Introduction
Achieving access to basic health services for the entire population without risk of financial
hardship or impoverishment from out-of-pocket expenditures (“universal health coverage” or
UHC) is a challenge that continues to confront most low- and middle-income countries. As
coverage expands in these countries, issues of financial sustainability, efficiency, and quality
of care quickly rise to the surface. Strategic health purchasing is an important lever to
efficiently manage funds for UHC through the definition of what is purchased (which services
and benefits the covered population is entitled to receive), from whom services are purchase
(which providers are contracted to deliver the covered services), and how and how much the
providers are paid.

Health care provider payment systems—the way providers are paid to deliver the covered
package of services—are an important part of strategic purchasing to balance system revenues
and costs in a way that creates incentives for providers to improve quality and deliver services
more efficiently. This ultimately makes it possible to expand coverage within limited funds
(Langenbrunner, Cashin and O'Dougherty 2009). In practice, however, provider payment
systems are often under-utilized as an effective tool to achieve UHC goals (Lagomarsino, et al.
2012).

In the early 1990s, after 70 years of a socialist system, Mongolia transitioned to a market
economy and embarked on reform across all sectors, including health. Since that time, the
health system has gradually moved from a centralized “Semashko-style” model to somewhat
more decentralized financing and service delivery, with a growing role for private sector
providers and private out-of-pocket financing. The main challenge to the system has been to
maintain the universal coverage of the socialist period in the face of drastically reduced public
funding, while introducing incentives for greater efficiency and improved quality of care.

Although population coverage of social health insurance has consistently been over 80
percent, financial protection has continued to erode. Social health insurance was introduced
in 1993 to provide a supplemental funding stream to the declining budget. Nonetheless, out-
of-pocket payments increased from 14.5 percent of total health expenditure in 1995 to 41.4
percent in 2010 (Tsolmongerel, Evlegsuren , Bulganchimeg, Ganbat, & Oyunbileg, 2013).

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has identified strategic purchasing as one of the most important
levers to more effectively direct limited funds to priority services and populations. As part of
plans to revise the Law on Health Insurance, the MOH commissioned an in-depth assessment
of its current provider payment systems to inform a roadmap with steps to strengthen the
health purchasing function under the new law.

The assessment was conducted to help inform the design and implementation of Mongolia’s
provider payment systems going forward. After providing a brief overview of Mongolia’s
health financing and service delivery system, this report describes the provider payment
assessment and summarizes the main findings. It discusses the positive aspects and
shortcomings of the current mix of payment systems and compares the design and
implementation with international good practices. The chapter concludes by providing a
roadmap for refining and realigning Mongolia’s provider payment system going forward.


The Health Financing and Service Delivery System
Under the former centralized Semashko model, the health delivery system was publicly
owned, hierarchically organized, and financed by general tax funds paid to health facilities
using input-based line item budgets. The Semashko-based financing and delivery model is
associated with a wide range of inefficiencies at all levels of the health system (Kutzin, Cashin
and Jakab 2010). Input-based line item budgets, in particular, are known to create barriers to
matching funding with service delivery priorities and can lead to excess capacity in the system.

Mongolia has taken a number of steps away from this financing and service delivery model.
For example, family group practices and soum hospitals were restructured into family/soum
health centers to focus more on public health intervention rather than mainly curative
services. While soum health centers are public facilities, the family health centers are private
and deliver government-funded health services through contracts with the government. Other
private providers have been permitted to enter the system and can be contracted by the social
health insurance agency, the Social Insurance General Office (SIGO).

Mongolia’s health system is organized according to its administrative divisions, namely:
aimags (provinces) and the capital city (Ulaan Bataar), soums (districts) and bags (villages).
Mongolia has 21 aimags, with each consisting of between 15-27 soums and each soum divided
further into 4–8 bags. The two-tier health system includes facilities that deliver primary care
at the bag and soum level and those that deliver specialized care, including secondary and
tertiary care at the aimag and city level (Figure 1).

The MOH continues to finance most public health facilities using historical line-item budgets,
although family health centers and soum health centers are paid by capitation to deliver basic
primary care. The SIGO purchases inpatient services using a case-based payment system with
a set of 115 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Health facilities also can charge user fees for a
limited set of services. Doctors, nurses and paramedics at government health facilities are civil
servants and salaried according to the civil servants’ salary schedule. Most non-medical staff
such as cleaners and/or maintenance people are contract workers not on the civil servants’
payroll. Health professionals are relatively underpaid. The government has made efforts to
create incentive schemes for rural workers, primary health care providers, and for specific
categories of medical professionals that are in short supply.

The Integrated Budget Law (IBL) has however modified many aspects of provider payments in
the health sector. More specifically, changes have been introduced in budget planning,
approval as well as budget execution rules for primary health care providers. As already
discussed in Chapter 1, the IBL has granted new decision space to sub-national officials in
Mongolia. It increases decision space on budgeting and planning, especially at the aimag,
Capital City, and soum levels and has also given facility directors significant control over human
resources functions, especially hiring, firing, and granting of bonuses and incentives.

The IBL has resulted in changes to the budget allocation and formulation process, specifically
for primary health care. As discussed in Chapter 1, primary health care is delegated to the sub-
national governments and financed by earmarked transfers. Aimag and Capital City governors
are responsible for primary health services and can provide additional financing to health
facilities within their region. The Minister of Health must contract with the aimag and Capital
City governors within 14 days of the state budget approval. The contract must include the
purpose, standard, quantity, and quality of services to be provided, as well the reporting
requirements. The Ministry of Health estimates the amount of earmarked transfers available
within the budget constraint placed by the central government and sends the estimates to the
Health Departments of the aimags and Capital City. At the local level, health facilities submit
their budget proposals to the respective governors. The Assembly then discusses and approves
the earmarked transfers as part of the local budget. Thus, the earmarked transfers are now
part of the local budget allowing aimag and City governors to make adjustments to the health
sector budgets under their control.

Although the MOH has identified strategic purchasing, and in particular provider payment as
one of the most important levers to direct limited funds to priority services and populations
more effectively, strategic health purchasing has been limited by the continued strict
management of all public funds through the Budget Law. The Budget Law stipulates that all
budget entities and entities that are partially or fully owned by the government and contracted
with public funds are required to follow the law when planning, executing, and reporting on
their budgets (Lkhagvadorj 2012). Therefore, even though some new output-oriented
payment systems have been used, the Budget Law limits how the payment systems can
effectively create new incentives for providers because all funds are planned, disbursed, and
accounted for using input-based line item budgets..


Provider Payment Assessment Method
This study was conducted using the JLN Provider Payment Diagnostic and Assessment Guide.
The Guide was developed by the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN),
together with the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), and other partners (JLN,
2012).1 The assessment was a cross-sectional qualitative study with the main results based on
stakeholder perceptions, supplemented by analysis of normative policy documents.

  This assessment was one of two country field tests of the JLN Provider Payment Diagnostic and
Assessment Guide. The first field test was carried out in Vietnam during February – June 2013 (Nguyen,
Tran, Hoang, Tran, & Cashin, 2015). Researchers from Vietnam provided some support to the Mongolia
assessment team through video conferencing, and the Mongolian team referred to the Vietnam report
to help structure and interpret the findings.
The JLN Guide is a process guide for systematically examining current provider payment
systems in view of health system objectives and the current managerial capacity of health care
providers and health purchasers. The strengths and weaknesses of the design and
implementation arrangements for current payment systems and the incentives they are
perceived to create are compared against internationally accepted guiding principles and
benchmarks (“international good practices”). The output of the process is a roadmap for
improving the country’s provider payment systems developed through consensus among
stakeholders on the interpretation of the assessment results (Figure 2).

The JLN Guide is based on the premise that provider payment methods and their supporting
systems (e.g., management information systems, accountability measures) create different
incentives for providers, and the responses to those incentives can have profound effects on
how health resources are allocated and services are delivered. Institutional relationships and
contextual factors shape those incentives and provider responses. Ultimately, however, the
effectiveness of provider payment systems and the incentives they create are largely driven
by how providers understand, perceive, and respond to them (Langenbrunner, Cashin, &
O'Dougherty, 2009).

The JLN Guide provides a structure for gathering qualitative information on the range of
provider payment systems used for different health facility types (“provider payment method
mapping”), standard aspects of payment system design and implementation arrangements,
and the results of the payment systems. For example, stakeholders are asked to describe which
services are paid by which payment methods, how payment rates are set, how funds are
disbursed, and financial relationships with other providers. Stakeholders are asked open-
ended questions about the strengths and weaknesses of each payment system, and closed-
ended questions about whether or not each payment system contributes to any of 16 pre-
defined positive and negative health system results. Local researchers adapted the instrument
to the specific context of Mongolia.

During the course of the assessment in Mongolia, a multi-stakeholder working group was
convened to identify the objectives of the assessment, guide the design and implementation,
and interpret the findings. The working group was convened at the beginning of the
assessment, once for a mid-term review of preliminary findings, and for a final workshop to
interpret the results and make recommendations for a roadmap to improve Mongolia’s
provider payment systems going forward.

The working group identified the key stakeholders to be interviewed to include the MOH, SIGO
and public and private providers at all levels of the health system. The final sample included
respondents from 35 health care providers, two departments in the MOH, the UB Health
Department, SIGO, and the Ministry of Finance (Table 1).

Overview of the Mix of Provider Payment Methods
Currently, three different payment methods are used by health purchasers in Mongolia: line
item budgets, case-based hospital payment using DRGs, and fee for service for direct payments
by clients (Table 2). The mix of payment systems received by an individual provider varies
widely, even within one provider category. Line item budgets, for example, make up only 12
percent of total revenue for some tertiary providers but more than 80 percent for others.
Overall, however, the line item budget payment system still accounts for at least half of all
revenue for most public providers. Revenue from DRG payments varies from less than 10
percent of revenue to more than 80 percent, but on average both public and private hospitals
receive about 30 percent of their revenue from DRG payments. Family health centers and
those soum health centers paid by capitation receive 100 percent of their revenue through
capitation payments. Fee for service is a small share of total revenue for all public providers,
reaching a maximum of 10 percent but more commonly less than five percent of total revenue
for a single provider.

Provider Revenue Caps
A notable feature of Mongolia’s mix of payment methods is that each provider faces a global
cap on all revenue sources. Revenue that is higher than expected from one source such as fee-
for-service payments would be offset by a reduction in other sources, so total payments in one
year from all revenue sources would not exceed the cap. Each health facility’s revenue cap is
estimated based on its projected budget requirements by line item. For soum health centers,
the cap is on the basis of the previous year’s expenditures and for family health centers on the
basis of catchment population multiplied by the capitation rate. For a hospital receiving a line
item budget, DRG revenue, and fee-for-service revenue, the share of the total projected
revenue expected from DRG and fee-for-service revenue based on historical utilization is
subtracted from the cap, and the remainder is paid to the provider as a line item budget. Caps
are also imposed on payment to private providers based on their historical billing to SIGO with
incremental increases.

        “The hospital estimates budget requirements and projects DRG and “own”
        income (fees, ancillary activities). The MOH reviews and sets the total
        budget (less than requested) and the MOH budget covers the shortfall
        between this number and DRG/own income. We must then live within this
        total budget.” ~Central Hospital

How health provider revenue caps are formed varies widely. Some health providers develop
the budget proposals that inform their revenue caps based on the previous year’s budget
execution or historical utilization, while others consider input requirements such as bed
capacity and staff. Some providers attempt to factor in the needs of the catchment population,
including morbidity and mortality patterns.

        “The budget proposal is estimated based on human resource norms,
        population, and morbidity. For example, we estimated that we will employ
        so many of new staff but neither hiring of new staff nor remunerations have
        increased.” ~District Health Complex

        “The budget is based on previous year historic expenditure level and doctors
        view on medicines.” ~Aimag General Hospital

        “In addition to prices, we look at various cost estimates such as volume of
        cases for this year and add 10% of it for the next year.” ~Inter-Soum Hospital

The final revenue caps appear to be somewhat arbitrary. None of the providers reported
having a clear understanding about the basis for the final approved revenue cap.

        “We assemble Departmental requests for hospital budget, justify it based on
        prior budgets, trends in volume, staff, bed utilization. The proposed budget
        is then heavily cut by MOH—cut in half.” ~Aimag General Hospital

        “We make and send our budget. Our budget is not approved as it is. It is cut.
        We do not know why.” ~Soum health center

        “The budget is mostly reviewed and allocated based on the previous year’s
        performance and suggestions of relevant departments and the MOH. The
        human factor is great in decisionmaking.” ~ Ministry of Finance

The provider revenue cap is a hard cap. The respondents all reported that it is impossible to
exceed the cap. This feature of provider payment policy has been effective for containing
overall costs in Mongolia’s system.

        “It creates incentives for people to work within approved budget.
        Sometimes, instead of doing 1 thing we perform 2-3 works with the budget
        for 1. We try to be efficient as much as possible.” ~Regional Diagnostic and
        Treatment Center

        “It is not possible to over spend budget money. The budget is approved
        therefore we are told to work within the budget limit. We have not run with
        debts before.” ~District Health Complex

Although overall costs are well-managed in the system through the hard caps, some individual
providers do report deficits and incur debts to suppliers.

         “We incurred debt in heating costs due to dzud in winter. So, we sent many
        letter to resolve this but nothing has been decided. We paid to the company
        out of the budget for this year and paying the debt off only today. We heat
        up 3 rooms with an electric heater and did not start the heating until
        December. In such a way, the savings were made from heating costs to pay
        off the debt.” ~Inter-Soum Hospital

        “The funds are never enough and in some cases we run into deficit.” ~ Soum
        Health Center

Providers are not permitted to keep any surpluses generated from lower-than-expected
volumes or efficiency gains.

        “When there is a savings, it is accumulated and taken back by the MOF at
        the end of year. It is not possible to use it for operations. Revenue from paid
        services exceeds the plan every year, however it is taken back by the
        treasury. It is not possible to over-spend budget money. The budget is
        approved therefore we are told to work within the budget limit. We have not
        run with debts before.” ~District Health Complex

According to the respondents, the most problematic aspect of the provider global revenue
caps is that they are formed, executed, and accounted for using input-based line items with
little flexibility to move across expenditure categories once they are approved. This is because
all public funds flow through the treasury system and are subject to the restrictions of the
Budget Law. Although a positive feature of the mix of payment systems is that all revenue
sources are pooled, thus largely avoiding the conflicting incentives that are often created by
different payment methods from multiple revenue sources, the potential benefits of the
output-oriented payment systems are reduced significantly.

        “The DRG payment gets mixed with line item payment and therefore the
        situation is similar to the previous payment system.” ~District Health
        Complex

        “The budget law is very tough. Health insurance is being restricted by the
        budget law therefore becomes barrier for its improvement.” ~District
        Health Complex
        “DRG payments are increased in order to fund quality of care and costs of
        services provided to the insured. But when the Ministry of Finance calculates
        the budget it affects this system and causes problems.” ~SIGO

What has changed under the IBL?
Under the IBL, the responsibility for setting the revenue cap for primary health care providers
has shifted away from Central Government and to the aimag/Capital City level. Previously, the
Ministry of Health set the budget cap separately for family health centers and soum hospitals,
based on capitation for the former and the previous year’s spending for the latter. Now, the
budget cap is allocated by the Department of Health (DOH) in each aimag which receives the
aimag’s global budget cap from the Ministry of Health (MoH). The method for setting the
budget cap remains the same for the two types of hospitals. The only difference is that there
is one budget cap set for both family health centers and soum hospitals.

Part of the responsibility for preparing and approving the budget has also shifted to the
aimag/Capital City level. Based on the budget cap soum hospital formulate the budget
proposal for the next year using a line item budgeting technique. Family health centers do not
submit budget proposals to aimag DOH. Instead, they report on their catchment population
which is counterchecked figures produced by local statistical office. The aimag DOH compiles
the budget proposals from all providers funded by the state budget and health insurance fund
(HIF) and submits them to MoH. Meanwhile, aimag/Capital City governors submit the budget
proposal to the local citizens’ representative Khural and the lump sum budget is approved for
the implementation of special mandates of government such as primary health care delivery
in each soum and district. The citizens’ Khural has limited authority to make changes in the
budget, however, due to the following restrictions in the IBL:
     transfers of special purpose subsidies for base expenditure of local budget and other
        sectors are not allowed;
     debts and receivables are not allowed;
     the standards, quantity and quality targets and accessibility of services must not be
        affected.

A key difference is that the budget for family health centers and soum hospitals are no longer
approved separately. Prior to 2013 when the IBL became effective, budgets for family health
centers and soum hospitals in each aimag were approved separately within portfolio of the
Minister of Health. Since 2013, the budgets for the two types of primary health care providers
are combined and approved as “the special purpose transfer for primary health care” for an
aimag/capital city. Table 3 illustrates this difference in the case of Arkhangai Province

Unlike before, aimag / Capital City governments and local treasury offices now have a bigger
role to play in the execution of family health center and soum hospital budgets. Once the
budget is approved, MoH develops quarterly and monthly spending plans for family health
centers and soum hospitals that sets overall limits, which are then approved by aimag / Capital
City governors. The family health centers and soum hospital then go through two major steps
to start spending their annual budgets. For each budget entity, the governors of aimags or
central budget governors submit requests for “authorization for budget financing” and
“authorization for budget spending” 1-2 times a month. Then the local treasury offices review
authorizations for budget financing and issues the authorization for spending within 2 days.

The IBL has not resulted in changes to the way in which the budget for primary health care is
disbursed. Budgets are disbursed according to each line item category for soum hospitals, but
on a lump-sum basis for family health centers.

The IBL has improved the level of flexibility that soum hospitals have in budget execution,
however. Soum hospitals no longer require prior endorsement or permission from MoH or
MoF to make adjustments for amount lower than 10 million MNT. They can now approach
soum governor and soum citizen’s Khural for adjustment within quarterly and monthly
recurrent budget plan.

In short, the provider payment cap has been retained, and continues to play an effective role
in controlling costs before and after the IBL. The only major changes under the IBL are that the
aimag / Capital City governors have a greater role to play in setting the provider payment cap
for family health centers and soum hospitals, and in budget approval and execution. Soum
hospitals have a little more flexibility in spending from their line item budgets. Family health
centers, which were always paid on a lump-sum basis continue to enjoy the high level of
flexibility in spending as before.


Payment system design and implementation arrangements
Provider payment systems include both technical design features and implementation
arrangements. Technical design features include the parameters, bases, or calculations used
to compute payment rates, the services paid through the method, and the cost items covered.
Implementation arrangements refer to the rules for disbursing, using, and accounting for
payments and the relationships between purchasers and providers, between different
providers, and among other actors. Both design features and implementation arrangements
affect the incentives payment systems create, the consequences for the system, and whether
health system objectives are supported.
Key aspects of provider payment system design and implementation arrangements for the
payment systems in Mongolia are presented in Table 4. In the following sections, the design
features and implementation arrangements for Mongolia’s provider payment systems are
presented and compared with international benchmarks and good practices.2

Line Item Budgets
Line item budgets are paid to providers as the residual of their revenue cap after other
revenue sources are deducted. As discussed above, all public providers in Mongolia start with
an annual revenue cap that is based on a line item budget. Revenue from other sources is
projected and deducted from the revenue cap, and the residual is paid to providers in equal
monthly instalments according to approved line items. The basis for the budget and rules for
disbursing, spending, and accounting for budget funds all have shortcomings compared to
international benchmarks and good practices (Table 5)3.

  The international benchmarks on provider payment system design and implementation were
developed and ranked by least to most desirable characteristics by consensus of the multi-stakeholder
working group. These benchmarks should not be considered international evidence and are not
generalizable beyond the interpretation of Mongolia’s provider payment assessment.

  Implementation
                      Providers are allowed to keep at least some
                      portion of surpluses, with some financial
                      accountability most desirable


A health facility budget is a prospectively agreed sum within which operating expenses of the
facility must be contained (Dredge, 2004). The basis for the budget can be the inputs
historically used by the facility (staff, building, and supplies), projected volume of services, or
projected needs of the population (case-mix adjusted volume of services accounting for other
factors such as poverty, geography, etc.). Budgets based on inputs, as in Mongolia, are
considered to be the least desirable since they are the least closely linked to population health
service needs, and budgets based on projected needs are considered to be the most desirable
(Langenbrunner, Cashin, & O'Dougherty, 2009; Langenbrunner & Wiley, 2002).

International good practices suggest that budget payment systems with fewer line items and
greater flexibility for expenditure are more desirable (Langenbrunner & Wiley, 2002;
Langenbrunner, Cashin, & O'Dougherty, 2009; Kutzin, Cashin, & Jakab, 2010). In Mongolia,
however, how budgets are disbursed, spent, and accounted for is strictly controlled by the
Budget Law, with little flexibility to reallocate expenditures and no ability for providers to
retain any surpluses from efficiency gains. . Movement between line items is reported to be
difficult, with burdensome approval requirements. A number of providers reported having
savings in one line item but not being able to move funds to cover deficits in others. In fact,
the lack of flexibility to allocate spending was noted as a problem more frequently than the
inadequate amount of the budget.

 On the other hand, the hard budget cap is implemented effectively, and total expenditures in
the system are well- controlled, as mentioned earlier.

Case-based Hospital Payment Using DRGs
In 2006, Mongolia introduced case-based payment using DRGs for inpatient services
purchased through its social health insurance system. The payment system started with 22
case groups and was expanded to 115 groups in 2010. The payment system is effectively a flat-
rate tariff for cases in each of the groups. Private hospitals get paid 50 percent of the DRG
tariffs paid to public sector facilities. The design and implementation of the DRG-based
payment system in Mongolia is compared with international good practices in Table 6.

Compared with international benchmarks and best practices, the DRG-based payment system
is a step in the right direction. In terms of the design of the payment system, the 115 case
groups appear to be appropriate for Mongolia’s health service delivery system and the current
capacity of the purchaser and provider. The case groups are widely perceived to be
appropriate to capture much of the cost variation across the types of cases common in
Mongolia.

        “It is beneficial because there are variations by diagnostic groups. It is not
        possible to pay for all cases at same rates.” ~Regional Diagnostic and
        Treatment Center

        “Every disease is financed differently which is good and fits reality.” ~Soum
        Hospital

        “It is good that we get paid differently for different diseases. It is flexible and
        precise.” ~Soum Hospital

        “[The DRG payment system] is similar to numbers and costs of diseases
        prevalent in Mongolia.” ~Private Hospital

However, the system does have some shortcomings. The main shortcoming providers raised
about the design of the DRG-based payment system is that it does not account for co-
morbidities, so cases within a DRG are paid the same regardless of whether the patient has
complications or any additional diagnoses. There is also no mechanism to pay for outliers
(particularly high-cost cases in a DRG).

        “Only one DRG is allowed, and some patients have two or more diseases.
        There is no surcharge for complex cases, or higher DRG for multiple
        diagnoses.” ~Central Hospital

        [The DRG-based payment system] does not compensate for very high cost
        patients.” ~Provincial General Hospital

        “It is weakness that there is little variance in the level of payment rates
        between diagnostic groups. We get paid same regardless of case
        complications.” ~District Health Complex

Several providers specifically noted that while maternal care is paid for through the budget,
they do not receive DRG-based payments for services related to complications and co-
morbidities of pregnant women.

        “We do not get reimbursed for treatment of co-morbidity of pregnant
        mothers. It is said that the care for pregnant women is funded by the
        government budget. However, they have many co-morbidities and we treat
        their conditions. Say that one mother has three different illnesses and she
        was seen by three doctors, but health insurance pays for the first diagnosis
        only. This is a big shortfall of the payment method.” ~Province General
        Hospital

        “A pregnant woman might have chronic illness, and in this situation it
        should be possible to give additional payment with another cost weight or
        coefficient.” ~District Health Complex

As noted above, payment rates to private hospitals are set at 50 percent the rate paid to public
hospitals for each case group. The basis for this payment differentiation is not clear.

        “Every hospital should be reimbursed same within the health insurance
        payment system. Private hospitals get paid 50% of the payment rate of the
        government hospitals. We don’t agree to this payment arrangement.
        Health services are provided at same level and quality regardless of
        ownership, public or private.” ~Private hospital

DRG payments in Mongolia are fixed tariffs and are not made up of case groups, relative cost
weights, and base rate. Although this type of DRG payment calculation is used by a number of
OECD countries such as England, France, and the Netherlands (Cots, Chiarello, Salvador,
Castells, & Quentin, 2011), it is more desirable according to international good practices to
have a formula-based system made up of separate payment system components. Having a
separate base rate and relative cost weights gives the purchaser two levers to establish
appropriate relative prices for different types of hospital cases while remaining budget neutral
by adjusting the base rate upward or downward depending on available resources and actual
volumes of cases (Langenbrunner, Cashin, & O'Dougherty, 2009).

In terms of implementation arrangements, the DRG payments are subject to the same Budget
Law restrictions as the line item budget. It therefore has the same strengths (hard budget cap)
but also the same weaknesses (lack of flexibility to re-allocate DRG revenue across line items
and no possibility for providers to retain any surplus).

        “It is not possible to shift between line items. Also if we focus on prevention
        and have fewer admissions we get paid less from insurance.” ~Provincial
        General Hospital

Capitation

In 2000, Mongolia restructured its urban primary care sector into a model of family group
practices, now called family health centers. Soum hospitals were restructured into soum health
centers. The MOH pays family health centers and some soum health centers through a per
capita payment system (capitation). Mongolia’s capitation system is consistent with
international benchmarks and good practices, although some shortcomings make it difficult to
capture all of the potential benefits of the payment system. The design and implementation
of the capitation payment system in Mongolia is compared with international good practices
in Table 7.

    Design and
  Implementation
                      Providers are allowed to keep at least some portion
                      of surpluses, with some financial accountability


Although the calculation of the base rate in Mongolia follows international good practices,
providers complain that the rate is too low. Each family health center and soum health center
is paid a fixed amount for each registered person to provide all necessary primary care. There
are adjustments for six age/sex groups, and providers serving populations in ger districts are
paid a higher rate. The base per capita rate is set through an allocation formula of the Ministry
of Finance, and there are persistent complaints that the rate is too low and not updated
annually for inflation.

        “Payment rates are not adjusted annually. They are not adjusted to the
        annual inflation.” ~Family Health Center

        “Rates are fixed, they do not fit reality. Prices are rising. But rates are fixed.
        It was the same for the last 5 years.” ~Family Health Center

The main shortcoming in Mongolia’s capitation payment system is the way the population
served by each primary care provider is estimated. Currently, the population does not actively
choose the family health center or soum health center to which they are assigned. The
population reports of the National Statistics Office are used to estimate the number of people
served by the family health centers and soum health centers. Those reports are up to two
years outdated and do not account for mobile populations, which are significant in Mongolia
with large seasonal variations.

        “The financing is done based on registered population. In such case expenses
        for people who have come without official notification in registry about
        movement from soums are not reflected.” ~Family Health Center

        “In 2012 the population number is 8,009, however we got paid for 7,800
        persons then there were 9,200 we served in real life.” ~Family Health Center

        “Mongolia has low populations in rural areas, but the places with more
        population and migrants risk depleted financing. Because there is no
        information system or database, there is no basis for transferring funds
        between facilities based on population movement.” ~Ministry of Financer

The implementation arrangements for capitation are much closer to international benchmarks
and good practices than the other payment systems for family health centers, because they
are not budget institutions and are therefore granted more flexibility. Capitation payments
are made as a monthly lump sum to family health centers, and the providers can allocate their
funds across line items as needed. They also are permitted to retain any surpluses, although
surpluses are subject to 10 percent tax. Most providers report that payment rates are so low
that they never generate a surplus. Soum health centers are budget institutions, and their
capitation payments are subject to the Budget Law, although the soum health center in the
assessment sample reported having flexibility to allocate funds across line items.

        “We shift between expenses. For example, if we save on food then we use the
        saving for fuel.” ~Soum health center

        “We have a right use the funds for any cost item.” ~Family Health Center

        “If we generate a surplus, we can keep it and pay 10% in tax. We can use
        the rest as we see fit---buy furniture, etc. Same facilities in ger districts have
        had problems with higher heating, staffing bills and have had to cut back on
        staff.” ~Family Health Center

        “If it works out that there is a surplus, it will be our profit. However, we do
        not make a profit rather incur insufficient funding often. Under the current
        capitation payment rates it is not possible to make profit.” ~Family Health
        Center

Fee for Service

Secondary and tertiary hospitals in Mongolia can charge patients directly for some diagnostic
services and tests outside of the guaranteed package of services according to an approved fee
schedule. The regulations on fee for service were approved by the joint order of the Ministers
of Health and Finance in 2006. Private providers have more flexibility in setting their fees than
public providers. The design and implementation of the fee for service payment system in
Mongolia is compared with international best practices in Table 8.

                     portion of surpluses, with some financial
                     accountability

Whereas private hospitals rely on fee-for-service payments for more than 70 percent of their
revenue, fee for service is kept to a very small share of public hospital revenue. As described
earlier, the projected fee-for-service payments are incorporated into the hospital’s annual
budget cap.

        “Effectively, [fee for service] revenue is capped because SHI payments
        are reduced if total revenue exceeds expectation due to increase fee
        revenue.” ~Central Hospital

Public providers also report that fee-for-service revenue is low due to the socioeconomic
situation, particularly in rural Mongolia.
        “It is difficult to provide services to people living below minimum
        living standards. About 80-90% of patients have hard lives and are
        poor. Many have debt.” ~Province General Hospital

        “If we set high price, no citizens will be able to pay. We try to set prices
        as suitable as possible to all parties.” ~Regional Diagnostic and
        Treatment Center

Public providers are not permitted to retain any surplus if their budgeted fee for service
revenue is higher than expected. However, the provincial hospital claimed that some of the
surplus is carried over to the next year.

        “Revenue exceeded by 47 million MNT for 2013. Exceeded revenue
        becomes the surplus for us and taken back to the MoF. There is no
        such thing as bonus.” ~Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Center

        “At the end of the year MOF or treasury takes back [any surplus].
        However, 20% of total surplus is paid back next year.” ~Province
        General Hospital

In terms of design, the fee schedule is for itemized (unbundled) services with no clear basis for
setting the fees, so there are no incentives to deliver the services efficiently. Secondary
hospitals complain that their fees are set lower than for tertiary hospitals, although they
deliver comparable quality.

        “Tariffs are very different for secondary and tertiary care providers.
        Tertiary care providers charge higher fees than secondary care
        providers for the same quality of services.” ~District Health Complex

        “There are difficulties because there are no uniform instructions,
        regulations or tariffs.” ~Ministry of Finance



Positive and Negative Consequences of the Current Payment Systems
During the interviews, stakeholders were asked to identify the main strengths and weaknesses
of each payment system. They were then asked specific questions about whether in their view
the payment systems contributed positively or negatively to four sets of consequences: (1)
equity and access to services, (2) efficiency, (3) quality, and (4) financial sustainability. All
responses throughout the interviews were coded and compiled into those four categories and
related sub-categories (Table 9). The responses were categorized as positive or negative
consequences in each category. For example, if a respondent stated that a payment system
does not contribute to fair and equitable distribution of resources across the population, the
response was coded as a negative consequence of the payment system on equity. In the
sections below, each figure shows the number of times each type of positive and negative
consequence was noted by the respondents.

Line Item Budget
The line item budget is generally seen as an important source of guaranteed, stable income
that is important for provider financial viability. The compiled responses related to perceived
positive consequences of the line item budget are presented in Figure 3. For some providers,
the budget drives efficiency and limits over-use of services—but this is largely due to the hard
constraint and limited funds. Very few provider responses indicated any positive
consequences of the budget for equity or quality.
                      “The idea is correct. Payment based on monthly schedule reduces risks.
                      However, the budget is not sufficient or in short.” ~National Specialty
                      Hospital

                      “The budget gives assurance for uninterrupted and continuity of operations
                      and no risks to sustainability.” ~District Health Complex

                      “Since we don’t get enough money we must economize.” ~Province General
                      Hospital

                      “We try to avoid or reduce hospitalization, and try to pay more attention to
                      public health. We have an understanding that by reducing hospitalization
                      we can save some money.” ~Soum Health Center

In spite of some positive consequences noted by stakeholders, the line item budget was
associated with significantly more negative responses than any of the other payment systems
(Figure 4). The rigidity of the budget and inability to keep surpluses is widely viewed as the
main barrier to efficiency and quality.

Nearly all providers noted that the line item budget has negative consequences for efficiency
due to the lack of flexibility to shift expenditures across line items as needed.

                      “There is no incentive or bonuses for efficient operations. We save on
                      electricity and water fairly sufficient, however the saving is taken back to
                      the treasury.” ~National Specialty Hospital

                       “We do not see any advantages. Saved expenses are not shifted to expenses
                      that are in short. Thus, this payment method is not very useful. If you save
                      on food it is not possible to use for medicines. It is restricting efficient
                      resource use.” ~National Specialty Hospital

                      “Quality will not improve if we do not have an approved budget that meets
                      our needs. The strict line item budget makes it difficult to manage variable
                      costs such as medicine, which can vary substantially depending on the
                      conditions we treat.” ~Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Center

                      “Very limited capacity to improve efficiency. For only a few line items
                      resources can be spent effectively." ~District Health Complex

                      “It is difficult to purchase assets since there is no such line item.” ~Soum
                      Hospital

                       “[The budget] is not flexible. It is impossible to initiate anything. It
                      suffocates aspirations and provides no opportunity for development and
                      expansion.” ~Soum Hospital
The line item budget is also perceived to have negative consequences for equity. In terms of
population, geography and distance are not taken into account. For equity across providers,
the budget does not reflect the complexity of cases that different providers manage.

        “Not equitable across providers because payment is not proportional to
        burden of the services they provide.” ~Central Hospital

        “Districts that have a smaller population than ours receive the same budget.
        This means that the budget is allocated regardless of the size of the
        population and geographical condition.” District Health Complex

        “Does not consider distance, which is a weakness. Examining patient at
        longer distance takes more money. But the cost is calculated as the same.”
        ~Soum Hospital



Case-based Hospital Payment Using DRGs
The DRG-based payment system is well understood by providers and largely viewed positively.
Respondents noted many positive consequences of the DRG-based payment system (Figure
5). It is the only payment system that is perceived by providers to promote equity, efficiency,
and quality. In particular, they perceive it as fair since it pays providers for activity.

        “We do not get paid for the total operations of the hospital but for providing
        services for particular patients. It is more flexible and directs the payment
        to services or operations. In general, we would like to get paid by each case.
        It would be good if government funded share is same as by the insurance
        system.” ~National Specialty Hospital

        “The advantage is that payment is made based on service provision.”
        ~District Health Complex

Several providers also noted that the case-based payment system creates incentives to be
more efficient in treating individual cases and reduce unnecessary services.

        “It does prevent doctors from ordering unnecessary tests or procedures.”
        ~Central Hospital

        “[The DRG-based] payment system makes us provide services within
        resources.” District Health Complex

At the same time, there do not appear to be serious negative consequences for quality. Having
clinical guidelines in place may be an important factor in protecting quality with the stronger
efficiency incentives of case-based payment.

        “[The DRG-based payment system] enhances quality because payment is
        related to need.” ~Province General Hospital
                     “We have been able to introduce new technology.” ~Province General
                     Hospital

                     “As for quality, we provide full treatment according to our conditions. After
                     surgery a patient will stay for 4 or 5 days. I think it is OK for the DRGs
                     provided.” ~Soum Hospital

                     “We try to follow standards. There is no incentive for skimping on care.”
                     ~Soum Hospital

The main perceived negative consequence of the DRG-based payment system is that it does
not promote fairness and equity. As discussed earlier, current case groups do not account for
complications and co-morbidities (Figure 6). A number of stakeholders also noted that the
DRG-based payment system does not promote equity because there is no adjustment for
different geographic areas.

                     “[The payment rate] is the same for all areas and that is not fair.”
                     ~Sanitorium
                     “[The DRG-based payment system] does not contribute to geographic equity

                     “[The payment rate] is exactly the same. It does not reflect specific
                     characteristics of geography.” ~Soum Hospital

Although perceived negative consequences of the DRG-based payment system are not
widespread, several providers noted that the system could possibly lead to unnecessary
hospital admissions. However, this may have more to do with the way benefits are structured
under the health insurance system and the focus on inpatient benefits. One provider also
noted that there may be an incentive to avoid more complicated patients.

                      “Even if a person is not interested to get hospitalized, for the hospital it is
                      the only way to get paid. This creates an incentive to go after money and
                      poor quality service.” ~Province General Hospital

                      “Prevention is not funded by social insurance, hence if we have fewer
                      admission we get paid less from insurance.” ~Province General Hospital

                      “This payment system might result in unnecessary readmissions, but not
                      here.” ~Province General Hospital

                      “There is an incentive to avoid sicker patients because we are cautious about
                      resulting accountability to them.” ~Province General Hospital

                      “[The DRG-based payment system] does not give incentives for health
                      promotion because payment is only made if the patient is sick. There is no
                      funding for prevention and chronic diseases.” ~Soum Hospital



Capitation
The capitation payment system is widely perceived to have positive consequences related to
efficiency, equity, and access to services for the population (Figure 7). It allows funds to be
used for outreach, and providers have the flexibility to allocate funds across line items
according to their needs.

                      “We get a lump sum and can decide how to use it most effectively, which
                      encourages smart planning.” ~Family Health Center

                      “We can use funds very flexibly to address the particular needs of the
                      population.” ~Family Health Center

                      “Payments are based on population and meeting patient needs.” ~Family
                      Health Center

                      “Capitation is an easy method to provide primary care in a fair and
                      equitable way. It has an important role.” ~MOH Department of Finance and
                      Economics

Capitation is the only payment system that is perceived to encourage health promotion and
prevention.

                      “It enables us to reach out to the population and provide services to every
                      person.” ~Soum Health Center

                      “It enables us to focus on public health and prevention, because we do not
                      have to rely on service revenue.” ~Family Health Center

                      “Since payment is based on population, we can reach out, even to those who
                      do not seek services.” ~Family Health Center
Capitation is perceived to have some negative consequences. For example, as it is currently
implemented in Mongolia, capitation does not create any specific incentives to improve quality
of care or limit excess referrals (Figure 8).

                      “[Capitation] tends to create incentives for referral and it is impossible
                      to control quality of care.” ~ MOH Department of Policy and Planning
                      “It is easy to calculate funding of the health facility, but [capitation]
                      does not provide good incentives based on results.” ~MOH Department
                      of Finance and Economics

Respondents also noted some negative consequences related to the low capitation payment
rates and the inadequate attention given to mobile populations when calculating the rate
(Figure 8). One provider also noted that the capitation payment system has negative
consequences for equity because there is no discrimination across geographic areas.

                      “If rates were higher they could do more outreach, and perhaps reduce
                      admissions.” ~Family Health Center

Fee for Service
The fee-for-service payment system is perceived as bringing several positive consequences
without the negative consequences typically associated with fee for service payment systems,
especially cost escalation and over-use of high-cost services (Figure 9). This is because
Mongolia tightly controls the fee-for-service payments and limits them to services outside of
the benefits package with revenue included within the providers’ overall revenue caps. Also,
the socioeconomic situation in the country limits capacity for out-of-pocket spending among
users of the public system, but this is something that could change as Mongolia’s economy
continues to develop and demand for more and higher-tech health services increases.
                      “There are efficiency gains from extra motivation without over-use of high-
                      cost services.”~Soum Hospital

                       “Does not promote high-cost services because it is difficult for Mongolian
                      condition. People have varying capacity to pay.” ~Private Hospital

The cash income from fees, although small for public providers, is perceived as being helpful
for financial viability and is used by most providers to improve the quality of their services.

                      “Fee payments help with financial viability because this is our own revenue
                      and prevents from shortages.” ~Soum Hospital

                      “Helps with quality because we have cash." ~Soum Hospital

                      “Direct cash payment is made to the health facility. Drug suppliers prefer to
                      be paid by cash. Therefore, it enables us to buy drugs and supplies needed
                      for patient services.” ~Private hospital

                      “We use it to upgrade the hospital, buy and upgrade equipment.” ~Private
                      Hospital

                      “We provide small bonus to staff and help out with their social problems.”
                      ~National Specialty Hospital
In spite of these positive consequences, there are some perceived negative consequences of
the fee-for-service payment system (Figure 10). The negative consequences relate mainly to
poor understanding of the fees by the population.

                      “Lots of complaints from patients because they do not understand why
                      social insurance is not paying in full, and they have to pay fees.” ~Private
                      Hospital

                      “There is poor understanding of regulations by patients so we face
                      difficulties and resistances sometimes.” ~District Hospital

Challenges and Limitations of the Assessment
Implementation of the provider payment system encountered a number of challenges, which
were also found in the field test in Vietnam (Nguyen, Tran, Hoang, Tran, & Cashin, 2015). In
general, provider payment literacy is weak among stakeholders in many low- and middle-
income countries, which was a challenge also encountered in the Mongolia assessment.
Variable understanding of specific terminology may have impacted the results. The
terminology used to describe provider payment results also was found to be too abstract for
some respondents, so responses sometimes provided less in-depth discussion than expected.
In addition, although the structure and content of the assessment guide was adapted for the
Mongolian context, it is possible that key issues were missed because there were not specific
questions to capture them.

The assessment only yielded information about the perceptions of stakeholders regarding the
design, implementation, and results of the provider payment systems currently in use.
Provider understanding and perceptions of the design, implementation, and incentives
created by payment systems are a key factor in the effectiveness of payment systems in
supporting health system objectives. While the assessment cannot provide a quantitative
estimate of this effectiveness, it can shed light on the root causes of the failure of higher levels
of health spending to generate significant progress toward key objectives and provide
guidance on key bottlenecks that need to be addressed.


Policy Implications and Roadmap
At the end of the assessment, the results were discussed to reach consensus on the
interpretation, conclusions, and implications for the roadmap to improve Mongolia’s provider
payment systems under the upcoming revision of the Health Insurance Law.


Supporting Health System Objectives
The provider payment systems as currently designed and implemented in Mongolia are only
moderately supporting priority health system objectives agreed in the first stakeholder
planning meeting for the assessment (Figure 11). The objective of achieving universal
coverage is supported by the overall provider budget cap, which is enabling effective cost
containment. This financial discipline is more likely to make it possible to use additional
resources to expand effective coverage. However, efficiency objectives are not supported by
the payment system implementation arrangements, particularly the line item budget
restrictions. Other objectives include stimulating competition, promoting primary care,
improving child health care, and increasing accessibility of medicines.

Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses of Current Payment Systems
Overall, the results of the provider payment assessment show that the payment systems
complement each other and that all bring some positive features. For example, providers
appreciate the guaranteed, stable portion of revenue that comes from the budget. They also
understand the activity-based payment through DRGs and think it is fair. They rely on the
small amount of fee-for-service revenue to supplement their total revenue and provide some
staff motivation.

The overall budget cap at the provider level is effective at containing costs and forcing some
efficient behavior. Providers are generally accepting of the cap and report that they adjust
their service delivery decisions to manage within the cap and avoid deficits. Some providers
complain about the cap, but in most cases, it is more an issue of how the cap is set rather than
the cap itself.

Following the IBL, part of the responsibility for setting the budget cap for primary health care
(family health centers and soum hospitals) has shifted away from CG and to Aimag/Capital City
government. The budget cap continues to operate as before, and serves as an effective
mechanism for containing costs and improving efficiencies. The main difference is that the
budget cap as well as the budget spending plans prepared by the health facilities are approved
by lawmakers at the aimag/Capital City level. In principle, this implies there is scope for
ensuring that local level priorities are reflected in the budget cap and spending plans. However,
it is too early to see these effects in practice.

There is little evidence of the adverse consequences often associated with the different
payment systems. The potential negative consequences of several of the payment systems—
such as increased admissions with DRG payment, skimping on care with budget payment and
capitation—are effectively kept in check with the global budget cap and widespread
awareness of and respect for clinical guidelines. Fee for service has not driven over-use of
costly services and general cost escalation, as it does in many health systems. This is largely
because fee-for-service payment is used in a targeted way and subject to the overall provider
cap. Fee-for-service revenue is also limited by the socioeconomic context in Mongolia.

Several provider responses indicated a strong influence of professional ethics and a lack of
desire to treat health services as a market good that can generate a profit. This perspective
could face pressure, however, as national and household incomes grow and demand for more
and higher technology services grows. Mongolia will have to continue to manage the pressure
of increasing fee for service revenue for providers.

In spite of these positive aspects, there are serious limitations in the current design and
implementation arrangements of the provider payment system that affect incentives to
improve efficiency and shift resources and service delivery to primary care and prevention
activities. Universally, stakeholders view the line item budget as the major constraint to using
resources effectively and meeting the needs of the populations served. Most providers also
responded that being able to keep at least some surplus when they keep their volume of
services below their cap would not only serve as a motivation to use resources more efficiently,
but it would also make it possible to invest in service delivery improvements to better meet
population needs.

The constraints associated with line item budgets have been alleviated only marginally under
the IBL. To begin with, the IBL only affects the budget processes of family health centers and
soum hospitals. Secondary and tertiary care providers are not affected by the IBL. Family
health centers’ budgets are set on a capitation basis, and the budgets allocated on a lump-sum
basis. This has not changed under the IBL, and family health centers continue to enjoy a high
degree of flexibility in how they spend the budget. Soum hospitals’ budgets are set on a line -
item basis now, as before. However, the IBL has resulted in greater flexibility in spending across
categories for soum hospitals.

Most providers noted that payment rates do not include adequate adjustments for geographic
differences in the cost of delivering care. In the Mongolian context, low population density,
the remoteness of many villages, and severe weather conditions create enormously variable
challenges and resource requirements for providing basic services. Most stakeholders
consider adequate geographic adjustment to payment rates to be one of the most critical
issues for improving the allocation of resources across providers and the population.

Last, but not the least, good management information systems are vital for strengthening
provider payment mechanisms and strategic purchasing capacity. Since 2005, the health sector
has been making efforts to implement a health management information system strategy. The
Ministry of Health uses Health-info software for collecting, integrating and processing the
routine health statistics. Most tertiary and secondary hospitals use Hospital information
systems, however hospitals have to keep paper records as the legal framework for electronic
record keeping has not been fully instituted and regulated effectively. For example, linkage to
social health insurance is still quite basic, as there is no electronic exchange of information
between health care providers and health insurance. Use of IT at the primary care level is
limited to basic word-processing and the use of spreadsheets. Information on ICT in private
sector is limited though newly established private health care providers use the latest
developments of hospital information system. A more integrated information system,
preferably electronic would help improve performance monitoring and therefore, efficiency
and quality of service delivery.


Roadmap
The assessment does not suggest that the general structure and mix of payment systems in
Mongolia need to change. It is important to continue to prevent potential adverse
consequences of the different payment systems, which is easier than reversing them in the
future. For example, it is recommended that Mongolia continue to implement the cap on all
revenue sources for providers, limit fee-for-service, and strengthen clinical guidelines and the
referral system.

Based on the stakeholder consultation meeting, it was agreed that the roadmap should focus
should on three key areas. These areas are:
     The public financial management rules (line item rigidities and retaining a portion of
      surpluses),
     Improving the technical design of the payment systems to better link payment rates
      to appropriate volume projections and case mix, and
     Refine geographic adjustments.

Based on the urgency and feasibility of different recommended steps as well as the timing of
the revision of the Health Insurance Law, the draft roadmap (summarized in Figure 12 below)
is partitioned into three main phases:
    I.    Urgent adjustments: the next 6 months
   II.    Fundamental revisions: the next 18 months
  III.    Realignment of payment systems: 3-5 years

The urgent revisions focus on putting in motion a dialogue to better exploit the flexibility that
currently exists in the Budget Law, immediately refining the basis for estimating population for
capitation, and beginning analysis for future phases. For example, analysis should begin
immediately to develop the parameters for moving toward budget caps based on volume and
other estimates of population health need and to refine the case groups for the DRG payment
system to better capture variation in the severity and cost of different categories of admissions
and to include adjustments for co-morbidity. Options for payment for outpatient specialty
services also need to be explored. A top priority is to develop a technical basis for geographic
adjustment for payments under all of the different payment systems. Targeted cost analysis
may be needed to accurately estimate the impact of geography, population density, and
climate conditions on the cost of delivering health services.

The vision for the roadmap is to lead toward a mix of payment systems that builds on and
enhances the current mix: guaranteed global budget (replacing the line item budget); refined
DRG-based payment for inpatient services; appropriate payment for outpatient specialty
services (to be determined); and expanded primary care capitation with incentives for quality
of care and health promotion. The provider cap will continue but should be developed based
on parameters that reflect population health need, such as case mix-adjusted volume. The
constraints of the Budget Law will be eased by gradually exploiting existing flexibility, including
consolidating line items to only three (personnel, recurrent costs, and capital) and retaining
surpluses at the sector or provider level to reinvest in the health delivery system.


Conclusions
The provider payment assessment revealed that overall, the general direction of provider
payment policy is effective. Many of the pitfalls observed in other lower middle-income
countries have largely been avoided. Overall provider revenue is capped, there is a mix of
payment methods that are in general complementary, and the role of fee-for-service payment
is targeted and limited.

The main conclusion for the way forward is that a major overhaul of the payment systems does
not seem to be necessary. The most significant obstacle to better leveraging provider payment
lies in the restrictions of the current Budget Law. Mongolia can make substantial progress with
a shift in the basis for the payment cap and budget payment from inputs to parameters that
reflect population health need and with some technical refinements to the design of the DRG-
based payment system and capitation. A top priority is to begin to develop appropriate
geographic coefficients to adjust payments for the varying cost of delivery services related to
Mongolia’s challenging physical environment and population density. All stakeholders agree
that there is some flexibility in the current Budget Law that has not been exploited, and steps
should begin immediately to reduce the number of line items and maximize the opportunity
to retain any surpluses for the health sector that are generated from underspending due to
lower-than-expected volume.
