This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      elevation of cross section at the planning and zoning
      department of district municipality which is in charge to provide
      the construction direction plan, as well as the elevation of cross
      section plans. The documents obtained in the previous
      procedures must be submitted at this time. The technicians set
      all the necessary levels -- road, entrance, plot, building corners,
      etc. -- to be the basis for the design process of the works that
      will follow, and issue a construction direction plan and elevation
      of cross section. The construction direction plan includes stated
      directions on the land, distances from neighboring plots, and the

      sign a service contract with this inspector. The inspector must
      check and approve all the project’s plans before they are
      submitted to the municipality. The list of project plans is
      extensive and includes the architectural design of the building
      done by design consultants; the reinforced concrete and
      insulation project plans prepared by a civil engineer; the fire
      safety project plans prepared jointly by an architect and the
      mechanical engineer for utilities; the project plans and               4 days      TRY 18,984

      Selecting an independent building consultant takes only a day.
      However, practitioners agree that it takes at least 3 days for the
      building inspector to review and approve all the documents
      before they are submitted to the municipality. Hence, for the

      The municipality must approve the project’s proposed designs.
      The fire safety project should also be submitted to the
      municipality for approval and can be included in this procedure.
      If the municipality asks for changes to be made to the
      architectural designs during the approval process, these changes
      should be reflected in the engineering and landscaping projects
      as well. For final approval, these project plans are submitted to
      the municipal project branch, for static, sanitation facility, heating
      and heat insulation, and landscaping project plans to the Turkish
      Electricity Distribution Corporation (TEDAS), for the electricity
      project plans; and to the telephone company, for the

       An authorized commission from the municipality inspects the
       building and verifies that it complies with the project. This
       commission then issues the occupancy permit.

       The law specifies a statutory time limit of 30 days for the
       municipality to issue an occupancy permit. Practitioners observe
       that this statutory time limit is not frequently observed, and so,
       this process can take on average 2 months.

        an engineer on the payroll who is registered with the Chamber of
        Electrical Engineers).

        The Engineer prepares the electrical project based on the facility’s
        architectural project. Part of the electricity project, the engineer prepares
        a connection scheme (for both internal and external installations). For

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The buyer conducts a non-encumbrance check on the property

       Although not mandated by law, non-encumbrance check is a must
       Procedure without which buyers do not proceed with the transfer
       process. The buyer almost always checks whether or not the property is
       free of liens and encumbrances. For this, the seller would need to obtain
       the document showing that the property is free of disputes.

       By law, title deeds are open to anyone who legitimizes their interest.
       However, in practice the records are not accessible to the public: the
       buyer can obtain this document only with a power attorney of the seller.
       Therefore, this document is typically obtained by the seller who is often     1 day                no cost
   1
       accompanied by the buyer. For transactions that are undertaken by
       lawyers, this procedure is taken care of by lawyers (who have the power
       of attorney from the seller and have a legal right to search titles). The
       information is computerized; it takes minutes to check and is free of
       charge. If the buyer or seller wish to obtain a copy of the records
       displaying the status of the property, a fee applies (TL 7.60 per page + a
       fixed fee of TL 17.50 that only applies if it is not the owner of the
       property who is is requesting a copy of the records).

      Obtain an earthquake insurance policy, or amend the existing one

      If an earthquake insurance policy had not been issued for the building,
      one is prepared since in practice, when selling the building or asking for
      a loan on it, it is usually required.   Even though commercial properties
      are excluded from the scope of the compulsory earthquake insurance
      policy, it is generally recommended to obtain one before transferring the
      property. The cost of this insurance policy depends on the features such
      as the area of the building and the place thereof, and the insurance                       no cost (unless a

      (i.e. if the term of the insurance policy has not yet expired), then there is
      no need to issue another one just as a result of the change of ownership.
      However, the new owner of the property shall have the insurance policy
      amended to indicate his own name under the policy, which will be
      arranged between the insurance company and the new owner.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

 Indicator        Answer                                        Explanation
                                  The most common and practical way for the hotel to proceed is the
                             postponement of bankruptcy procedure. Article 377 of Turkish Commercial
                                Code and Article 179 of the Turkish Enforcement and Bankruptcy Code
                             regulate this procedure. The debtor must propose a rehabilitation plan. The
                                   court may decide to grant up to one year for the debtor to attempt
                           rehabilitation based on the proposed plan. This period can be extended up to
             liquidation
                            4 years in total. Upon the decision on postponement of bankruptcy, no legal
               (after an
Proceeding                       proceeding (including the proceedings for the collection of the public
             attempt at
                           receivables) can be initiated against the debtor and the pending proceedings
           reorganization)
                              will be deferred. If the court agrees to postpone the bankruptcy, it will also
                            appoint an administrator in the same decision. The maximum postponement
                             period is one year (it can be extended up to 4 years) during which time the
                              administrator will supervise the business. In most cases, similar to the case
                            study, the debtor does not achieve the projections of the rehabilitation plan
                                         and the court will commence liquidation proceedings.

                                If the debtor fails to achieve its goals shown in the rehabilitation report, then
Outcome       piecemeal sale    the court will rule for opening its bankruptcy. Therefore in that case it would
                                   not be possible for the debtor to continue operating as a going concern.

                               After several months of procedural matters and hearings, the court will grant a
                                 one-year postponement of bankruptcy period to Mirage. This period can be
                               extended up to four years depending on the achievement of the rehabilitation
                                plan. In the case of Mirage, the postponement period will last 3 years in total.
                                  After the third year, Mirage can request an extension of the postponement
                                   period (another year), however, the court will likely deny this this request,
                                  because Mirage is not likely to comply with the financial projections of the
                               proposed rehabilitation plan. The court will declare Mirage bankrupt and notify

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.
       Has 60 employees.
       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if
        such agreements cover more than 50% of the

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
