The year 2015 was rough on Nepal. On April             2014/15 at 0.77, a fourteen year low.

struck the country. This was followed by a series      As devastating as these recent shocks have been,

This was bittersweet for a majority of Nepal is
eagerly awaiting a resolution to what has been a
rather prolonged period of political transition.
In a single generation, the country has gone
from being a unitary, Hindu state ruled by an
absolute monarch to a secular republic that has
adopted a federal structure. The promulgation

prosperity. Instead it was off to a shaky start,
with the trade disruption severely affecting eco-

essential commodities were acutely in short sup-
ply. Shortage of raw materials and essential fuel
forced businesses to either shut down entirely
or operate at reduced capacity. Owing largely
to these disruptions, the latest government es-        Source: WB Staff calculations using WDI, 2016

Further, breaking down the sources of income
between farm and non-farm income, non-farm
income growth appears to have been more im-

than farm incomes, though farm incomes have
contributed quite a bit as well. (Figure 6b)This

captures, among others, the dependency struc-

participate in the labor market relative to the
number of dependents they have – also appears
to have been important for poverty reduction.

The primary reason for the dominant role of
labor income in the observed poverty reduc-
tion has been the increase in wages across the
country. (Figure 7) Mean real wages grew from
Rs. 184 per day to Rs. 326 per day (in 2010
Rupees) or roughly 5.1 percent per year over

ly attributed this fertility transition observed in
Nepal to the spread of mass education, increas-
ing female labor participation, mechanization of
agriculture, among others.

The increase in urbanization is also another po-
tential driver. The share of urban population
has been increasing steadily, from 3 percent in
the 1960s, 9 percent by 1990, and 18 percent
by 2014. This is the fastest urban growth rate in
all of South Asia.7 (Muzzini & Aparicio, 2013)
More recently, the social and economic changes
brought about by the increase in the migration of
overwhelmingly male population together with
an increase in educational attainment of girls
has increased the average age of first marriage.
Whatever the reasons may be, the fertility tran-

       Note: HOI, or the equity adjusted coverage, measures inequality of opportunity. The closer it is to 100, the more universal the opportunity
       is, i.e., the higher the fraction of population that “have” the opportunity. The closer this number is to the “coverage” the lower the inequality
       among those who have it. See Annex 1for details on methodology.

The current understanding of poverty is static
and it is not always fully appreciated that the
commonly reported poverty trends are net
rates that obscure two crucial and contrasting
phenomena of people falling into poverty and
people escaping poverty. Those who fall into
poverty and who are never able to escape pov-
erty are distinct and the policy response neces-
sary to address the needs of these two disparate
groups is also different. For those who remain
trapped in poverty, the chronic poor, enhanc-

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE                                                                                             portant caveat of this measure is that it is sensitive
Consider two societies A and B in which half the                                                             to the set of circumstances chosen for analysis. But

in urban areas. Now consider a basic opportunity                                                             highly desirable given that it is often impossible to

societies will appear similarly placed. But, suppose                                                         of circumstances in the analysis. This implies that
we also know that in society A, no rural child at-                                                           the computed inequality serves as a lower bound to

both rural and urban children attend school. The                                                             interest could be included in the analysis.
HOI discounts the coverage rate of 50 percent by
imposing a “penalty” when access is more unequal                                                             ESTIMATING THE HOI FROM                                           inequality            serves as a lower bound to the “actual” inequality where all
