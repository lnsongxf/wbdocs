Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                                                                 Draft Final Report              iv
Foreword
The World Bank appointed Pegasys Strategy and Development, to conduct the mid-term review (MTR) of the
Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) programme. This programme is of continental significance
and has a key role to play in supporting basins to unlock the potential of resource development through:

    •    Sustained strengthening of information, institutions, and investments in priority basins: The bulk of CIWA
         resources are dedicated to long-term engagement in CIWA’s priority basins, which the program establishes
         through an analysis of the basin’s needs, expressed demand, subsequent gaps, and CIWA’s comparative
         advantage.

    •    Short term, opportunistic, catalytic work: When opportunities arise, CIWA supports catalytic work that
         unlocks potential for cooperative investment in basins other than priority basins.

    •    Knowledge management and capacity building: CIWA supports activities that create a shared
         understanding that can facilitate cooperative development and management of international waters.

   The CIWA programme has developed organically in the last four years and now has a portfolio of projects that
   are strongly focused on the development of the systems, information and institutions that are critical to support
   development, as well as those projects that focus on the infrastructural development itself.

   The programme is at a juncture where it would be appropriate to undertake a mid-term review (MTR) that is
   backward looking, to understand the emergent lessons, and is also forward thinking towards shaping the
   programme to be able to upscale to meet the growing requests for support.

   This final report synthesises the input from the interviews, suggestions and feedback from the Advisory
   Committee workshop as well as the information from the FY15 Annual Report into a final recommendation
   report.

   While appreciating the depth of detail in the Draft Discussion Report, there was a suggestion from the AC
   meeting in September 2015 that the report was too lengthy. Hence, the decision to focus on a few prioritised
   key issues that CIWA has to address. It is therefore suggested that for the more detailed review of comments
   and research on key issues, the Draft Discussion Report should be the reference point. The Draft Discussion
   Report will be submitted as an addendum to this report.

Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report   vii
Executive Summary
Introduction
The Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program, launched in 2011, is supported by a multi-donor
trust fund that is administered by the World Bank and that seeks to support riparian governments in unlocking the
potential for sustainable, inclusive, climate-resilient growth by addressing constraints to the cooperative
management and development of international waters. CIWA intends to achieve this by improving the quality and
accessibility of information, strengthening institutions, and providing support for preparing and/or improving the
quality of investments with regional benefits. CIWA has set a target of raising and utilising $200 million dollars over
ten years, and it believes that this will enable it to achieve its objectives.

Approach and structuring
Given that the program is at its midpoint, this piece of work entails a Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the CIWA Program.
The intended purpose of the MTR is to assess the degree to which this 10 year-life CIWA program is on-track and
fit for purpose in meeting its designed development objectives moving forward. Noting that many of the projects
are now just moving towards implementation, the Advisory Committee (AC) advised that this MTR should not take
the form of a detailed evaluation, but rather explore areas for improvement. In conducting the MTR, the consulting
team reviewed strategic program documentation, project documentation, and reports. Consultative interviews
were also conducted with relevant stakeholders ranging from AC members, development partners/donors and
World Bank/CIWA staff to continental actors, regional economic communities (RECs), river basin organisations
(RBOs) and other recipients of the CIWA program. A site visit to one of the CIWA basins was also conducted. This
MTR is thus based on the document review and discussions with various CIWA stakeholders.

Building upon CIWA’s achievements
Although CIWA is undertaking difficult upstream work which is largely demand driven and flexible to deal with the
different approaches required across Africa, the program is providing a range of support that helps to unlock the
potential for sustainable and climate resilient growth within the continent by addressing the constraints to
cooperative management and development of international waters. Leveraging on WB convening power, credible
reputation, expertise and global presence, CIWA is rolling out interventions that are aligned with national and
regional objectives, and the program is considered highly relevant by recipients. The program has done well in
terms of strengthening cooperation in transboundary waters and advancing investments across Africa.

S1.      In reflecting upon the continentality of the program together with a range of dimensions that indicate
         relevance across the continent, the MTR found that the CIWA program is relevant and with the current
         suite of projects has a good geographic spread for potential impact.

S2.      The responses regarding the comparative advantage of the World Bank systems, the experience of the
         World Bank through the connectivity to the Global Practice, the geographic presence of World Bank staff
         across the continent, and the benefit that is accrued through a pooled multi-donor trust fund were all
         clearly voiced. This is further supported by studies that highlight the Bank’s track record in supporting work
         in transboundary contexts. The program therefore appears fit for purpose.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                  Draft Final Report   viii
S3.      It has been noted that working in transboundary basins is complex and as such takes time. This is noted in
         the CIWA annual reports, but various authors have also noted the complexities related to working in these
         political spaces. These also vary over time and space, and the differences in approach between the various
         regions of Africa are also distinct. In getting to this point of the program there have been lessons learned
         that can support the further roll-out of the program. With 4 basin projects accounting for 75% of the
         allocable budget and a useful blend of knowledge management, information, institutions and infrastructure
         projects under the catalytic sub-program the program is well placed for a productive five year period that
         should see the existing budgets spent.




Improving the program
         Improving program modalities

S4.      The strategic intent and strategic planning process of the CIWA program needs to be revisited. The CIWA
         program may benefit from an ongoing engagement regarding its strategic intent. This could be through an
         annual strategic planning session which brings together the various stakeholders including the World Bank,
         PMU, its TTLs and donors, as well as a broader array of continental actors (some of which are part of the
         Consultative Group) and results in a review of its strategic plan. In this strategic planning process, CIWA
         needs to engage with projects being implemented, and specifically with the balance between “quick-wins”
         and longer term benefits from various interventions towards developing a pipeline of projects.

S5.      Visibility should be strengthened through strategic communications. There is general consensus that the
         CIWA program is making an important contribution in dealing with water challenges on the continent, but
         that there is a need for CIWA to strengthen its visibility by improving its strategic communications
         interventions and successes more effectively. Thus, CIWA needs to market itself more effectively and share
         the results of interventions strategically. This could then also contribute to better fund mobilisation.

S5.1     Similarly, the improvement of CIWA guidelines and program document will strengthen the understanding
         of CIWA and its modalities.

S6.      Develop a gender strategy. Whilst there have been improvements regarding the elevation gender and
         poverty dimensions there are still gaps in terms of an improved way of articulating the gender and poverty
         intent of CIWA. There is a clear need for a gender strategy to guide reporting and monitoring on gender
         dimensions of CIWA activities.

S7.      Strategic plan for CIWA strengthening. The recommendations from the MTR have indicated a suite of
         adjustments to further strengthen what is already a good program. These need to be consolidated into a
         strategic plan that enable the WB to take this issues forward in structured manner. There are effectively
         three key areas for attention namely the programmatic governance and oversight, program resourcing and
         capacity and project level planning and oversight.

S8       Fund Mobilisation needs to be improved. Given the value of the program to its stakeholders and the fact
         that the design of the program was predicated on raising US $200 million, fund mobilisation should be given
         more importance within the program. If CIWA is not able to meet its aspirational target of raising US $200




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report         ix
         million, it may need to reconsider some aspects of its model and design, but most importantly the funding
         strategy needs to be linked to the strategic planning and an understood pipeline of projects.

S9.      Building capacity is important to strengthen the program. Concerns with regards to staff capacity have
         been discussed in nearly all interviews. There is a sense that the appointment of some key staff members
         would support the team to unlock some processes and to support in moving some processes more
         efficiently. It is clear from the interviews that this capacity would be needed at both PMU level (to support
         strategic matters) and at basin levels (to support project mobilisation). It is noted that expenditure on
         staffing is at less than 3% of budget and so there are in fact funds available for additional staff

S9.1     It has been noted that the Bank has started some restructuring activities and key individuals, who have a
         wealth of understanding of CIWA may be moving. There are concerns with regards to the loss of
         institutional memory.

S9.2     Therefore, a resource and capacity strategy is needed to further strengthen the program. This will need to
         consider the Banks developments in terms of the Global Water Practice. This needs to be linked to an
         improved knowledge management system that enables the exchange of experience.

S10.     Improving processes where possible. Whilst some stakeholders (largely those external to the Bank) felt
         that the approval process was excessively long, those within the Bank and some of the donors felt that the
         time needed was proportionate to the nature of these programs and projects. The MTR team’s initial sense
         was that for a 10 year program approval processes in the order of two years was too long and would impinge
         on the ability to reach targets. Without doing an intensive analysis, it would be of value to look at ways of
         improving efficiencies in this process. The Bank is known for its systems and rigour and the donor partners
         value this. If there are not efficiencies that can be achieved then there is stronger emphasis needed on
         developing a pipeline of projects so that these approvals do not impact on the programs ability to meet
         objectives.

S11.     Disbursements and delivery. The rates of disbursement has in previous financial years been extremely low
         and has only in this financial year seen a significant improvement. This is linked to the fact that many of
         the projects are now starting to be implemented. However, the MTR is concerned that with 83% of the
         projects being executed by RBOs, more accountability for delivery needs to be placed in the shoulders of
         the RBOs. This should include a more rigorous reporting requirement for which the RBO takes
         responsibility.

S12.     Risk Management needs to be improved. CIWA is currently quite strong in terms of identifying risks, but it
         is not clear how well these risks are being managed. In order to improve the risk management framework
         the monitoring and reporting of risks does need to be improved. Firstly, CIWA’s approach to risk, including
         a risk framework and appropriate evaluation and reporting system needs to be outlined in its Operating
         Guidelines. Secondly, the risks at the program level need to be monitored and reported in the Annual
         Report. Thirdly, the reporting on risk management at the basin level needs to be strengthened to reflect
         status at approval and how these risks are being managed.

         Improving Program Management

S13.     Revisit the program management structure. Looking at the overall program management structure the
         management of the program at the strategic programmatic level, as well as at the basin level in support of
         project implementation is appropriate. The need to have structures that engage stakeholders on
         continental/strategic matters as well as at the basin level on more operational matters is recognised. The
         overall program governance framework does require revisiting so as to clarify roles and responsibilities and
         strengthen these structures towards improved performance.

S14.     Strengthening strategic partner engagement. The CG has been less effective in recent years and needs to
         be strengthened to support consistency in attendance, and in order to play its role of strategic guidance. It
         has been noted that attendance at the CG’s has dwindled with time and there have been challenges in
         consistency of attendance. Therefore, the CG either needs to be strengthened or it needs to be disbanded
         and the program will need to investigate some alternatives that will enable the program to engage in
         strategic discussions with key stakeholders, lead agents and development partners across the continent.

S15.     Unlock the strategic role of the Advisory Committee. The AC is understood to play a vital role, but this
         needs to revert to one of providing strategic direction and having oversight on program performance.
         Whilst the AC members see the value add in providing strategic guidance there is not a desire to micro-
         manage. A revised governance framework does need to be developed that clearly articulates roles and
         responsibilities and align with other Trust Funds being managed by the World Bank. This will empower
         CIWA to take full responsibility for the program, and accordingly be held fully accountable. This will unlock
         the real strength of the AC in terms of its strategic guidance.

S16.     Strengthening Basin Advisory Committees for improved knowledge management. The BAC plays an
         important role at the basin and project levels and the flexibility to build upon existing structures is
         appreciated in order to avoid duplication of structures. It has been noted that the lessons learned at the
         basin and project level are not being captured and shared as effectively as they should be. The BAC needs
         to be strengthened to enable more engagement and coordination at the basin level and to support an
         improved knowledge management approach within the program.



         Improving Monitoring

S17.     Basin scale results framework needs to be strengthened. Noting that the richness in terms of impact and
         the generation of lessons for future projects and initiatives lies within the projects at the basin level, having
         appropriate results frameworks at the project scale is critical for the program as a whole. Essentially,
         improving upon the results frameworks at basin level entails holding basin level workshops to develop and
         agree upon a theory of change for each project. With the theory of change developed, results chains need
         to be developed so as to reflect the connectivity between activities, outputs, outcomes and impact.
         Moreover, baselines need to be developed that are appropriate and linked to the actual contextual baseline
         within the basin, and not a baseline linked to CIWA processes. This needs to be developed in partnership
         with key stakeholders so as to create an improved sense of ownership and develop capacity for future
         monitoring. It is also critically important to engage a gender specialist at these basin level workshops to
         assist in tackling the challenges currently experienced in addressing and reporting upon gender dimensions.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report          xi
S18.     There is need to strengthen the reporting at project scale within the basins to ensure the provision of more
         detail on process, progress and response. While reporting is done every 6 months through Implementation
         Status Results (ISR) reports, providing an indication of what has been achieved, there is a sense that: a)
         there is not sufficient qualitative reporting against indicators; b) is not always clear how the various
         interventions have resulted in the numbers that have been determined. Notably, some of the ISR reports
         are better than others while certain projects have only been initiated recently, however, this reporting does
         require improvement.

S19.     The CIWA Basin Support Plans need to be reformulated and revised to reflect the basin theory of change
         and to provide a hub for the knowledge management within basin. The Basin Support Plan is important in
         providing a bridge between the local stakeholders, the RBOs and the WB. The uncertainty created by the
         lack of clarity and alignment in understanding the BSP is an opportunity lost. Strengthening these reports
         to reflect the theory of change at basin level and to become a vehicle for structuring the lessons and
         knowledge that emerge through the project is needed.

S20.     The role of RBOs in the reporting at basin level needs to be strengthened. There is need for enhanced
         reporting at the basin level led by RBOs. This could be undertaken through a reporting mechanism separate
         from the World Bank systems, noting that WB systems are structured in a particular manner. This could
         create improved ownership and provide the opportunity to report on progress, risks, and value for money
         in a more detailed manner.

S21.     The use of a Developmental Evaluation approach will strengthen the evaluation of impact and create a
         shared sense of ownership across projects within basins. Given the magnitude and regional significance of
         CIWA projects, it is recommended that such initiatives adopt the Developmental Evaluation (DE) approach.
         The selection of DE for CIWA can support the on-going development of the interventions within the current
         context it operates in. Fundamentally, DE operates with the assumption that the changing dimensions of
         projects are necessary to accommodate a changing external environment and is therefore structured to
         allow for this change. Finally, DE recognises the value of involving stakeholders in the evaluation processes
         making the approach suitable for evaluating complex dynamic systems.

S22.     The development of a theory of change for the program together with a more complete suite of
         assumptions will be critical to be able to assess impact. In the absence of a theory of change (TOC), the
         program is vulnerable in being able to provide a sense of the strategic intent, how this aims to be reached,
         and periodically testing the assumptions implicit in the strategic intent.

S23.     The indicators for the Program Development Objectives (PDOs) need to be reworded to truly reflect the
         nature of the program. Indicator (i) uses the word “mobilised” which is in effect beyond the scope of CIWA
         which has little ability to ensure that funds are mobilised, and is in effect an inappropriate indicator. At
         best, CIWA can influence or leverage, with even the latter sometimes being difficult. This must be adjusted.
         Indicator (ii) uses the term “directly” with regard to benefit from improved water resource management
         and development. In some instances this can be quite problematic due to CIWA’s upstream nature. This
         must be rectified.

S24.     Challenges regarding the suite of existing targets must be rectified. Reflection on the targets for the
         program link to the nature of the program and to the current performance. Whilst it is not appropriate to


Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        xii
         adjust targets to meet underperformance, it is fair to redress targets that appear to be unreasonable or
         overly ambitious. There a number of targets that require redress and if not addressed will create problems
         in assessing performance. The following matter require attention.

         •         The results framework does not have targets for FY 17 – 19 and these need to be developed.

         •         Targets for PDO indicator (i) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that it has
                   limited to no influence on direct mobilisation of funds. In addition the target for FY16 notes
                   “potential” projects whilst the targets for FY20 is “mobilised”. The target of US$10 billion mobilised
                   is not appropriate and likely not attainable. The suggestion is to remain with “potential” projects
                   which reflects the Bank’s ability to influence projects with a 2020 target of US$15 billion.

         •         Targets for PDO indicator (ii) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that it has
                   limited influence on direct beneficiaries and hence the use of the word ‘potential’. In addition, the
                   assumption is that the beneficiaries are all those living within the basin which really could not be
                   tested. The leap from 15 million potential beneficiaries to 50 million direct beneficiaries between
                   FY16 and FY20 is unrealistic, noting at the mid-term the achievement has been 5.6 million direct
                   beneficiaries and the projects that are currently online. The targets for potential direct beneficiaries
                   is also unrealistic in that the achievement in FY15 is about four-fold.

         •         The baselines for all targets are reflected as zero, linked to CIWA initiatives. This the MTR finds
                   problematic as it really undermines the actual existing capacity within basin.

         The PDO targets need adjustment whilst the assumptions that underpin the targets for the intermediate
         results areas require strengthening.

S25.     The monitoring and reporting framework needs to provide a basis for the programs knowledge
         management, and needs to be documented in the operational guideline. The overall programmatic
         approach to monitoring and reporting is not currently documented within any of the guideline documents
         and this needs to be captured in the operational guidelines. Doing this should provide a clear framework
         for the reporting and effectively the knowledge management for the program. Currently, the rich
         experiences and findings within the basins is being lost and needs to be reported upon. Strengthening the
         Basin Advisory Committees will be a key step forward in supporting the basins in reporting, and ensuring
         that this knowledge is not lost.

S26.     Further improve value for money (VFM) statements. Whilst the FY14 and FY15 Annual Reports did reflect
         on VFM at a programmatic level. However, there is a need to assess this at project/basin level where it will
         be more important to track progress. It is noted that many projects are only now being initiated, and so
         there is limited to no data available that can be used to reflect current progress. In order to support the
         developmental evaluation for the projects a suite of indicators and baselines will need to be developed for
         each project/basin. The ICF indicators whilst sometimes difficult to utilise do provide a meaningful first
         port of call for each basin. This will require capacity building support to assist the basins in undertaking this
         monitoring and the MTR would expect that the RBOs must take this on board as a key element of reporting

1. CIWA and the Mid-term Review
        1.1. Introduction
One of the World Bank’s fundamental values is to help vulnerable countries address their water
challenges as a strategy for ending poverty and ensuring shared prosperity. To this end, it is through
sustainable management and development of its international waters that Africa can make positive
strides towards the attainment of climate-resilient growth and poverty reduction. This is particularly
important given that all of the major water resources in Africa, in 63 basins, are shared between 48
countries and the key sectors that contribute to growth are largely reliant on water. Sufficient access
to adequate supplies of water, food and energy are the most significant challenges across Africa, and
Global averages for water consumption by the agriculture and energy sectors is 70% and 15%,
respectively. While these water-dependent sectors must be developed to support Africa’s growth,
the financial, technical and political complexities of transboundary waters form serious obstacles to
achieving the climate-resilient food, energy and water security needed for Africa’s sustainable
development. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report for 2015 again placed water crises as
its most significant risk in terms of impact. Given this, cooperative action becomes necessary and
imperative to optimize regional benefits and mitigate the shared risks including those posed by climate
variability and change.

The historical notion of international development support has been to support this development
through a process of singling out best practice, for a particular issue, and then providing support to
see this best practice implemented1. Whilst this is sometimes of value, in many instances this can be
fraught and this is typically where one is dealing with complex issues that have shifting requirements
(over time and space) and are in effect difficult to resolve. These so called ‘wicked problems’ (see
Table 1, below) force programmes to adapt and change and this creates managerial challenges and
potentially increases costs.

Characteristic                  Wicked Problem
                                The problem is difficult to define. Many possible explanations may exist. Individuals perceive

                                the issue differently. Depending on the explanation, the solution takes on a different form.
                                There is no single set of criteria for whether solutions are right or wrong; they can only be

                                Every problem can be considered a symptom of another problem. There is no identifiable

Replicability                   Every problem is essentially unique; formulae are of limited value.
                                Each problem is a one-shot operation. Once a solution is attempted, you cannot undo what

All of these characteristics find resonance in the transboundary water management arena and authors
such as Blomquist, Dinar and Kemper (2005)3 and Subramanian, Brown and Wolf (2012)4 have
described the complexities and the nature of the risks of working in these environments. These
complexities are useful to understand when assessing a program that operates in these difficult
institutional environments. Subramanian et al (2012) provide an insightful suite of risks, as captured
in Table 2, below.

Key messages towards for engagement in transboundary basins that emerge from both Blomquist et
al. (2005) and Subramanian et al. (2012) are informative:

       •    More attention is required in understanding political economy in decision making and the
            perceptions of risk.
       •    A range of actions will be needed to reduce risks.

    •    Engagement at national levels does not involve singular stakeholders but requires multi-
         stakeholder processes.
    •    Individual champions can unlock processes, but equally developing partnerships and
         supportive teams is important to generate the support for processes.
    •    Solutions must be tailored for the basin requirements but also match national needs. There
         are no idealised or model solutions, but only those that are appropriate and ‘fit for purpose’.
    •    Politics are difficult to predict and so anticipation is critical to enable swift action.
    •    Longer term engagement is important and consistency of support is as important as the
         magnitude of support. It takes time to plan, facilitate and build confidence.
    •    Situations are dynamic and the issues that may have helped to drive collaboration and
         engagement will be addressed and replaced with new issues. Events at a range of scales can
         impact upon progress or create new opportunities.
    •    Supra-national entities such as the World Bank, the European Union and others international
         development partners can play a meaningful role in assisting to unlock opportunities.

It is therefore understood that whilst transboundary water management is extremely important to
the socio-economic development of Africa, that this is indeed complex. Additionalities such as climate
change makes this all the more complex with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
identifying Africa as the region at greatest risk from climate change. Improvements in our
understanding of what is required of basins to strengthen their climate resilience will prove critical in
the coming years.

     1.2. The CIWA Program and its Evolution
Against this background, the World Bank and a group of development partners established the
Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program in 2010. CIWA was established through
the initiative of the Water Resources Management Unit of the Africa Region of the World Bank
(AFTWR) together with the Department for International Development (DFID) of the UK Government.
Since then, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands have joined in supporting the CIWA
program.

The design of CIWA has been based on lessons learned from past World Bank work on transboundary
water issues including in the Nile, Niger, Zambezi, and Senegal River Basins as well as through other
multi-donor trust funds such as the African Water Resources Management Initiative (AWRMI), the
Water Partnership Program (WPP), and the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI). Some of the key
lessons that have been incorporated into the CIWA design are:

•   the importance of riparian ownership and early stakeholder engagement;

•   flexible levels of engagement;
•   clear goals and results focus in implementation;

•   the need to communicate results and outcomes to stakeholders and development partners in
    order to build support;

•   a clear exit strategy; and



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report         3
•      the importance of donor coordination to increase program effectiveness.
These lessons have been further enriched, through ongoing processes, with the realization that steady
progress towards transboundary cooperation can be made through long-term sustained support to
basins with weak institutional capacity, and that short-term support in the form of analytical studies,
technical assistance and capacity building initiatives can drive cooperation within basins.5

Importantly, the CIWA program aims to support governments in sub-Saharan Africa to unlock the
potential for sustainable, climate resilient growth and poverty reduction through cooperative water
resources management and development efforts. This will be attained through:

       •     Sustained strengthening of information, institutions, and investments in priority basins: The
             bulk of CIWA resources are dedicated to long-term engagement in CIWA’s priority basins,
             which the program establishes through an analysis of the basin’s needs, expressed demand,
             subsequent gaps, and CIWA’s comparative advantage.

       •     Short term, opportunistic, catalytic work: When opportunities arise, CIWA supports catalytic
             work that unlocks potential for cooperative investment, mainly in basins other than priority
             basins. However, the catalytic sub-program does provide methodological support for recipient
             executed activities in priority basins.

       •     Knowledge management and capacity building: CIWA supports activities that create a shared
             understanding that can facilitate cooperative development and management of international
             waters.

The overall impact of the program is to “strengthen Climate Resilient Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa”
The long term objective of CIWA is “to strengthen cooperative management and development of
international waters in Sub-Saharan Africa,” which it intends to meet through support to activities that
fall within the following four intermediate results areas:

• Regional Cooperation and Integration - aims to foster cooperative transboundary institutions for
  greater regional stability and creation of an enabling environment for shared sustainable growth

• Water Resources Management -This aims to underpin the evidence-based knowledge for planning

work that supports knowledge management/capacity building and provision of technical assistance
(see Figure 1). Projects across the program are demand-driven6 but that should not down play the fact
that CIWA has a broad strategic intent and that all projects should support the attainment of that
intent.

Figure 1: CIWAs modes of engagement7




Basin Sub-Program: The majority of CIWA funds are dedicated to sustained engagement within
priority basins. The support provided through this sub-program is aimed towards strengthening
foundational elements such as data and information dissemination systems, agreements, institutions,
investment plans and operational plans that enable building of trust among riparians, create an
understanding of opportunities for cooperative development, strengthen the institutional framework
that facilitates collaborative action, and build riparian capacity to undertake complex regional
initiatives. Implementation could occur through RBOs, RECs, and other regional organisations
including CSOs, NGOs or national governments. The Basin Sub-program has a holistic approach to
facilitating cooperative action in the long-term, thus making it different from the Catalytic Sub-
program.

CIWA’s priorities for sustained basin engagements are at this stage the Nile, Zambezi, Volta, and Niger
basins8. These project are not bank executed but are executed by the recipients.

Catalytic Sub-Program: The catalytic sub-program focuses on activities that contribute to
understanding barriers to cooperation, exploring cooperative investment possibilities, building
stakeholder capacity, generating regional public goods in the form of information and analytical tools,
and brokering knowledge. While this sub-program can support activities in all transboundary river
basins in Africa, the bulk of the Catalytic Sub-Program’s focus is on basins other than the priority basins

(as discussed above). Furthermore, Africa-wide work can also be undertaken through this sub-
program. The work within this sub-program is not intended to utilise more than 10% of the total CIWA
envelope. The two main criteria for work within this sub-program are demand and notable
contribution to the CIWA program PDO and four results areas (see Catalytic Sub-program Project
Concept Note for the Programmatic Approach).

CIWA’s priorities for Opportunistic Engagements, according to the Strategic Framework, are ECOWAS,
Lake Chad and Okavango. Opportunistic engagements could eventually move into sustained basin
engagements9.

The Knowledge Management and Capacity Building engagements are aimed at improving the
understanding of cross-cutting issues in order to facilitate cooperative development and management
of transboundary waters. As such these initiatives may have varying entry points and have varying
scales of relevance. These engagements cover four thematic pillars:

•           Analytical Work for Catalysing Cooperation;
•           Exploring Collaborative Investment Opportunities;
•           Improving Access to and Improving the Use of Climate Change Data, information, and Models
            to Build Resilience; and
•           Capacity Building and Knowledge Management.

The Knowledge Management/Capacity Building window is primarily Bank-executed and falls largely
within the Catalytic Sub-Program.

Through these sub-programs CIWA provides support in addressing Information, Institutions and
Investments10. In addressing information and institutional challenges the CIWA program supports
projects that consider:

       •    Information synthesis,
       •    Monitoring systems,
       •    Analytical tools,
       •    Information dissemination,
       •    Transboundary operating rules,
       •    Evaluating trade-offs,
       •    Allocation mechanisms,
       •    Water for the environment,
       •    Legal instruments,
       •    River basin planning,
       •    Sustainability of core financing,
       •    Communication,
       •    Stakeholder participation,
       •    Evidence base for cooperation,
       •    Platforms for cooperation,

    •    Institutional frameworks, and
    •    Regional financing mechanisms.
The types of projects that support investments include:

    •    Facilitating agreement,
    •    Evaluating trade-offs,
    •    Scoping,
    •    Pre-identification,
    •    Identification,
    •    Pre-feasibility,
    •    Feasibility,
    •    Environmental and social impact assessment,
    •    Detailed design,
    •    Transaction and legal support,
    •    Resource mobilization,
    •    Informing construction and commissioning, and
    •    Informing ongoing operations and maintenance.


The program has evolved over the five year period from its initial starting point of focus upon the Nile
and the Zambesi (as basin engagements) to four basin engagements and a suite of projects under the
catalytic sub-program. The geographic spread of projects has moved from being focused on East and
Southern Africa to the current context with a fairly well balanced spread of projects across the
continent. Similarly, the program has evolved from one that started by providing the weight of its
effort in strengthening institutions and information (which is a pragmatic place to start) to the current
situation where 50% of the funding supports institutions and information, 42 % supports large scale
infrastructure investments and 8% supports small scale infrastructure investments.

Initial targets for the ten year program were set out as:

•   50 million direct beneficiaries of projects influenced by CIWA,
•   5 basins with strengthened institutions,
•   5 basins with improved analytic tools, data and capacity,
•   10 investment opportunities with regional benefits progressed in the project cycle, and
•   5 basins with improved engagement with civil society, private sector and academia.

An initial reflection of the evolution of the program towards these objectives does reflect that the
program appears to be on the trajectory when one notes that CIWA is now supporting four basins,
with a fifth basin under the catalytic sub-program, and some 22 investment opportunities being
advanced. Potentially, at this initial stage, the area that has not evolved to the extent desired at this
stage would be the engagement with stakeholder groups.

     1.3. Program Governance
The management and governance of the program takes place at two levels namely at program level,
focused on strategy and activities across the program, and at basin level with the focus upon the
detailed activities within a basin project. At the program level structures include the Consultative
Group (CG), the Advisory Committee (AC) and the Project Management Unit (PMU) (See Figure 2).




Figure 2: CIWA program strategic advisory and management structure

These structures provide a useful balance between strategic support and guidance on the positioning
and intent of the program (CG), the strategic content of the program to meet the programs objectives
(AC) and the provision of technical input, oversight, quality assurance and day-to-day management
and administration of the program (PMU).

The CG aims to bring broad expertise and knowledge to CIWA, providing strategic guidance in
achieving its objective of strengthening cooperative management and development of international
waters in Africa. As such it is not a decision-making body, but provides strategic inputs that can
influence direction and intent, and can assist in strategically placing the CIWA program amongst the
myriad of support programs that are being undertaken in Africa at varying scales. This provides a
platform for CIWA to draw benefit from the insights and experience of key African water sector
professionals. The CG is made up of CIWA recipient partners (river basins organizations, RECs or other
international water organizations in the cases of international lakes or aquifers); development
partners (donors and other financing agencies which may or may not be contributors to the CIWA
Multi-donor Trust Fund); and other stakeholders (AMCOW, RECs, RBOs, NGOs, etc.). The CG is
proposed to meet once a year or as needed.

The function of the AC is to provide strategic advice and guidance to the World Bank regarding CIWA’s
programs and plans. The Committee has both a consultative and an advisory role and provides a
forum for contributing development partners to meet, exchange information, and consult on a regular
basis. The World Bank as manager of the CIWA MDTF undertakes day-to-day operational activities
and retains the overall decision making authority linked to its fiduciary responsibility, consistent with
all Bank managed trust funds and in terms of the Trust Fund Administration Agreements entered into
with each donor. Having noted that, the project approval process for the program does note that at



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report         8
key junctures within the project approval process that the AC does need to provide endorsement (see
Figure 3, below).




Figure 3: Project development and approval process towards basin engagement projects11

The review of the Operational Guideline with regards to the role of the AC reflects that these roles
are:

•          Review of CIWA program strategy in order to provide guidance on the overall content and
           direction of the program and ensure the use of Trust Fund resources to meet the objectives of
           the program;
•          Review of “Justification Notes” to assist with the decision for CIWA to begin sustained
           engagement in a prospective basin;
•          Review of “Project Concept Notes” to assist with the decision for CIWA to allocate funding for
           specific projects in basins where CIWA has sustained engagement;
•          Review of CIWA Support Plans as part of relevant Basin Advisory Committees in order to provide
           guidance on the content and direction of the program in basins where CIWA has sustained
           engagement (this applies to basins where AC members have a particular interest, experience,
           or expertise; AC members are not expected to review all CSPs in detail);

•      Provide feedback on planned and on-going projects to help ensure alignment with basin
       strategies and target results as well as with overall program strategy and target results;
•      Review overall program implementation progress, financial management, and administration;
•      Review of CIWA funding needs and promotion of participation of new donors to close funding
       gaps and support new program components;
•      Encourage donor harmonization, either through the MDTF or bilaterally, for potential
       investments;
•      Meet annually and if needed, consider a semi-annual meeting, virtually or in-person.

The AC consists of the development partners who are contributing to the CIWA Multi-donor Trust
Fund (MDTF) and the World Bank. The AC meets formally once per year but will also convene virtually
on an ad hoc basis as required to enable effective and efficient program delivery. It does appear to
be the norm to have at least one extra-ordinary meeting per year.

The PMU, led by the Program Manager, is comprised of both management and technical staff
responsible for managing all CIWA operations. The PMU provides high-level multi-sectoral technical
input, oversight and quality assurance to the CIWA program, and day-to-day management and
administration of the CIWA program and its projects. Technical Team Leaders (TTLs) support and
guide the basin projects. These World Bank staff members are not purely dedicated to CIWA projects
and as such provide the opportunity to link initiatives and leverage possible synergistic opportunities.

It is important to note that at the basin level, the Basin Advisory Committee (BAC) structure is aimed
at providing the guidance and oversight to ensure that the projects within the basin or across the
region achieve their objectives. A key role of the BAC is to ensure coordination with other ongoing
activities across the basin. Thus the BAC also provides an opportunity for interested partners to
consult and contribute to discussions on basin plans and priorities (Figure 4).




Figure 4: BAC positioning within the basin context

The membership of the BAC includes representatives from the riparian states, regional bodies such as
the RBOs and the REC, international agencies such as GWP or the IUCN, other non-CIWA donors (such
as GIZ), other interested stakeholders, and of course the CIWA/ World Bank staff (see Figure 6).

     1.4. Funding the CIWA Program
The CIWA program is funded through a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) administered by the World
Bank with an initial contribution from the UK and subsequent contributions from Denmark, the


Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        10
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. With a longer term aspirational vision of an expanded funding
envelope, it is envisaged that other donors might come on-board in supporting the program. The
intent is that through CIWA, the development partners and the World Bank are leveraging the
expertise, convening power and resources of the Bank for managing and developing transboundary
water resources in Africa.

The aspirational target from the World Bank was to attain a total finding envelope of US$200 million
over the ten year period, and this would be used to mobilise some US$10 billion for cooperative
management and development by the year 2020.

To date US$68 million have been pledged and amounts received have been US$44.5 million. The
funding process and current funding status are reflected in Figure 5, below.




Figure 5: CIWAs funding process12

With this funding envelope, the overview of allocations geographically, institutionally and by nature
of support is as reflected in Figure 6, below.

The detailed allocations per project are provided in Table 3, below.

     1.5. Purpose of the MTR
The Mid-Term Review (MTR) sought to assess the degree to which CIWA is on-track and fit for purpose
in meeting its development objectives moving forward and their relevance under the current
circumstances. There are three key elements of the CIWA (MTR) that are to be assessed as part of this
review process.
     • The first entails assessing the degree to which CIWA is fit for purpose in meeting its
        development objectives moving forward, as well as their relevance under the current
        circumstances.
     • The second is that the MTR is primarily a “functionality review” which considers specific
        elements of CIWA’s governance, structure, resourcing, processes, procedures and systems.
        It is noted that in this regard there are different programmatic and institutional interfaces
        that need to be carefully considered.
     • The third aspect of the MTR entails a progress review which will assess how the program as
        a whole is on-track to meet its goals.


In this context it is important to recognize that some of the projects and basin engagements have only
just begun. Regardless, data and information available provided a useful and sufficient basis to
determine which aspects of CIWA are relevant and which may require refinement.

The primary areas of focus for the MTR of the CIWA
program, as set out in the TOR (see Appendix 1),
include five key elements of:

•    Program relevance, portfolio review and progress
•    Program management structure
•    Results framework and monitoring and evaluation
     system
•    Risk management
•    Value for money



                                                                                 Figure 7: five key elements of the review

Throughout the analysis, the consulting team identified particular challenges or opportunities that
require attention in order to improve delivery. The five key elements driving the MTR scope of work
are briefly described in the table below.

                                     •    Review how CIWA processes and programming should be implemented moving
                                          forward given the extensive project preparation time.
                                     •    Examine the relevance of CIWA’s Results Framework to the current portfolio,
                                     •    Assess how well the Project Development Objective indicators and Intermediate
                                          Results indicators capture the intended results of the program, and how well

system                               •    Review whether the various indicators and targets are relevant across the scope
                                          of projects and whether any recommendations in terms of amendments to
                                          these can be made,
                                     •    Assess the efficacy of the monitoring at project level and ascertain whether the
                                          appropriate reporting at project level is indeed taking place,
                                     •    Assess the readiness of the program for a future impact evaluation

                                          considered and propose new or modified mitigation measures if relevant,
Risk Management
                                     •    Review risks and risk management at the project level, to ascertain whether risks
                                          are indeed being assessed at the project level and to understand how these
                                          interface with the broader programmatic risks.
                                     •    Assess if CIWA has the structure and procedures in place to ensure value,
                                          outcomes and impact,
Value for Money
                                     •    Assess the appropriateness of this approach and whether the measures being
                                          utilised are useful in assessing the value for money for the projects and program.



Importantly, the intended audience for the MTR is the World Bank management, who in consultation
with the CIWA AC, will determine if program restructuring and reformulation is needed including any
needed changes to the CIWA Results Framework.

2. Approach and Structuring
2.1. Approach for the MTR
The MTR methodology commenced with a review of CIWA literature as an entry point to interviews.
It is important to note that the methodology used for the MTR lends itself to diversity of views on key
themes and elements of the CIWA program. Capturing the diverse opinions and responses entailed
choosing the right methodology to address the MTR scope of work and answer key questions. The
review team employed a qualitative study approach based on semi-structured and open ended
questions designed into an interview template/checklist. The qualitative study was selected in order
to have a deeper view of how the CIWA program is performing and the perceptions associated with
the program performance. Furthermore, the qualitative approach was selected due to limited data
available for the program given that many projects are still coming on stream, reporting of outputs is
not qualitative (no sense of outcomes from outputs at this juncture) and whilst a little less than half
of the aspirational funding envelope has been realised, the disbursement of funds is only starting to
significantly increase.

Notably, some of the opinions and views reflected during interviews have been fairly extreme and the
review team tried to understand the broader context in order to minimise bias where possible. To
address this the team undertook a systematic approach of:
• Asking further probing questions to try to understand whether the question asked was not
     misunderstood, whether the interviewer was actually understanding the comment and its
     context and to see if through discussion the root cause of the comments could be determined,
     and
• Post interview triangulation by assessing existing literature, by linking these comments (if
     possible) to other interviews and by asking additional questions of others actors to test the
     validity of the comments.

Purposive sampling was used to identify participants following a list of contacts supplied by the World
Bank. The World Bank provided the review team with a list consisting of 28 contacts in total. The first
9 contacts on the list were primarily key contacts from the development partners/donors while the
remaining 19 were mainly World Bank/CIWA staff. In theory, the list for the development partners
had 9 contacts. The review team reached out to all the 28 primary contacts with a response rate of
100%. The review team further consulted additional stakeholders who were identified as relevant to
the MTR. These included continental actors (GWP, IUCN, AfDB, ANBO and AMCOW) and CIWA’s clients
within the RECs and Basins such as the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), Volta Basin Authority (VBA),
Nile Basin Discourse, Nile Basin Initiative, SADC Groundwater project, OKACOM, and the Lesotho
Highlands-Botswana water project personnel. The response rate from this group was again fairly high
with only three non-responses and one contact declining to be interviewed. The full list of people
consulted is appended (Appendix 2).

Interviews with most respondents were conducted telephonically or via skype. A few interviews were
conducted face-to-face particularly for the South Africa-based World Bank staff and DFID
representatives. Moreover, a site visit to the Volta Basin was also included in order to have first-hand


Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report         17
experience and interaction with stakeholders on the ground. These face-to-face discussions allowed
for richer discussions and surfaced nuances that were possibly harder to garner telephonically. The
review team provided a suite of questions that were developed and adapted appropriately to suit
each stakeholder group. These groups were:
• World Bank PMU staff,
• World Bank Regional staff and TTLs,
• Advisory Committee,
• Other development partners,
• Continental Actors such as AMCOW, ANBO and AFDB, and
• RBOs, RECs and Member states.

Clearly, with each interview there were distinctive areas of focus for the discussion and in many
instances interviewees felt ill-equipped to answer certain questions and, therefore, refused to answer.
This was useful in that it did remove some of the bias that is created from what are ostensibly
uninformed opinions. This was further supported by the fact that very few people interviewed did
not have a direct working relationship with CIWA, the World Bank and/or the projects

The questions were categorised according to the key focal areas of the MTR, namely:
• Overall performance,
• Programme relevance, portfolio review and progress,
• Programme management structure,
• Results Framework and monitoring and evaluation system,
• Risk management,
• Value for money, and
• Way forward

The teams approach towards assessment of credibility and plausibility of inputs was as follows:
• The project team undertook an initial document review and as a result started to develop
     opinions, as independent reviewers, of areas of the programme that could be strengthened based
     upon the experience of the team in working in transboundary basins and with development
     partners;
• Subsequent documentation reviews were undertaken when triangulating comments received,
     especially when an opinion was misaligned to previous comments or to what the project team
     had gleaned from the documentation;
• Interviews did focus on areas where the interviewee clearly has insight and an informed opinion;
• In answering questions interviewees were asked to justify their comments with evidence;
• In nearly all interviews the discussions were actually incredibly frank and open with the intention
     of finding ways to improve the program; and
• Generally, there was a very significant amount of alignment in the various reflections on the
     program.

This report is a synthesis report and does not reflect all the comments and inputs received. These
have been captured in questionnaire templates and were analysed through a discussion document
that was shared with the AC and the PMU at a workshop in Livingstone, Zambia, in September 2015.

2.2. Structuring the MTR
The methodological process employed by the review team provided a slightly nuanced approach to
the project as set out during project inception. The methodological process adopted is reflected
diagrammatically below highlighting the key processes from inception, consultation and compilation
through to analysis, validation and formulation.




Figure 8: MTR Methodology

Document Review- A robust and comprehensive document review of strategic documentation, project
documentation, reports and reviews was conducted. The documents were made available to the
project team through a shared platform, ‘the box’. A full list of documents reviewed is provided in
Appendix 3.

Stakeholder Consultations- As highlighted earlier, consultations targeted a range of stakeholders from
the list provided by the World Bank and some additional stakeholders. Specific methods for reaching
out to the stakeholders included face-to-face meetings, telephone or video conferencing. During
consultations with external parties (i.e. excluding the WB and donors) the review team focused on
inquires to gain feedback relevant to the respective organization and its role in the CIWA program.

Site Visit
The review team also undertook a site visit to the Volta Basin. The site visit discussions and
observations provided the project team with nuanced insights on CIWA supported projects in the
Volta Basin. During the site visit, the review team managed to discuss with a range of key stakeholders
in the Basin. This provided a more holistic view of CIWA support within a basin.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        19
Having completed the draft discussion report, the team submitted the report to the PMU for
comments on matters of clarity and correctness. These comments were not focused on the findings,
but towards programmatic or systemic clarifications. The PMU has in fact respected the
independence of the review team and has such taken all comments in an open, frank and non-
defensive manner.

The review team revised the report and this was submitted to the PMU a month before the Advisory
Committee meeting in Livingstone. The review team was invited to present the report findings at the
AC meeting, where final comments and recommendations were discussed so that the MTR report can
be finalised.

The report presented at the AC meeting in Livingstone, was recognised as being a useful draft
discussion document as it contained many of the detailed inputs and insights that emerged from the
interviews. However, it was agreed that the final report needed to be more succinct with a crisper
suite of findings aligned to the discussions held at the workshop.

Written inputs were received from monitoring and evaluation experts in support of the Netherlands
and United Kingdom. These comments have been taken on board in the production of this final report.

2.3           Understanding the MTR
The TOR indicates that the MTR should reflect on:

•        The degree to which CIWA is fit for purpose in meeting its development objectives moving
         forward, as well as their relevance under the current circumstances.

•        A “functionality review” which considers specific elements of CIWA’s governance, structure,
         resourcing, processes, procedures and systems. It is noted that in this regard there are different
         programmatic and institutional interfaces that need to be carefully considered.

•        A progress review which will assess how the program as a whole is on-track to meet its goals.

From the discussions of the AC14, there was clear understanding that the MTR could not perform an
evaluation when noting that many of the project had only just come on line, and that it would only be
appropriate to undertake a qualitative assessment in reviewing the program in the light of the above
mentioned aspects. The AC also noted that in undertaking the MTR that there should only be a
selective consultation process.

In undertaking the MTR these aspects became the lenses that were considered in looking at the
various dimensions of the program. These then being that the program is:
• Appropriate to reach objectives;
• Relevant;
• Functionally effective and efficient; and
• Progressing towards targets.

3. Building Upon CIWA’s Achievements

3.1. Continental context
Due to the large number of landlocked countries, transboundary water systems, and an uneven
distribution of energy resources and load centers, Africa’s development agenda is inherently regional.
Given that a total of 63 transboundary river basins accounts for 90 percent of Africa’s surface water
resources, 63 percent of its surface area, 83 percent of its precipitation, and 92 percent of its annual
discharge, water resources shared by countries pose complex political and management challenges.
While it is widely acknowledged that international waters have created some opportunities for
fostering regional economic cooperation and political integration through cooperative development,
the added complexity is also likely to lead to tension and derail the optimum development of common
resources.

In these transboundary contexts, there are a range of concerns which vary from basin to basin, but
which Subramanian et al (2012)15 note as key risks that influence co-operation decisions. These
include:

•     Sovereignty as deep seated concerns about national control that can re-surface at later stages,
•     Equity and access and that deals would provide some fairness in quantity, quality or in shared
      benefits,
•     Capacity and knowledge and that this would lead to some form of being disadvantaged, and
•     Accountability and voice and that needs would not be heard.

CIWA is undertaking a range of support that helps to unlock management and development

Given these challenges, a multi-purpose, integrated and cooperative approach has the clear potential
not only to help countries build economic resilience to climate change, but more importantly, to
diversify their economies. Multi-purpose cooperative water resource development has the potential
to offer significant benefits to the countries of Africa, provided that appropriate water governance
institutions manage the complex dynamics of multi-country development.

The CIWA program supports riparian governments in unlocking the potential for sustainable, climate-
resilient growth through cooperative water resources management and development. CIWA achieves
this by improving the quality and accessibility of information in order to raise awareness of increased
benefits and reduced risks that can result from joint action. Such joint actions include strengthening
the ability of institutions to provide platforms for riparians to act cooperatively; enabling African
governments to bring a wide range of stakeholders to the table; and enhancing the quality of regional
investments through adoption of benefit-sharing approaches.

CIWA strengthening cooperation in transboundary waters in Africa

In doing this, CIWA leverages the comparative advantage (as detailed in section 3.2 below) of its host
institution, the World Bank, which offers strong technical expertise in international waters and across

other relevant sectors such as agriculture, energy, and service delivery, while also having the power
to convene and mobilize multiple stakeholders and to utilize the experience gained from work on
international waters issues around the world. To this end, demand for CIWA program support from
potential recipient organizations exceeds available funding and so the need to accelerate fund-raising
efforts to address needs across Africa has increasingly become a matter of growing concern for the
program. While CIWA is continually seeking additional funding from existing and prospective partners,
it takes a cautious approach by matching the pace of project preparation with funding availability.

CIWA advancing investments across Africa

Finally, the program’s focus on facilitating cooperation that reaches across sectors for sustainable,
climate-resilient growth in Sub-Saharan Africa makes it a key vehicle in support of the recently
proclaimed SDGs. The strategic alignment of CIWA’s support with national and regional priorities, as
well as with World Bank and other development-partner interventions, continues to provide the basis
for on-going engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa. The comparative advantage of the CIWA program
under the auspices of the World Bank is outlined in detail below.



3.2. Comparative advantage
CIWA is a unique program through which development partners and the World Bank are leveraging
the expertise, convening power and resources of the Bank for managing and developing
transboundary water resources in Africa. This is the primary rationale for the World Bank to lead and
host the CIWA program. The World Bank ensures systematic and prudent management oversight of
entrusted funds, owing to its credible reputation as a trustee of more than $25 billion dollars annually.
Besides, the World Bank has vast experience in program delivery with the highest level of technical
capacity, collaborative partnerships with recipient countries and a global operational platform. In the
water sector, the Bank’s team is recognized for its world-class expertise as well as its extensive
experience in project design and implementation. This technical capacity and broad experience
enables the Bank to play a catalytic role in fostering cooperative water resources management and
development.

CIWA is a unique program leveraging on WB convening power, credible reputation, expertise and
global presence

The following table expands upon this, detailing the Bank’s comparative advantage and suitability as
host institution for CIWA.

Beneficiary perspectives on the CIWA program highlight that since the program is demand-driven, it
offers flexibility in terms of tailoring support to beneficiary needs. CIWA’s Strategic Framework notes
that all CIWA’s work is demand-driven16, and this was confirmed by interviewees who also noted that
this ensure that it meets the needs on the ground in maximising basin and member state beneficiation.
In being a demand-driven program, respondents highlighted CIWA’s flexibility in tailoring support to
beneficiary needs. In addition, CIWA notes that TTLs have been extremely supportive in identifying

 Demand takes various forms including requests from RBOS and RECs, requests during Consultative Group meetings, and assessments
made by the World Bank during implementation of activities which are relevant to CIWA (CIWA, 2013)

major technical assistance programs. Thus, clients of CIWA noted that the kinds of projects that are
being supported speak to beneficiary needs.

CIWA interventions are aligned with national and regional objectives, and considered highly
relevant by recipients.

The need to convert upstream projects into bankability was aptly captured by one continental partner,
“…we should come out of technical assistance and now we need to design and build infrastructure
projects, through engagement with private sector and governments,the collaboration should take a
different direction to encourage investment”. The same sentiments were shared by an RBO
representative who indicated that “people (beneficiaries) want to see some things on the ground
above and over the analytical work…upstream activities of institutional development. We would like
to see infrastructure projects on the ground”. In dealing with infrastructure, CIWA’s Strategic
Framework notes that it engages with infrastructure in promoting and improving investment in many
types of water-related infrastructure, and that its focus is on upstream work helps to improve the
quality of investments, thus leading to more sustainable investments. This results from a stronger
linkage between investments and the Basin Framework and CIWA’s support for environmental and
social analysis. In addition, CIWA is working to improve linkages with capital markets which it feels
could support in closing the gap in funding Africa’s infrastructure (CIWA, 2013). Thus, the need for
hard infrastructure projects (as articulated by some of the respondents) must be balanced with what
CIWA is intending to achieve as well its available purse.

CIWA is doing difficult upstream work which is largely demand driven and flexible to deal with the
different approaches required across Africa.



3.3. Programmatic progress to date
As indicated earlier, the CIWA program’s objective is to strengthen cooperative management and
development of international waters in Sub-Saharan Africa to assist in achieving sustainable climate-
resilient growth. In order to accomplish this objective, CIWA supports the institutions that manage
and develop the basins, catalyzes and enables transformative water-related investments, and
facilitates information gathering and sharing on the benefits of cooperation. The CIWA 2015 Annual
Report (CIWA, 2015) provides a synopsis of program level results against set targets.

It should be noted from the outset that, as with all infrastructure preparation projects, information
sharing efforts, and institutional strengthening work, the impact of any support provided may only be
realized after many years. It is against this background that the review team analysed the progress
made by the program. The indicators, targets and progress towards the attainment of the PDOs are
outlined below.

Table 9 provides an overview of all the four IRs, their targets and progress against targets. As
illustrated in Table 6 below, overall progress per Intermediate Results (IR) of the program indicate a
general positive progress for the program where four targets were ‘fully achieved’, two targets
‘partially achieved’ and only one target ‘not achieved’. Despite this seeming success, there is a need
to focus on improvement in areas where targets were not met.

Figure 9: Funding allocation per basin (CIWA, 2013; 2014; 2015)

Figure 9 above illustrates programmatic shift and progress towards funding allocation. Notably,
program funding allocation improved from 3 sustained basins (Nile, Volta and Zambezi) in FY2013 to
include Niger in FY2014. Moreover, the funds allocated also improved towards a more equitable and
balanced portfolio across basins, although the Nile and Zambezi basins still receive the largest
allocations respectively.




Figure 10: Allocation per region (CIWA, 2015)

With regards to funding allocation per region, Figure 10 illustrates an increasingly equitable balance
in terms of funds allocation per region. East Africa has historically received the largest allocation
followed by Southern Africa and West Africa respectively. Although the allocations vary from one fiscal
year to the other since 2013, there is a general recognition that the allocation is balanced.

Figure 11: Area of support

Figure 11 illustrates an increasingly balanced support towards soft and hard projects within the
program. Whilst support for soft projects was significantly higher at 59% in FY2014, with infrastructure
support (soft and large) having a combined 41%, there is a balance in FY2015, where support for soft
and hard investments is 50% apiece. This shift might imply that as more upstream work is finalised,
more investments might be shifting towards infrastructure support.




Figure 12: Partner type

Figure 12 illustrates an increasing proportion of recipient executed projects by RBOs, from 78% in
FY2013 to 83% in FY2015. The other partners, including REC, NGO, BE/KM have largely remained the
same from FY2014 to FY2015. Overall, the increasing shift towards RBO executed projects has the
benefit of improving ownership.

The progress and process flow of institutions with projects in operation that improve the approach to
sustainable investment planning and bankable investment preparation is best illustrated under figure
13 , while the progress and key elements for strengthening cooperation is illustrated by figure 14.

Financial reporting and progress

As of June 30, 2015, US$61.7 million has been allocated to CIWA projects and activities, which
effectively has assigned most of the available funding (97 percent) to activities under preparation or
implementation. Furthermore, the majority of available funds (US$47.7 million, or 75 percent) are



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report       30
allocated to CIWA’s four priority basins - Nile, Niger, Volta, and Zambezi. Table 10 presents a detailed
account of the allocation of available funding.
Table 10: Detailed account of allocation of available funding (CIWA, 2015)




By the end of FY15, the program had committed a cumulative US$56.2 million in grants, of which
US$11.3 million was disbursed in projects and activities. Although the pace of disbursement in FY15
more than tripled from the previous year, it is clear that a lot still needs to be done to improve
disbursements. To this end, it is envisaged that the pace of disbursements will increase as the full
portfolio is now in full implementation. Table 11 provide a summary of the overall cumulative
allocations, commitments, disbursements, commitment balance, and current pipeline activity
amounts.

Overall, the program has been very cost efficient in its management, benefiting from the solid and
embedded World Bank financial management and monitoring systems put in place at program
inception. However, there are concerns that attaining the US$200 million might not be possible given
that the program is already at mid-point having only raised less than US$70 million as of June 30, 2015.



3.4. Lessons learnt
There is a general understanding and acknowledgement that CIWA supported interventions in key
basins are sustainable and stand to yield benefits in the long run. This is further supported by the great
need for transboundary cooperation in Africa, and CIWA’s focus on transboundary water resources
management and cooperation is considerably important. The Nile, Niger, Volta and Zambezi basins
provide good examples. In these sustained basins, there is a general sense that the program is
supporting the attainment of long-term objectives in addressing regional integration, poverty
alleviation and economic development among other key issues (though there are challenges with how
some RBOs function). Notably, however, there is also a strong realisation and appreciation of the
program’s opportunistic element through the catalytic sub-program. Combined, these provide a
balanced portfolio of interventions in terms of geographic reach, sustained and opportunistic
engagements. The program is doing very well in this regard.

CIWA’s sustained engagements in Basins reaps longer term rewards.

One interviewee noted the gains that CIWA has made in the Nile Basin regarding fostering
cooperation. Due to conflicting interests and other reasons, countries such as Sudan and Egypt froze
relations with the Nile initiative. However, Sudan returned to ENSAP/NBI and there is positive
anticipation that Egypt will likewise find a way to get back. Through CIWA supported intervention on
cooperation have largely resulted in Sudan coming back on-board, further attesting to the positive
outcomes from CIWA. The key lesson is that the difficult upstream work that CIWA engages in has the
potential as an enabler for unlocking long-term benefits.

Facilitating cooperation through diplomacy has kept countries engaged.

The presence of the World Bank across Africa and its ability to convene is a strategic advantage from
which CIWA can easily benefit. Moreover, the World Bank is not only present in Africa but also in other
regions of the world, thus giving the Bank a comparative advantage in leveraging experience from
elsewhere. Whilst leveraging on this strategic advantage, there is a sense that the World Bank still
needs to improve engagement with other continental partners. This is a key a lesson about having
clear strategic intent.

World Bank has convening power, broad expertise and experience from elsewhere - CIWA benefits
from this.

The CIWA program implementation mainly occurs through recipients executed projects by RBOs and
RECs, being the direct beneficiaries of program. The member states and communities are largely
indirect beneficiaries. Since the CIWA program is demand-driven, in general, the relevance and
ownership of projects is quite high. It is not surprising to note that more than 80% of the CIWA-
supported projects are recipient executed. One interviewee noted for instance that the relevance of
projects is decided upon by the riparian governments through the RBO/REC, and it is therefore the


Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme     Final Report        32
RBO/REC that determines the appropriateness/relevance of the CIWA-supported projects (see NBD).
The demand driven nature of the program seems to have fostered a strong sense of ownership among
recipients and being largely relevant. This is a key lesson about ownership and longer term
commitment.

The demand-driven and flexible nature of the program renders it highly relevant to beneficiaries

The nature of program is such that support by CIWA is requested and this initiates a process of project
co-design and development. Therefore, the program has developed organically over space and time
and this makes it difficult to have specific strategic clarity of intent. The nature of such programs is
often one of difficulty in finding clear and measurable objectives, and being able to work with these
same objectives consistently.

Importantly, in being demand-driven the program does remain both flexible and relevant, however,
despite the difficulties the program does need to articulate a strategic intent for the program in order
to guide the program in terms achieving its objectives, but equally importantly to be able to place the
program within the array of programs being undertaken across the continent. This strategic intent
has both internally facing and externally facing benefits. Hence, there is a real concern that if CIWA
does not strengthen this it will be difficult for the program to attract other donors/funders to support
the program and potentially difficult create alignment and leveraging opportunities with other
programs and initiatives. This can be linked to comments made later in this review regarding the need
for a ‘Theory of Change’

Therefore, there is need for an improved strategic intent at program level without losing the benefit
that comes with demand driven projects.

Project pipeline

From the review of documentation it was not entirely clear as to the sequencing of projects and
whether those projects under the catalytic sub-program were intended to be developed and migrated
into the basins sub-program and whether there were other basin projects that were expected to
emerge. If this is the case then it was not clear as to the types of criteria that would be used to shift
from one sub-program to another.

Part of this uncertainty was also fuelled by the fact that the basin projects do take a number of years
to get to implementation. This lack of clarity in terms of the projects pipeline further undermines the
strategic intent of the program and creates further uncertainty as to how CIWA fits in with other
programs and where funding support is required. Noting that many development partners want to
provide targeted funding (either geographically or technically, or both), it becomes essential to
understand the longer term pipeline of projects.

Developing a strategic planning case for a pipeline of projects is essential.

Strategic communications

Arguably, there is some misunderstanding of the strategic intent of the program within the basins.
This emerged through interviews where the focus of projects was questioned and where there were
requests for projects to focus on community based projects and /or small scale localised infrastructure
projects. This is in part due to limited, or the lack of, clear strategic communication. This lack of clarity
regarding strategic intent has often resulted in various perceptions being created about the program.



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme       Final Report         34
Despite the intensive efforts of World Bank staff within the basins, there is a perception that CIWA
does not do small-scale projects, but only focuses on large scale investments. This is further
underlined by the perception that the CIWA program is not seen as working closely enough with local
partners. To some extent this is exacerbated by the fact that the vast majority of the program is
recipient executed, and as such the World Bank staff are key stakeholders to the projects.

It is important for CIWA to provide strengthened communications tools. CIWA can undoubtedly,
where relevant, have projects that impact at a range of project and geographic scales, however, it is
not clear to stakeholders and even some World Bank staff when and where this would be appropriate.
Of course, in some instances it is more appropriate to leverage the possibilities of other programs.
The sense is that although CIWA might be one of the largest water sector support funds in Africa, if it
improves its engagement and collaboration with other existing funds and continental actors, the
program and project ownership and impact in Africa will be more effective and sustainable, and garner
further funding support.

The strengthening of strategic communications will be a key step in creating an aligned vision of the
program and will support the drive to bring more funders into the program.

Leveraging lessons

The fact that CIWA is operating in several basins on the continent gives it an advantage in terms of
delivering synergistic support and sharing knowledge across basins, and there is a sense that CIWA
should leverage that further through the catalytic sub-program. This is a clear strategic advantage for
CIWA and the program needs to make more of this through an improved knowledge management
approach. The Basin Advisory Committees can play a key role in sharing this knowledge and in
leveraging basin level opportunities, however, this will require that the BACs are strengthened.

The thought leadership that potentially emerges from the programme through strengthened
knowledge management is extremely valuable and provides possibilities for working more
synergistically with other programs and initiatives across the continent.

Guideline documents

The importance of CIWA’s own guides and documents must not be underestimated in terms of
supporting the strategic communications and the strengthening of the programs strategic intent, in
that these guidelines provide a richer understanding of the program and its modalities. These
documents have developed organically and have been amended as the program has developed. This
gives the sense that these are still ‘working documents’ and this is exacerbated by some
inconsistencies across these documents.

In addition to improving these documents they also need to be more readily available through the
World Bank website so that stakeholders can access these to enrich their understanding of the
program and its approach.

The improvement of CIWA guidelines and program documents is essential to improve
understanding of the program and its modalities

Gender

The program has made significant improvements regarding the elevation of gender and poverty.
However, there are still some gaps in terms of improved ways of articulating the gender and poverty



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report       35
intent of CIWA. There is a sense that gender and poverty elements are currently under reported within
CIWA. This implies that more support is required at basin level in addressing gender. To this end, a
gender strategy might go a long way in ensuring that that gender reporting and monitoring is
articulated clearly and managed across all levels within CIWA.

Given these challenges, there is a clear need for a gender strategy to guide reporting and monitoring
on gender mainstreaming within CIWA supported interventions.

Strategic planning

There is a sense of some disjuncture between PMU and regional WB staff. Notably, it was reported
that the WB used to have annual strategic planning sessions but these have since ceased occurring. It
was clear that some of the staff working on the project did not have a common understanding of some
aspects of the project. It was suggested, especially by regional/basin WB staff that the reviving such
strategic planning session annually or bi-annually might go a long way in fostering a common position
and understanding within the program at the WB level. This would additionally support the
knowledge exchange that is not currently taking pace as well as it could.

Reintroduction of strategic planning events for World Bank staff supporting CIWA will support
alignment in staff understanding and approach, will foster exchange of experience and will support
a broader programmatic review of actual progress and strategic direction.



Strategic action planning

Recognising that the CIWA program has grown organically, the World Bank has also passed through
some key phases of lesson learning that have enabled the program to develop over time and the World
Bank to improve upon its management of the program. It was generally recognised during the
interviews that in the last 2 years the management of the program has improved considerably. Prior
to this it was noted that limited effort and resources were being applied by the World Bank to the
program.

During these initial phases of the program, it is clear that the trust of the development partners was
broken and as such these partners used the Advisory Committee structure to play a stronger oversight
role. This needs to shift and the World Bank needs to take full account of its fiduciary responsibilities
to manage this program. These issues are further discussed under the program structure, but it is of
significant strategic concern that CIWA regain the trust of its donor partners, that a strategic action
plan be developed that provides a plan for addressing the key strategic actions that will enble the
World Bank to effectively and efficiently run this program. The nature of this action plan is articulated
in the recommendations section of this report.

The development of strategic action plan to address challenges faced by CIWA will importantly
support in regaining the trust of the development partners.



4.1.2. Funding

The CIWA programme is supported by a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) administered by the World
Bank. This trust fund, programmatic in nature, sees funds committed to support CIWA’s broad



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        36
thematic framework, and not specific projects although it is clear that partners do want to support
certain initiatives and so some ‘soft-earmarking’ does take place. Broadly, this allows the programme
more flexibility to deploy funds.

Including existing initiatives, CIWA has an identified the aspirational target of having a pipeline of
projects in excess of US$200 million. The programme initially sought to mobilise this amount over a
10-year period from its inception. However, it has faced challenges in fulfilling this intent, with a
current envelope of approximately US$68 million pledged by its small group of current partners of the
European Commission, Denmark, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. There is
hence a clear and perhaps urgent need, for CIWA to not only source additional funding to suitably
cover its pipeline, but also to expand potential funding streams and reduce reliance on its core existing
partners.

Funding Strategy

When one examines the progress of the programme to date it is clear that the program faces some
challenges that impact upon the financial status and management:

    •    Processes to get projects to implementation take time and in the order of two years. The
         rigour and time applied to these processes does potentially provide a strong basis for the
         project to thereafter kick-off quickly and to rapidly ramp-up the project expenditure,
         however, this does significantly influence program expenditure during those two years of
         getting project approval.
    •    Some 83% of the program is being managed by the RBOs and as such CIWA is in the hands of
         the RBOs to ensure ongoing project progress and expenditure.
    •    To date, of the US$ 61,672,637 that has been allocated, an amount of US$ 11,322,668 has
         been dispersed.
    •    There is not the strategic clarity as to whether CIWA continues beyond 2020.


In reviewing the program financials (Figure 15, below), it is observed that funds dispersed are
approximately 17% of the current funding envelope. Whilst this is considered to be low for this mid-
term juncture, it is important to note that CIWA has spent extensive time getting an impressive suite
of projects ready for implementation. We can therefore expect disbursements to increase
considerably during the second half of the program.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        37
Figure 15: Allocated and disbursed funds

Nonetheless, it seems that the aspirational target of US$200 million will not be required for the
program to deliver on its existing suite of projects and any possible new projects, noting the time
frames required to get projects prepared and approved for implementation.

A key question then becomes the time-frames for CIWA and whether there will be continuation of the
program beyond 2020. During the October 2015 Advisory Committee meeting this was discussed and
it was in principal agreed that the program should carry on beyond 2020.

It is therefore imperative that CIWA’s approach to fund raising be strengthened.

The strengthening of the fund raising approach must be based around three key pillars, namely:

    •    There is a need for a dedicated fund raiser so that there is a structured engagement with
         potential donors
    •    A funding strategy needs to be developed that looks to other conventional and possible non-
         conventional donors, and provides an ongoing approach to funding for the program as it
         develops
    •    There is a need to diversify the funding base for CIWA so that there is not an over reliance on
         the existing donors


A brief review of possible other funders/ funding opportunities is included in Appendix 4. This review
has been based upon desktop research and is only indicative.



4.1.3 Capacity

In terms of capacity, there are multi-faceted issues and concerns that were raised and require redress.
Capacity issues relate to both World Bank (PMU and regional) as well as capacity challenges for CIWA
recipients. For the CIWA donors, there is a need to have a clear indication on the preferred modality
for capacity addressing capacity issues (hiring staff vs consultants). For the donors, staffing within



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        38
CIWA seems to be of significant concern, especially given the number of dedicated resources in
comparison to the size of the program. For the PMU, there is a concern that the 6% cap restricts
CIWA’s manoeuvrability regarding staffing. Some of the pertinent capacity issues are outlined below.

WB/CIWA staff over-stretched

Concerns have been raised about the lack of capacity of Bank staff to attend to CIWA project issues.
This applies at both PMU and regional/basin levels. PMU staff are stretched in providing program
support and administrative function whereas TTLs are also over-stretched and working on different
projects. To mitigate this challenge, it was suggested during the interviews that there is a need for the
Bank to add a few more full-time resources/staff to work on CIWA. However, the counter-argument
proffered by PMU was that having additional dedicated staff to CIWA would mean that staff would
not be fully occupied. Other inputs noted that if the Bank appointed a few permanent CIWA staff this
would indicate that the Bank is indeed taking this programme seriously. It is noted that the current
structure with staff having operational portfolios for the bank results in these operational teams
having relationships in the basins as well as having the strategic vision for needs in the basin. This is
a major advantage of CIWA and does support the opportunity to coordinate with other initiatives.
This does need to be balanced with dedicated staff who can help accelerate CIWA projects.

This is not to say that the staff working under the CIWA banner are not doing a good job and the
interviews reflected a recognition of the value of the program and the hard work of the staff. So for
example, there has been remarkable involvement and interaction between/among the CIWA team
and TTLs of the WB with other stakeholders in the Nile Basin (see NBD). It was reported that the NBD
staff are in constant liaison with CIWA & the TTL regarding project activities through skype “…what I
like with CIWA, is their involvement. A representative from the WB/CIWA supervises project
activities”. In this instance, CIWA is providing sufficient support when called upon. A number of other
examples have been provided during the interviews of staff being committed and working long hours
to provide support.

A resource and capacity strategy is urgently required to guide and strengthen the program.



Although the Table 12 provides some useful information regarding staffing, it is difficult to make a full
assessment of staffing needs without doing a full analysis of staff, their job profiles and the range of
projects that they are required to work upon. The intention is not to undergo a job analysis process.
However, there are areas of the program that do require a fuller effort to redress challenges that are
being faced and an analysis of staffing will be important. It is noted that the World Bank undertaking
a restructuring process, but this has not been engaged through the MTR. The table below illustrates
the CIWA staffing levels as of June 30, 2015.

The way the World Bank works enables staff to work across projects.

As illustrated in Table 12, the program only has 4.5 full time staff (FTS). For a program this size, FTS
compliment of 4.5 persons is considerably low. The program management need to seriously consider
additional FTS resources given that staff at PMU and regional/basin level are already over-stretched.

Retaining institutional memory

The need to augment staffing capacity cannot be over-stated. Noting the current re-structuring within
the Bank, there are concerns about the program’s institutional memory. This is particularly important
given how institutional relationships help CIWA to deliver, based on the trust build over years. Hence,
there is real fear that the on-going shuffling of Bank staff might have a negative effect in terms of
disturbing the operational experience, connectivity, and institutional memory that the TTLs and others
have built over the years. Importantly, the Bank also recognised that although it has institutional
enablers, there is no surplus, hence, the need to consider staffing models that create that surplus. The
surplus model entail focusing long term CIWA money into staff that operate at the basin that will make
the delivery of work more practical. However, such surplus cannot be achieved using the Bank’s
current staffing model. An appropriate and responsive staffing model is required urgently to augment
the current capacity constraints. An appropriate model will address some of the following staffing
issues:

        •    Dedicated specialist staff needed to service key areas such as gender mainstreaming and
             monitoring and evaluation across the full program, at both program level and basin level;
        •    Dedicated staff/resources for coordinated fundraising for CIWA;
        •    Dedicated staff to support the ongoing administration of the program and improvement of
             the key strategic and operational documents; and




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                Final Report               40
    •    Dedicated CIWA staff in the regions to assist the TTLs, the RBOs and RECs to keep processes
         moving and to assist in building capacity in regional institutions.

The additional support will be critical in assisting the projects and to redress the monitoring of their
performance. To this end, a resource and capacity strategic action plan is urgently required. Such a
plan will assist in detailing resource mobilization, augmenting Basin and PMU Staffing, strengthening
strategic communications, and strengthening knowledge management.

Although the WB/CIWA has institutional enablers, the program needs to consider staffing models
that create capacity to aid delivery.

Capacity issues of recipients RECs/RBOs

The capacity at basin and regional level in the recipient RBO’s and RECs is important in order to take
approved regionally executed projects through to implementation. However, capacity at basin level
is equally stretched and under-resourced to support and unlock processes, as well as support
monitoring and reporting. It has been noted that CIWA faces challenges in the sense that funds have
been committed and but are not being dispersed, and this can be translated as the difficulties relating
to management in transboundary contexts and/or capacity within those regions to keep processes
moving. The TTLs do play an important role in providing this support, but the TTLs are also stretched.
The MTR has often reflected that the true beneficiaries of the CIWA support is the RBOs through their
strengthening and so increased efforts to develop capacity in the basins would only be welcomed by
the RBOs.

Strengthen knowledge management

There is a sense that the program does not currently have adequate arrangements for capturing the
richness of the information and knowledge at basin level. Hence, there is needs to capture the
program’s rich experience from basin scale to program level.

Knowledge management systems need to be improved in order to capture the rich experience
developed at project level.



4.1.4 Processes

Approval processes

Through the interviews a number of comments were received about the length of time that it takes
to obtain the necessary project approvals. Granted, these approval processes are indeed long,
however, it is not a design fault of the program, but does appear to be the nature of these type of
long-term intervention. There is recognition of the complexity of transboundary basin management
and that the approval processes at RBO level can be time consuming. Without undertaking any
specific or detailed analysis, the MTR team recognises that within the transboundary basin that the
RBO Council and /or a Technical Task Team may only meet twice a year, and as a result getting project
concepts agreed upon can take time.

However, there is recognition that the CIWA/World Bank processes are also time consuming. Yet
there is equally a firm thematic that underlines the strength of the CIWA program as being the rigour
of the World Bank systems that provide surety for the various donor partners. The divide in these



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        41
comments is then between the recipients of support, who potentially would like to see funds flowing
as quickly as possible, and the funders/managers, who despite wanting the funds to flow want the
rigour in approval to ensure that funds are directed and managed appropriately. There is; therefore,
a need to articulate the processes clearly and where possible, investigate how these can be
streamlined. It is envisaged that if and when the steps and processes is communicated clearly, there
are significant gains to be realised in terms of efficiency.

There is need to articulate the CIWA processes clearly to enable focused responsiveness by
recipients.



Additional layer of bureaucracy

Associated with the comment above, there was some comment that the additional layer of
bureaucracy introduced by CIWA is unnecessary and potentially a duplication of the WB procedures
and this then results in protracted approval times. Figure 16 does reflect that on average it does take
in the order of two years to take a project from Project Concept Note through to project effectiveness.
The review has not examined the length of time that it takes from the initial discussions through to
Justification Note and preparation of the CSP, and the Project Concept Note, however, it is assumed
that this would take in the order of a year. Notably, it is recognised that this length of time is not just
due to the CIWA team, but does involve the necessary basin processes. In effect, this additional layer
of bureaucracy, which is effectively the engagement of AC in this process and the development of the
Justification Note and the CSP, is questioned when the existing World Bank systems are understood
to be so rigorous.




Figure 16: Preparation time for RE grants (CIWA, 2015)

There is clearly a sense that the additional layer of bureaucracy is a result of earlier phases of the
program where the management of the program was not as strong as it should have been. The
management of the program has been strengthened in recent years and hence it has been noted in



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report        42
this MTR that the role of the AC should shift and the accountability for the program be more firmly
placed on the WB. With this shift it may be possible to look at streamlining these processes where
possible. At the same time there is recognition that projects in transboundary contexts take extensive
time to initiate and take to implementation. These concerns may also be ameliorated by a stronger
and clearly planned out project pipeline.

While the AC needs to step back from transaction advisory oversight, the WB/CIWA needs to step
up in terms of operational performance to calm the concerns of the AC.



Communicating systems and processes

It has been noted that the newer projects seem to struggle and reflect frustration with the processes
in order to obtain approval. It does seem that these processes could be better described and captured
in a brief and pragmatic document so that those newer basins and projects fully understand the
processes and the time frames associated with these.

4.1.5 Disbursement and delivery issues

It is widely acknowledged that the capacity issues within RBOs is holding WB/CIWA hostage. This is
despite the fact that CIWA is held accountable for program and project performance. Hence, it is
critical to note from the outset that the process for approval will influence ability of the program to
deliver. For recipient executed projects, the rate of disbursements is dependent on the efficacy of the
RBO capacity and responsiveness thereby impacting CIWAs ability to influence progress. It is therefore
not surprising that disbursement levels are low at this stage and requires redress.

Despite these challenges, it is widely acknowledged across basins that CIWA has put in place
frameworks, procurement process and financial reporting support systems that assist in providing
transparency and accountability at REC/RBO and project level (ZMC1; NBD). However, there is still
need for clearly communicating the processes to improve efficiency across the program. Given these
challenges, CIWA is unlikely to attain PDO targets of funds directly mobilised and people directly
benefitting.

Although disbursements have significantly improved in the current FY, the lack of capacity and
efficacy by RBOs has tended to slow disbursements.



4.1.6 Risk management

Risks are identified and managed both at program and basin levels. At the program and basin level
these risks are categorised into the risk areas captured in Table 13.

The risk management framework for the program does need to be included in the Operational
Guideline articulating the reporting requirements. At program level, the existing framework is
appropriate and could possibly be strengthened by including a risk area regarding the monitoring and
evaluation of program delivery and impact. At the basin level, there is a need to improve upon the
Systematic Operations Risk-rating Tool in order to reflect upon how risks are being managed.

In discussing the risk management of CIWA during the interviews it was reflected that CIWA is good
at identifying risks, as this is an integral part of the project identification, project preparation and
ultimately the selection under the basin sub-program. In fact risk is articulated in the Justification
Note, the Project Concept Note, and the Project Appraisal Document. Clearly the Project Appraisal
Documents do reflect risk and the mitigation of these risks in some detail and this mirrors the fact that
projects in transboundary contexts are inherently risky. However, during the interviews it was noted
that the program is not so effective in managing these risks (CHOM1; DNF). This insight may have
differing dimensions namely that actions are not taken to mitigate risks or that there is not effective
reporting on risk management. It was difficult in this review to effectively assess whether actions are
being taken to mitigate risks, and it is conceivable that this varies from basin to basin, but it was
possible to assess the degree of reporting as an indicator of the management of risk.

The program level risk analysis is presented in the CIWA Proposal for Development Partners March
2014 and then as Annex 4 of the 2014 Annual Report. The 2014 Annual Report rightly notes that the
program level risk whilst informed by the basin and project specific risk analyses, does not reflect the
detail of these basin and project risks and mitigation actions. There are clear linkages in structure
between the different levels of analyses and similar themes flow through the two levels of analyses
albeit using slightly different terminology. This risk framework and the program approach to risk
management is not described in the Operational Guidelines as it needs to be. For a program of this
nature and magnitude it is necessary that there is a well-structured risk framework supported by an
appropriate and thorough reporting system. Whilst there is some level of reporting on programmatic
risks in Annex 4, it is not sufficient and it is suggested that risks against this framework be improved
and incorporated into the body of the Annual Report as a key element of the report.

The existing risk framework needs to be strengthened by including an appropriate and thorough
reporting system.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                   Final Report      44
From the review of documentation, the existing risk framework at the program level does cover the
most important risk areas. Some concerns have been raised through the MTR as to whether there is
sufficient detailed monitoring and reporting at the basin level. This is potentially symptomatic of
capacity at the basin level (within the Bank or the RBO) which is considered in the risk framework.
However, noting the considerable concern regarding the appropriateness of the Results Framework it
is worthwhile considering introducing a risk area related to this and the monitoring and evaluation of
program. Linked to the earlier discussions in this MTR, the mitigation actions for the sustainability risk
area should include the development of broader strategic intent for the program linked to the array
of other continental and regional initiatives.

At the basin level, the risk analyses are structured around project stakeholder risk, implementing
agency risk and project risk, with this all being summed up by an overall implementation risk, as noted
above. These risk areas are not consistent and uses some slightly different risk areas which may prove
problematic in providing a rating at approval in the Implementation Status and Results Report.

In addition, the purpose of the Systematic Operations Risk-rating Tool is to reflect the management
of risks at the basin level. None of these reports reviewed reflected rating at approval and only some
had captured some more detailed discussion on the risk status beyond the status rating. It is
understood that this risk tool is part of the World Bank system and beyond the control of CIWA, it is
also recognised that this tool in itself is relatively new, but the detail of reporting on what is, or is not
being done to manage risks could be improved.



4.2. Programme Management

4.2.1. Structure

Program management structure

The management and governance of the program takes place at two levels namely at program level,
focused on strategy and activities across the program, and at basin level with the focus upon the
detailed activities within a basin program. At the program level structures include the Consultative
Group, the Advisory Committee and the Project Management Unit (See Figure 2).



These structures provide a balance between strategic support and guidance on the positioning and
intent of the program (Consultative Group), the strategic content of the program to meet the
programs objectives (Advisory Committee) and the provision of technical input, oversight, quality
assurance and day-to-day management and administration of the program (PMU). During the
interviews the comments reflected a recognition of the value-add of this structure with a balance
between strategic guidance and fiduciary responsibility. There was some comment that the roles and
responsibilities require clarification. A review of the Operational Guide does indicate that the
membership, roles and responsibilities are well articulated. The modalities of these structures may
need reconsidering based upon experience as well as observations from the MTR.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme       Final Report         45
Strengthening strategic partner engagements

There is an important and critical role in engaging with key strategic partners at both the global and
continental levels. This does provide strategic guidance and will support the development of a
strategic understanding of how the various programs that support water resource management,
climate resilience, and sustainable development all work in concert.

In this regard, the value add of external CG is recognised. There are some questions regarding
representivity on the CG and how this could be expanded to be a little more inclusive, especially of
organisations that provide meaningful opportunities to link in with other programs and initiatives.
This will support strategic coordination. From minutes and discussion documents it does appear that
there are some challenges in consistency of attendance. This issue is challenging but a more
formalised CG will only strengthen the strategic guidance that CIWA gains, but also powerfully unlocks
a broader strategic coordination between programs. It is the considered view of the MTR that the CG
is not as strong as needed. If it is to continue, there is need to strengthen the CG. However, if it cannot
be strengthened, then it is better to disband/discontinue the CG and to utilise other platforms and
events (ie African Water Week) to obtain the strategic guidance needed.

It is also noted that the strategic engagement at basin level should be strengthened, aligned to
Intermediate Result Area 4, where the program has not yet yielded all that it could.

The CG is not as strong and effective as needed, and requires strengthening. Failing that, the CG
should be disbanded while ensuring that the strengthening of engagement happens at the basin
level through the Basin Advisory Committee. Alternatives for more continental level engagements
should be sought.



Advisory Committee

It is clear from the MTR that there are varied opinions about the AC in terms of structure and mandate
in strengthening CIWA. Some of these views may be perception, but nonetheless perceptions need
to be managed. From one perspective, there is the perception that there is a tendency for the AC or
its members to be too involved in the “management” of projects. The sense from the donors in this
regard is that they do need to be able to justify expenditure and do as a result have some specific
requirements in terms of information in order to support their own reporting requirements.

The review of the Operational Guideline with regards to the role of the AC reflects that these roles
are:

    •    Review of CIWA program strategy in order to provide guidance on the overall content and
         direction of the program and ensure the use of Trust Fund resources to meet the objectives
         of the program;

    •    Review of “Justification Notes” to assist with the decision for CIWA to begin sustained
         engagement in a prospective basin;

    •    Review of “Project Concept Notes” to assist with the decision for CIWA to allocate funding for
         specific projects in basins where CIWA has sustained engagement;

    •    Review of CIWA Support Plans as part of relevant Basin Advisory Committees in order to
         provide guidance on the content and direction of the program in basins where CIWA has


Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report        46
         sustained engagement (this applies to basins where AC members have a particular interest,
         experience, or expertise; AC members are not expected to review all CSPs in detail);

    •    Provide feedback on planned and on-going projects to help ensure alignment with basin
         strategies and target results as well as with overall program strategy and target results;

    •    Review overall program implementation progress, financial management, and administration;

    •    Review of CIWA funding needs and promotion of participation of new donors to close funding
         gaps and support new program components;

    •    Encourage donor harmonization, either through the MDTF or bilaterally, for potential
         investments;

    •    Meet annually and if needed, consider a semi-annual meeting, virtually or in-person.



These roles are strategic in nature and appear to be focused upon providing guidance, structured
support and ultimately oversight. However, the structuring of the basin engagement process does
reflect a revised role of endorsement.

To the MTR team there does appear to be a governance mismatch in terms of this revised role of
‘’endorsement’’ which potentially undermines the ability of CIWA to take full accountability for the
program and then to deliver, monitor and report. Equally this places the AC in a position of not being
able to hold CIWA fully accountable as they are compliant in the decision making process and the
allocation of budget.

It would therefore strengthen the program for the AC to play its strategic role of guidance and
structured advisory support balanced with a firm oversight of the program. This will place a stricter
burden on the World Bank to deliver, monitor and report. With this in mind the AC could hold one
meeting per year to review progress and evaluate the Annual Report and then to provide strategic
direction for the year ahead.

The AC needs to play a strategic role of guidance, structured advisory support, and oversight whilst
the WB needs to be more accountable for operational and performance issues.



Basin Advisory Committee (BAC)

The BAC plays an important role at the basin and project levels and the flexibility to build upon existing
structures is appreciated in order to avoid duplication of structures. It has been noted that the lessons
learned at the basin and project level are not being captured and shared as effectively as they should
be. The BAC needs to be strengthened to enable more engagement and coordination at the basin
level and to support an improved knowledge management approach within the program.

Strengthening Basin Advisory Committees for improved knowledge management is a key aspect of
strengthening CIWA.

4.3. Improving Monitoring
The need to report on progress is a key part of any program, but beyond that the reporting process
becomes an important vehicle for transferring knowledge. Whilst CIWA has gone through an intensive
start-up phase there is only limited access to the knowledge and experience that has been generated
to date. This generally needs to be improved and the knowledge that the program has garnered over
the last few years would not only be useful to other transboundary situations, but would also further
assist in strategically placing this program.

4.3.1 Basin scale results framework

It is widely acknowledged that every basin is unique, hence, the indicators in the results framework
are adaptable to address the needs of each basin. There is a general sense of satisfaction with the
design of the results framework at basin level, with some modifications to suit context and purpose.
A number of interviews at basin level underscored this although the newer projects were less inclined
to comment on the results frameworks as these have not had the opportunity to be tried and tested.
It is noted that the real richness in terms of impact and the generation of lessons for future projects
and initiatives lies within the projects at basin level and so having appropriate results frameworks at
the project scale is critical for the program as a whole.

Noting this it is observed that there are some weaknesses within the existing results frameworks that
require redress at this juncture, so as to ensure that the impact of these projects can be assessed at a
later stage upon completion of the project. This will be essential for the program to be able to assess
impact at a later stage. These weaknesses include:

    •    There are, in some instances, no clear “theory of change” that articulates the intended
         impacts that the projects intend to have.
    •    Most of the indicators are not reflecting outcomes, but are more process oriented. So for
         example, with regards to the development of a charter the indicators over the years reflect
         whether is completed as opposed the fact that the charter clarifies roles and responsibilities,
         creates alignment, and strengthens governance and so forth.
    •    Many indicators are quantitative and misses the richness of qualitative indicators needed for
         strengthening of cooperation and development and climate resilience.
    •    From our limited view of internal WB systems there is very useful detail within these systems
         that underpins the targets for the results frameworks that would enrich understanding of
         progress.
    •    Attribution with regards to a number of indicators appears to be problematic and where the
         project is trying to capture results through its influence, this can only be done through
         contribution analysis, however, the indicators don't speak to tracking this kind of information.
    •    There are not always documented assumptions which is a critical part of being able to
         interpret results and track performance.

Having noted the above the MTR team are under no mis-conceptions that the development of these
results frameworks is easy and in fact clearly recognises that there are some real difficulties in
designing appropriate results frameworks that are appropriate to international waters and have a




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        48
blend of qualitative and quantitative indicators. However, in order to be able to reflect impact at the
next program review in five years, these results frameworks will need to be improved.

Therefore, it will be essential to strengthen the results frameworks at basin level.

In order to improve upon the results frameworks at basin level the following needs to happen.

    •    Basin level workshops need to be held to develop and agree upon a theory of change for each
         project.
    •    With the theory of change developed, results chains need to be developed so at reflect the
         connectivity between activities, outputs, outcomes and impact.
    •    These results chains should provide a mixture of short term and longer term interventions.
    •    Baselines need to be developed that are appropriate and linked to the actual contextual
         baseline within the basin ie not a baseline linked to CIWA processes.
    •    These need to be developed in partnership with the key stakeholders so as to create
         ownership and develop capacity for future monitoring.
    •    The engagement of a gender specialist at these basin level workshops will assist in tackling
         the challenges that the projects are having in addressing and reporting upon gender
         dimensions.

Basin level workshops to develop a theory of change and improved results frameworks for projects
is critical to program success.



4.3.2 Basin scale M&E

The real richness of the program is at project level within the basins and as such the monitoring at this
level is important for the program as a whole as well as providing a rich source of lessons for other
projects and programs. The MTR generally would have liked to have seen more information and data
available from the monitoring and reporting at this scale. However, it is noted that the reporting
should not be onerous but rather efficient and effective. It is also noted that with a program of this
nature that there are very definitely political sensitivities and nuances in processes that CIWA engages
that could be hampered or even scuttled as a result of reporting.

Project reporting

Reporting is done every 6 months through the Implementation Status Results (ISR) reports. While
these reports provide an indication of what has been achieved, there is a sense that: a) there isn’t
sufficient qualitative reporting against indicators; and b) that it is not always clear how the various
interventions have resulted in the numbers that have been determined. These ISR Reports are a
requirement of the WB and indeed provide a useful snapshot and quantitative review of progress.
However, there are limited qualitative assessments and it is through these assessments that the detail
of process and progress emerges. It is clear that some of these reports are better than others and also
that certain projects have only been initiated more recently, however, this reporting does require
improvement.



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        49
There is a need to strengthen the reporting at project scale within the basins and that provides more
detail as to process, progress and response.

Basin support plans

It was clear that not all WB staff were aligned in terms of understanding the nature and role of the
CIWA Basin Support Plan. This tool is key in providing a bridge between the local stakeholders, the
RBOs and the WB. Yet this uncertainty exists and this is an opportunity lost. Therefore, there is a
need to strengthen these reports to really reflect the theory of change at basin level and to become a
vehicle for structuring the lessons and knowledge that emerge through the project.

The CIWA Basin Support Plans need to be reformulated and revised to reflect the basin theory of
change and to provide a hub for the knowledge management within basin.

RBO reporting

There is a need for a little more detailed reporting at the basin level and this needs to be led by the
RBOs. Noting that the WB systems are structured in a particular manner, this could be undertaken as
a separate progress report. This could create improved ownership, and provides the opportunity to
report on progress, risks and value for money in a more detailed manner.

The role of RBOs in the reporting at basin level needs to be strengthened and this could be
undertaken through a reporting mechanism apart from the World Bank systems.

Value for Money

Whilst the FY14 and FY15 Annual Reports did reflect on VFM at a programmatic level, there is a need
to assess this at project/basin level where it will be more important to track progress. It is noted that
many projects are only now being initiated, and so there is limited to no data available that can be
used to reflect current progress. In order to support the developmental evaluation for the projects a
suite of indicators and baselines will need to be developed for each project/basin. The ICF indicators
whilst sometimes difficult to utilise do provide a meaningful first port of call for each basin. This will
require capacity building support to assist the basins in undertaking this monitoring and the MTR
would expect that the RBOs must take this on board as a key element of reporting

The VFM reporting needs to be taken to basin level and the RBOs as executors of the projects need
to track and report on this.

Developmental evaluation

Due to the magnitude and regional significance of the CIWA project, we recommend that the initiative
takes on an “on-going evaluation” methodology using a learning-oriented approach to obtain timely
information to help inform design/ development and support implementation.

The selection of Developmental Evaluation (DE) for CIWA can support the ongoing development of
the intervention within the current context it operates in. Evaluation findings resulting from the use
of such an approach can strengthen programs that are modelled to adjust and adapt to the realities
and complexities within development settings in a less reductionist manner.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme     Final Report        50
A DE approach will respond to the unpredictability, uncertainty and complications within this complex
implementation context, aiding those submerged in these settings to employ a systemic process to
develop projects. Developmental evaluation operates with the assumption that the changing
dimensions of projects are necessary to accommodate a changing external environment and is
therefore structured to allow for this change.

Developmental evaluation begins from a premise that evaluation should attend to the
utility/information needs of program personnel and stakeholders engaged in the development and
implementation of the project. It recognises the value of involving stakeholders in the evaluation
processes. As such, the approach focuses on principles of engagement for evaluating complex
dynamic systems.

Within basins the uses of a Developmental Evaluation approach will strengthen the evaluation of
impact and will create a shared sense of ownership across the project.



4.3.3 Program results framework

The program results framework was designed and an active monitoring and evaluation process was
established at the outset of the program to provide an ongoing measure of the effectiveness of the
work and to provide accurate and timely feedback to the contributors of the multi-donor trust fund.

The CIWA results framework is organised as a hierarchy of impacts, objectives (Program Development
Objectives) and results (Intermediate Results). Noting the complexity and diversity of projects, the
development of a results frameworks for a program of this nature is extremely challenging. This is
completely understood by the MTR, the development partners and indeed by the specialists that
typically work in the M&E arena.

However, the ongoing concerns regarding the results framework at program level remain and the MTR
shares some of these concerns. These are reflected upon in terms of structure, indicators and targets.



Structure

There is at this point no theory of change (TOC) in place to support the results framework at program
level. The MTR team does not want to be orthodox in suggesting the need for a strict TOC, but in the
absence of one, the program is vulnerable in being able to provide a sense of the strategic intent, how
this aims to be reached, and periodically testing the assumptions implicit in this strategic intent.

If we remain with the suggested matrix of results that draws on intermediate outcomes (x axis) and
basin level outcomes (y axes) the TOC becomes essential. The TOC is equally important for assessing
the value/importance of new undertakings in both the basin and the catalytic sub-programs.

There are clearly difficulties in aggregating up results from the basin to program level, when we are
dealing with diverse projects that are demand-driven. In addition, the reporting is not reflecting how
the confluence of activities is happening at the basin levels under the intermediate results areas. The



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        51
development of improved results chains at basin level will support in redressing this issue. Similarly,
there are challenges in the connectivity between the intermediate results areas and the program
development objectives.

Some assumptions are provided in the description of the IRs i.e. (IR 2, 3 & 4) and the program needs
to have a more complete set of assumptions that we can use to understand all our indicators, both at
program and basin levels. These assumptions need to be regularly tested so that we can be more
responsive to emerging requirements of the program.

The development of a theory of change for the program together with a more complete suite of
assumptions will be critical to be able to assess impact.

There has been some discussion during the course of the MTR as to the possibility of having different
results frameworks for differing funding envelopes. This would in effect enable the program to shift
its objectives and targets with increased funding. The MTR believes that should CIWA strengthen and
clarify its strategic intent (connected with the theory of change) then this would not be necessary. It
is also noted as being slightly problematic in the sense that the program could just shift out objectives
and targets when the program is attaining these. The development of a clear strategic intent becomes
imperative for this program.

The development of a clear strategic intent for the program will nullify the need for differing results
frameworks to match differing funding envelopes.

Indicators

There is currently no indicator for impact and so assessing impact will be difficult. This can be
developed once there is clarity as to the program’s strategic intent and theory of change.

As noted with the basin results frameworks most of the indicators are not reflecting outcomes but are
more process oriented. Furthermore, the indicators are largely quantitative in nature and miss the
richness of qualitative indicators needed for strengthening of cooperation and development and
climate resilience.

In addition, there are indicators that are not appropriate for the program noting its upstream nature.
These do require redress if the program is to be able to reflect its impact. These being:

    •    PDO Indicator (i): US$ financing mobilized for cooperative management and development of
         international waters resources projects supported by CIWA
    •    PDO Indicator (ii): Number of people directly benefiting from improved water resources
         management and development in target basins through projects supported by CIWA


Indicator (i) uses the word ‘’mobilised’’ which is in effect beyond the scope of CIWA which has little
ability to ensure that funds are mobilised and is in effect an inappropriate indicator. At best CIWA can
influence or leverage. This must be adjusted.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        52
Indicator (ii) uses the term “directly” with regard to benefit from improved water resource
management and development. In some instances this can be quite problematic due to CIWA’s
upstream nature and so this must be redressed.

In addition there are clearly challenges regarding beneficiaries and how to attribute benefit. The use
of basin population statistics is problematic and in addition if we are talking about multi-use initiatives
there can be real challenges in attributing benefits from energy, irrigation and water supply and so
forth. Noting that some initiatives will have broader socio-economics benefits (e.g. hydropower has
benefits to industry as well as civil society) and others will impact upon more localised livelihoods (e.g.
access to irrigation) it is useful to consider rewording this indicator to cover these aspects of broader
economic development and possibly more localised social development.

Suggested amendments to these indicators are:

    •     PDO Indicator (i): US$ financing influenced for cooperative management and development of
          international waters resources projects supported by CIWA.
    •     PDO Indicator (ii): Number of people benefiting from water resource development and
          number of livelihoods improved through strengthened water resources management in target
          basins through projects supported by CIWA.

The indicators for the Program Development Objectives need to be reworded to truly reflect the
nature of the program.

Targets

Reflection on the targets for the program link to the nature of the program and to the current
performance. Whilst it is not appropriate to adjust targets to meet underperformance it is fair to
redress targets that appear to be unreasonable or overly ambitious. There are a number of targets
that require redress and if not addressed will create problems in assessing performance:

There are a number of challenges with regards to the suite of existing targets that must be
redressed.

The following matter require attention.

    •     The results framework does not have targets for FY 17-19 and these need to be developed.

    •     Targets for PDO indicator (i) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that it
          has limited to no influence on direct mobilisation of funds. In addition the target for FY16
          notes ‘’potential’’ projects whilst the targets for FY20 is “mobilised’’. The target of US$10
          billion mobilised is not appropriate and likely not attainable. The suggestion is to remain with
          “potential” projects which reflects the Banks ability to leverage and influence projects with a
          2020 target of US$15 billion.

    •     Targets for PDO indicator (ii) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that it
          has limited influence on direct beneficiaries and hence the use of the word ‘potential’. In
          addition the assumption is that the beneficiaries are all those living within the basin which



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report        53
         really could be tested. The leap from 15 million potential beneficiaries to 50 million direct
         beneficiaries between FY 16 and FY20 is unrealistic, noting at the mid-term the achievement
         has been 5.6 million direct beneficiaries and the projects that are currently online. The targets
         for potential direct beneficiaries is also unrealistic in that the achievement in FY 15 is about
         four-fold. At this juncture, it would be more prudent, noting the suggested amendments to
         the indicator, to revisit the assumptions for this indicator, and after the basin workshops to
         develop theories of change to develop a more realistic suite of targets for broader economic
         development and more localised social development.

    •    The targets for the intermediate results areas appear reasonable and achievable. There are
         questions regarding the assumptions that underpin these targets and these need to be re-
         assessed.

    •    The baselines for all targets are reflected as zero, linked to CIWAs initiatives. This the MTR
         finds problematic as it really undermines the actual existing capacity within basin.

The PDO targets need adjustment whilst the assumptions that underpin the targets for the
intermediate results areas require strengthening.

4.3.4 Programmatic M&E

The overall programmatic approach to monitoring and reporting is not currently documented within
any of the guideline documents and this needs to be captured in the operational guidelines. This then
should provide a clear framework for the reporting and effectively the knowledge management for
the program. The Annual Reports in the last two years have been significantly large steps forward for
CIWA with these reports providing the necessary amount of information and being accessible.
However, as noted above, the rich experiences and findings within the basins is being lost and needs
to be reported upon.

In this regard the strengthening of the Basin Advisory Committees will also be a key step forward in
supporting the basins in reporting and in ensuring that this knowledge is not lost.

The monitoring and reporting framework needs to provide the basis for the programs knowledge
management and needs be documented in the operational guideline.

5. Findings and Recommendations
The CIWA program has develop organically in the last four years and now has a portfolio of projects
that are strongly focused on the development of the information and institutions that are critical to
support and guide development, as well as those projects that focus on the infrastructural
development that can support socio-economic development and improved climate resilience.

The programme is at a juncture where it is appropriate to undertake a mid-term review (MTR) that is
backward looking, to understand the emergent lessons, and is also forward thinking towards shaping
the programme to be able to upscale to meet the growing requests for support. The aspirational
targets that have been set for the program are ambitious, but with the support that the World Bank
is obtaining from its development partners and from the key stakeholders in the basins, with the suite
of projects that are coming online and are moving towards implementation, as well as with the lessons
learned by the program to date, it does appear to this MTR team that the program is well placed to
now upscale disbursements through the projects that are set for implementation.

However, as with all programs there are areas where there is room from improvement. The MTR has
reflected upon the program with the lenses of how the program is:

•    Appropriate to reach its objectives;
•    Relevant;
•    Functionally effective and efficient; and
•    Progressing towards targets.


The TOR of the MTR does indicate that for the stage at which the program finds itself, with many of
the projects now only just going into implementation, that this MTR should not be a complete
evaluation of progress. Such an analysis would possibly be counterproductive at this stage. The MTR
has, therefore, been a relatively light-touch review to assess whether there are strengths that need to
be built upon and maximised, and whether there are weaknesses that need addressing. In order to
do this, this MTR has revolved around documentation review in conjunction with a series of interviews
of World Bank staff working on the program, recipients in the form of RBOs and RECs as well as a
number of stakeholders.

The MTR has captured much of the discussion and debate regarding the CIWA program in a draft
discussion document that was presented to the PMU and AC. During the AC workshop on the 29-30
September 2015 the findings were discussed. This report is then a synthesis of the MTR findings with
the inputs from that workshop.

It is noted that the next review, in five years, should be a more intensive evaluation with thorough
evaluations at project levels within a number of the basins.

The findings and recommendations of the MTR are provided below. The recommendation are
summarised in a more easily digestible format in Appendix 5 in order to support submission to the
World Bank Board for consideration. In order to assist the program to address some of the
recommendations, which are important to prepare the program for more effective monitoring as a
basis for the future evaluation, a high level action plan is presented in Appendix 6.

5.1 Building upon CIWAs achievements
CIWA’s intended impact is to strengthen sustainable climate-resilient growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Towards this aim the program seeks to support riparian governments to unlock the potential for
sustainable and climate resilient growth by addressing the constraints to cooperative management
and development of international waters. Regional water policies across the continent recognize the
importance of transboundary water resource management and development17 CIWA’s focus on
water-related growth does reflect the desire of riparian governments engaged in cooperative
management to accelerate water resources development in support of economic growth and poverty
reduction.

The program development objective is to strengthen cooperative management and development of
international waters in Sub-Saharan Africa to facilitate sustainable climate resilient grow.

Continental Context and Relevance

Africa’s development agenda is inherently regional and is strongly linked to water which exists within
a significant number of transboundary basins across the continent. Regional water policies around
the continent recognise the importance of transboundary water resource management and the need
to support RBOs as the central actors in these basins. In reflecting on the relevance of the program it
is noted that:

•     The program’s distribution of projects around the continent is well balanced;
•     The program supports projects regarding the strengthening of information, institutions and
      infrastructure as key elements of the water security needed to support socio-economic growth18
•     Transboundary water resource management is understood as a key challenge that will underpin
      future development and this is reflected in regional policy;
•     Climate resilience is very relevant with Africa being possibly one of the most vulnerable regions
      of the world;
•     The CIWA program is taking on the difficult projects19 in these contexts, as guided by and in
      partnership with key basin actors;
•     The focus on existing initiatives as a tool to influence other fund mobilisation looks to support
      the development of longer term sustainability which is typically a challenge across the continent.

All the interviews with recipients of CIWA support and the various development partners (both
existing funders of the program and those not currently funding) agreed that the program is highly
relevant.

1.    The MTR finds that the CIWA program is relevant and with the current suite of projects has a
      good geographic spread for potential impact.

Comparative advantage

In thinking through the notion of fit for purpose the MTR found that the heart of the question for
consideration by the World Bank and the development partners was as to whether the vehicle was
appropriate to reach the objectives. In effect, why should a development partner utilise the CIWA
program to influence transboundary water resource management as opposed to doing this
themselves.

The responses regarding the comparative advantage of the World Bank systems, the experience of
the World Bank through the connectivity to the Global Practice, the geographic presence of World
Bank staff across the continent, and the benefit that is accrued through a pooled multi-donor trust
fund were all clearly voiced. This is further supported by studies that highlight the Bank’s track record
in supporting work in transboundary contexts20.

The CIWA program has developed organically and interviews reflected that during the initial years the
program did have some governance challenges. As a result the development partners have played a
useful guiding role through the AC. The interviews with the development partners all noted the
significant strides that the Bank has made in strengthening the program management.

The provision of adequate and appropriately focused technical assistance prior to reaching agreement
on significant investments where institutional capacity is not sufficient is both prudent and essential21.
The CIWA program recognises the importance of this and is clearly constructed to develop the
sustainable institutional platforms for these later investments.

2.       The CIWA program does appear to be fit for the purpose for which it was established.


Establishing the Portfolio

It has been noted that working in transboundary basins is complex and as such takes time. This is
noted in the CIWA annual reports, but various authors have also noted the complexities related to
working in these political spaces. These also vary over time and space, and the differences in approach
between the various regions of Africa are also distinct.

Up to this point, CIWA has proved that longer term, sustained engagement is an important aspect of
unlocking the challenges in these basins. Examples in the Nile and Zambesi basins reflect this. It is
important to note that the sovereign complexities in these basins do require trusted advisors and as
such much of this cannot be documented.

In getting to this point of the program there have been lessons learned that can support the further
roll-out of the program.

         knowledge management, information, institutions and infrastructure projects under the

          catalytic sub-program the program is well placed for a productive five year period that should
          see the existing budgets spent.

     5.2 Improving the program
     In looking at ways to strengthen the existing program the MTR team looked at the program modalities,
     the program management and lastly the monitoring framework that will support later program
     evaluation.

     Improving program modalities

     4.   The strategic intent and strategic planning process of the CIWA program needs to be revisited.
          The CIWA program may benefit from an ongoing engagement regarding its strategic intent. This
          could be through an annual strategic planning session which brings together the various
          stakeholders including the World Bank, its TTLs and donors, as well as a broader array of
          continental actors (some of which are part of the Consultative Group) and results in a review of
          its strategic plan. This kind of strategic planning session will assist CIWA in terms of understanding
          what other actors are doing on the continent and how synergy can be created between the work
          being done by other actors and CIWA. In its strategic planning process, CIWA needs to engage
          with projects being implemented, and specifically with the balance between “quick-wins” and
          longer term benefits from various interventions towards developing a pipeline of projects. This
          kind of process will leverage CIWA’s comparative advantage of bringing together different
          stakeholders to a common platform in order to deal with the challenges of water management
          and development for the poor in Africa and then starts to leverage the real power of a continental
          program.


5.        Visibility should be strengthened through strategic communications. There is general consensus
          that the CIWA program is making an important contribution in dealing with water challenges on
          the continent, but that there is a need for CIWA to strengthen its visibility by improving its
          strategic communications interventions and successes more effectively. Thus, CIWA needs to
          market itself more effectively and share the results of interventions strategically. This could then
          also contribute to better fund mobilisation.

          It will be important for CIWA through these strategic communications to leverage the thought
          leadership that emerges through the basin and continental experiences. This will support
          working more synergistically with other programs.

          Similarly, the improvement of CIWA guidelines and program document will strengthen the
          understanding of CIWA and its modalities.

     6.   Develop a gender strategy: Whilst there have been improvements regarding the elevation
          gender and poverty dimensions there are still gaps in terms of an improved way of articulating
          the gender and poverty intent of CIWA. There is a clear need for a gender strategy to guide
          reporting and monitoring on gender dimensions of CIWA activities.



     Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report        58
 7.       Strategic plan for CIWA strengthening. The recommendations from the MTR have indicated a
          suite of adjustments to further strengthen what is already a good program. These need to be
          consolidated into a strategic plan that enable the WB to take this issues forward in structured
          manner. There are effectively three key areas for attention namely the programmatic
          governance and oversight, program resourcing and capacity and project level planning and
          oversight. The key issues under these would be:

                 (a)   Program governance and oversight
                     • Strategic intent and placing of CIWA including program extension beyond 2020
                     • Shifts in overall project governance
                               Resolving issues with the results frameworks at program level
                               Enhance reporting (including progress, risk, gender)
                  (b) Program resourcing and capacity
                     •    Resource Mobilization – Coordinated Action from Water GP and Africa Region
                     •    Augmenting Basin and PMU Staffing
                     •    Strengthening Strategic Communications
                     •    Strengthening internal documentation and guides
                     •    Develop a revised approach to knowledge management
                  (c) Project level planning and oversight
                     • Circulate Pipeline Planning Document
                     • Develop Theory of Change guidance at basin levels
                     • Develop Results chains based on Theory of Change for each priority basin
                       •    Restructure the CIWA Basin Support Plan

 8.       Fund mobilisation needs to be improved. Given the value of the program to its stakeholders and
          the fact that the design of the program was predicated on raising US $200 million, fund
          mobilisation should be given more importance within the program. The CIWA program may
          benefit from appointing a dedicated person for this purpose. Furthermore, the funding envelope
          is currently tied too strongly to existing donors and there is a need for expansion of the donor
          base. The CIWA program may furthermore consider a bouquet of donors rather than having all
          the donors under one umbrella. If CIWA is not able to meet its aspirational target of raising US
          $200 million, it may need to reconsider some aspects of its model and design, but most
          importantly the funding strategy needs to be linked to the strategic planning and an understood
          pipeline of projects.

9.        Building capacity. Concerns with regards to staff capacity have been discussed in nearly all
          interviews. There is a sense that the appointment of some key staff members would support the
          team to unlock some processes and to support in moving some processes more efficiently. It is
          clear from the interviews that this capacity would be needed at both PMU level (to support
          strategic matters) and at basin levels (to support project mobilisation. It is noted that expenditure
          on staffing is at less than 3% of budget and so there are in fact funds available for additional staff.
          It is apparent to the MTR that there is a need for strengthening in particular areas of the program.



     Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report         59
            •     Dedicated specialist staff are needed to service key areas such as gender mainstreaming
                  and monitoring and evaluation across the full program, at both program level and basin
                  level.
            •     Dedicated staff are required to support the ongoing administration of the program and
                  improvement of the key strategic and operational documents.
            •     Dedicated CIWA staff are needed in the regions to assist the TTLs, the RBOs and RECs
                  to keep processes moving and to assist in building capacity in regional institutions. The
                  additional support will be critical in assisting the projects and to redress the monitoring
                  of their performance.
            •     The capping of core staff costs does not necessarily need to be revisited at this stage
                  due to the low expenditure on staff.

     It has been noted that the Bank has started some restructuring activities and key individuals, who
     have a wealth of understanding of CIWA may be moving. There are concerns with regards to the
     loss of institutional memory.

     Therefore, a resource and capacity strategy is needed to further strengthen the program. This
     will need to consider the Banks developments in terms of the Global Water Practice. This needs
     to be linked to an improved knowledge management system that enables the exchange of
     experience.

10. Improving processes where possible. Whilst some stakeholders (largely those external to the
    Bank) felt that the approval process was excessively long, those within the Bank and some of the
    donors felt that the time needed was proportionate to the nature of these programs and projects.
    The MTR team’s initial sense was that for a 10 year program approval processes in the order of
    two years was too long and would impinge on the ability to reach targets. Without doing an
    intensive analysis, it would be of value to look at ways of improving efficiencies in this process.
    The Bank is known for its systems and rigour and the donor partners value this. If there are not
    efficiencies that can be achieved then there is stronger emphasis needed on developing a pipeline
    of projects so that these approvals do not impRevact on the programs ability to meet objectives.

     The appointment of additional staff to CIWA would help smooth project preparation and would
     then later support in ensuring effective monitoring.

     At the same time, it is critically important that CIWA produces a clear and concise project
     document that articulates the approval process and the associated time frames so the new
     project clients have a better grasp of these processes.

11. Disbursements and delivery. The rates of disbursement has in previous financial years been
    extremely low and has only in this financial year seen a significant improvement. This is linked to
    the fact that many of the projects are now starting to be implemented. However, the MTR is
    concerned that with 83% of the projects being executed by RBOs, more accountability for delivery
    needs to be placed in the shoulders of the RBOs. This should include a more rigorous reporting
    requirement for which the RBO takes responsibility.

12. Risk Management needs to be improved. CIWA is currently quite strong in terms of identifying
    risks, but it is not clear how well these risks are being managed. In order to improve the risk
    management framework the monitoring and reporting of risks does need to be improved. Firstly,
    CIWA’s approach to risk, including a risk framework and appropriate evaluation and reporting
    system needs to be outlined in its Operating Guidelines. Secondly, the risks at the program level
    need to be monitored and reported in the Annual Report. Thirdly, the reporting on risk
    management at the basin level needs to be strengthened to reflect status at approval and how
    these risks are being managed.


Improving Program Management

13. Revisit the program management structure. Looking at the overall program management
    structure the management of the program at the strategic programmatic level, as well as at the
    basin level in support of project implementation is appropriate. The need to have structures that
    engage stakeholders on continental/strategic matters as well as at the basin level on more
    operational matters is recognised. However, during the review it was clear that the program is
    not achieving in terms of the Intermediate Results area 4 on stakeholder engagement, and that
    some of these structures are not proving effective. The overall program governance framework
    does therefore require revisiting so as to clarify roles and responsibilities and strengthen these
    structures towards improved performance.

14. Strengthening strategic partner engagement. The CG has been less effective in recent years and
    needs to be strengthened to support consistency in attendance, and in order to play its role of
    strategic guidance. It has been noted that attendance at the CG’s has dwindled with time and
    there have been challenges in consistency of attendance. Therefore, the CG either needs to be
    strengthened or it needs to be disbanded and the program will need to investigate some
    alternatives that will enable the program to engage in strategic discussions with key stakeholders,
    lead agents and development partners across the continent.

15. Unlock the strategic role of the Advisory Committee. The AC is understood to play a vital role,
    but this needs to revert to one of providing strategic direction and having oversight on program
    performance. Whilst the AC members see the value add in providing strategic guidance there is
    not a desire to micro-manage. A revised governance framework does need to be developed that
    clearly articulates roles and responsibilities and align with other Trust Funds being managed by
    the World Bank. This will empower CIWA to take full responsibility for the program, and
    accordingly be held fully accountable. This will unlock the real strength of the AC in terms of its
    strategic guidance on new basins or strategic issues to add to the program, interconnectivities
    with other programs and initiatives, and strategic discussion on areas of concern where jointly
    the AC, development partners and the Bank could collectively address or unlock issues.

16. Strengthening Basin Advisory Committees. The BAC plays an important role at the basin and
    project levels and the flexibility to build upon existing structures is appreciated in order to avoid
    duplication of structures. It has been noted that the lessons learned at the basin and project level
    are not being captured and shared as effectively as they should be. The BAC needs to be



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        61
     strengthened to enable more engagement and coordination at the basin level and to support an
     improved knowledge management approach within the program.



Improving Monitoring

17. Basin scale results framework needs to be strengthened. Noting that the richness in terms of
    impact and the generation of lessons for future projects and initiatives lies within the projects at
    the basin level, having appropriate results frameworks at the project scale is critical for the
    program as a whole. Essentially, improving upon the results frameworks at basin level entails
    holding basin level workshops to develop and agree upon a theory of change for each project.
    With the theory of change developed, results chains need to be developed so as to reflect the
    connectivity between activities, outputs, outcomes and impact. Moreover, baselines need to be
    developed that are appropriate and linked to the actual contextual baseline within the basin, and
    not a baseline linked to CIWA processes. This needs to be developed in partnership with key
    stakeholders so as to create an improved sense of ownership and develop capacity for future
    monitoring. It is also critically important to engage a gender specialist at these basin level
    workshops to assist in tackling the challenges currently experienced in addressing and reporting
    upon gender dimensions.

18. There is need to strengthen the reporting at project scale within the basins to ensure the
    provision of more detail on process, progress and response. While reporting is done every 6
    months through Implementation Status Results (ISR) reports, providing an indication of what has
    been achieved, there is a sense that: a) there is not sufficient qualitative reporting against
    indicators; b) is not always clear how the various interventions have resulted in the numbers that
    have been determined. Notably, some of the ISR reports are better than others while certain
    projects have only been initiated recently, however, this reporting does require improvement.

19. The CIWA Basin Support Plans need to be reformulated and revised to reflect the basin theory
    of change and to provide a hub for the knowledge management within basin. Clearly, not all
    WB staff were aligned in terms of understanding the nature and role of the CIWA Basin Support
    Plan. The Basin Support Plan is important in providing a bridge between the local stakeholders,
    the RBOs and the WB. The uncertainty created by the lack of clarity and alignment in
    understanding the BSP is an opportunity lost. Strengthening these reports to reflect the theory
    of change at basin level and to become a vehicle for structuring the lessons and knowledge that
    emerge through the project is needed.

20. The role of RBOs in the reporting at basin level needs to be strengthened. There is need for
    enhanced reporting at the basin level led by RBOs. This could be undertaken through a reporting
    mechanism separate from the World Bank systems, noting that WB systems are structured in a
    particular manner. This could create improved ownership and provide the opportunity to report
    on progress, risks, and value for money in a more detailed manner.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report        62
21. The use of a Developmental Evaluation approach will strengthen the evaluation of impact and
    create a shared sense of ownership across projects within basins. Given the magnitude and
    regional significance of CIWA projects, it is recommended that such initiatives adopt the
    Developmental Evaluation (DE) approach. The selection of DE for CIWA can support the on-going
    development of the interventions within the current context it operates in. Fundamentally, DE
    operates with the assumption that the changing dimenstions of projects are necessary to
    accommodate a changing external environment and is therefore structured to allow for this
    change. Finally, DE recognises the value of involving stakeholders in the evaluation processes
    making the approach suitable for evaluating complex dynamic systems.

22. The development of a theory of change for the program together with a more complete suite
    of assumptions will be critical to be able to assess impact. In the absence of a theory of change
    (TOC), the program is vulnerable in being able to provide a sense of the strategic intent, how this
    aims to be reached, and periodically testing the assumptions implicit in the strategic intent.
    Moreover, there are difficulties in aggregating up results from the basin to program level when
    dealing with diverse projects that are demand driven. Similarly, there are challenges in the
    connectivity between intermediate results areas and the program development objectives.
    Clearly, the program needs to have a more complete set of assumptions that can be used to
    understand all the indicators at both program and basin levels. Finally, the assumptions need to
    be regularly tested in order to invoke better responsiveness to emerging requirements of the
    program.

     The development of a clear strategic intent for the program will nullify the need for differing
     results frameworks to match differing funding envelopes.

23. The indicators for the Program Development Objectives (PDOs) need to be reworded to truly
    reflect the nature of the program. Indicator (i) uses the word “mobilised” which is in effect
    beyond the scope of CIWA which has little ability to ensure that funds are mobilised, and is in
    effect an inappropriate indicator. At best, CIWA can influence or leverage, with even the latter
    sometimes being difficult. This must be adjusted. Indicator (ii) uses the term “directly” with
    regard to benefit from improved water resource management and development. In some
    instances this can be quite problematic due to CIWA’s upstream nature. This must be rectified.

24. Challenges regarding the suite of existing targets must be rectified. Reflection on the targets for
    the program link to the nature of the program and to the current performance. Whilst it is not
    appropriate to adjust targets to meet underperformance, it is fair to redress targets that appear
    to be unreasonable or overly ambitious. There a number of targets that require redress and if not
    addressed will create problems in assessing performance. The following matter require attention.

          •     The results framework does not have targets for FY 17 – 19 and these need to be
                developed.
          •     Targets for PDO indicator (i) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that
                it has limited to no influence on direct mobilisation of funds. In addition the target for
                FY16 notes “potential” projects whilst the targets for FY20 is “mobilised”. The target of
                US$10 billion mobilised is not appropriate and likely not attainable. The suggestion is to



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme     Final Report         63
                remain with “potential” projects which reflects the Bank’s ability to influence projects
                with a 2020 target of US$15 billion.
          •     Targets for PDO indicator (ii) are problematic in that CIWA’s upstream nature means that
                it has limited influence on direct beneficiaries and hence the use of the word ‘potential’.
                In addition, the assumption is that the beneficiaries are all those living within the basin
                which really could not be tested. The leap from 15 million potential beneficiaries to 50
                million direct beneficiaries between FY16 and FY20 is unrealistic, noting at the mid-term
                the achievement has been 5.6 million direct beneficiaries and the projects that are
                currently online. The targets for potential direct beneficiaries is also unrealistic in that
                the achievement in FY15 is about four-fold.
          •      The baselines for all targets are reflected as zero, linked to CIWA initiatives. This the MTR
                finds problematic as it really undermines the actual existing capacity within basin.

     The PDO targets need adjustment whilst the assumptions that underpin the targets for the
     intermediate results areas require strengthening.

25. The monitoring and reporting framework needs to provide a basis for the programs knowledge
    management, and needs to be documented in the operational guideline. The overall
    programmatic approach to monitoring and reporting is not currently documented within any of
    the guideline documents and this needs to be captured in the operational guidelines. Doing this
    should provide a clear framework for the reporting and effectively the knowledge management
    for the program. Currently, the rich experiences and findings within the basins is being lost and
    needs to be reported upon. Strengthening the Basin Advisory Committees will be a key step
    forward in supporting the basins in reporting, and ensuring that this knowledge is not lost.

26. Further improve the Value for Money statements. Whilst the FY14 and FY15 Annual Reports did
    reflect on VFM at a programmatic level. However, there is a need to assess this at project/basin
    level where it will be more important to track progress. It is noted that many projects are only
    now being initiated, and so there is limited to no data available that can be used to reflect current
    progress. In order to support the developmental evaluation for the projects a suite of indicators
    and baselines will need to be developed for each project/basin. The ICF indicators whilst
    sometimes difficult to utilise do provide a meaningful first port of call for each basin. This will
    require capacity building support to assist the basins in undertaking this monitoring and the MTR
    would expect that the RBOs must take this on board as a key element of reporting.

Terms of Reference for the Mid-Term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa
(CIWA) Program

Background

Climate resilient growth and poverty reduction in Africa depend on the sustainable management and
development of its international waters. Two or more countries share all of the major water sources
and the key sectors that contribute to growth depend on water. The transboundary nature of Africa’s
rivers, lakes and aquifers add considerable political, technical, environmental, and financial complexity
to their sustainable development. It has been principally recognized that unilateral uncooperative
development by riparian countries in a transboundary basin may have detrimental consequences for
the hydrology of the basin as a whole or may foreclose on optimal development opportunities in the
future; as such, this additional complexity has often resulted in stalled investments or the adoption of
sub-optimal development choices that have a real and significant cost. Cooperative action is
necessary to optimize benefits regionally and mitigate the shared risks including those of climate
variability and change.

The Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program, established in 2011, is a multi-
donor trust fund that is administered by the World Bank and that seeks to support riparian
governments in unlocking the potential for sustainable, inclusive, climate-resilient growth by
addressing constraints to the cooperative management and development of international waters.
CIWA intends to achieve this by improving the quality and accessibility of information, strengthening
institutions, and providing support for preparing and/or improving the quality of investments with
regional benefits. CIWA leverages the comparative advantage of its host institution, the World Bank,
which offers strong technical expertise in international waters and across other relevant sectors such
as agriculture, energy, and service delivery, while also having the convening power to mobilize
multiple stakeholders and experience managing international waters in other regions of the world.
Through its analytical work, CIWA can also provide technical advice to bilateral or multilateral
diplomatic efforts of its donors.

The long term objective of CIWA is “to strengthen cooperative management and development of
international waters in Sub-Saharan Africa,” which it intends to meet through support to activities that
fall within the following four results areas:

Regional Cooperation and Integration: This aims to foster cooperative transboundary institutions for
greater regional stability and creation of an enabling environment for shared sustainable growth.

Water Resources Management: This aims to underpin the evidence-based knowledge for planning and
decision-making to maximize development opportunities and minimize climate risks.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        65
Water Resources Development: This aims to support investments that improve resilience to climate
variability and change, enhance food and energy security, and enable countries to follow a lower
carbon growth path.

Stakeholder Engagement and Participation: This aims to enable greater voice in decision-making
processes of civil society, private sector and academia in the cooperative management and
development of shared basin resources.

CIWA responds to demand from interested basin institutions through its “Basin Engagement Sub-
program” whereby basin programs are selected according to their alignment with CIWA’s objective,
potential to contribute to one or more of CIWA’s results and the expressed interest by basin countries.
In addition to sustained basin engagements, the CIWA “Catalytic Subprogram” aims to catalyze
support and provide a clearer, deeper understanding of factors influencing the cooperative
development and management of international waters in Africa as a means to unlock the potential
contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. It is predicated on a combination of mutually
reinforcing knowledge management, technical assistance, and advancing high-impact investment
opportunities with regional benefits that support the achievement of CIWA’s primary objective and
further regional and national development objectives. The Catalytic subprogram will generate, share,
and manage knowledge that can facilitate cooperative development and management of international
waters; explore potential high impact collaborative investment opportunities in defined basins and
regions; and create shared understanding of the opportunities, risks, costs, and benefits of
cooperative development and management of international waters among stakeholders.

More information on the CIWA program can be found on its website and in the attached 2014 Annual
Report. (http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/cooperation-in-international-waters-in-africa)

Objectives of the Mid-Term Review

The Mid-Term Review (MTR) will assess the degree to which CIWA is on-track for and fit for purpose
in meeting its development objectives moving forward and their relevance under the current
circumstances. The MTR will be conducted in 2015 and will be primarily a “functionality review” which
considers specific elements of CIWA’s structure and processes. The MTR will include a progress review
which will assess how the program as a whole is on-track to meet its goals. If relevant, the MTR will
make specific recommendations for changes to program elements that may improve program design
and performance.

Based on findings of the MTR, World Bank management, in consultation with the CIWA AC, will
determine if program restructuring and reformulation are needed including any needed changes to
the CIWA Results Framework.

The following sections provide an initial guidance on issues to be covered under the Framework and
in the cases studies. However, it should be noted that the Proposals to be submitted by the interested
firms are expected to detail the methodology, general approach and work plan proposed to achieve
the objectives delineated above.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report       66
Approach

The Review will be managed by the CIWA program management unit (PMU) and conducted by an
external consulting firm (consultant) who has extensive experience working on complex programs and
related review processes. The CIWA PMU and CIWA basin teams will provide relevant material and
background to the consultant to support their analysis and review of the program.



In principle, and subject to the analysis included in the proposal, the MTR may be conducted according
to the scope (described below) through the following steps:

     1. Document Review. A comprehensive document review that incorporates strategic
        documentation, project documentation, reports and reviews22.

     2. Inception Report. The preparation of an Inception Report which finalizes the review questions
        and describes the methodology and a work plan. The Inception Report could include, but is
        not limited to the following items:

             i.     Implementation process, timeline and key milestones for the MTR

            ii.     Strategic guidance on documentation, reports and data to review

            iii.    Strategic guidance on and identification of relevant stakeholders and process for
                    stakeholder engagement (e.g., interviews, questionnaires, document review)

            iv.     Identification of relevant field visits (if any)

            v.      Strategic guidance on the organization of the debriefing workshop (venue,
                    participants, agenda)

            vi.     Structure of the final report

The Inception Report will notionally be completed one month after contract is in place.

     3. Stakeholder Consultations. The consultant will conduct consultations with specific
        stakeholders that are in a position to inform the specific points of analysis herein. Specific
        opportunities include telephone or video connected consultations with:

             i.     Interested CIWA Advisory Committee (AC) members;

            ii.     World Bank experts;


22
  Relevant documentation will include: CIWA Proposal to Development Partners, Strategic Framework, Results
Framework, CIWA Support Plans for priority basins, CIWA Annual Report for FY2012, FY2013 and FY2014,
Catalytic Subprogram: Structure, Process and Proposed Activities, CIWA Project Documentation, CIWA
Operational Guidelines, CIWA Administrative Agreements, and World Bank strategies on water, energy,
agriculture, climate change and related Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF), as well as documents which
describe global development priorities such as development of the Sustainable Development Goals.

             iii.     CIWA’s major clients23;

             iv.      Representatives of organizations engaged with CIWA in selected opportunistic
                      activities24;

              v.      Representatives of selected complimentary or umbrella organizations25;

             vi.      National government representatives as relevant; and

            vii.      Other stakeholders who are identified as relevant to the Review.

During consultations with external parties (i.e., other than Bank and donors) the consultant will ensure
that consultations focus inquires to gain feedback relevant to the respective organization and its role
in the CIWA program.

     4. Draft Report. Synthesizing information gathered during the MTR documentation review and
        consultations into a draft report with specific recommendations for any changes required to
        improve the program’s design and performance. The consultant will ensure that the
        assessments are objective and balanced, affirmations accurate and verifiable, and
        recommendations realistic.

The draft MTR Report will notionally be completed by four months after contract is in place.

     5. Consultative Workshop. Presentation of the report at a debriefing workshop with the CIWA
        AC and other stakeholders as relevant to gain sufficient feedback on the draft MTR Report, to
        validate the consultant’s findings and to discuss any recommendations made for changes to
        the program. The consultant will convene the workshop, seeking to time the workshop with
        another major relevant conference and to make virtual connections possible to reduce travel
        required solely for the workshop.

The MTR validation workshop will notionally be conducted five months after contract is in place.

     6. Final Report. Based on feedback from the Workshop, the consultant will prepare and submit
        the Final Report. The final report will incorporate feedback received during the workshop and
        any agreed actions and will include specific recommendations, as relevant, for needed
        modifications that will improve the program design. The final report is intended to be a public
        document and CIWA will either make the report publically available on the website or will
        publish a summary version more relevant for external stakeholders.

The Final MTR Final Report will notionally be completed six months after contract is in place.

The consultant will also make themselves available to participate in internal Bank Review processes
associated with this project as and if it becomes relevant.

Scope of the MTR

The MTR will focus primarily on the key topics outlined below. It will be set in the context of using a
programmatic approach with predominantly recipient-executed grants to achieve the program’s goals
in Africa, and to leverage the comparative advantage of a Multi-Donor Trust Fund administered by the
World Bank. Consideration will be taken for the current funding envelope vs the anticipated funding
envelope, the planned program length, CIWA’s comparative advantage versus other international
waters, water management and water development programs. Recommendations should be
provided with full understanding of lessons learned from execution of the Nile Basin Trust Fund and
other international waters programs.

Program relevance, portfolio review and progress: This component of the review will examine: i)
CIWA’s comparative advantage in the international waters in Africa and if the program remains
relevant to meeting the needs of intended beneficiaries; ii) assess whether its portfolio, including
balance of activity focus and regions, is aligned with its comparative advantage and stated long-term
objectives; and iii) if the program is on-track to meet its stated goals.

In reviewing relevance, the MTR will assess how CIWA accounts for the current realities in Africa. For
instance, are the institutional and external environments still the same or have they changed in
substantial way since the program’s inception. This component will also review the extent that the
objectives of the program are consistent with beneficiaries’ needs and requirements, and relevant to
global priorities and donors’ policies, and whether or not they are still achievable. The component is
linked with the Results Framework component below in that it will assess the relevance of CIWA's
program development objective (PDO) and intermediate results areas (IRs) to meeting transboundary
water cooperation needs in Sub-Saharan Africa. This may include a review of the expected outcomes
in the results framework as well as the appropriateness of the target beneficiaries.

This component will also consider how the current portfolio is set up to provide benefits to CIWA’s
intended beneficiaries. Is the portfolio’s balance of activities, regions, and contribution to results areas
aligned with CIWA’s comparative advantage? Does the portfolio maximize positive outcomes for
beneficiaries? This component will include an assessment of the international funding landscape for
the program (i.e., what is the potential for resources mobilization?) and an assessment of the real,
unmet demand for CIWA’s interventions in Africa in order to inform potential future channels for
CIWA funding. Does the current portfolio contribute adequately to CIWA’s state objectives and
intermediate results areas?

This component will also provide an assessment of progress made by the program to date and if the
program is on-track to meet its long-term goals. The analysis will consider how projects which are
under implementation and preparation are contributing to CIWA’s program-level goals but will not
conduct an impact analysis of the program. This component will also consider the extensive amount
of time required to develop proposals and prepare projects and how this lead time plays a role in the
program’s positioning in the development landscape and its ability to meet its objectives.

Program Management Structure: This component of the review will analyze CIWA’s modalities for
governance including the Consultative Group, the AC, the Panel of Experts, the Basin Advisory
Committee and the Basin Support Plan. Where relevant, this assessment will consider the decision



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme      Final Report         69
making and financial allocation process. The MTR could also look into how CIWA follows good practice
for international development and will examine project planning and implementation considerations.
A key area to review is how CIWA processes and programming should be implemented moving
forward given the extensive project preparation time.

Results Framework and the Monitoring and Evaluation System: This component of the review will
examine the relevance of CIWA’s Results Framework to the current portfolio. It will assess how well
the Project Development Objective indicators and Intermediate Results indicators capture the
intended results of the program, and how well this framework monitors outputs that are directly
linked to CIWA’s inputs and various interventions. It will also examine whether the indicators reflect
the breadth of results expected across CIWA’s portfolio and how these indicators can be aggregated
at various levels. Recommendations could include revision of indicators and targets, taking into
consideration the current funding envelope and a series of future funding envelope scenarios. This
component of the review will also consider efficacy of the monitoring and evaluation systems
currently used by the program, including the project results frameworks and results reporting,
standard bank practices for supervision of projects and the Basin Support Plan results accountability
mechanisms. The assessment and any recommendation for reconfiguration of the results framework
will keep the program accountable for outputs and outcomes within its sphere of influence and will
account for the breadth of activities funded by CIWA.

This component of the review will also assess the readiness of the program for a future impact
evaluation. The consultant should include impact design evaluation in the report and may collect
baselines to create ability to evaluate impacts of the program at a later stage. As relevant, the analysis
of the Results Framework could involve developing and reviewing results chains for each institution
to understand which activities are aligned with CIWA’s objectives in order to target future efforts and
funding allocations accordingly.

Risk management and mitigation measures: This component will examine CIWA’s risk analysis
framework as part of the comprehensive analysis of the program, identify additional risks that have
not yet been explicitly considered and propose new or modified mitigation measures if relevant. The
Review will also help the World Bank and its development partners to better understand if the
program faces an acceptable level of risk.

Value for money: This component will analyze if CIWA has the structure and procedures in place to
ensure value, outcomes and impact. Please refer to the Value for Money annex in the 2014 CIWA
Annual Report as a reference for existing assessment on value for money of the program.

Professional Qualifications of the Consultant

The CIWA MTR will be carried out by a Consultant (consulting firm, university, or organization) with a
solid background in the following fields: monitoring and evaluation; development work with
multilateral and bilateral development organizations; infrastructure; transboundary waters; social and
institutional development; and environment, natural resources and water resources management.

Appendix 4: CIWA expanding funding options

CIWA – A High-Level Investigation of Funding Options

Introduction

The Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) programme is supported by a multi-donor
trust fund (MDTF) administered by the World Bank. This trust fund, programmatic in nature, sees
funds committed to support CIWA’s broad thematic framework, and not specific projects. This allows
the programme more flexibility to deploy funds.

Including existing initiatives, CIWA has an identified pipeline of projects in excess of US$200 million.
The programme initially sought to mobilise this amount over a 10-year period from its inception.
However, it has faced challenges in fulfilling this intent, with a current envelope of approximately
US$78 million pledged by its small group of current partners of the European Commission, Denmark,
United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. There is hence a clear and perhaps urgent
need, for CIWA to not only source additional funding to suitably cover its pipeline, but also to expand
potential funding streams and reduce reliance on its core existing partners.

Considerations in Identifying New Funding Streams

One of the primary issues in considering potential new funding sources for CIWA is the programmatic
nature of its MDTF. CIWA’s mandate is broad, both in terms of possible sectors of intervention, as
well as geographic locations. This requires prospective donors be comfortable that their contributions
can be utilised anywhere across this mandate, and may rule out many sources of funding which have
more specific objectives, or prefer more control over where their funds are deployed. Many donors
prefer bilateral or direct arrangements, favouring targeted deployment of funds at a project level.

A softer and possibly more controversial factor to consider, but of no less importance, is the role that
political dynamics and relationships play in the donor funding space. Various funds and programmes
“compete” for funding from the same pool of sources, whilst those sources may have agendas and
desired outcomes which extend beyond the on-the-ground fundamentals.

Both of these issues are difficult to ascertain with any degree of certainty without engaging with the
source and allowing for a more comprehensive determination of mandate, agenda, and the nature of
relationships. Fundraising is a fluid exercise, requiring adaptability in a consistently shifting space.
Hence a first step in a more detailed process is to “look close to home” – an assessment of funds of
similar nature to CIWA, and an appraisal of existing funding relationships, within the broader World
Bank Group. The broad questions to consider are:

    •    What other funds/trust funds does the World Bank Group administer?

    •    Which donors does the World Bank Group have existing relationships with?

    •    Which donors contribute to World Bank funds or trust funds with similar or complementary
         thematic areas to CIWA?




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme   Final Report         79
    •    Which donors contribute to World Bank funds or trust funds of a similar nature to CIWA’s
         structure – programmatic and multi-donor?

The high-level answers to these questions should begin to provide pointers to likely candidates, albeit
at a preliminary stage of evaluation. Such candidates can be further investigated and engaged with
as part of a process to develop and structure a formal fund raising strategy for CIWA. This analysis
provides an initial and non-exhaustive survey of some of the higher profile and more obvious
candidates for short-listing, providing a launching point for a more thorough study and development
of a fund raising strategy.

It should be noted that the above considerations, and following analysis, does not take into account
potential funding modalities such as in-kind or co-funding arrangements. This is because it is unknown
at this stage whether CIWA would consider such mechanisms which don’t involve direct contributions
to its MDTF, and also because such arrangements are typically negotiated and structured on a case-
by-case basis and therefore would do little to assuage concerns over the long-term pipeline-funding
mismatch.

Early-Pass Identification of Potential Opportunities

World Bank Group Funds - Overview

A logical first step in the review process was to examine the contributions to International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) trust funds,
which support World Bank development operations in low and medium income countries. An
overview of the top contributors to World Bank IBRD/IDA trust funds is provided in the figure below.




Figure 1: Cumulative Cash Contributions by Top Ten IBRD/IDA Development Funders FY09-13 in US$ billions (source:
World Bank 2013 Trust Fund Report)

At a broad level, the donors listed in the figure above are likely to share similar developmental traits,
mandates and agendas. Five out of six of CIWA’s current partners – UK, European Union, Netherlands,
Norway, and Sweden – are Top 10 donors to IBRD/IDA trust funds. This would suggest that the likes
of the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and possibly Spain, could be worth approaching and
investigating further as potential new sources of CIWA support.

If the analysis is expanded to consider contributors to World Bank Financial Intermediary Funds (FIF),
Germany and France may also be appropriate possible donors to CIWA, although this is moderated by
the fact they appear to prefer channelling through FIFs rather than trust funds. Looking at the level



Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme          Final Report         80
of contributions to the IDA as a whole - the single largest source of donor funds for basic services in
the world’s 77 poorest countries, half of which are African - Austria, Belgium, Korea, Italy, and
Switzerland may also be potential contributors.

These countries are providing significant sums of donor funding to support grass-roots development
across most of Africa, and have established relationships with the World Bank Group as a whole,
marking them out as possible “low hanging fruit” for CIWA to investigate further as donors. Additional
analysis would look to determine any specific interest in supporting CIWA’s thematic initiatives and
objectives, and ability or willingness to contribute through a MDTF, amongst other issues.

World Bank Group Funds – Water Theme

World Bank funds that support the development of African water resources and supply are an obvious
area of investigation to identify potential new sources of funding for CIWA. Donors contributing to
these funds, but not to CIWA, would be a target.

        •    Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF)

The NBTF was established as an MDTF to coordinate and oversee funding to the Nile Basin Initiative
(NBI). The NBI is a partnership amongst the Nile riparian countries seeking to develop and manage
the river cooperatively. The NBI has a focus on supporting early-stage cooperation and development
harmonisation at a regional level amongst the basin countries, funding a total of 28 projects over a
10-year lifespan at over US$200 million.

Contributing donors to the NBTF included Canada, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the World Bank. Other contributors to the NBI,
but not through the NBTF mechanism, included Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, USA, AfDB, GEF,
and the UNDP. It is largely unknown at this stage why these latter partners preferred a bilateral
relationship direct with the NBI, but is possibly indicative of their lack of willingness to contribute
through an MDTF.

Discounting the non-NBTF countries pending further investigation, contributors to the NBTF who are
not already supporting CIWA include Canada, Finland, and France, and these countries should be
assessed as potential sources of funding. The NBI is one of the earliest examples on the continent of
formalised region river basin cooperation, and the NBTF one of the first mechanisms to fund such
cooperation. As supporters of an MDTF with a similar mandate to CIWA and at the end of its lifespan
(to be confirmed), these three countries may be interested in contributing. NBTF and CIWA are co-
funders on at least one project26, so issues around competition and conflict would need to be suitably
assessed.

        •    Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)

The WSP was established to support poorer communities in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable
access to water and sanitation services, as well as adapting water supply delivery to climate change

Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                       Final Report   81
impacts. It has a significant focus across large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa, with US$83million
contributed in donations for the FY14-16 period.

The largest donors to WSP for the FY14-16 period, who are not already CIWA contributors, are
Australia, Switzerland, Austria, and Finland. In particular, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland contribute
to the Africa MDTF, suggesting these countries would be good opportunities for further investigation
as potential donors to CIWA. WSP’s focus is downstream from CIWA, with initiatives in many regions
of Africa, supporting a view that CIWA’s work is complementary and crucial to WSP’s objectives, and
hence may be of interest to WSP funders.

World Bank Group Funds – Agriculture/Food Security Theme

World Bank funds that support the development of African agriculture, and seek to increase food
security, are also an obvious area of investigation to identify potential new sources of funding for
CIWA given their downstream dependence on water resources.

    •    Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)

The GAFSP’s objectives are to increase agricultural productivity, improve food security, reduce
poverty, and improve on-farm livelihoods. It has a significant focus on work across sub-Saharan Africa,
with US$1.2 billion contributed to the public sector window.

The largest contributors to the public sector window, excluding existing CIWA partners, include
Australia, Canada, Germany, Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation is also a major donor.

Given that the themes of agricultural productivity, improved food security, and reduced poverty are
heavily reliant on sustainable provision of water suitable for irrigation and basic usage, and its heavy
focus on most of Africa, it may stand to reason that several of these countries could be interested in
supporting CIWA’s objectives. Willingness to contribute through an MDTF would need to be
confirmed, with GAFSP an FIF.

World Bank Group Funds – Climate Resilience Theme

World Bank funds that support climate resilient development in Africa, and the management and
protection of natural resources from the impact of climate change, are also likely to possess funders
with a shared interest in CIWA’s mandate.

    •    Global Environment Facility (GEF)

GEF assists in the protection of global environment and promotes environmentally sustainable
development. GEF’s International Waters focal area was established to support countries to jointly
manage their transboundary water basins to enable the sharing of benefits from their utilisation. GEF
administers several trust funds: GEF Trust Fund, Least Developed Countries Trust Fund, and Special
Climate Change Trust Fund. It has a significant focus across sub-Saharan Africa, and just the main GEF
Trust Fund as a US$3.5 billion commitment for the GEF6 four-year window.




Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme    Final Report        82
There are numerous donors to the GEF6 Trust Fund widow, including Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and USA as some of
the largest excluding existing CIWA contributors. It is possible that several of these GEF donors could
also be convinced to providing funding to CIWA as well, although possible conflict of interest is an
issue given GEF’s work in the transboundary water management space. GEF ad CIWA are already co-
financiers on a number of projects, including the Volta River Basin SAP Implementation27, and the
Sustainable Groundwater Management in SADC States28.

World Bank Group Funds – Energy Theme

A thematic link between World Bank energy funds – energy generation, sustainable provision, rural
electrification, and similar – and the CIWA programme may exist primarily in the form of hydropower.
However, this connection is indirect, unlike the agriculture and climate resilience themes. Therefore,
not as much certainty exists that donors to an energy fund, or even specifically hydropower, would be
attracted to CIWA’s mandate. If engagement with potential donors identified from the analysis in
other areas is not successful, then this theme can be further investigated.

External and Private Sector Sources

This initial analysis has focused predominantly on potential country donors to the CIWA MDTF, those
which already contribute to World Bank funds of a similar nature and whom the World Bank has an
existing relationship. This is primarily because these could be “easy wins” in the sense that:

        •   It is uncertain to what extent such potential sources of funding have already been considered
            and investigated;

        •   Any prospective CIWA MDTF arrangements with these sources would likely closely reflect
            those existing; and

        •   A more wide-ranging and in-depth investigation and identification of high-potential funding
            sources would require a much longer study involving numerous engagements.

There are several sovereign developmental agencies involved in the financial and technical support of
projects and programmes on the African continent, which are not reflected in the above analysis. This
predominantly includes China and a number of Middle Eastern nations. However, their modus
operandi is often opaque and dynamic. For example, China has several disparate entities which offer
developmental aid, with no consolidated or consistent approach. Instead, any support is provided on
a case-by-case basis.

From this first pass analysis, it seems less likely that multilateral institutions, with their own mandate
and structures (such as UNDP, UNEP, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, NEPAD,
ClimDev, Nordic Development Fund, Millennium Challenge Corporation, etc.) would be interested in
contributing indirectly to their objectives through CIWA’s thematic MDTF. For example, the Islamic
Development Bank typically identifies specific projects in Islamic member countries for direct support.

Mid-term Review of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Programme                     Final Report   83
Developmental finance institutions such as the IFC are predominantly seeking to support private
sector involvement in downstream developmental initiatives (predominantly fixed infrastructure)
through concessional financing, whilst private sector entities themselves often prefer a more direct
involvement in projects which generate explicit and measurable returns in either financial or non-
financial terms. CIWA’s current methodologies and objectives do not lend themselves to attracting
such funding.

There are several private philanthropic organisations such and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
and the Scholl Foundation, which may have interest in donating to CIWA’s fund. However, foundation
grants are typically small (less than US$1 million), and therefore would not contribute significantly to
addressing the funding shortfall relatively to the resources invested in securing the donation. Some
large private sector corporates may share a desire to support CIWA’s broader mandate, but are
unlikely to want to do so in a substantial way through a pooled and programmatic structure where
direct funding visibility is limited.

Conclusion

In short, CIWA’s best chance of attracting additional funding in the short term, of sufficient quantum
to reduce the shortfall towards its US$200 million target, is through targeting national government
development agencies which already contribute to World Bank funds of a similar or complementary
nature. A full fund-raising or resource mobilisation strategy should be developed, which builds on this
initial analysis to:

    •    Fully define what CIWA seeks in terms of the amount and type of funding;

    •    Establish the need for additional avenues of funding;

    •    Better characterise potential donors to be approached and refine the shortlist;

    •    Understand the modalities by which potential donors operate, for example specific funding
         windows, initiation processes, and typical fundraising, commitment, and drawdown timelines
         (five years remaining in the CIWA Program may not be sufficient time and therefore rule out
         certain sources); and

    •    Determine and describe the most appropriate message and method of approach;

Only with such a strategy will CIWA be in a position to mobilise resources sustainably fund its pipeline
over the coming years.

Appendix 5: MTR Summary recommendations

This annex provides a suite of high level summary recommendations from the MTR.

Building upon CIWA’s achievements

1.   The MTR found that the CIWA program is relevant and with the current suite of projects has a
     good geographic spread for potential impact.

2.   The CIWA program does appear to be fit for the purpose for which it was established.

3.   With 4 basin projects accounting for 75% of the allocable budget and a useful blend of knowledge
     management, information, institutions and infrastructure projects under the catalytic sub-
     program the program is well placed for a productive five year period that should see the existing
     budgets spent.


Improving program modalities

4.   The strategic intent and strategic planning process of the CIWA program needs to be revisited. In
     its strategic planning process, CIWA needs to engage with projects being implemented, and
     specifically with the balance between “quick-wins” and longer term benefits from various
     interventions towards developing a pipeline of projects.

5.   Visibility should be strengthened through strengthened strategic communications.

6.   Development of a gender strategy is necessary.

7.   Develop a strategic plan for CIWA strengthening.

8.   Fund Mobilisation needs to be improved through the development of a funding strategy.

9.   A resource and capacity strategy is needed to further strengthen the program. This will need to
     consider the Banks developments in terms of the Global Water Practice. This needs to be linked
     to an improved knowledge management system that enables the exchange of experience that is
     being generated through the projects.

10. Look towards improved efficiencies in approval and project initiation processes.

11. Work towards shifting more accountability for delivery to the RBOs.

12. Risk management and the reporting of this needs to be strengthened to reflect all that is
    happening.

Improving Program Management

13. The overall program governance framework does require revisiting so as to clarify roles and
    responsibilities and strengthen these structures towards improved performance.

14. The engagement of strategic partners and stakeholders is important and so the manner in which
    this undertaken needs to be revisited.

15. Unharness the strength of the Advisory Committee towards playing a stronger strategic role in
    terms of guiding CIWA tactically as opposed to the current managerial modalities.

16. Basin Advisory Committees need to be strengthened to enable more engagement and
    coordination at the basin level and to support an improved knowledge management approach
    within the program.

Improving Monitoring

17. Basin scale results frameworks needs to be strengthened. This needs to be developed in
    partnership with key stakeholders so as to create an improved sense of ownership and develop
    capacity for future monitoring. Basin level workshops to develop a theory of change and
    improved results framework for projects is critical to program success.

18. There is a need to strengthen the reporting at project scale within the basins to ensure the
    provision of more detail on process, progress and response.

19. The CIWA Basin Support Plans need to be reformulated and revised to reflect the basin theory of
    change and to provide a hub for the knowledge management within basin.

20. The role of RBOs in the reporting at basin level needs to be strengthened.

21. The use of a Developmental Evaluation approach will strengthen the evaluation of impact and
    create a shared sense of ownership across projects within basins.

22. The development of a theory of change for the program together with a more complete suite of
    assumptions will be critical to be able to assess impact.

23. The indicators for the Program Development Objectives (PDOs) need to be reworded to truly
    reflect the nature of the program. The use of the words “mobilised” and “directly” are quite
    problematic due to CIWA’s upstream nature.

24. Challenges regarding the suite of existing targets must be rectified. Some are not appropriate
    and cannot be attained, whilst others have been significantly over achieved. The PDO targets
    need adjustment whilst the assumptions that underpin the targets require strengthening.

25. The monitoring and reporting framework needs to provide a basis for the programs knowledge
    management, and needs to be documented in the operational guideline.

26. The value for money reporting is useful at programmatic level, but there is a need to assess this
    at project/basin level where it will be more important to track progress. The MTR would expect
    that the RBOs must take this on board as a key element of reporting.

Appendix 6: Action Plan

This high level action plan reflect an intense period of revision during the first 6 month period of 2016.
Some of these issues will require engagement with the Advisory Committee on an ad hoc basis, but
key strategic issues will be taken to the Advisory Committee meeting in September 2016 where CIWA
will report on the programmatic adjustments that have been made.
