Executive Summary
1.	     This assessment is aimed at identification and analysis of the main gender disparities in
Ukraine in terms of agency, endowments and access to economic opportunities. The report is de-
veloped in the framework of the World Development Report on Gender and Development. The assess-
ment is based on a quantitative approach using a wide range of international databases including World
Bank’s World Development Indicators, the Global Financial Inclusion Database, the Enterprise Survey,
the Life in Transition Survey, the European Value Study, and as well as supplementary statistics of
the Eurostat, the World Health Organization, and United Nations Economic Commission for Europe,
and others. The national data is provided by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, along with results
of Labour Force Survey, Household Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and Demography and
Health Survey. The national consultancies with leading experts on gender issues were held to validate
the key findings and strengthen the recommendations of the report. The key findings of the assessment
can be summarized as follows:

2.	      Ukraine is characterized by a high level of human development, in particular with regard
to indicators of gender equality. The country’s advantaged position is largely contributed by women’s
high educational attainments and labour force participation rates, which are quite comparable with de-
veloped regions. Significant progress was achieved in reducing maternal and infant mortality, coverage
with prenatal care and mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The national legislation can be mostly de-
scribed as gender-neutral, while international assessments classify Ukraine with a low level of gender
discrimination in social institutions. To promote gender equality, the target public programs were enact-
ed along with establishing the institutional framework for developing and coordinating gender policies.
The Millennium Development Goals declared a range of important tasks in the field of gender equality;
however, most of them haven’t been met in full due to a lack of political will and policy failings. To ad-
dress the gaps, gender issues were incorporated into the national post-2015 development agenda as well.

3.	      The report identifies some important gender disparities in various domains of public life,
including political representation and decision-making, social views and public attitudes, and dis-
tribution of powers in a society. In spite of women’s high educational achievements and economic
activity, their participation in politics and decision-making remains disproportionally low. Despite af-
firmative actions taken to introduce the 30- percent gender quotas in electoral processes, these norms
could be ignored in practice due to a lack of any sanctions for non-compliance. Though women are
rather well-represented at lower administrative levels and at the local self-governance, they face a per-
sistent ‘glass ceiling’ in access to chief executive positions in public administration. Positively, there are
increasing evidences of a raise of women’s social activism and participatory activities associated with
development of a civil society. Nevertheless, the gender-based views on traditional roles of men and
women remain prevalent in Ukraine, shaping the distribution of powers in households and opportunities
of empowerment outside the family. Such stereotypes are particularly important in terms of women’s
reconciling of employment and family duties, including responsibility for unpaid and domestic work.
Sociological surveys reveal that women tend to be less satisfied with their life than men do.

4.	      Gender stereotypes are reproduced in the system of education and cause the vigorous cycle
of gender-based segregation in occupations and employment. The grounds of segregation are found
yet in the system of secondary education, as perceptions of the ‘proper’ gender roles could be influ-
enced by school textbooks and curricula. As a result, men and women tend to choose different fields of
study at post-secondary level. Though women’s high concentration in tertiary education can be regarded
as important competitive advantage at the labour market, female returns of education may be low. In
practice, female-dominated occupations and types of economic activity are often associated with lower
wages and devaluated social prestige. There are still no efficient instruments to assess the outcomes of
education across gender, as well as international competitiveness of students in Ukraine.

                                                                                                                    7
    Executive Summary



    5.	      In spite of quite high rates of labour force participation, women could face certain barri-
    ers in opportunities of employment and earnings. As women prevail among employed in the bud-
    get-funded sectors of economy (such as public administration, education, healthcare and social service,
    etc.), female employment is generally more secured in terms of social guarantees and unemployment
    risks. In contrast, male-dominated industries experience the largest impact of economic downturns
    through short-cuttings and recession. However, the patterns of employment confirm women’s vulner-
    ability at the labour market; prevalent part-time employment could also restrain women’s career ad-
    vancement and professional development. Importantly, the extensive system of social protection on
    maternity could pose additional burden for women’s employment opportunities, causing the biased atti-
    tude of employers and contributing to female economic inactivity. As on average, women earn less than
    men, and the gender pay gap is only partially explained by observed gender differences in education,
    length of service, residential and sectoral dummies. The importance of unexplained determinants of the
    gender wage gap could be associated with direct discriminatory practices at the labour market, which
    are well-documented by sociological surveys, as well as with ‘vertical’ form of gender segregation in
    employment. Women’s access to business activities and financial resource should be improved through
    development of the target microcrediting programs and support of start-up projects; it is also important
    to raise financial literacy of a population.

    6.	      Gender inequality in income opportunities results in increased women’s vulnerability and
    poverty risks. Though there are no reliable data to argue about total feminization of poverty in Ukraine,
    the poverty ‘profiles’ are clearly gendered. In particular, the highest poverty risks are common for fami-
    lies with many children (and the risk is naturally increasing in single female-headed households), while
    elderly women and women of the most active reproductive age face high poverty rates as well. Women’s
    lower earnings and shorter length of pensionable service contribute to the gender gap in pensions, af-
    fecting the quality of life in old age. So, along with optimization of the pension system, an increase in
    women’s retirement age is aimed to reduce the gender gap in pension benefits. The poverty risks are
    increasing among rural population and residents of small settlements with poorly developed labour mar-
    kets and lower incomes of employment. In terms of non-monetary criteria of poverty, rural residents also
    face multiple deprivations from access to basic services and infrastructure. Finally, the armed conflict in
    Eastern Ukraine and large-scale displacement movements resulted in a new form of vulnerability, as nu-
    merous contingents of internally displaced people turned out to be deprived from safe housing, income
    of employment and access to public services. As women prevail among displaced persons, having ad-
    ditional obligations in terms of caring for children, elderly and disabled persons, the gender approaches
    should be incorporated into the policies of humanitarian response.

    7.	      The problems of gender-based violence and trafficking in persons remain particularly
    acute with regard to the on-going conflict. Though important efforts have been done to achieve the
    progress in combating trafficking to comply with requirements of EU partnership, prevention and pros-
    ecution activities should be improved, as well as inter-agency coordination. As to domestic violence, its
    roots are closely related to unequal distribution of powers and prevalent gender stereotypes. As a result,
    public tolerance to spousal violence is quite high in Ukraine, while there is no wide-spread practice to
    apply for any assistance due to common stigma put on survivors in communities. The permanent lack
    of shelters and protective services for survivors of gender-based violence is often supplemented by low
    population awareness and mistrust to the existing service-providers. Despite of an intense response
    to the problem of gender-based violence provided by international agencies in the conflict-affected
    regions, there is a pressing need in expansion of preventive information campaigns and providing ade-
    quate support to survivors.

    8.	      Importantly, the problems of gender inequality concern men as well. A large gender gap
    in average life expectancy is contributed by significantly higher rates of male mortality, in particular in
    the working age. Along with cardio-vascular diseases, some of the main determinants of excessive male
    mortality are related to external death causes, such as injuries, traffic accidents, poisonings, suicides,
    homicides, etc. In addition, stressful environment, hazardous works, and additional psychological pres-

sure of the traditional ‘breadwinning’ role could provoke alcohol abuse, unhealthy diet or risky behavior.
The incidence of such communicable diseases as tuberculosis and HUV/AIDS is also importantly higher
among men, but a share of females living with HIV has grown because of the increased role of sexual
transmission. The comprehensive knowledge about HIV prevention remains insufficient, in particular
among young people, as well as lifetime experience of HIV testing.

9.	      The current demographic situation is featured with depopulation and progressing ageing.
While the total population number has been decreasing since the 1990’s due to a decline in fertility, un-
precedented population losses were caused by the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The demographic
consequences of the conflict, including postponed births, external migrations, shifts in the trends of
morbidity and mortality, still have to be examined in details. Ukraine’s patterns of fertility still differ
from the European ones in terms of age-specific birth rates: the mean age at first childbirth is among the
lowest in Europe. This trend is particularly important with regard to women’s empowerment, as early
motherhood is associated with constrains for education and employment. Also, in spite of a decline in
the rates of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, teenage pregnancy remains a pressing problem. As a
whole, the ageing population poses new challenges for the pension and healthcare systems, as well as
new requirements to the system of life-long education and flexible labour market. Though labour mi-
grations have become an important source of remittances and household’s well-being, they are closely
associated with new social risks, including deficit of care for children and elderly.

10.	      Promoting gender equality in Ukraine may benefit from the proposed measures, covering
recommendations on improving the agency constrains, effective use of endowments and expand-
ing economic opportunities for women. In spite of development of the gender-neutral legislation, the
implementation of its provisions remains inadequate, as no important sanctions or penalties are provided
for non-compliance. The national machinery on gender equality should be strengthened, in particular
at the regional and local levels. The Government should take the leading role in developing the gen-
der agenda and provide coordination of various initiatives launched by civil society organizations and
international agencies. Implementation of gender policies should be supported by the target funding,
while principles of gender budgeting need to be incorporated into governance. The continuous practice
of training public officials in gender sensivity could facilitate the progress, as well as advocacy cam-
paigns among employers. To address gender-based discrimination, the population awareness should be
improved with regard to possible forms of discrimination and available mechanisms of counteraction. In
general, transformation of the traditional gender stereotypes will require a comprehensive gender exper-
tise of the whole system of education, combating any sexism in mass media, conducting of information
campaign on popularization of equal duties and responsibilities across gender, etc. The national statis-
tics can be expanded by supplementary gender-disaggregated data, and special surveys are needed to
address the current data gaps, such as women’s constrains in doing business or political participation. It
is also important to use the gender-sensitive approach in any needs assessments for internally displaced
persons, as displaced women are particularly vulnerable to multiple forms of discrimination and biased
treatment. The risks of gender-based violence and trafficking in persons are increasing in the on-going
conflict, so inter-agency response could be strengthened through establishing of information campaigns
and providing access to safe housing for survivors. Finally, the current demographic trends pose a need
in planning of the long-term strategies to address depopulation, progressing ageing, labour migrations,
excessive mortality of men, and health-associated problems, including communicable diseases.

     Introduction
     1.	      Ukraine is currently classified as a lower-middle income country with a Gross National
     Income per capita (Atlas method) of US$3,560 in 2014. The country experienced a sustained eco-
     nomic growth since the early 2000’s, being associated with a fast reduction in poverty. However, the
     global financial and economic crisis hit the economy of Ukraine, generating one of the largest economic
     setbacks in Eastern Europe. The post-crisis recovery (2010–2011) was then followed by stagnation in
     2012–2013, as serious macroeconomic and structural weaknesses remained unaddressed (World Bank
     Economic Update 2015). The Euromaidan protests and political destabilization followed by occupa-
     tion of the Crimea and armed conflict in the Eastern Ukraine resulted in a deep social-economic crisis.
     Ukraine’s GDP dropped by 6.8 percent in 2014, while the inflation rate increased to 24.9 percent (the
     historical maximum over the last 14 years). A rapid devaluation of the national currency has lead to
     deterioration in the population living standards, while the changed political and economic priorities con-
     tributed to cuts in financing human development and social policies. The numerous contingents of the
     internally displaced people (IDP) flew across the regions of Ukraine, posing the new serious challenges
     for the systems of social protection, healthcare, education, and the labour market. In 2014, Ukraine and
     the European Union (EU) signed the Association Agreement, providing shared commitments to a close
     and lasting relationship based on common values, in particular full respect for human rights and funda-
     mental freedoms, rule of law, and democratic principles, including gender equality. In particular, gender
     equality has been identified as priority area by the EU’s Eastern Partnership Platform I (Democracy,
     Good Governance and Stability) Work Programme for 2014-2017.

     2.	      According to the UN’s global ranking, Ukraine is considered as a country with high hu-
     man development. Ukraine’s Human Development Index (0.747 in 2015) has been increasing since the
     early 2000’s, ranking the country at the 81st position globally (UNDP 2015). As to the UN’s Gender
     Inequality Index (0.286), Ukraine was ranked significantly higher (57th position in 2015), indicating
     certain gender advantages of human development. For both indices, the largest positive contribution is
     provided by high educational attainments of a population. The scores of the Global Gender Gap Index
     (World Economic Forum 2015) also indicate the input of education and women’s health to Ukraine’s
     gender development. However, the country moved a few positions down in the corresponding global
     ranking (from 56th to 67th position in 2014-2015), mostly due to declined indicators of economic op-
     portunities and participation. Finally, the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) classifies Ukraine
     with a low level of discrimination in social institutions, still paying attention to some policy failings,
     including inadequate response to gender-based violence, gender stereotypes reinforced in the media, etc.
     (OECD 2014).

     3.	     To address these issues, this paper is focused at three dimensions of gender disparities in
     Ukraine: i) agency as ability to make decisions and take opportunities; ii) endowments, includ-
     ing education, health and demography; and iii) economic opportunities realized through access
     to the labour market and earnings. A wide range of the gender-disaggregated statistics was used to
     capture the gaps across multiple demographic, economic and social indicators. For international com-
     parisons, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) were used a primary data source,
     being supplemented by global databases of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations
     Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the Eurostat for comprehensive assessments. The
     Global Financial Inclusion (FINDEX) database was used for analysis of the gender disparities in access
     to finance, while the Enterprise Survey (ES in 2011 and 2013) allowed outlining of the gender gaps
     in business activities and entrepreneurship. To ensure international comparability of the gender-based
     perceptions and views in a society, we used the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS in 2008 and 2010) and
     the European Value Study (EVS in 2008). The national data were based on information collected by the
     State Statistics Service of Ukraine, along with data obtained from the 2007 Ukraine Demography and
     Health Survey (UDHS) and the 2012 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). Detailed analysis of
     the gender disparities in employment patterns, earnings and poverty rates was based on microdata of the
     regular Household Survey (HHS) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in Ukraine.

4.	      The paper is structured as follows. Chapter I is devoted to agency, shaping the process of
using endowments by women in men, including legislation and institutional environment, political par-
ticipation and decision-making, gender stereotypes in public attitudes, and subjective well-being. In
Chapter II we examine the gender gaps in endowments across men and women, captured by enrolment
to various education levels and preferred fields of study. This Chapter is also focused at the current
demographic trends and their gender implications, as well as at the gender disparities in health, with a
particular emphasis on communicable diseases and reproductive health. Chapter III examines the gen-
der gaps in labour force participation and patterns of employment, including vulnerable and informal
employment, gender-based segregation and labour migrations. The gap in earnings is analyzed in details
by background characteristics of employment. The problem of poverty and vulnerability is outlined
in gender dimension in this Chapter as well. Finally, the gender inequality in opportunities of career
advancement is discussed in Chapter III, as well as disparities in financial inclusion and access to entre-
preneurship in Ukraine. In Chapter IV, we present some basic conclusions and policy recommendations
of the revealed gender gaps.


Key Findings:
Low political participation and underrepresentation of women in decision-making remain the ma-
jor challenges in enhancing gender equality in Ukraine, being non-consistent with high rates of female
educational attainments and economic activity. Whereas women prevail in the public administration
and are well-presented in local councils, they face persistent barriers in access to the top executive po-
sitions. Despite of the gender quotas introduced in the election process, no important progress has been
observed due to a lack of political will and unavailability of effective sanctions for non-compliance with
this norm.

Multiple gender gaps can be captured at the labour market, though female labour force participation
and employment rates are comparable with average ECA indicators. Employment patterns for women
are largely dependent on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, and number of
children; there are more women in vulnerable and part-time employment. Women also prevail among
the registered unemployed, and the need in placement in jobs has grown significantly with appearance
of the IDPs. The gender-based segregation in employment is progressing, being observed by sectors of
economic activity and occupations. The ‘glass ceiling’ effect is in force, restricting women’s opportuni-
ties of career advancement across various occupations and sectors. There are more men in firm owner-
ship and top management, while female-headed enterprises are smaller and less profitable regardless of
a type of economic activity.

The gender gap in earnings remains persistent, being hardly affected by gender policies and regula-
tions. While lower female wages are associated with explained factors such as occupational segregation
(including restriction of women’s employment in underground works) or fewer working hours, the un-
explained determinants are also in force, being largely related to discrimination at the labour market.
Prevalence of discriminatory practices in employment is confirmed by special sociological surveys and
monitoring of job vacancies. Importantly, the gender gap in wages contributes to the respective dispar-
ities in pensions, and affects the quality of life in old age. As a whole, there are more women among
vulnerable population groups, while the increased poverty risks are faced by elderly women and single
mothers.

There are no important gender gaps in the field of education, as both women and men have equal ac-
cess to the basic levels of education. There are also more women in tertiary education, while men prevail
in vocational training institutions. However, the grounds of gender-based segregation in employment are
set yet at a level of education, as men and women tend to choose different fields of study. There are also
certain restrictions for female entrance into tertiary education in the sector of defense and security, as the
list of available specialties is regulated by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Though some efforts on



                                                                              Country gender assessment

     the gender expertise of academic syllabi and school programs have been implemented, there is still no
     comprehensive policy on incorporating the principles of gender equality into education.

     Health indicators reveal a disadvantaged position of men in terms of life expectancy, morbidity
     and communicable diseases, injuries and life-style associated health problems. Prevalence of tuber-
     culosis and HIV-infection remains high, while the large-scale internal displacements pose the new chal-
     lenge of non-controlled epidemics due to unmet medical needs of displaced people. Despite of a decline
     in the child and maternal mortality rates, the issues of reproductive health require additional attention
     to be addressed. Finally, the progressing population ageing poses multiple challenges for the fiscal and
     pension systems, as well as a need in the respective adjustments at the labour market, in the systems of
     healthcare and life-long education.

     Domestic violence remains a particular problem, being closely related to the gender-based views in a
     society and unequal distribution of powers and resources between men and women. Despite progressive
     legislation and developed institutional environment, the overwhelming majority of survivors do not
     apply for any assistance of public institutions because of a low awareness, mistrust to authorities, and
     prevalent stigma attitude in local communities. A poor availability of service-providers in most regions
     results from the permanent lack of shelters for survivors of domestic violence and the recent short-cut-
     ting in the contingents of social workers due to budgetary crisis. The armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine
     resulted in the increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV) and destruction of the scarce system of
     service for survivors in the conflict-affected regions.

     For many years, Ukraine has been regarded as a country of source, transit and destination for traf-
     ficking in human beings. Although the number of revealed victims has declined recently, the trafficking
     is still exposed in multiple forms of sexual and labour exploitation, involving women, men and chil-
     dren. According to the last U.S. Department of State Report, the Government of Ukraine does not fully
     comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant
     efforts to do so.

     Gender stereotypes remain prevalent in a society, being often reproduced in the media and education.
     The biased gender-based views are particularly persistent towards distribution of household duties, rec-
     onciling work and family balance, and given men priority in jobs. Maternity and need in caring for chil-
     dren are associated with major causes of a biased employer’s attitude to working women. As a whole,
     women tend to be less satisfied with life than men do.

     The large-scale displacement movements, caused by the armed conflict in the Eastern Ukraine, are
     associated with a new humanitarian challenge, requiring immediate response. Women tend to be dis-
     proportionally affected by the crisis consequences, prevailing among internally displaced persons and
     facing multiple social exclusions in terms of placement in jobs, income support, access to housing
     and public services. Thus, the adequate needs assessment should be based on the integrated gender
     approach, as well as efficient policy targeting and implementation. It is also important to empower
     women’s participation in the peace-building and recovery processes to ensure consideration of gender
     equality principles in all developmental strategies.

Chapter 1. AGENCY
1.1.	    The 2012 World Development Report (World Bank 2012) recognized that expanding women’s
agency – their ability to make decisions and take advantage of opportunities to achieve desired out-
comes – is crucial to improve as their individual lives, as their communities, as the whole world. In reality,
determinants of such empowerment are complex and depend on multiple factors. Women’s endowments
(such as health, education and assets) and economic opportunities could be significantly limited by insti-
tutional barriers and discrimination, unequal distribution of powers or traditional social stereotypes. In
particular, persistent social norms and attitudes could also pre-determine advancements of women in var-
ious domains of public life through outlining the ‘proper’ gender roles. Finally, equal political representa-
tion and access to decision-making is crucial to facilitate women’s empowerment through development of
gender-sensitive policies. Agency constraints and deprivations affect women’s well-being in all countries
(Klugman 2014), whatever their income level, social status or education attainments.

1.2.	   In this Chapter we examine the key determinants of agency in Ukraine, in particular by focusing
on the current legal and institutional framework of gender policies, opportunities of women’s voice and
representation, gender-based disparities in subjective well-being of a population, and gender-related
views in a society. Issues of gender-based violence are also covered in this Chapter, being closely linked
to unequal distribution of powers and resources between men and women.


A. Legal and Institutional Framework
1.3.	    Ukraine succeeded in development of a progressive legislation and institutional environment,
shaping the frameworks for enhancing gender equality and non-discrimination. The country has ratified
the core international documents with regard to gender equality. Yet in 1948, Ukraine joined the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, while the country signed the ILO Equal Remuneration Convention
(1951), the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (1958) and the Workers with
Family Responsibilities Convention (1981) later on. In 1980, Ukraine ratified the UN Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Optional Protocol thereto
(2003). The country also signed the European Social Charter and the Beijing Declaration and Platform
for Action on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in 1995. In November 2010, Ukraine rati-
fied the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Finally, Ukraine
signed the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence
(Istanbul Convention) in 2011; however, it hasn’t been ratified yet. The expert group of public officials
and representatives of CSOs is currently working on harmonization of the Ukrainian legislation with
provisions of the Convention.

1.4.	    In 2000, Ukraine joined the UN Millennium Declaration at the UN Millennium Summit, and
by doing so has undertaken the responsibility of reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
by 2015. Promoting gender equality was set among the principal Goals, while gender dimension was
also clearly traced within other Goals, dealing with reducing child mortality or improving maternal
health, combating the epidemics of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, or eradicating poverty. To address the
Gender Goal, two specific targets have been set: i) to ensure gender representativeness at the level of
no less than 30–70 percent in representative bodies and high-level executive; and ii) to halve the gap in
incomes between women and men. A set of indicators has been outlined for annual monitoring of prog-
ress, including gender ratio among the Members of the Parliament, gender ratio among the members of
local councils, gender ratio among the higher-level civil servants, and ratio of average wages between
women and men. According to the monitoring progress reports on the MDGs, ensuring gender equality
in Ukraine turned out to be one of country’s largest challenges. Most of the ambitious targets the country
set for achievement by 2015 have not been met in full due to a lack of political will and systemic policy
gaps (MGD 2015). To address this failure, gender equality was prioritized in the post-2015 development
agenda, and the working groups of national experts launched discussions on setting the Sustainable


                                                                              Country gender assessment
                                                                                          for UKRAINE
                                                                                                                   13

     Development Goals (SDGs) for Ukraine. The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade was au-
     thorized to coordinate the national SDGs campaign.

     1.5.	     To comply with international obligations, the Government of Ukraine submits the Regular State
     Reports on the implementation of the CEDAW to the UN’s CEDAW Committee, reflecting the country’s
     progression in mainstreaming equal rights and opportunities for women and men, and the article-by arti-
     cle review of the UN Convention implementation (CEDAW 2008). In turn, the Committee provides the
     Government of Ukraine with the Concluding Observations on the Elimination of Discrimination against
     Women with its specific recommendations (CEDAW 2010). To address the particular policy gaps, the
     Alternative CEDAW Reports are being prepared by Ukrainian NGOs (Women’s Consortium of Ukraine
     2008). Also, Ukraine provided the National Review on Implementation of the Beijing Declaration and
     Platform for Action and the outcomes of the 23rd special session of the General Assembly in 2014
     (Ukraine National Review 2014).

     1.6.	    The national legislation of Ukraine guarantees the equal rights for women and men, basic prin-
     ciples of gender equality being established in the Constitution. In 2001, the Parliament adopted the Law
     ‘On Prevention of Domestic Violence’, which became a driving force in promoting the equal rights and
     opportunities for women and men in all domains of public life. The Presidential Decree ‘On Improving
     the Work of Central and Local Executive Authorities on Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities of
     Men and Women’ (2005) stipulated development of the national gender machinery by establishing the
     gender working groups and coordination councils, and appointing the gender advisors in the central and
     local authorities. The Law of Ukraine “On Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities of Women and
     Men” was passed in 2005 after prolonged advocacy campaigns supported by CSOs; it came in force in
     the early 2006. The Law determines the main directions of the national gender policy, establishes the
     national gender machinery, and prohibits gender-based discrimination. However, some provisions of the
     Law do not stipulate specific sanction for their violation.

     1.7.	   To ensure the effective implementation of the Law on Equal Rights, the gender-legal expertise
     of the existing legislation and draft legal acts was introduced. In 2009, the Ministry of Education and
     Science (MoES) issued the Decree ‘On Integrating the Principles of Gender Equality in the Education’;
     respectively, the guidelines on expert assessment of training curricula, materials and handbooks have
     been developed and applied. In 2011, the Law ’On combating the trafficking in Human Beings’ was
     adopted, while the Law ‘On Grounds of Preventing and Combating Discrimination in Ukraine’ was
     passed in 2012. Later on, the anti-discriminatory legislation was re-viewed and significantly improved
     based on court cases and recommendations of the national and international human rights organizations
     and CSOs.

     1.8.	     The Law ‘On the Employment of Population’ was passed, providing for equal opportunities of
     all citizens irrespective of their gender for free selection of activity. The amendment was introduced to
     the Family Code of Ukraine in 2012, in order to increase the marriage age of women to 18 years (thus it
     was made the same as men’s marriage age). Finally, the amendment to the Law ‘On political parties in
     Ukraine’ (2013) introduced the gender quotas in the process of elections, while the recent Law “On local
     elections’ (2014) secured the gender quotas in the electoral system (at least 30 percent of representatives
     of each gender in the electoral party lists). Thus, Ukrainian legislation is basically gender-neutral and
     does not establish different legal status for men and women; however, the major problems concern the
     implementation of the legislation framework due to insufficient inter-agency cooperation, inconsis-
     tency of reforms and a lack of efficient sanctions for non-compliance with legal provisions.

     1.9.	    To address the present gender gaps in a society, several State target programs on ensuring gen-
     der equality have been developed and implemented in Ukraine; the latest State Program (2013-2016)
     was developed in a close cooperation between the Government, NGOs and international organizations.
     The Program’s tasks were focused at: further improving of the legislation on gender equality; conduct-
     ing awareness raising campaigns among employers on the European standards of gender equality in the
     field of labour and equal distribution of family duties; advocacy in case of discrimination; promoting

women’s leadership and decision-making; upgrading the skills of public officials, involved into activ-
ities on gender policies, etc. As to other programme instruments, the State target social program on
combating trafficking in human beings (2012-2015) was approved, addressing the tasks of prevention of
trafficking, prosecution of offenders and protection of victims. Also, the State target social program of
supporting families was set until 2016, suggesting a complex of measures to prevent asocial phenomena
in families, including domestic violence, to provide social protection and support to families in difficult
life circumstances, and to transform the gender-based views in a society. Finally, to address the UN
Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security (#1325), the National Plan of Actions for
a Period until 2020 was developed and approved by the Government on February 24, 2016. The tasks
of the Plan are targeted at assessment of the conflict’s impact on violation of human rights, assistance
and rehabilitation of GBV survivors and promoting women’s participation in prevention of conflict and
peace building efforts.

1.10.	 The Ministry of Social Policy (MoSP) is the main institutional body, responsible for develop-
ing, implementing and coordinating gender policies in Ukraine. The Expert Council to Consider Claims
with regard to Gender Discrimination was set up, consisting of representatives of the MoSP, Ukrainian
Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, other public authorities and NGOs. To facilitate the gen-
der-sensitive policies, the Equal Opportunities Caucus1 was formed in the Parliament yet in 2011. In
accordance with Decrees of oblast’s public administrations and Kyiv city public administration, the re-
gional coordination councils on issues of family, gender equality, demographic development, preventing
domestic violence and trafficking in human beings have been created. The State Statistics Service is
authorized to collect gender-disaggregated statistics; the relevant data are biannually summarized in sta-
tistical booklets ‘Women and Men in Ukraine’ based on international standards. Though the list of sta-
tistical indicators is still limited, it provides information on gender disparities in education, healthcare,
labour force participation and employment, asocial phenomena, etc. Numerous efforts have been taken
to build capacity of public officials in terms of development, implementation and monitoring of gender
policy, with regard to gender statistics, gender budgeting, gender education and sensitivity, etc. In total,
more than 30 thousand public officials and members of council were covered with training workshops
and awareness raising programs during 2006-2014 (Ukraine National Review 2014). The role of civil
society and international organizations remains quite high in advocating for gender equality in Ukraine,
as many legislative initiatives, institutional developments and advocacy efforts in the field of gender
equality were pushed by non-governmental sector.


B. Voice and Representation
1.11.	 In Ukraine, political representation of women still remains very low at the national level, de-
spite setting the gender parity in elected authorities among the target indicators of MDGs. Though a
share ofwomen in the National Parliament has been gradually increasing (Figure 1.1a), it reached only
11 percent as a result of Parliamentary elections in 2014. Presently, there are only 51 women among
422 Parliament Members (12.1 percent). In this regard, Ukraine lags far behind the regional average of
women’s representation in Europe (25.7 percent), as well as the global average of 22.7 percent (Inter-
Parliament Union, December 20152). Also, a share of women in the Parliament of Ukraine is among
the lowest at the ECA region (except Georgia, Armenia and Hungary). The recent legislative changes
targeted at introduction of the gender quotas in electoral lists of candidates for Parliament Members
(amendments to the Law of Ukraine “On political parties”, 2013) have not lead to the proper improve-
ments. The gender quotas were not taken as mandatory requirements by some parties, as there were no
sanctions for non-compliance. Due to vague legislative provisions, women were occasionally placed in
the lower parts of election lists, thus having smaller chances to pass the electoral threshold.

     1.12.	 Women’s representation is traditionally higher in local governing bodies, in particular at lower
     administrative levels. According to gender monitoring of 2014 local elections by Women’s Consortium
     of Ukraine (WCU 2014), women constituted only 12 percent of members of oblast councils, while
     their share increased to 14 percent for city councils, 23 percent for district (rayon) councils, 46 percent
     for settlement councils, and as much as 51 percent for village councils (Figure 1.1b). In 2015, a new
     law on local elections was passed, containing a provision on the gender quotas (with each sex repre-
     senting no less than 30 percent of a political party’s electoral list). As a result, the gender balance was
     improved among members of 11 of 22 city councils, but the 30-percent threshold has been reached only
     in Chernihiv city council (33.3 percent of women). In general, the average representation of women
     in the city councils of Kyiv city and city-oblast centers reached 18.1 percent, while a share of women
     among total nominated candidates was 32.2 percent (Figure 1.2). Based on gender monitoring of the
     Committee of Voters of Ukraine (2015), the lowest rates of women’s representation were registered
     in Ivano-Frankivsk and Kirovohrad city councils (by 9.5 percent), as well as in the city council of
     Uzhgorod (8.3 percent). Women’s representation in oblast councils was improved as well, as the average
     share of elected women has grown to 15 percent. The largest shares of women were elected to oblast
     councils in Khmelnytski (21.4 percent) and Sumy (20.3 percent) oblasts, while the smallest share was
     registered in Odesa oblast (9.5 percent). According to the results of mayoral elections in Kyiv and 18
     cities-oblast centers in November 2015, no women were elected as mayors.

     1.13.	 As compared with men, there are much more women employed in the state administration bod-
     ies. In particular, women constituted 74.8 percent of total civil servants at the beginning of 2015, making
     employment in the sector of public administration particularly feminized. At the same time, women’s
     distribution across the levels of executive positions of civil servants is characterized by a distinctive
     “glass ceiling”, as their numbers are declining among top officials (Figure 1.3). While women prevail
     among civil servants at lower executive positions (civil servant of executive categories V and VI), they
     make only 16.1 percent of the top executives involved in decision-making at the national level (civil
     servants of executive category I). These disparities are even more obvious in the local self-governance,
     as women constitute only 5 percent of the top officials (executive category I) there, while representing
     about 80 percent of officials at the lowest executive positions.

1.14.	 According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women occupied 10.5 percent of ministerial posi-
tions in Ukraine, reflecting appointments up to January 2015. This share is small compared with advanced
gender democracies of Europe; Ukraine also lags behind most post-Soviet countries, ahead of only the
Russian Federation (6.5 percent), Turkmenistan (5.7 percent) and Azerbaijan (2.5 percent). In 2015, only
two ministerial positions in the Government were held by women, including the Minister of Finance and
the Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers. Five women held positions of the First Deputy Ministers, while
11 of them worked as Deputy Ministers. A woman was heading the Central Bank of Ukraine, and there
were 3 women among members of the Central Bank Board (almost 30 percent). Ukraine’s representation
of women in economic decision-making (measured as proportion among presidents or CEOs and members
of boards of the largest companies listed on the national stock exchanges) is quite close to the average
EU-28 (respectively 17.3 against 21 percent) (European Commission 2015). However, women constitute
only 11.1 percent of the Constitutional Court Members. According to the UNECE Statistical Database3, a
share of women among Ambassadors was only 1.5 percent, being much smaller than in the EU countries.

1.15.	 As a whole, the rate of participation in political activities and social activism has been quite low in
Ukraine in the early 2000’s – as for men, as for women. The European Value Study (EVS 20104) has not
revealed any significant gender disparities in involvement to political parties (about 3 percent for both male
and female respondents), trade unions (about 12 percent of respondents), welfare and community organi-
zations, and other types of NGOs (less than 2 percent of respondents). As to women’s activism, only 0.5
percent of female respondents belonged to any women’s group. However, the recent studies argue about
increased public activity of women and their growing involvement into CSOs (Phillips 2008; Ukrainian

     Women’s Fund 2011). A particular focus on women’s political activity was related to Euromaidan protests
     in 2014 (Phillips 2014; Onuch & Martsenyuk 2014). According to Kyiv International Institute of Sociology
     (KIIS 2014), women constituted 43 percent of protest participants in the early days of Euromaidan, while
     their share dropped to 12 percent in February, when the protests became more violent. For instance, the
     participants of civil protests have organized the Kobylianska Female Sotnia of Self-defence, and provid-
     ed legal, medical and other volunteer help, ensured public safety, and made countless efforts to keep the
     protest peaceful (Philips 2014). Social activism of women has also dramatically increased in 2014-2015
     through volunteer movements related to providing support to Ukraine’s militarymen in the armed conflict
     in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts and assistance to internally displaced persons (OSCE 2015).

     C. Subjective Well-Being
     1.16.	 Subjective well-being is a measure of individually perceived level of well-being, revealed
     through self-assessment of incomes, job, health, living environments and relations. According to the
     Life in Transition Survey (LiTS5), life satisfaction of the population of Ukraine remains quite low (only
     38 percent of respondents agreed with the statement “All things considered, I am satisfied with my life
     now” in 2006), being considerably lower than the average rate for Western Europe and in the transition
     region as a whole. Besides, a large gender gap is observed in subjective assessments of the well-being
     for men and women. Based on the 2006 LiTS, there were 33 percent of women and 43 percent of men
     satisfied with their lives. The second round of the LiTS (2010) revealed that life satisfaction has even
     dropped by about 8 percentage points for the entire population. Such a decline in subjective well-being
     affected as men, as women (Figure 1.4a), being most probably linked to the deteriorated living standards
     due to the economic and financial crisis of 2008-2009. The gender gap in subjective assessments of
     well-being remained significant, as only 27 percent of female respondents were satisfied with their lives
     in contrast to 38 percent for male respondents.

1.17.	 The European Value Study (EVS 2010) was also used to check the gender disparities in individ-
ual’s satisfaction with life. The Survey questions differed from those, used in the program of LiTS, as
well as a population sample and time frames of the surveys. Thus, the results of these two surveys cannot
be directly compared for any correlations, just used to outline some general trends. Based on the EVS,
57 percent of total respondents were satisfied with their lives in Ukraine in 2008; however this share
was also among the lowest ones in the ECA region (except Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Bulgaria).
Certain differences in the level of life satisfaction can be also observed across gender (Figure 1.4b), indi-
cating that more men were satisfied with their lives (60.6 percent) as compared to women (54.1 percent).

1.18.	 The gender differences in life satisfaction could be potentially linked to individual perceptions
of control over life (Figure 1.5a), as more men believed that they have control over their lives (59.5
percent of men versus 49.7 percent of women). However, women were more satisfied with their cur-
rent jobs, as almost 74 percent of employed women and 69.1 percent of employed men agreed with the
respective statements (Figure 1.5b). This finding may reflect the role of prevalent gender stereotypes,
prioritizing family roles for women and restraining their expectations of the decent jobs, income and
professional realization.

     1.19.	 Background characteristics, such as education, marital status, age or number of children, do not
     make significant impact on gender differences in life satisfaction of respondents (Annex A). That may
     be explained by joint sharing of household resources by men and women, and their inability to disaggre-
     gate individual well-being. In general, there are more life-satisfied persons among young people (aged
     15-29) and persons with higher educational attainments. As to particular domains of the well-being, the
     2012 Ukraine Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 2013) asked women and men aged 15–24 about
     their satisfaction with family life, friendships, current job, health, the place of their residence, their
     current income and other dimensions. The majority of young people were satisfied with their health and
     friendship; the rates of satisfaction with current jobs were lower and only 44.4 percent of respondents
     were satisfied with their current income. Although young women demonstrated slightly lower rates of
     satisfaction with health, living environment and friendship, the gender differences in distribution of
     responses are not statistically significant (Figure 1.6).

     1.20.	 2007 Ukraine Demography and Health Survey (2007 UDHS) provided data on control over re-
     sources and household decision-making across gender. As compared to other ECA countries, Ukraine’s
     women are characterized by a rather high control over household decision-making and resource use.
     Based on the 2007 UDHS, 64 percent of married women make decisions alone about their own health,
     16 percent decide about the purchase of large household items, 77 percent make decisions about daily
     household purchases and 24 percent decide on their own about visits to family or relatives. Among mar-
     ried women receiving cash earnings, more than one third (35 percent) mainly decide themselves how
     to use the money, while 63 percent decide jointly with their husband. Only 1 percent of women say that
     mainly their husbands decide on the allocation of the woman’s earnings.

D. Gender-Related Views of a Society
1.21.	 Gender stereotypes can be regarded as important determinants of the gender inequality in many
aspects of public life, including access to the labour market, economic resources and decision-making, as
well as distribution of the gender roles in households. Being reproduced in social norms and attitudes, such
public views have a persistent character and are slowly transformed with time. Many recent studies pay
attention to the prevalence of traditional gender stereotypes in Ukraine (Rubchak (ed.) 2011; Hankivsky
(ed.) 2012; Sayenko 2007), not only affecting the individual women’s lives, but also shaping the whole in-
formation environment through activity of the mass media and education (Ukraine National Review 2014).

1.22.	 In Ukraine’s society, such gender stereotypes are particularly expressed in public views on op-
portunities of women’s employment and reconciling work and family. For example, although nine in ten
respondents of EVS (2010) agreed that a working mother can have just as warm relations with children
as mothers who do not work, about 70 percent of both men and women believe that a pre-school child
is likely to suffer if his/her mother works (Figure 1.7). Men’s underestimation of women’s role at the
labour market and their aspirations for professional realization is revealed through a significant gender
difference in agreements with some statements related to women’s life priorities. For example, more
than 90 percent of male respondents believe that women mostly want a home and children, about 70
percent of them agree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling for women as working for pay. Indeed,
according to the Survey of Women’s Participation in the Labour Force of Ukraine (UCSR and UNFPA
2012), women’s interest in professional fulfillment and unrealized career aspirations are declining with
increased number of children. On the other hand, fewer men than women believe that having job is the
best way for a woman to secure her independence (see Figure 1.7).

1.23.	 In this context, Ukraine stands out among the developed counties of the EU, being quite close
to Georgia, Turkey and Azerbaijan with their more conservative gender norms (Figure 1.8a). Thus, more
than one-fourth of all female respondents of the EVS (2010) strongly agreed that pre-school children are
likely to suffer with working mothers, while the corresponding shares of respondents in the developed
gender democracies of Europe didn’t exceed 5 percent. Another question of EVS had to find out how much
women are ready to yield to men in the situation when there is tension in the labour market and there are
not enough jobs to meet the whole demand. Again, almost 40 percent of male respondents and about 25

     percent of female respondents agreed that ‘men have more right to a job’ in such situation (Figure 1.8b). In
     contrast, such attitudes are non-common for the EU countries, in particular for the Nordic states.

1.24.	 At the same time, the contribution to household well-being and perception of parental responsi-
bilities are characterized by more egalitarian views. According to the EVS, the overwhelming majority of
population agreed with the statement that both husband and wife should contribute to household income.
Also, this thesis is supported by a larger proportion of women, as compared to men (see Figure 1.7). This
finding is well-correlated with high rates of women’s control over economic resources in households, ob-
served in the Ukrainian families. Egalitarian views on equal responsibilities for children are also revealed
through wide-spread beliefs that fathers are as well suited to look after children as mothers.

1.25.	 In a broad sense, reproductive activity consists not only of a child birth and rearing, but also
of various types of unpaid work related to reproduction of generations and maintenance of the family’s
vital activities – housekeeping, care for sick, incapacitated and elderly family members, purchase of
everyday consumption goods, etc. In most societies, these works are performed mainly by women; in
Ukraine, this trend appears to be particularly striking. According to the Survey of Women’s Labour
Force Participation in Ukraine (UCSR and UNFPA 2012), more than three-fourths of married / partnered
female respondents said that it was mainly their duty to clean up the house (78.4 percent) and to cook
meals (75.3 percent). About two thirds of married female respondents with family members in a need of
continuous care (such as disabled or elderly) said that they mainly care for such persons. Most women
were also responsible for purchase of foodstuffs and everyday consumer goods for the whole family.
According to the UNFPA Survey, only 22% of men are willing to share these household responsibilities
evenly in such families, while almost a half (49.3 percent) of women in such families aspire for a more
fair distribution of household work.


Violence Against Women and Girls

1.26.	 Violence against women (VAW) has been acknowledged worldwide as one of the most preva-
lent forms of human rights violation, in both developed and developing regions. It is estimated that 20
to 25 percent of women in Europe have suffered physical violence (Council of Europe, 2011). However,
the real number of survivors is believed to be much higher due to a large underreporting rate. Gender-
based violence affects women disproportionally due to a direct link to the unequal distribution of powers

     and resources between women and men; women also have fewer options to avoid or escape abusive sit-
     uations and to seek justice. They also are particularly vulnerable to negative consequences of violence,
     including forced and unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and reproductive health harms, sexually
     transmitted infections and HIV. The psychological stress and post-traumatic effects could cause the
     long-term negative consequences affecting all dimensions of women’s life.

     1.27.	 Ukraine has become the first post-soviet state, adopting the Law «On Prevention of Domestic
     Violence» (2001) with specification of legal and institutional bases to prevent and combat domestic
     violence. The respective provisions have been amended to other legislative acts, including the Criminal
     Code. Also, the relevant institutional environment has been developed to assist the survivors of violence
     through the social safety nets and assisting NGOs. In early 2014, there were 22 public and municipal
     centers of social-psychological assistance and 18 public social centers for mothers and children situated
     in most regions of Ukraine; some private, non-governmental and charitable foundations also provide
     support to survivors of domestic violence. The National Hotline on Domestic Violence, Trafficking in
     Human Beings and Gender Discrimination is operating 24/7 in the country. However, the problem of
     gender-based violence is still quite wide-spread in the country, being manifested in many ways: domes-
     tic violence, rape, physical assault, stalking, sexual harassment and trafficking in persons (Gerasymenko
     2015). Based on the official crime statistics (the Prosecutor General’s Office in Ukraine6), women con-
     stitute the overwhelming majority of the registered victims of offences of a sexual nature, in particular
     90.6 percent of rape survivors, 73.5 percent of domestic violence survivors and 76.5 percent of survivors
     in crimes related to trafficking in persons in 2014.

     1.28.	 Domestic violence committed by a husband or partner remains the most common type of VAW.
     Based on 2007 Ukraine Demographic and Health Survey (2007 UDHS), 24.4 percent of ever-married
     women aged 15-49 experienced some type of spousal emotional, physical, or sexual violence (Table 1.1).
     Of them, almost 13 percent report physical violence by their current or most recent husband/partner, 3.3
     percent–sexual violence by intimate partners, and 22.4 percent - emotional violence (UCSR, and Macro
     2008). Partner’s alcohol abuse can be regarded among the main contributing factors, as women whose
     husbands get drunk frequently are the most likely to report violence (56 percent of respondents in con-
     trast to 2 percent of women whose husbands do not drink).

24                   for UKRAINE
                                                                                            Chapter 1. AGENCY



1.29.	 The 2014 UNFPA Survey on Incidence of Violence against Women and Girls (VAW-2014)
was based on the DHS Domestic Violence Module to compare the results with data of 2007 (UNFPA,
2014b). The results revealed that the rate of physical spousal violence has even increased, while the
rate of sexual violence has not changed significantly. At the same time, the observed decline in the
prevalence of emotional spousal violence can be linked to the stressful impact of the armed conflict
and humanitarian crisis, leading to re-assessment of everyday values in front of the new challenges. As
a whole, these findings indicate a persistent character of domestic violence in the country, as well as
non-availability of the efficient mechanisms to prevent it through public policies.

1.30.	 The roots of wide-spread domestic violence in Ukraine should be largely associated with patri-
archal stereotypes on gender norms and unequal position of women in a society, their economic vulner-
ability and dependent role in a family. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in Ukraine
(MICS 2013), men are more likely than women to agree with one of the reasons to justify beating a
wife/partner (9.4 percent of men compared to 2.9 percent of women). The largest proportion of men
(7.5 percent) agreed that a husband has a right to beat his wife if she neglects the children, while 2.6
percent of them – if she argues, and 2.3 percent – if she refuses to have sex with him. Wide-spread
public perception of domestic violence as a personal or intra-family issue in Ukraine is associated with
a common social stigma put on survivors in communities and attitudes of victimizing them for pro-
voking behavior. As a result, the overwhelming majority of survivors (68 percent) do not apply for any
kind of assistance (UNFPA, 2014b). Due to few survivor’s appeals, the administrative crime statistics
of Prosecutor General’s Office in Ukraine do not reflect the actual scope of domestic violence: there
were 2,247 crime offences related to domestic violence registered in 2013, and this number dropped to
998offences in 2015. Importantly, domestic violence is not perceived as important social problem by a
population of Ukraine. Such public attitudes make a huge contrast with the results of Eurobarometer on
Gender Equality – 2009, revealing that 62 percent of Europeans think that gender-based violence (GBV)
should be a priority action in the area of gender inequality, while 92 percent of them believe that there
is an urgent need to tackle it (European Commission, 2010).

1.31.	 As to out-of-family GBV, a worrying trend has been observed in Ukraine: a share of female
survivors of non-family violence (committed by male acquaintances or strangers) increased in 2014.
Based on the 2014 VAW Survey (UNFPA 2014b), 5 percent of women experienced physical violence
outside of a family (in contrast to 3 percent of women in 2007), while 4 percent of women experienced
sexual non-family violence (2 percent of women in 2007). The overall share of women who experi-
enced physical and/or sexual violence increased from 18 percent in 2007 to 22 percent in 2014. Despite
high prevalence rates, the official crime statistics trace a decline in the registered crime offenses of a
sexual nature: the number of rapes dropped from 508 in 2013 to 421 in 2014 and to 323 cases in 2015
(Prosecutor General’s Office in Ukraine). Obviously, a lot of rapes stay underreported, as survivors do
not apply for assistance due to fears of a stigma or reprisal from the abuser; but the present public dis-
trust to the law enforcement, non-transparency of crime investigations and low efficiency of prosecution
in case of sexual abuse should be mentioned among policy constrains as well. It is widely acknowledged
that risks of GBV are increasing at times of armed conflicts and humanitarian crisis. Degradation and
ruining of the system of public services in communities, the lack of law enforcement, limited access to
health facilities and providers of social service result in the increased vulnerability of GBV survivors.
The rates of domestic violence could increase as well due to the stressful environment, while prevalence
of poverty and deprivations from a usual lifestyle could contribute to the increased scales of human traf-
ficking or forced prostitution. The 2015 UNFPA Survey on GBV in the Conflict Setting confirmed the
increased vulnerability of women to various forms of violence during the conflict: a share of displaced
women, reporting at least one situation of violence outside the family, was three times higher than the
corresponding share of local women, surviving any violence in the host communities (15.2 against 5.3
percent of respondents). According to statistics of the International Women’s Rights Center “La Strada
Ukraine’. the number of applications to the National Hotline on Domestic Violence has grown almost
by 200 percent during January-March of 2016, as compared with the identical period of 2015; many

     calls come from families of displaced persons and demobilized militarymen7. To address the challenge,
     the UNFPA Humanitarian Response Project launched the work of mobile teams of psychological sup-
     port in the conflict-affected regions, providing assistance to survivors of violence in remote settlements
     (UNFPA 2015).


     Trafficking in Persons

     1.32.	 For many recent years, Ukraine has been the top country of source, transit, and destination
     for trafficking in persons. Though various data sources provide different estimations of the scales of
     human trafficking, all of them indicate high rates of trafficking prevalence and high vulnerability of a
     population to this practice. Based on the IOM Survey conducted in February-March of 2015, about 40
     thousand persons have been trafficked abroad from Ukraine in 2012-2014 (IOM 2015); in aggregation
     with previous estimations (IOM 2006 and IOM 2012), the total number of victims could reach about
     160,000 persons since 1991. From January 2000 to June 2015, 11,237victims of trafficking were assist-
     ed by IOM in Ukraine, including legal aid, medical care, psychological counseling, financial support,
     vocational training, and other types of assistance. Since the launch of the National Referral Mechanism
     for assisting victims of trafficking in 2012, 94 persons have been granted with official status of a victim
     of trafficking (of them: 39 men, 39 women and 16 children).

     1.33.	 As well as in other countries of Eastern Europe, Ukraine’s social-economic situation is widely
     considered to be a major factor in the prevalence of trafficking in persons. Various authors mention
     that high unemployment and low living standards force people to accept the risky job proposals
     abroad, while active international labour migrations and low levels of awareness on the potential
     vulnerability contribute to the problem (Gerasymenko 2011; Weitzer & Zhang 2014; Petrunov 2014).
     More than a half (52 percent) respondents of the 2007 UDHS reported that they had heard of a person
     experiencing trafficking, while almost 10 percentof them personally knew someone who had such
     experience (UCSR and Macro 2008). The highest share of household respondents who have heard
     about actual victims of trafficking was observed in urban settlements (56 percent), among respondents
     with tertiary education (62 percent), and among representatives of the wealthiest quintile. In other
     words, rural residents, persons with lower education attainments and low income levels face higher
     risks of trafficking because of lower awareness on the problem scope. Also, wide-spread patterns of
     gender inequality in a society should be mentioned among determinants of trafficking in women, as
     they often have to seek unofficial, unskilled and non-prestigious jobs abroad because of particularly
     low wages (as compared to men) and common discriminative practices at the national labour market
     (Gerasymenko 2013).

     1.34.	 The recent trends in trafficking are characterized by an increase in a share of male victims, most-
     ly trafficked with purpose of labour exploitation during 2010-2014 (Figure 1.9a). While women con-
     stituted for 86 percent of victims of trafficking, assisted by IOM in 2004, their proportion has dropped
     more than twice (up to 42 percent in 2014). However, a share of women among victims started to grow
     during the first half of 2015, identifying the impact of the 2014 crisis on women’s position and vulnera-
     bility. Women absolutely prevail among victims of sexual exploitation; they have also constituted more
     than one-third of victims of labour exploitation during 2007-2014.

     1.35.	 The victims of trafficking are subjected to sex and labor exploitation within the country and
     abroad. According to the IOM, the main destination regions for Ukraine’s victims are Russian Federation
     (46 percent of assisted victims in 2015), Poland (13 percent) and other EU member states (14 percent),
     and Turkey (11 percent). Domestic trafficking has remained quite low, but its risks have significantly
     grown with escalation of the armed conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts of Ukraine. Presently, there
     are numerous voices highlighting the cases of gender-based violence and human trafficking in the re-
     gions. Based on evidence form assisting NGOs and hotline statistics in the region, the IOM identified the

trends related to sexual and/or labour exploitation of women and girls, exploitation of men at the armed
conflict and forced labour, increased scope of child begging (IOM 2015). The experts also emphasize
the increased vulnerabilities of IDPs to trafficking due to their economic hardship and lack of ties in the
host communities (OESC 2015). As on mid-2015, seven cases of trafficking (or attempts of trafficking)
were recorded among IDPs by IOM, while the National Migrant Advice reported a 14 percent increase
in the number of calls from IDPs on the Counter-Trafficking Hotline 527. That makes a particular chal-
lenge for public policies to combat trafficking and gender-based violence, provide proper assistance to
survivors and ensure prosecution of perpetrators.

1.36.	 According to the U.S. Department of State (2015), the Government of Ukraine does not fully
comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant
efforts to do so. In particular, the government adopted the standards of social services for victims; re-­
established the anti-trafficking unit as a separate, stand-alone subdivision; and significantly increased
the number of officers in the anti-trafficking unit. As a result, a proportion of successful court verdicts
increased, however the total number of investigated crime offences related to trafficking has dropped
since 2005 (Figure 1.9.b). In 2014, the law enforcement investigated 109 trafficking offenses (compared
with 130 in 2013), initiated prosecutions of 42 defendants (compared with 91 cases in 2013) and con-
victed 57 traffickers (compared with 109 in 2013). According to the Ministry of Internal, there were 80
criminal offenses registered during the first half of 2015 (an increase by 51 percent as compared with the
previous period). To raise the population awareness on the risks of trafficking, the national-wide infor-
mation campaigns are realized, including special lessons in secondary schools and tertiary institutions,
trainings and counseling for the risk groups, and social advertisements in the regions (such as regional
campaign “Your Safe Way to the Goal” in 2014).

     Chapter 2. ENDOWMENTS
     2.1.	    Human endowments in terms of accumulated health, attained education and physical assets are
     crucial for individual well-being and successful realization in a life. These capabilities are usually associat-
     ed with human capital, being important to take up economic opportunities and generate income. The gen-
     der gaps in endowments could be the primary reason of unequal women’s position in a society, constrain-
     ing their abilities for development and empowerment through deprivations from the base opportunities.

     2.2.	   Chapter 2 is devoted to assessment of the gender gaps in human endowments in terms of educa-
     tion and health. To address these issues, we analyze the gender disparities in enrollment to education and
     educational attainments of women and men in the first Section. The sex-age composition of a population
     and general demographics of the country are analyzed in the Second section. The gender dimension
     of public health, morbidity trends and lifestyle-associated problems in Ukraine are examined in this
     Section as well.


     A. Education
     2.3.	     Education is an important determinant of human development at individual level, shaping the
     opportunities of a decent job, incomes of employment and proper living standards. High educational at-
     tainments have been traditionally regarded as important advantages of women in Ukraine. Indeed, no sig-
     nificant gender disparities can be statistically measured in the rates of enrollment at most education levels
     (Figure 2.1). There are slightly less women among students of post-secondary (non-tertiary) institutions,
     providing vocational training; and women’s proportion has been declining there. However, this imbalance
     is compensated by women’s prevailing at the more advanced education levels, in particular among students
     of the first and second stages of tertiary education. Such trend is common for most countries of Eastern
     Europe and developed regions; it may be facilitated as by occupational segregation (vocational training is
     mostly associated with blue collar jobs common for men), as by gender stereotypes, forcing men to became
     breadwinners since the young age instead of studying. Another positive trend is seen in women’s growing
     interest in the second stage of tertiary education through taking postgraduate courses to obtain doctoral and
     PhD degrees. Still, women face considerable barriers, as they move up their academic careers.


     Primary and Secondary Education

     2.4.	    Primary school spans the first four years of education with a starting age of six in Ukraine. Due
     to the universal system of school education, offering equal access to boys and girls, there are no signifi-
     cant gender disparities in primary enrollment rates (Figure 2.2a). In spite of a small decline since 2000,
     the gross enrollment rates exceed the average ECA indictors as for boys, as for girls. The primary school
     completion rates have also increased in Ukraine during 2000-2013 (Figure 2.2b), indicating better inclu-
     sion of children into the education system.

     2.5.	    Enrolment rates for children in complete general secondary education are also quite high, as
     this level of education is compulsory in Ukraine and guaranteed by the State on a free-of charge basis.
     The official entrance age to lower secondary education is 10, while the theoretical duration of secondary
     education is 7 years. In the early 2000s, a small decline in the gross secondary enrollment has been ob-
     served, indicating a divergence from the trend common for the whole ECA region (Figure 2.3a). In spite
     of the recent increase in enrollment rates, Ukraine’s indicators are still slightly lower than in the ECA,
     reaching 97 percent among girls and 100 percent among boys in 2013.

     this education level has been quite stable in the ECA region during 2000-2013, vocational training in
     Ukraine was characterized by a sharp decline in the proportion of female students (Figure 2.3b). This
     trend was closely correlated with women’s drain to tertiary education due to a decline in the prestige of
     vocational training and their interest in higher education attainments, as well as because of the persistent
     gender-based segregation of employment.

     2.7.	    Despite the inclusive education model in Ukraine, there are some categories of children for
     whom appropriate training is not being provided. During 2014/15 academic year, 43,997 children aged
     6–18 were not attending general secondary schools for various reasons (Annex C). While more than
     one-third of these children were not in secondary schools for health reasons (including those with com-
     plex developmental disorders, who study in specialized institutions), 43.4 percent did not study because
     of other reasons, such as home education. A share of girls, who didn’t attend schools because of reasons,
     not associated with health, was by 5 percentage points larger than the corresponding share of boys - as
     in urban settlements, as in rural area.

     2.8.	    An important challenge for Ukraine’s inclusive system of education is provided by impact of the
     large-scale internal displacements caused by political destabilization in 2014-2015. These population
     movements affected as children (of pre-school and school age) and students, as education workers (such
     as teachers and lecturers). As a result, the continuity of educational process was broken for numerous
     contingents of displaced schoolchildren and students, as they were forced to get used to a new social
     environment, to get adapted to new locations of residence and schooling. According to the Ministry
     of Education and Science of Ukraine (MoES), there were 67.5 thousand displaced children attending
     preschools and secondary schools as on November 2014, of them 2.7 thousand children arrived from
     the Crimea, 42 thousand from Donetsk region, 22.8 thousand from Lugansk region. The number of dis-
     placed children reached almost 148 thousand persons in May of 2015. The MoES informed that more
     than 60 percent of the former Donbas students (i.e. about 90 thousand persons) were transferred to other
     tertiary institutions through the territory of Ukraine as on April of 2015. Also, almost 8 thousand stu-
     dents were transferred from the Crimea to other regions of Ukraine.

Tertiary Education

2.9.	    According to the WDI data, Ukraine’s rates of enrollment in tertiary education are much higher
than in the ECA region as on average. The gross enrolment rates have been increasing as for girls, as
for boys during 2000-2013 (Figure 2.4). In particular, women’s gross enrollment in tertiary education
reached 86 percent, while men’s gross enrollment – 72 percent in 2013. As a result, the gender gap in
tertiary enrolment has also increased from 6 to 14 percent in favour of women. Presently, women out-
number men in tertiary education in most developed regions, testifying as their higher aspirations to
obtain tertiary degrees to compete at the labour market, as girl’s higher preparation for higher education,
as evidenced by their test scores in secondary education (OECD 2008).

2.10.	 A large share of schoolchildren become students of tertiary institutions immediately after grad-
uating from school (19.5 percent of basic school graduates and 44.9 percent of high school graduates in
2014), which indicates a continuous transition from secondary to tertiary education in Ukraine. However,
access to tertiary education can largely depend on income inequality: based on data of Household Survey
in Ukraine (HHS), girls from low-income households are less likely to continue education after gradua-
tion from secondary school. To assess the gender disparities in enrollment to post-secondary education,
we use the data on students in households, and examine enrollment ratios among the population aged 17-
24 by gender and consumption quartiles (Figure 2.3b). The findings of this analysis reveal the important
dimension of women’s vulnerability: while male enrollment rates are almost identical in households
with different wealth status (at a level of 50 percent), women’s enrollment rates are much lower in the
bottom (poorest) quartile as compared with top quartile. That may reflect a particular impact of income
inequality on accessibility of tertiary education for women from low-income household, despite their
total prevailing among tertiary students.

     2.11.	 The impact of gender stereotypes is revealed through gender differences in the preferred fields
     of study. According to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, female students make the overwhelm-
     ing majority in the fields of healthcare, education and humanitarian sciences (more than 70 percent of
     all students with these majors in 2014/2015 academic year), while male students prevail among those
     who study in the fields of transport and communications, engineering, architecture and construction.
     Enrolment in natural science, social science, business and law is more gender-neutral (Figure 2.5).
     Importantly, the outlined gender-based preferences in selecting future occupations result from persistent
     gender stereotypes on the “proper” jobs for women and men, perceived in the early childhood and re-
     produced by the system of school education. Many studies emphasize the role of stereotypes on men’s
     and women’s roles in a society, which are persistent in the school tutorial materials and contribute to
     a further occupational segregation by gender at the labour market (Haydenko 2011; Ukraine National
     Review 2014; MDG 2015). In spite of development and introduction of gender studies syllabi and teach-
     ing materials in some Ukrainian universities, the overall transformation process in the field of education
     is still very slow. However, some shifts can be observed: according to the Ministry of Defense, the
     number of female students, who entered military education has grown almost twice in 2015 as compared
     with a previous year (103 against 47 female students).

     2.12.	 The composition of graduators from tertiary institutions by gender and obtained qualification
     confirms women’s interest in complete tertiary education, as there are more women among holders of
     higher qualification levels, such as Master’s Degree (Figure 2.6a). Importantly, a share of women among
     PhD holders has also grown recently (Figure 2.6b), reaching 57 percent in 2014. However, that may
     reflect the trend of social devaluation of employment in research and development due to low wages
     and men’s drain to more profitable sectors of economy. At the same time, women still make only 28.3
     percent of Doctors of Science that clearly indicates that certain barriers are in force, being associated
     with the ‘glass ceiling’ phenomenon in academic careers of women.

В. Health
2.13.	 Based on a definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), health is a state of complete
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Personal re-
sources and physical capabilities are essential in fostering opportunities of labour force participation,
income accumulation and career advancement. Better health outcomes are also associated with econom-
ic growth and sustainable development at the national level. In Ukraine, health inequalities could be
revealed through multiple gender gaps in terms of life expectancy and morbidity; importantly, gender
disparities in health outcomes are contributed by social factors and lifestyle-associated problems. In ag-
gregate, these disparities are accumulated in demographic trends and affect the sex-age composition of
a population. In turn, demographic processes shape the patterns of gender equality through intersections
between fertility rates and female labour force participation.


General Demographics and Sex-Age Composition of a Population

2.14.	 Ukraine has been experiencing a rapid population decline since the early 1990’s. According to
estimations of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine (2015b), the total population number has dropped
from 51.6 million persons in 1990 to 45.2 million persons in 2014. There were several determinants
of a shrinking population in force over this period, including low fertility rates, development of the
large-scale external migrations, and a small increase in the life expectancy at birth (in particular among
females since the mid-2000’s). The disastrous events of 2014 resulted in the unprecedented decline in
the total population as a result of annexation of the AR of Crimea; large population losses in the armed
conflict, postponed births and intensified external migrations contributed to this process as well. As on
early 2015, the total population number was estimated in 42.8 million persons (excluding the temporar-
ily occupied territories of the AR of Crimea). According to UN’s medium demographic projections, de-
population will progress in the nearest decades due to structural factors; as a result, the total population
of Ukraine could drop to 42.3 million in 2025 and to 35.1 million in 2050 (United Nations, Department
of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2015b).

     2.15.	 Presently, Ukraine is among nations with high rates of a population ageing. In 2015, persons
     aged 60 and over constituted for 22.6 percent of the total country’s population. At the background of
     the overall population decline, a population ageing is expected to progress in the next decades. Based
     on UN’s estimations, a share of persons aged 60+ could reach 25.4 percent in 2025 and 31.5 percent
     in 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2015b). It
     will result in the increased old-age dependency rates and significant burden for the pension and social
     protection systems. Also, such demographic shifts will pre-determine the new challenges for fiscal and
     insurance systems, the needs in reforming health care and education, and in new developments at the la-
     bour market and social infrastructure. In general, the whole system of social policies will require proper
     adjustments to the needs of elderly people.

     2.16.	 The sex-age composition of a population of Ukraine is characterized by important gender asym-
     metry (Figure 2.7a). While there are slightly more men among young persons (under age 30), a share
     of women is increasing in older age groups. Almost two-thirds of population aged 60 and over are fe-
     male, as women’s life expectancy largely exceeds that of men. Besides, women constitute 73.3 percent
     of population aged 80+. According to UN’s demographic projections up to 2050, a share of women
     among elderly persons will become even larger due to a progressing ageing and women’s advantage in
     average life expectancy (Figure 2.7b). Thus, public policies on ageing should consider gender-sensitive
     implications, as more women will face a need in the life-long education and skill upgrading to retain in
     employment as time passes.

     2.17.	 To address the challenges of ageing and to sustain the economic development, the pension reform
     has been realized in Ukraine, a new legislation entered into force in 2011. Unlike most post-socialist coun-
                                       creased the retirement age for both women and men (i.e. gender differences
     tries which have proportionally in­
     remained mostly unchanged), Ukraine’s women’s retirement age (57 as of now) would be gradually raised to
     reach men’s retirement age (60) in 2021. In terms of gender equality, this measure will provide positive effects,
     as women’s earlier retirement is associated with smaller pension benefits, longer periods of “retired” life
     and higher risks of poverty in old age (UCSR and UNFPA 2014). On the other hand, women may encoun-
     ter higher risks of unemployment in the pre-retirement ages, as employer’s biased attitude to older workers
     is among the main forms of discrimination in employment in Ukraine (UCSR and UNFPA 2012).

2.18.	 A sharp decline in fertility was among the principal determinants of a progressing population
ageing. The total fertility rate (TFR) has dropped from 1.8 births per woman in 1990 to 1.1 births per
woman in 2000 due to the aggravated living standards over transition period and because of structural
factors related to the effects of “demographic waves” in the population structure. Since then, a gradual
increase in fertility has been observed (Figure 2.8a); however the current TFR (1.506 births per wom-
an in 2013) is not sufficient to provide even a simple replacement of generations. The Government of
Ukraine made important efforts to increase the birth rates through allocation of generous maternity ben-
efits in the mid-2000’s; the total amount of benefit was increasing with child birth order until 2014, when
this norm was abolished. Although some growth of TRF has been observed, demographers argue that
such monetary instruments of pronatalist policy could provide only a short-term effect (Libanova 2012).

2.19.	 Ukraine’s fertility patterns are also quite different from the European ones in terms of age-spe-
cific birth rates (Figure 2.8b). Most women tend to have their first children before age 30, which could
potentially affect their opportunities of employment and career advancement due to prolonged maternity
leaves. In the early 2000’s, Moldova, Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Belarus had the lowest mean age at the
first birth among all European countries (Aksyonova 2014). In 2012, the mean age at the first childbirth
was 24.5 in Ukraine, while it varied significantly across Europe from 24.1 in Moldova to 30.8 in the
United Kingdom (28.7 as on average across EU-288). At the same time, a positive trend was observed
in Ukraine’s adolescent birth rate, as it has dropped from 32.1 to 27 live births per 1,000 girls aged 15-
19 during 2000-2014. Still, this rate is much higher than that in developed countries of Europe (12.6
births across EU in 2012). This demographic indicator is particularly important for gender assessment,
as it is well-acknowledged that adolescent pregnancies have negative health consequences, while early
motherhood is associated with adverse social effects, including education attainments and opportunity
of employment.

     Life Expectancy at Birth and Mortality

     2.20.	 Despite high rate of a population ageing, Ukraine substantively lags behind the European coun-
     tries in longevity. The transition period was featured with a significant deterioration in the health of
     a population due to degradation of the healthcare and decline in the living standards. As a result, the
     average life expectancy at birth has been significantly lower than in the whole ECA region. Though a
     slow growth has been observed since 2000 (Figure 2.9a), Ukraine’s average life expectancy at birth is
     still among the lowest in Europe (71.4 years in contrast to 83.3 years in EU-28 in 2013). As a whole,
     the gender disparities in life expectancy at birth in favour of women are common for most developed
     regions and vary from 3.2 years in Sweden to 11.1 years in Lithuania across the EU Member States
     (Figure 2.9b). However, this gap is particularly large in Ukraine, reaching 10 years in 2013 (the average
     life expectancy was 76 for women and 66 for men).

     2.21.	 The gender gap in life expectancy at birth is contributed by higher rates of mortality among
     men, exceeding the average rates of Europe and the ECA region (Figure 2.10a). The age-standardized
     death rates of men (1,495.1 per 100,000 population in 2013) were almost twice higher than the female
     age-standardized death rates (787.2 per 100,000 population). Despite of a notable progress over the last
     decade, adult mortality rate was 295 per 1,000 males in contrast to 114 per 1,000 females in Ukraine in
     2013 (the corresponding mortality rates were 178 and 79 per 1,000 population in Europe as on average).
     The gender gap in mortality is primarily affected by extra-high death rates among men of the working
     age. In particular, the largest gender disparities are observed among persons aged 20-29, as male deaths
     rates in this age group exceed female death rates more than 3 times.

2.22.	 It is important to highlight the gender disparities in the cause-specific structure of mortality: a
share of external death causes is significantly larger among male population (10.6 percent of total deaths
in 2014 in contrast to 2.6 percent of female deaths). As most of these death causes are preventable (such
as injuries, poisonings, suicides, etc.), the primary reserves of the increased life expectancy should be seen
in expansion of preventive policies to avoid any risky behavior and life-style associated problems. Male
higher death rates from injuries are associated as with traffic accidents (according to WHO, age-standard-
ized death rates of road traffic accidents were 21.5 per 100,000 males age 16+ and 5.1 per 100,000 females
aged 15+ in 2008), as with occupational injuries. Based on the State Statistics Service (2015d), there were
6,440 survivors of occupational injuries registered in 2014, of them 886 persons died. Men accounted for
89.8 percent of lethal injuries at employment (4,908 total deaths); most of them took place in mining indus-
tries, and were related to violation of the working discipline. Such statistics largely result from the gender
structure of employment in hazardous works, where men absolutely prevail.

2.23.	 Stressful employment, unhealthy diets, alcohol abuse and tobacco consumption contribute to
the increased mortality rates among men; with regard to the gender-related views in a society, these
factors are closely associated with a emotional pressure of men’s breadwinning role and responsibility
for their families. Levchuk (2009) identifies far greater alcohol-related mortality among males, as com-
pared with females in Ukraine: estimate 40 percent of deaths among men and 22 percent among women
aged 20-64 were attributed to harmful effects of alcohol. Ischemic heart diseases, undetermined injuries
and other accidents, alcohol poisoning, as well as cirrhosis of the liver, produce the largest gains in life
expectancy in this regard. Indeed, the age-standardized death rates of liver cirrhosis among males more
than twice exceeded the corresponding death rates among females (56.7 versus 23.7 per 100,000 pop-
ulation aged 15+ in 2012). There is also a worrying trend of increase in this type of alcohol-attributed
mortality as among men, as among women during 2000-2012 (Figure 2.11a).

     2.24.	 Current cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among men, in particular in rural area of
     Ukraine (Figure 2.11b). As to women, special sociological surveys reveal that they are more likely to
     smoke if they are young, live in large cities and have a university education. In 2005, smoking prevalence
     among the male population was the highest in the WHO European Region, reaching 67 percent (WHO
     2008). As a result, the WHO (2012) estimates the proportion of deaths attributable to tobacco in 25 percent
     for men and 2 percent for women (696 deaths per 100,000 men and 53 deaths per 100,000 women among
     population aged 30+). To address the challenge, the Law on Measures to Prevent and Reduce the Use of
     Tobacco Products and their Harmful Impact on the Health of the Population was adopted in 2005, while
     Ukraine ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2006.

     2.25.	 As to such base demographic indicators as infant and under-five child mortality, they demon-
     strate rather positive dynamics in Ukraine. Both children’s death rates declined sharply during the
     2000’s, being lower than the average ECA indicator (Figure 2.12). Still, Ukraine lags far behind the
     average EU rate in terms of infant mortality: in 2014, there were 8.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in con-
     trast to 3.8 deaths per 1,000 live births in the EU (and 10.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in the ECA). The
     present concerns are related to the children’s coverage with immunization. In contrast to full children’s
     coverage of the early 2000’s, the current rate of vaccination against TB dropped to just 56.5 percent
     of eligible children, while that of vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) to 38.4
     percent, against poliomyelitis to 44.7 percent, and against hepatitis B to 48.5 percent. That may have
     inevitable negative consequences in terms of a population health and epidemiology risks. Positively,
     several rounds of the national polio vaccination campaign reached 81.7 per cent of targeted children,
     according to Ministry of Health statistics.

2.26.	 The maternal mortality rate has also decreased from 24.7 to 15.2 deaths per 100,000 live births
during 2000-2014. Such a decline was largely contributed by actions conducted in the framework of the
State Program on the Reproductive Health of the Nation until 2015; in particular, 98 percent of pregnant
women were covered with antenatal care in Ukraine (MoH Center of Medical Statistics 2015). However,
maternal mortality in Ukraine still remains much higher than the average rate in the EU and the ECA
region (Figure 2.13a).

2.27.	 According to the State Statistics Service (2015c), 71 maternal deaths were recorded in 2014, of
them 44 deaths were directly related to obstetric causes (such as complications during pregnancy, deliv-
ery and postnatal period), while 27 deaths were related to any other disease, aggravated by pregnancy
(Table 2.1). Extragenital pathologies contributed to the largest share of maternal death causes (Figure
2.13b), with cardiovascular diseases prevailing. As a whole, Ukraine was placed at the 69th position out
of 179 countries in the global rating by Mother’s Index, which is estimated to assess the level of moth-
er’s well-being (UNICEF 2015).

2.28.	 As a whole, depopulation and related negative demographic trends have been recognized as
important challenges in the context of economic growth and human development by the Governments
of Ukraine, and the National Strategy of Demographic Development up to 2015 and the relevant Plan
of Action were approved yet in 2006. The main goals of the Strategy were targeted at: increase in fer-
tility rates and support to families, improvement of a population health, and decrease in mortality rates,
regulating migratory movements, providing adequate response to a population ageing and facilitating

     a disease that existed before or emerged during pregnancy, not related to a direct obstetric cause but aggravated by the physiological effects of the
     pregnancy.

General Morbidity and Communicable Diseases

2.29.	 The total structure of population mortality is characterized by certain gender asymmetry (Annex
E), which is particularly obvious for communicable diseases. Though women demonstrate quite higher
rates of disease incidence by almost all classes of diseases (i.e. number of diseases registered for the
first time), that may reflect women’s larger disposition to apply for medical assistance in case of disease.
Considering men’s higher death rates of all relevant death causes, morbidity statistics may also indicate
that women usually tend to apply for medical help at earlier stages of illness. For example, while inci-
dence of diseases of neoplasm was 1.5 times higher among women as compared with men (1,015 firstly
registered cases per 100,000 women in contrast to 653 firstly registered cases per 100,000 men in 2014),
there were much more male’s deaths attributing to neoplasm. At the same time, incidence of injuries,
poisoning and other consequences of external causes is significantly higher among men (5,127 in con-
trast to 3,072 firstly registered cases per 100,000 population), largely contributing to their high mortality.

2.30.	 Tuberculosis (TB) remains a particular problem in Ukraine, as the country was ranked among
27 high-multi-drug resistant -TB burden nations by the WHO. Despite the adoption of the Stop TB
Strategy by the National TB Program, its components have not been  sufficiently implemented. The
number of TB deaths has dropped twice during 2000-2013 (from 22.3 to 11.2 deaths per 100,000 popu-
lation), but it is still much higher than that in the ECA region (Figure 2.14a). The TB death rate started
to increase again in 2014, most probably due to a decline in the living standards due to the conflict and
large-scale internal displacement, leading to broken schemes of TB treatment and unmet medical needs
of the sick people. As to the gender dimension, the TB incidence has been traditionally much higher
among male population; in particular, there were 89.2 newly registered cases of active form of TB per
100,000 men in 2014 in contrast to 34.5 cases per 100,000 women (Figure 2.14b). The gender dispari-
ties are particularly notable among the mid-age population, as men constitute for more than three thirds
of total persons with active form of TB in the age group of 45-64. Thus, the epidemiological situation
with TB continues to pose a serious challenge for the public health in Ukraine and requires the priority
measures to be controlled.

2.31.	 Another important challenge is posed by expansion of the HIV/AIDS epidemics. According to
the UNAIDS estimates at the beginning of 2015, 264,489 cases of HIV infection have been officially
registered in Ukraine since 1987, while over 35 thousand persons have died of diseases attributed by

     AIDS9.As a result, Ukraine accounts for 25 percent of AIDS‐related deaths of their total number estimat-
     ed for the Eastern Europe and Central Asia. To address the problem, combating HIV/AIDS was targeted
     among the Millennium Development Goals in Ukraine, and some positive results have been achieved in
     collaboration with international donors. In particular, an important decline in the rate of mother-to-child
     HIV transmission should be mentioned. As a result of increased coverage with preventive antiretroviral
     therapy (ART) for women diagnosed with HIV during their pregnancy (from 9 percent in 1999 to 94
     percent in 2014), the rate of such ‘vertical’ transmission of HIV dropped from 27.8 in 2001 to 4.3 in
     2012.Importantly, the recent political destabilizing and armed conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts
     particularly affected the situation with HIV/AIDS response, as many HIV-infected people stayed at
     the non-government controlled areas, having no access to ART. In spite of the deep crisis, the National
     Special‐Purpose Social Program to fight HIV/AIDS for 2014‐2018 was adopted in 2014, addressing the
     implementation of a broad package of interventions to stabilizing the epidemics.

     2.32.	 Men still account for the majority of people living with HIV in Ukraine, but women’s share is
     gradually growing, reaching almost 44.2 percent in 2014 (Figure 2.15a). Such increase is largely contrib-
     uted by the growing role of sexual transmission of HIV in contrast to parenteral form of transmission com-
     mon for the early 2000’s. In 2005‐2014, a share of persons who were infected sexually increased from 19
     to 42 percent among men and from 53 to 86 percent among women. That may result from the insufficient
     rate of comprehensive knowledge about HIV prevention, as less than a half of women (46 percent) and
     men (45 percent) have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and transmission based on the
     2007 UDHS results10. According to the MICS 2012, 90.6 percent of women know where to get tested for
     HIV, but only 62.9 percent have actually done so. Despite the fact that 87.3 percent of men know where
     to get tested, only 52.2 percent of men have done so. The knowledge of HIV is particularly low among
     young people. Based on the UNICEF study in 2012-13, only 10 percent of adolescents and young people
     have any lifetime experience of HIV testing (15 percent for girls and only 7 percent for boys), while only
     28 percent of them correctly identify the ways of HIV transmission (Balakireva et al 2013).

             Comprehensive knowledge is defined as: 1) knowing that both condom use and limiting sex partners to one uninfected person are
             HIV/AIDS prevention methods, 2) being aware that a healthy-looking person can have HIV, and 3) rejecting the two most common
             local misconceptions, namely, that AIDS can be transmitted by kissing and by sharing food and utensils with someone who is infected
             with the AIDS virus.

Reproductive Health and Family Planning

2.33.	 According to the WHO, reproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible,
satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if,
when and how often to do so. Implicit in this are the right of men and women to be informed of and to
have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice,
and the right of access to appropriate health care services that will enable women to go safely through
pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. To address
the need in family planning, the network of specialized institutions was established in Ukraine, while
the targeted governmental programs have been realized to improve the reproductive health, including
“Family Planning”, “Reproductive Health 2001-2005”, and “Reproductive Health of the Nation for the
Period Until 2015”. With implementation of the program, the government has, for the first time, support-
ed the purchase of contraceptive supplies that will be provided at no cost to women who should avoid
pregnancy or childbirth for health reasons.

2.34.	 In general, a steady trend towards a decline in the number of unwanted pregnancies and abor-
tions was observed in Ukraine (Figure 2.16a). During 2000-2014, the number of abortions declined by
almost 70 percent (from 32.1 to 10.37 per 1,000 women of reproductive age). Of this number, 58 percent
were cases of pregnancy terminated at a woman’s request, while the remaining cases occurred for medi-
cal reasons such as spontaneous abortion, miscarriage etc. The prevalence of teenage pregnancy has also
declined from 17.76 in 2001 (per 1,000 girls aged 15–17) to 11.83 in 2014. The abortion rate decreased
from 7.74 per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2001 to 1.83 in 2013, which indicates that pregnant girls more
often decide to give birth than to terminate the pregnancy. Despite this notable decrease in the number
of abortions, the teenage pregnancy remains a pressing problem. In total, prevalence of abortions can be
considered quite high in Ukraine: more than a half of the 2007 UDHS respondents (58.2 percent) report-
ed about at least one abortion, while 37.2 percent had had two or three, and slightly fewer than 5 percent
had had four or more abortions. According to the 2012 MICS, 13.9 percent of pregnancies occurring
during the three years preceding the survey ended in abortions. The results of the 2007 UDHS showed
that knowledge of at least one modern method of family planning in Ukraine is universal among both
women and men, regardless of marital status. The 2012 MICS indicates that a half of female respondents
reported having ever used a pregnancy prevention method, with 48.9 percent of them using modern
methods, and 31.9 percent preferring traditional methods (MICS 2013).

2.35.	 Despite a notable improving, the health of pregnant women still requires increased attention, as
its poor state often affects the course of pregnancy and health of the newborns. According to the MoH,
one in four pregnant women experience anaemia during her pregnancy (Figure 2.16b), while one in
sixteen women – diseases of blood circulation system. The issues of reproductive health were consid-
ered in the programs of universal coverage of pregnant women with prenatal medical care. In particular,
introduction of technologies of the clinic protocol “Anaemia of pregnant women’ was accompanied
with positive dynamics of prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women (Figure 2.16a). Still, a lot of
problems persist, including high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (for instance, incidence of
the new cases of syphilis was 9.8 per 100,000 men and 7.5 per 100,000 women in 2014) and increase in
infertility. According to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (MoH), 6.8 percent of spousal pairs (about 1
million of families) experienced the problem of infertility. The estimated rates of infertility were 3.5-2.8
per 1,000 women and 0.5 per 1,000 men11. However, Ukraine still lags far behind the developed coun-
tries of Europe in term of use of the assisted reproductive treatment (ART): in 2011, the latest year for
which figures are available, 588,629 treatment cycles were reported from 33 European countries, France
(85.4 cycles), Germany (67.6), Italy (63.8), Russia (56.2), Spain (66.1) and the UK (59.8) being the
most active countries12. At the same time, there were only 16.1 thousand ART cycles in Ukraine in 2013

Chapter 3. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES
3.1.	   The outcomes of economic opportunities are revealed through access to income and economic
resources, determining the material well-being of individuals, their households and communities. In
aggregate, equal economic opportunities contribute to a sustainable economic growth associated with
high living standards and low income inequality. Gender inequality in economic opportunities can be
traced in multiple dimensions, including participation at the labor market and access to employment,
remuneration of work, and self-realization through career advancement or entrepreneurship.

3.2.	    To address these particular gaps, we provide the assessment of gender disparities in the la-
bour force participation, economic inactivity and unemployment by background characteristics of a
population, and specific features of employment patterns across gender in Section A. In this Section,
gender-based segregation of employment is also examined, as well as prevalence of gender discrimi-
nation at the labour market and gender dimension of labour migrations. Section B is devoted to a deep
analysis of the gender gaps in earnings and incomes, including the poverty risks. The issues of unequal
distribution of paid and unpaid work among women and men are considered in this Section as well. In
Section C, we examine the gender-based challenges in career advancement and access to top managerial
positions in Ukraine, as well as business opportunities and financial inclusion for women and men.


A. Labour Market
3.3.	     Employment is the main form of realization of the economic activity and the major source of
income for individuals, their households and entire communities. At the level of the global Millennium
Development Goals, full and productive employment and decent work for all were adopted as a central
target in eradication of poverty (ILO 2009). Importantly, employment not only provides the earnings,
but also allows expressing of self-fulfillment and empowerment. With this regard, the concept of the
decent work has been developed and put on the global agenda by the International Labour Organization
(ILO). The concept involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, secu-
rity in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and

Labour Force Participation

3.4.	    The overall labour force participation rate has dropped in Ukraine since the early 1990’s due
to transformations of the transition period and the increased share of inactive population, as well as be-
cause of extension of the period of study and higher enrolment to education. The respective decline has
been observed as for females, as for males. As a result, Ukraine’s male labour force participation rate
has been significantly lower than the EU and ECA averages during the whole period (increasing from
71.6 to 73.5 percent of male population aged 15-64 during 2000-2014). However, female labour force
participation rate was even higher than the average EU rate in the early 2000’s due to a historical pattern
of high women’s economic activity in post-socialist states. Based on the modeled ILO estimates (WDI
2015), it stayed almost unchanged during 2000-2014, being around 62-63 percent of female population
aged 15-64 (Figure 3.1). At the same time, female participation rate has been steadily growing in the EU
Member States; as a result, Ukraine is currently lagging behind the EU in this regard. As this gap is also
contributed by Ukraine’s lower retirement age for women (the standard European retirement age is 65
regardless of gender), the on-going increase in the women’s retirement age will obviously reduce this
gap through increased female labour force participation rate.

3.5.	    When estimated for the whole population aged 15 and over, Ukraine’s labour force participation
rates across gender are very close to the regional ECA and EU averages (Figure 3.2a). In fact, Ukraine’s
labour force participation rate for females (53.5 percent for population aged 15+) is even higher than that

     percent points in 2014) is also quite similar to the EU average (correspondingly 13.9 percent points).

     3.6.	   Gender patterns of the labour force participation or inactivity are largely dependent on factors
     associated with marriage and parenthood. Based on Ukraine’s Labour Force Survey (LFS) microdata,
     the largest gender gap in economic activity is observed among married population (the labour force
     participation rates for married population aged 15-70 were 75.5 percent for men and 60.7 percent for
     women in 2014). Besides women’s earlier retirement age, such a difference could be associated with
     persistent social views on the ‘proper’ gender roles, explored in Chapter 1. In particular, male’s role of
     breadwinners poses a need in their active position at the labour market to maintain their families, while
     married women could prefer economic inactivity and status of a housewife. To support this assumption,
     the gender gap in labour force participation is declining among divorced people at expense of women’s
     increased activity at the labour market. Several factors could contribute to the last trend, including a
     need to provide the decent living standards after separation, as well as women’s ‘deliberation’ from
     family duties and expanded opportunities of employment and career advancement. The lowest rates of
     labour force participation are common for widowed and never married persons, who represent rather
     elderly people and youngest population.


     3.7.	    The total number of inactive population increased from 11,945 to 12,023 thousand persons
     during 2010-2014; women accounted for more than 60 percent of them. Based on the national estimates,
     there were 7,370.3 thousand inactive women (43.9 percent of total female population aged 15-70) and
     4,652.7 thousand inactive men (30.7 percent of total male population aged 15-70) in 2014. The key rea-
     son for non-participating in the labour force for both men and women was related to their pension status
     (52.3 percent of inactive women and 55 percent of inactive men). The second significant reason for male
     inactivity was the pursuit of education (Figure 3.3); however, a share of students has decreased among
     inactive population as compared with 2005. In contrast, a substantial drain of the labour force into the
     household sector occurred, making engagement in domestic (family) duties the second largest reason for
     female non-participating in the labour force. The role of other reasons for economic inactivity, such as
     health state, disillusionment, seasonal character of work, and expectations for return to a previous job,
     is less important.

     Employment Trends and Background Characteristics of Employment

     3.8.	   Employment-to-population ratio is a base indicator of accessibility of work, indicating the op-
     portunities of getting a job. As a whole, female employment-to-population ratio remains lower than that
     of males all over the world; however, while a narrowing of the gender gaps in unemployment rates can
     be observed in Europe (ILO 2012), the Ukraine’s trends are not so obvious. The employment rate for
     Ukraine’s women was 55.2% in 2014, which was lower than the EU-28 average of 59.6%, but exceeded
     the indicators of some South European countries, such as Greece and Italy (Figure 3.4). At the same
     time, female employment rate in Ukraine was much lower than that in the Nordic countries (about 70%
     for women aged 15-64).

     3.9.	   As compared with the early 2000’s, employment-to-population ratios have grown as for men, as
     for women. But, statistics reveal that male employment rate is more sensitive to economic cycle impacts
     (Figure 3.5a), as it was clearly affected by the economic crisis of 2008-2009, while female employment
     rate demonstrated even a slow growth at that time. However, political destabilization and the 2014 crisis
     had a significant impact on labour market opportunities as for men, as for women, as employment rates
     have dropped by about 5 percent points for both population groups.

     3.10.	 Like in most developed countries, there is a positive correlation between the level of education
     and labour market participation rates in Ukraine (Figure 3.5b). Except the first stage of tertiary edu-
     cation, better educational attainments are associated with higher rates of employment for both sexes.
     Thus, a further development of female educational potential is an important instrument to raise their
     competitiveness in the labour market, and women’s high enrolment to tertiary education will promote
     their employment opportunities and reduce the gender gaps at the labour market.

3.11.	 Also, some structural shifts have been observed in the age-specific employment patterns
(Figure 3.6a): employment rates have dropped among young women (ages 25-34), contributing to the
largest gender gap in employment rates. It may result as from women’s growing enrolment to tertiary
education, as from their higher vulnerability to unemployment due to a biased attitude of employers.
As women aged 25-34 belong to the most active reproductive age group, they could be taken as less
valuable workers because of potential maternity leave and extensive social guarantees provided by leg-
islation. At the same time, the smallest gender gap in employment is observed in the age of 40-49, when
the burden of family responsibilities upon women is minimized and more opportunities are open for
economic activities. Some sociological surveys confirm that maternity and related family obligations
are regarded as most prevalent reasons of a biased attitude of employers in hiring women as competitive
workers (UCSR & UNFPA 2012).

3.12.	 As a whole, women are guaranteed with an extensive system of protective measures and specif-
ic benefits related to maternity in Ukraine. Like in most post-soviet states, they are entitled to the paid
maternity leave for a mandatory minimum length of 70 days prior to and 56 (in case of health prob-
lems - 70) days after childbirth. During this period women receive 100 percent of their wages provided
by the state social insurance system. Following, a mother (or a father) can take up to 3 years (in some
cases - up to 6 years) of parental leave; she (he) is also guaranteed an equivalent position after a leave.
Women are entitled to social benefits on children (Annex F), but due to a small amount of most benefits,
many parents return to work earlier. According to estimates of the League of Social Workers of Ukraine,
the average duration of parental leave is 9-12 months in Ukraine13. Also, the current legislation guaran-
tees a lower production/service rate for pregnant women or their transfer to easier jobs, elimination of
any impact of unfavourable production factors based on medical conclusion, with retention of average
earnings in the previous job; it is prohibited to employ pregnant women and women with children under
3 at night or overtime work, or work on holidays, and to send them on business trips; and dismissal of
pregnant women is penalized by the law. Women with children aged 3-14 or disabled children enjoy
limited employment in overtime work and business trips; the right to additional paid leaves for women
with two or more children; the right to additional paid breaks for child feeding for women with children
under 18 months. In practice, these additional measures of social protection often turn into employ-

     3.13.	 The impact of maternity on employment opportunities is also revealed through a reverse cor-
     relation between the rates of female employment and number of children. Based on LFS , the rate of
     employment for women having only one child was about 70 percent in the age group of 25-49, while it
     made only 40 percent for women having 4 children and more in the same age group (Figure 3.6b). The
     key factors of such dependency should be seen not only in lower competitiveness of women with many
     children at the labour market due to additional family responsibilities, but also in their changing prior-
     ities of work/family balance. Availability of childcare is also quite important to address the problems
     of working women with family obligations, but there is a systematic lack of affordable pre-schools in
     Ukraine, in particular in rural area. For example, the enrolment rate for children aged 3-5 was 82.5 per-
     cent in urban pre-schools in contrast to only 57.5 percent in rural area (State Statistics Service 2015f).
     As of early 2014, there were no pre-schools in 17,800 rural settlements having children under 6, while
     the nearest kindergartens were 3–5 km away (State Statistics Service 2014a).

     3.14.	 The disparities in access to work are most obviously reflected in the rates of unemployment.
     Women are more likely to be officially registered as unemployed in the Public Employment Service
     (PES). In particular, they accounted for 54.6 percent of total registered unemployed in 2014, when
     801.8 thousand women and 666.7 thousand men were registered with the PES. Respectively, the rates
     of registered unemployment were 2.8 percent for women and 2.1 percent for men. In this regard, Kupets
     argues that the gender gaps in unemployment coverage are caused by men’s lower propensity to register
     with the PES, resulting in unequal unemployment benefits and participation in active labour market
     programmes (Kupets 2010). At the same time, the LFS estimates (based on the ILO definition of unem-
     ployment) reveal significantly higher unemployment rates, when analyzing the actual labour force sup-
     ply in Ukraine. Since the early 1990’s, there have been more unemployed men in the total labour force
     (Figure 3.7). Such trend has been observed due to economic restructuring and closure of large industrial
     enterprises. Except economic reasons, lower rates of female unemployment in Ukraine could indicate
     women’s readiness to accept low-paid and less prestigious jobs because of lower competitiveness, not
     better job opportunities.

3.15.	 The impact of economic downturns is also well reflected in the trends of unemployment, indi-
cating that the number of unemployed largely increased in 2009 due to the impact of economic crisis
(Figure 3.7a). It also increased dramatically in 2014, following political destabilization and the armed
conflict to reach 7.5 percent for women and 10.8 percent for men (ages 15-70). Though it is widely
recognized at the global level that economic crisis may lead to the increased vulnerabilities of women
at the labour market due to unemployment (United Nations 2009), the trend is not so clear in Ukraine.
In contrast, both crises of 2009 and 2014 hit mostly male employment. In particular, the male-dominat-
ed sectors (such as heavy industries and construction) were the first to experience the economic losses
and short-cuttings. As women constitute the majority of employed in the public sector (particularly, in
education, health care, social service and public administration system, etc), they turn out to be more
secured in terms of employment.

3.16.	 The large-scale internal displacements of 2014-2015 posed new challenges of providing IDPs
with opportunities for employment. According to the PES, about 64.3 thousand persons from the AR
Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts have applied for assistance to regional departments of the PES
in all oblasts of Ukraine from March 2014 to January 2016; the largest numbers of applicants were
registered in Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Poltava, Lugansk oblasts and Kyiv city
(PES 2015). The PES assisted 17.6 thousand persons in placement in jobs, while 3.8 thousand unem-
ployed were arranged to receive occupational training, 5.5 thousands were engaged in public works. As
on January 31 of 2016, 9.9 thousand registered IDPs were receiving services of the PES, of them 9.1
thousands were officially unemployed. Women constituted for more than two-thirds (71.7 percent) of
the total registered unemployed among IDPs, while their share varied from 64 percent in Zakarpattya
oblast to 79.6 percent in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast. Such gender composition of the registered unemployed
IDPs results as from women’s prevailing among displaced persons, as from their higher vulnerability in
displacement.

3.17.	 Statistics confirms that women’s return to employment in case of losing a job could take more
time as compared with men (Table 3.1). There are also more women among the long-term unemployed
(for 12 months and more), who face particular risks of poverty and social exclusion. In particular, the
long-term unemployment rates were 22 percent for women and 19 percent for men in 2014. In addition,
the highest risks of unemployment are common for young people (aged 15-24), who face persistent con-
strains in finding a job due to a lack of skills and experience of work. The gender gap in unemployment

     Gender-Based Segregation at the Labour Market

     3.18.	 According to the 2012 World Development Report, women and men tend to work in very dif-
     ferent parts of the “economic space,” with little change over time, even in high-income countries (World
     Bank 2012). Indeed, gender-based segregation of employment is among the most enduring aspects of
     labor markets all over the world (European Commission 2009, Eurofound 2013), shaping the persistent
     gender inequalities in opportunities, earnings and career advancements. The patterns of gender-based
     segregation may take different forms, being traced across occupations and sectors of economic activity
     (i.e. horizontal form of segregation), and across levels of managerial positions (i.e. vertical form of seg-
     regation). In most societies, the increased concentration of women in ‘female-dominated’ sectors and
     occupations is associated with lower levels of remuneration for work, devaluation of labour, and lower
     social prestige of professions.

     3.19.	 The ILO reports argue that sectoral segregation of employment by gender has increased global-
     ly over time with women moving out of agriculture and industry into services in developed economies
     (ILO 2012a). As to gender-based occupational segregation, there is also some evidence of a decline in the
     1990’s and a stalling of this convergence in the last decade. The recent estimates for Europe (European
     Commission 2014) revealed that just 18 percent of women work in mixed occupations (where either
     women or men account for 60-40 percent of total employed), while 69 percent of women work in fe-
     male-dominated occupations, and 13 percent of women work in male-dominated occupations (Figure
     3.8). In contrast, only 15 percent of men work in mixed occupations and 59 percent of them work in
     male-dominated occupations. In Ukraine, female employment is more diversified, as only 57.8 of total
     employed women are concentrated in female-dominated occupations; there are also much more women
     in mixed occupations (27.8 percent of total employed women). In contrast, male employment looks
     more concentrated, as 61.2 percent of employed men work in male-dominated occupations, while 22.9
     percent of them are employed in mixed occupations.

3.20.	 To estimate the levels of gender-based segregation, Duncan’s Index of Dissimilarity is used, pro-
viding a measure of concentration of employed women / men within various sectors and occupations
(Duncan & Duncan 1955). The recent trends in Europe are outlined with a slight decline in the aggregate
occupational index and a slight rise in the sector index over the period of the recession and austerity
(2007-2012). Importantly, these changes have been driven mostly by shifts in male occupations, including
destruction of male-dominated jobs in construction and manufacturing. The similar trends have been ob-
served in Ukraine over this period; however, both indices for the gender-based segregation grew again in
2014 (Table 3.2), indicating the increased concentration of women and men in their traditional occupations
and sectors of economic activity. Such an increase has negative impacts in terms of the labour market flex-
ibility and mobility of the labour force, constraining the economic opportunities for both men and women.

Note: occupations are classified based on the ISCO-88, while economic sectors are classified based on NACE Rev.-1. The values of Index of Dissimilarity
range from 0 to 100 and measure the relative separation or integration of gender across occupations / sectors. If the value equals 0, it means the
occupations are distributed evenly between male and female, if the value is 100, it means the occupations are completely segregated. The detailed
methodology on calculation of Duncan’s Index of Dissimilarity is available at: (Duncan & Duncan 1955).

3.21.	 Presently, the gender-based sectoral segregation of employment is quite high in Ukraine. Just as in
most developed regions, women realize their economic activity mostly in service sector, while men are much
more represented in industrial activities (particularly in mining) and in the services needing black-collar
workers (Figure 3.9). The traditional ‘female-dominated’ types of economic activity are presented by sectors
of education (77.2 percent of women among total employed), health care and social protection (83.2 percent),
financial and insurance activities (70.7 percent), and accommodation and food service activities (68 percent).

     3.22.	 As to occupational segregation, women are usually over-represented in the mid-skilled jobs,
     like ‘office clerks’, ‘customer service clerks’ and ‘sales workers’, while men prevail among ‘crafts,
     plant and machine operators’, and at managerial positions (ILO 2012a). In Ukraine, the ‘female-dom-
     inated’ occupations consist also of mid-level intellectual jobs, such as ‘life science and health as-
     sociate professionals’, ‘teaching associate professionals’, and ‘teaching professionals’ (based on the
     International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88)15. Most of these occupations provide
     opportunities to use the educational advantage of women at the labour market, but they do not guaran-
     tee high returns of education in terms of earnings. In contrast, male-dominated occupations are mostly
     represented by manual labour occupations, such as ‘metal, machinery and related trades workers’;
     ‘drivers and mobile-plant operators’; ‘extraction and building trades workers’; ‘labourers in mining,
     construction, manufacturing and transport’ (Figure 3.10). As to intellectual work, men prevail among
     ‘physical, mathematical and engineering science professionals and associate professionals’; obviously,
     such segregation reflects the gender disparities in the preferred fields of tertiary education. Another
     important gender-based disparity is found in male domination at the top managerial positions, such as
     ‘directors and chief executives’, ‘legislators and senior officials’, ‘managers of small enterprises’. At
     the same time, the mixed occupations (such as ‘subsistence agricultural and fishery workers’; ‘depart-
     ment managers’, ‘machine operators and assemblers’, ‘personal and protective service workers’, ‘agri-
     cultural, fishery and related labourers’) are characterized by rather close-to-parity gender composition
     of employed in Ukraine (Annex G).

3.23.	 Gender-based segregation is determined by some objective factors. In particular, the legislation
of Ukraine bans women’s employment in some hazardous and dangerous occupations, heavy works, and
underground works. As a result, men constitute for almost 80 percent of employed population, working
in conditions, non-compliant with sanitary-hygienic norms; in particular, there were 252.6 thousand
women and 934.1 thousand men working in such conditions in the end of 2013 (State Statistics Service
2014b). The hazardous factors of production, which provide the most frequent impact for women, in-
clude: noise, infrasound, ultrasound, special microclimate in a room, inconvenient working position,
intensity of work and hazardous chemical substances. The list of the banned occupations was approved
by the Ministry of Public Health of Ukraine yet in 1993, containing more than 500 types of works in
various sectors of economy. For example, women cannot be involved into ‘works associated with con-
tinuous replacement of loads of more than 7 kg’, women’s labour cannot be used at night and overtime.
In fact, some of these requirements are quite outdated and failing to meet the real needs of both workers
and employers at the modern labour markets. In contrast, they could pose additional constrains to equal
opportunities based on the informed individual choice of preferred types of forms of employment. In
some cases, the names of occupations approved by the National Classifier of Occupations of Ukraine
(SC 003:2010) are already female-attributed (e.g. nurses, midwives, typists, needlewomen, etc.). The
deep roots of the gender-based segregation of employment are also facilitated by stereotypic attitudes

     and family education.


     Patterns of Employment

     3.24.	 The quality of employment is important in terms of the decent work and economic opportuni-
     ties. A lack of security is associated with vulnerable employment, comprising of contributing family
     workers and own account workers, whose work is performed for low pay or no pay at all (as opposed
     to wage and salaried workers). Globally, the vulnerable employment is more widespread for women
     than for men (50.4 percent of employed women, compared to 48.1 percent of men in 2012). However,
     a smaller share of women is engaged in this type of employment in the developed regions: in particular,
     the vulnerable employment rate was 10.0 percent for women and 14.3 percent for men in the EU as on
     average in 2012 (WDI 2015). As compared with the EU, Ukraine is characterized by slightly higher
     rates of vulnerable employment among men and much higher rates of female vulnerable employment
     (Figure 3.11a). During the 2000’s, no progress has been observed in achieving secured employment in
     the country, as a share of vulnerable employment increased from 9.2 percent in 2000 to 17.3 percent
     in 2005, and stayed at this level up to 2013. Female vulnerable employment has been higher than that
     of men during the whole period except 2014, when it reached 13.2 percent in contrast to 15.9 percent
     among men (Figure 3.11b).

     3.25.	 The prevailing numbers of population in vulnerable employment are engaged in the informal
     sector, having no guarantees of social protection and non-participating in any insurance schemes16.
     As a whole, the informal employment accounted for one-fourth of the total employment in Ukraine in

           According to the guidelines of the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, informal employment comprises of:
           1) own-account workers and employers employed in their own informal sector enterprises; 2) contributing family workers;
           3) employees holding informal jobs; 4) members of informal producers’ cooperatives; 5) own-account workers engaged in the
           production of goods exclusively for own final use by their households (ILO 2003).

                                                                                                                     Chapter 3. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES



2014 (based on LFS). Men constituted for 57.8 percent of all informally employed (correspondingly
2,620.3 thousand men and 1,920.6 thousand women). Since 2008, the informal employment has been
growing in the country, mostly at expense of men (Figure 3.12). A share of informally employed
women remained almost the same over this period (at a level of 21-22 percent of total female employ-
ment), most probably due to prevailing participation of women in the public sector with its formal
employment. In contrast, the male informal employment has grown from 22.2 to 28 percent during
2008-2014.

3.26.	 Based on the LFS data, the smallest share of informally employed is observed among people
with high educational attainments. In 2014, there were only 7.3 percent of informally employed wom-
en and 11.4 percent of informally employed men among employed with tertiary education (Figure
3.12b). The corresponding shares of informally employed are increasing for employed persons with
vocational training and incomplete tertiary education (to 22.5 percent for women and 29.1 percent for
men). Informal employment is most prevalent among population with primary education, accounting
for 67.1 percent for employed men and 88.9 percent for employed women. Thus, high education can
be regarded as a competitive advantage not only in terms of having a job, but also in the context of
secured employment. Besides, this correlation is much more pronounced for women’s employment
opportunities.

3.27.	 As to specific sectors and occupations, the informal employment is particularly prevalent in
agriculture (and, respectively, among rural population), as well as in elementary occupations common
for all types of economic activity (almost a half of employment in elementary occupations was informal
in 2014). To be more specific, 46.7 percent of informally employed women worked in the sector of agri-
culture, forestry and fishing, and 31.3 percent of them in the wholesale and retail trade. As to informally
employed men, more than one-third of them worked in agriculture as well (35.5 percent), 25.7 percent
of them worked in construction, and 14.8 percent of them worked in wholesale and retail trade.

3.28.	 As in other countries of Europe (European Commission 2008), women are more likely to be
involved into part-time employment than men in Ukraine. Based on Eurostat database, about one-third
(32.2 percent) of the women aged 15–64, who were employed in the EU, worked on a part-time basis in
2014, a much higher proportion than the corresponding share for men (8.8 percent). In Ukraine, women

                                                                                                                                    for UKRAINE
                                                                                                                                                          57

     also accounted for more than two-thirds of total part-time employed population in 2014 (correspond-
     ingly, there were 351.6 thousand women and 164.2 thousand men employed for part-time). A share of
     part-time employed women is much smaller than in the EU (only 7.4 percent among total employed
     females), that may result from a lack of flexible working arrangements. The largest proportions of fe-
     male part-time employment are common for such sectors as ‘transportation and storage’ (16.3 percent),
     ‘arts, entertainment and recreation’ (15.2 percent), ‘accommodation and food service activities’ (13.1
     percent), and ‘education’ (10.3 percent). Importantly, while some cases of part-time employment could
     reflect individual preferences, a lot of them may also stem from constraints such as a lack of care ser-
     vices or low financial incentives to take up full-time work.

     3.29.	 As to detailed use of the working time, about 23.3 percent of women worked less than 40 hours
     per week in comparison to 15.9 percent of men in 2014 (based on LFS data). In contrast, 15.6 percent of
     men worked for more than 40 hours per week, while a share of women, who worked over the normative
     working time was only 9.9 percent. As a result, the average length of weekly working hours was 38
     for women and 40 for men. Obviously, this difference in hours worked is reflected in the gender gap in
     monthly earnings.


     Labour Migrations

     3.30.	 The informal employment problem is particularly important with regard to intensification of la-
     bour migrations from Ukraine. All over the world, labour migrants usually fill up some marginal niches
     in the labour supply in the recipient countries; they also agree to work at workplaces that do not attract
     local residents. As a rule, migrants are employed in jobs requiring low skills, and agree to work for low
     pay and in unfavourable working conditions, while their job placement is not properly legalized, leaving
     them in the informal sector. Labour migration patterns could differ across gender in terms of sector of
     employment, length of staying abroad, amount of earnings, etc.

     3.31.	 According to the Ukraine Labour Migration Survey (IOM 2013), 1.2 million persons (or 3.4
     percent of a population aged 15-70) were identified as labour migrants from January 2010 until June
     2012. The main destination countries for labour migrations included Russian Federation, Poland,
     Italy, Czech Republic, Spain, Hungary and Portugal. Men prevailed over women among migrant
     workers, making up to two-thirds of the total number of labour migrants. In particular, a share of
     labour migrants among men aged 15-70 was estimated in 4.8 percent, while the corresponding share
     among women was 2.2 percent. There were 4.3 times more men than women among younger migrants
     (age group 25–29), but the number of women 6.8 times exceeded the number of men among migrants
     aged 60–70.

     3.32.	 The present international migrations are increasingly shaped by a growing demand for house-
     hold services, which include domestic work and care for incapacitated family members and among
     which women traditionally prevail. Indeed, working as a domestic servant is the most common ac-
     tivity of female labour migrants from Ukraine (50.2 percent of all female migrants), in particular in
     such countries as Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. As the absolute majority of domestic workers
     are employed with no proper legalization, they are particularly vulnerable to violation of their labour
     rights. According to the Ukraine’s Labour Migration Survey, only 16.5 percent of domestic workers
     had written agreements to formalize their employment. As to other types of economic activities com-
     mon for labour migrants from Ukraine, women are mostly engaged in agriculture and trade (Table
     3.3). Male migrant workers are mainly engaged in construction in all destination countries (67.2 per-
     cent of all migrants), while the second-largest sector of agriculture accounted for only 9.1 percent of
     their employment.

3.33.	 Migrant workers mostly remit the money earned abroad to Ukraine, which significantly im-
proves the welfare of their families. According to the National Bank of Ukraine, the amount of private
money transfers to Ukraine increased from 6.2 to 8.5 billion USD during 2008-2013; it is almost com-
mensurate with direct foreign investment and constitutes 4% of the GDP (ILO, 2013). According to the
World Bank, labour migrants sent home an estimated US$9 billion in remittances in 2014, the largest
amount in the region, representing 5.4 percent of GDP (World Bank 2013a). The average men’s earn-
ings were higher than average women’s incomes (Table 3.4), reaching USD 996 and 813, respectively.
Interestingly, despite smaller female earnings abroad, the Ukraine Labour Migration Survey (ILO 2013)
revealed that women remit larger amounts than men do. That may indicate women’s stronger connection
to a family even in case of working abroad, as well as more responsible attitude to the need in supporting
their children, parents and relatives.

3.34.	 Despite important economic contribution of migrants’ remittances into well-being of their fam-
ilies, the intense labour migrations have quite negative social and demographic consequences. Children
could be deprived from parental support in transition to adulthood, while broken family ties, and care
deficit for elderly family members pose multiple challenges for social policies to address their needs.
Left-behind children are particularly vulnerable to the risky behaviors and deteriorated health, juvenile
delinquency and emotional problems. According to the Ministry for Family, Youth and Sports, there are
about 200,000 children left behind by Ukrainian migrants, while one-quarter of all children are raised by
one parent in the regions, most affected by immigration (such as Western Ukraine). The scale of migra-
tions and the impact of remittances on domestic economies have prompted the Government of Ukraine
to partner with EU Member States and international organizations to develop policies addressing the
welfare of migrants and those left behind.

     Unpaid and Domestic Work

     3.35.	 Unpaid work is the production of goods and services by household members that are not sold
     on the market, but provided for the consumption within the family, such as cooking, gardening or house
     cleaning. Voluntary work, such as helping out neighbours, caring for elderly or people with disabilities,
     supporting charities, assisting immigrants, also contribute directly and indirectly to societal well-be-
     ing. Women traditionally do much of the unpaid and domestic work in all societies, but it is not mea-
     sured in economic indica­  tors. To account women’s contribution with unpaid work to the economy,
     some countries have even launched the practice of preparation of the ‘satellite’ national accounts that
     consider household work depending on the time spent or on the market value of the services provided.
     Importantly, domestic work could require even more intense physical efforts and time spending than
     paid employment, thereby substantially limiting women’s opportunities and prospects of development.
     That’s why contemporary scientific studies describe gender features in working time distribution in
     terms of women’s ‘double burden’.

     3.36.	 Across the 29 countries for which data were available (OECD 2011), people average 3.4 hours
     per 24-hour day on unpaid work, the equivalent of 14% of their total time. The gender gap is on aver-
     age 2 hours and 28 minutes per 24-hours day, but there is significant divergence across countries. For
     instance, Turkish, Mexican and Indian women spend per day 4.3-5 hours more on unpaid work than
     men in those countries, while the difference is only a little over one hour per day in the Nordic states.
     Though there is no regular practice of assessment of time budgets spent for paid and unpaid work in
     Ukraine, some information is available based on special sociological surveys. According to the UCSR
     and UNFPA (2012), two-thirds of employed and married women reported that their husbands were en-
     gaged in household work for only 1-10 hours a week, and about a half of them said that their husbands
     spent the same amount of time to care for family members needing continuous attendance (children,
     elderly persons, persons with disabilities). In contrast, more than one-fourth of the interviewed women
     spent more than 20 hours weekly for household work, and 15% of them spent the same time on care for
     family members.

B. Earnings, Incomes and Poverty
Income of Employment
3.37.	 The gender gap in earnings is the main display of gender inequality in economic opportunities,
accumulating the impact of multiple gender disparities in the patterns of employment, segregation of the
labour market, returns of individual endowments, or preferences for working hours. The gender gap in
earnings is a global phenomenon, varying between regions and nations; according to the empirical evi-
dence, the largest gap is observed among high-paid workers (ILO 2015). According to the ILO, the average
earnings of women make only 77 percent of the average earnings of men globally, and the ratio has grown
only by 3 percent point during the last decades. Thus, the international progress in facilitating gender
equality in wages is still low and will require additional efforts to be addressed.

3.38.	 In Ukraine, women averagely earned only 76 percent of men’s average monthly wage in 2014
(UAH 3,037 and 3,979 per month, respectively)17. This unadjusted pay gap is quite comparable with some
countries of the ECA region (Figure 3.13a), but is much larger than the average EU pay gap (16.4 percent
in the EU-27 in 2013). Hence, achieving the standards of the European developed democracies in terms of
gender equality in remuneration of work will require significant efforts in Ukraine. This task is particularly
challenging, as analysis of dynamics of the gender pay gap over 2000-2014 reveals that there are no efficient
instruments to reduce the gap through gender policies; it depends largely on the impact of macroeconomic
processes and labour market regulations. Though the monthly wage gap has decreased from 29 to 24 percent
during 2000-2014, there were controversial fluctuations observed over this period (Figure 3.13b). In 2005, an
impulse to a gradual decline in the gender pay gap was provided by the start of implementation of the Unified
Tariff System in the public sector of Ukraine, which consists of the most female-dominated economic activi-
ties (such as education, health care and social work, public administration, etc.). However, the minimum pay
gap, registered in 2009-2010, was related to the impact of financial and economic crisis, when male-dominat-
ed industries were hit most severely. In other words, the narrowing of the gender pay gap during the crisis was
contributed not by increased women’s earnings, but rather by a decline in the average men’s wages. In 2011,
the gender pay gap started to grow again, as the Government restored the Unified Tariff System for employees
in the public sector. Since then, a slow increase is taking place in the wage gap across gender.

     3.39.	 Besides administrative statistics on wages, the HHS data also confirm that women tend to earn
     less than men do (Figure 3.14a,b). Importantly, the population distribution by average monthly wage
     from the main job reveals that more women are concentrated in the low-wage sector, while there are
     more men receiving higher incomes (Figure 3.14b).

3.40.	 Remarkably, the gender pay gap is observed even in the economic activities, in which women
prevail (Annex H). As more detailed disaggregation of statistics shows, low-paid economic activities
usually feature smaller gender wage gaps: for example, the smallest disparities are typical for health
care and social work, education, administrative services and public administration (Table 3.6). Also, in
the sector of ‘libraries, archives, museums and other cultural activities’, the average female wage was
even somewhat higher than the average male wage. This can be explained by the equalizing effect of the
minimum wage, which becomes more apparent amid low-paid branches. In 2014, a very small gender
pay gap was registered in construction; it may result from a decline in the average male wages due to the
crisis. In contrast, the largest pay gaps are typical for economic segments with high remuneration rates,
such as financial intermediation, mining and manufacturing. In fact, while the gender pay gap in mining
industries is associated with legislative restriction for women’s employment in underground works, a
large difference in wages in financial intermediation with ‘female-dominated’ employment looks quite
groundless and poses a need in argumentation of unexplained part of the gender pay gap.

3.41.	 The impact of occupational segregation on the gender pay gap is revealed also through regional
variation of disparities in average wages between women and men. Thus, the largest gender gaps in
wages are traditionally observed in the industrially developed regions of the Eastern Ukraine, including
Donetsk (41.8 percent in 2014), Dnipropetrovsk (31.2 percent, respectively), Lugansk (30.5 percent),
Zaporizhzhya (29.3 percent) oblasts. These regions are characterized by concentration of ‘male-domi-
nated’ heavy industries and generally higher rates of wages. In contrast, the agrarian regions are char-
acterized by lower average wages and respectively smaller gender gaps in payments; in particular the
minimum gender wage gaps were registered in Kherson (10.3 percent), Ternopil (10.4 percent), and
Zakarpattya (11.8 percent) oblasts.

3.42.	 Despite occupational segregation, there are some other determinants of the pay gap in force,
including disparities in education, length of service, size of enterprise, occupation and average working
hours. To provide a more detailed analysis of the gender disparities in wages, we use the data of a sam-
ple Enterprise Survey on Wages conducted in 2012 (State Statistics Service 2013). The key findings of
the Enterprise Survey confirm that the gender gaps in wages are increasing at larger enterprises and are
associated with much higher male’s wages there (Figure 3.15): while average women’s wage was even
slightly higher than the average men’s wage at small enterprises, it was three times smaller than men’s
one at large enterprises (with more than 1,000 employees). A similar trend was observed in terms of the
length of service: the smallest pay gap was common for employees, servicing for less than 2 years (14
percent), while the gender gap was 34 percent among employees, servicing for 15-19 years, due to larger
men’s earnings. The gender pay gap was declining among employees, servicing for 20 years and more,
as most of them are represented by persons of the pre-retirement age, who may face age-based biased

     attitude at the labour market, regardless of gender. The findings of the Enterprise Survey on Wages also
     prove that tertiary education remains the important instrument to address the gender inequality in earn-
     ings, providing women with opportunities to compete at the labour market and increase their income of
     employment. The smallest gender gaps were observed among persons with complete tertiary education
     (22 percent), while the pay gap was increasing to 35 percent among persons with secondary education.

     3.43.	 To assess contribution of various factors into the pay gap across gender, we analyze the gross
     monthly wages from the main job based on 2013 HHS. The primary distribution of results confirms that
     women tend to earn less than men regardless of any socio-demographic background or characteristics
     of employment (Annex I). An important finding obtained from the HHS is associated with observed
     correlation between the gender pay gap and type of settlement: the gap is growing with increased size of
     settlement, being almost twice larger in large cities (31.1 percent) than that in rural area (15.9 percent).

     3.44.	 Decomposition of the gender wage gap based on Oaxaca-Blinder approaches18 reveals that ob-
     served characteristics explain only a minor share of the monthly wage gap across gender. The estimated
     regressions explaining the men’s and women’s monthly wages for 2013 HHS data were used to develop
     threefold and twofold Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the gender wage gap (Annex J). As shown in
     Table 3.7, the estimated wage gap was 23.9 percent. The ‘explained’ part of the wage differentials (re-
     lated to some objective determinants) accounted only for 8 percent of the gap. In contrast, the absolute
     majority of the wage gap (92 percent) is contributed by the unexplained part, related to difference in
     returns to observed characteristics for men and women. Occupational segregation (sector variable) is
     the key observed factor explaining the wage gap, and contributing to the unexplained part as well. At the
     same time, education, experience and type of settlement tend to narrow both unexplained and explained
     parts, providing a positive contribution to a decline in the gender inequality in earnings. Importantly, as
     most components of the unexplained part are also associated with a decline in the wage gap, we may
     assume that discrimination accounts for the majority of the gender gap in average wages. Although some
     proportion of the unexplained part may be also dependent on some omitted determinants of the pay gap
     (such as difference in the working hours between men and women or concentration of men among the

Note: HHS’s yearly data on the average wage from the main job were used for Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. A positive sign of components indicates
increase in wage gap. Explanatory variables include age, education, sector of economic activity and type of settlement dummies. Though the
regional differences in wages are also significant in Ukraine, they are not considered in decomposition because of a large correlation with sectoral
variables and types of settlement.

3.45.	 Prevalence of gender-based discrimination at the labour market of Ukraine is indicated by data
from multiple sociological surveys, special monitoring studies of human rights organizations and CSOs,
reports by the Representative of the Parliament of Ukraine for Human Rights, and the results of inspec-
tions conducted by the State Labour Inspectorate of Ukraine. In particular, there were 213 episodes of
violation of the labour rights of women in the framework of inspections of 32 thousand enterprises in
201319. Furthermore, according to the ILO study, up to 10 percent of the advertisements in printed me-
dia are discriminatory, while this share is increasing to 15 percent when making content analysis of the
specialized job-seeking websites. Between 2 and 14 percent of respondents of the sociological survey on
the prevalence of gender-based discrimination (UNFPA 2014a) reported having encountered discrimi-
nation personally or through their friends and relatives. The most prevalent forms of a biased treatment
were related to discrimination in hiring (14 percent), women’s lower pay for doing the same work (10
percent), and lower representation in business as compared with men (10 percent). In reality, the degree
of discrimination could be substantially higher because of the taboo around talking about this subject or
due to the respondents’ inability to identify discrimination.


Income, Poverty Risks and Vulnerability

3.46.	 As income of employment is the main source of incomes for the working age population (pro-
viding for more than 80 percent of aggregate income for men and women in this age group), the gender
pay gap contributes to disparities in aggregate income between women and men (Figure 3.16a). Among
the total population of Ukraine, wages account for a smaller share of aggregate income due to a large
role of pensions, common for ageing societies. A share of wages is more important among the total male
population, constituting for more than two-thirds of aggregate income (68.5 percent) in contrast to 58.5

     percent among female population. Also, shares of income of business activities and self-employment
     are somewhat larger among males, though they generally account for a small proportion of aggregate
     income for both population groups (8.4 percent among men and only 3.2 percent among women). In
     contrast, the role of pension is increasing for the total female population, because of women’s earlier
     retirement age and prevailing among elderly (a share of pensions was 36.7 percent in women’s income
     versus 22.1 percent in men’s income).

     3.47.	 The gender disparities in average wages contribute to the respective gap in pensions, as the last
     ones are directly determined by a size of wage and length of service. However, the dynamics of pen-
     sions (and respective trends in the gender gap) was more complicated during 2000-2014, being largely
     dependent on social policy regulations in contrast to economic factors (Figure 3.16b). In particular, the
     gender gap in pensions on age was significantly smaller than the gap in wages until 2004, because of
     a strict limit of the maximum pension and applied approaches to calculate pensions20. Implementation
     of the new approaches (the length of service and earnings for the entire working period considered) re-
     sulted in a sharp increase in the pension gap by gender in 2004. Later on, the minimum old-age pension
     was set at a level of the subsistence minimum for incapable people, and the gender gap was reduced
     due to equalization effect. Subsequent recalculation of pensions made in 2008 (updating the wage base
     for calculation of pensions, and raising the value of one service year from 1% to 1.35%) launched a
     new growth in the gender gap. As a result of economic crisis of 2008-2009, the minimum pension was
     frozen; a gradual decline in the gender gap has been taking place since then. The recently frozen social
     standards (due to the crisis of 2014) would probably lead to a further narrowing of the gender gap in pen-
     sions in the nearest future. As to the long-term prospects, the planned increase in the women’s retirement
     age should provide a convergence on men’s and women’s pensions because of the extended length of
     service for women. Importantly, the gender gaps in pensions indicate the multiple disadvantages women
     face in employment and income through their life-cycle. That may have important impacts on the living

     20	
           The old-age pensions were estimated as 50% of an individual’s wage over the recent 5 years of work, being increased by 1% for
           every year over the required service. The length of pensionable service affected only an allowance for over-the-norm service,
           whereas the wage difference was somewhat leveled with the aid of various mechanisms of artificial wage increase in pre-retirement
           years.

standards at old age, given women’s higher life expectancy compared to males. Thus, some efficient
measures are needed to address the gender pay gap, and to eliminate labour market barriers to skilled
and highly paid occupations and economic sectors for women.


Poverty and Vulnerability

3.48.	 Having lower individual incomes, women naturally encounter higher risks of poverty and find
themselves among vulnerable categories more often. Based on the 2013 HHS, women account for a
majority in the low-income population, applying for the state social assistance (Table 3. 8). Whereas the
number of women is 1.35 times larger than the number of men among recipients of benefits on children,
it is 1.43 times larger among recipients of privileges and as much as 2.25 times larger among recipients
of subsidies. This data indicates increased women’s vulnerability to poverty.

3.49.	 In Ukraine, poverty studies are based on several research approaches, including the absolute and
relative poverty lines21. Since 2000, Ukraine has made some progress in reducing the absolute poverty,
but it still remains a problem. During 2000-2013, a share of population with daily consumption below
USD 5.05 / USD 4.30 until 2005 (PPP) has dropped from 11.9 to 1.9 percent, while a share of popula-
tion with consumption below the actual subsistence minimum from 71.2 to 22.1 percent (MDGs 2015).
The relative poverty rate has been at a level of 27-28 percent in the early 2000’s; a gradual decline is
being observed since 2009. Unfortunately, the armed conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, economic
recession and devaluation of the national currency are expected to revert the previous positive trends.
According to estimates of the Institute for Demography and Social Studies of NASU, a new source of
vulnerability is presented by the ‘sudden’ poverty due to the lost property and livelihoods as a result of
the armed conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts (MDGs 2015). The risk of poverty is particularly
high for displaced persons, since they have to pay for housing and to replace lost household property
and majority of the long-term use goods. The Government provided IDPs with a range of social ben-
efit payments, but the amount of allowances remain quite small to provide the decent living standards
(UAH 884 per incapable person and UAH 442 per capable person; in aggregate, no more than UAH
2,400 per household monthly). Also, the Government suspended the payment of benefits to IDPs n
Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv oblasts, and started a procedure of their
verification in order to fight frauds in February of 2016. According to the Ombudsperson’s estimate, this
measure could affect as many as 500,000 people.



21	
      The absolute poverty line is based on a daily consumption below US$5.05 (PPP) per adult, being mostly used for interna-
      tional comparisons. The relative (national) poverty line is applied to categorize some population groups as ‘poor’ in case if
      their per capita incomes (expenditures) are lower than a selected criterion (75 percent of the median aggregate expenditures
      per adult). Finally, the subsistence minimum represents the officially established cost of a living per person, being approved
      annually by the Parliament of Ukraine, when setting the State Budget.

     3.50.	 The poverty rates are highly dependent on socio-demographic composition of households and
     residence place (type of settlement). Families with children represent the major group of increased pov-
     erty, as one in three households with children lives below the poverty line. Having one child raises the
     risk of relative poverty by 17 percent, whereas having three or more children increases it by as much
     as 42 percent (MDGs 2015). Obviously, poverty risks are increasing in single-parent households22, in
     particular with children under 3, as parents mostly stay on parental leaves and depend exclusively on
     social benefits over this period. The poverty risks are also increasing among rural population and pop-
     ulation of small cities with poorly developed labour markets and lower rates of income of employment.
     When non-monetary criteria are used (such as deprivations from the base social services), the rural
     poverty is particularly significant. In particular, 48 percent of women, living in the rural areas, do not
     have medical care centers or hospitals in the vicinity, 36 percent of rural women do not participate in
     decision-making in their communities and 67 percent of rural women do not access to Internet at home
     (UNDP 2015).

     3.51.	 Statistical assessment of poverty by gender is limited in Ukraine, as the national methodology
     is targeted at households as units of measuring. Thus, the data on individual well-being of household
     members cannot be disaggregated in terms of poverty. Theoretically, the disparities in poverty rates
     could be analyzed by gender of household heads, but the reliability of this data is low, as identification
     of a household head in the framework of the Household Survey could have quite a random character.
     So, the most reliable results of gender-based assessment of poverty could be obtained for single-person
     households only. Based on 2013 HHS, there are more female-headed households in Ukraine in most age
     groups, except population aged 25-39 (Figure 3.17). A share of female-headed households is particularly
     large among population aged 65 and over (65 percent of total households), reflecting the features of the
     sex-age composition of a population, with significant prevailing of women among elderly. There are also
     more women in the single-person households, constituting for more than 80 percent of such households
     among population aged 56 and over.

           Unfortunately, due to a small number of single mothers covered with the HHS, any statistical assessments of poverty for such

3.52.	 When estimating poverty rates for the entire female and male populations (HHS 2013), no im-
portant gender disparities can be revealed. However, the mentioned limitations of statistical assessments
should be taken into account in this case. Male poverty rates are somewhat higher than female poverty
rates as for the whole population (Figure 3.18a), as for most age groups (Figure 3.18b). However, wom-
en’s vulnerability to poverty is obvious among the elderly and among the age group of 20-29. Whereas
higher poverty rates of elder women result from lower pensions and lost residual working capacity pro-
viding the opportunity to earn additional income to complement pensions, younger women, who face
high poverty risks, belong to the most active reproductive age. As many of them stay on child-care leave,
their personal income depends on ‘generosity’ of child allowances and social benefits. In this regard,
it is important to improve targeting performance and efficiency of the whole social assistance system
to address the needs of the most vulnerable population groups, shaping the current poverty profiles in
Ukraine.

C. Career Advancement and Enterpreneurship
3.53.	 The opportunities of career development for women are featured with continuing barriers in
most societies, commonly known as ‘glass ceiling’. Accordingly, top management positions are pre-
dominantly occupied by men in most sectors of economic activities; as it has been discussed, they also
fill most of the CEO positions in public administration. The key factors in force for the ‘glass ceiling’
effect are related to the hidden discriminatory practices caused by biased corporate attitudes to women
at senior positions and the lack of efficient mechanisms of promotion. To address this challenge, some
countries introduced gender quotas among top managers and board directors. In particular, women’s
quotas for publicly-listed companies were introduced in Norway (2003), Spain (2007), Iceland and
France (2010), Belgium and Italy (2011), the Netherlands (2012), Denmark (soft target - 2013) and
Germany (2014), while gender quotas for state-owned companies were introduced in Denmark (2000),
Finland and Ireland (2004), Ireland (2006), Austria and Slovenia (2011), Poland and Greece (2012). As
a result, the number of countries with gender quotas for publicly-listed or state-owned companies has
increased from 7 to 24 percent in 2004-2014 (CWDI 2015).

     3.54.	 According to the findings of the Enterprise Survey (ES) in Ukraine (World Bank 2013b), wom-
     en have more chances to participate in firm’s ownership than to manage firms at top positions. The
     smallest representation of women is common for majority firm ownership (only 12.9 percent); however,
     all indicators are very similar to the average ECA rates (Figure 3.19a). During 2008-2013, the rates of
     female participation in top management and ownership have significantly dropped. While a share of
     firms with female ownership (47.1 percent) was almost equal to that of men in 2008 (also being much
     higher than the average for ECA), it has declined significantly during the next five years (up to 31.5
     percent). The percentage of firms with a female top manager decreased from 27.9 to 18.8 percent as
     well, staying below or at par with international levels. The proportion of women in the private sector
     workforce also decreased over this period, but it still remains at higher levels, as compared with ECA
     average (Figure 3.19b).

     3.55.	 As a whole, the patterns of female firm ownership and top management are very similar to the
     features of gender-based segregation of employment at the entire labour market: there are more women
     in firm ownership in the sectors of garment (61 percent) and retail (almost 50 percent), while they make
     up to 31 percent among owners of firms providing food and other services (Figure 3.20a). These sectors
     are also featured with relatively high women’s participation among top managers (from 55.3 percent
     in garment to 32 percent in retail). The ‘male-dominated’ sectors are represented by manufacturing,
     machinery and equipment, and non-metallic mineral products. Also, women’s participation is decreas-
     ing in top management of large firms (8.8 percent among managers of firms with 100 employees and
     more), but they are more likely to manage small firms (24.1 percent of top managers at firms with 5-19
     employees) (Figure 3.20b).

3.56.	 Women’s opportunities of access to business activities in Ukraine is also confirmed by the IFC
Survey (2011), indicating that there are slightly more women among small entrepreneurs (53 percent)
as compared with men. But, the Survey findings confirmed that female-headed enterprises are mostly
small and less profitable regardless of the sector of economic activity. Business activities in trade remain
particularly female-headed, as 70 percent of female entrepreneurs were concentrated in this sector (in
contrast to 38 percent of male entrepreneurs). Based on LFS, the structures of employment by status at
the labour market are also almost identical for men and women (Figure 3.21).

     3.57.	 According to the Enterprise Survey (World Bank 2013), Ukrainian firms reported access to
     finance and corruption as their biggest obstacles in doing business. In 2008, the role of political insta-
     bility increased for respondents as well; obviously, this factor has been in force for 2014 and 2015, as
     political destabilization, economic recession and armed conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts obvi-
     ously hit the sector of entrepreneurship in Ukraine, constraining the opportunities of doing business and
     investment attractiveness. In fact, firms’ access to credit has worsened in Ukraine yet over 2008-2013.
     A share of private firms with a bank loan or line of credit fell between 2008 and 2013 to levels below
     the average for lower middle income countries (ES 2013). Perceptions of corruption remained quite
     high among population, despite a slight improvement over 2014-2015, associated with establishment of
     anti-corruption bodies and emergence of the whistleblowers’ movement. In 2015, Ukraine was ranked
     130 out of 168 countries (142 rank in 2014), based on the results of the world Corruption Perceptions
     Index (Transparency International 2016), lagging behind most countries of the ECA, except Tajikistan,
     Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. As to Bribery Incidence, defined as the percentage of firms facing at least
     one bribe payment request when engaging in six different transactions for public services, permits, or
     taxes, it is significantly higher in Ukraine than in the ECA. The same pattern is observed with Bribery
     Depth which measures the pervasiveness of corruption by computing for each firm the percentage of
     transactions in which bribes were requested or expected. As a result, Ukraine’s rank (63.04) in the 2015
     Doing Business rating (World Bank 2016) was lower than the average score for ECA (69.82), lagging
     behind such comparator economies as Poland, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Belarus and Moldova.
     However, some positive trends in business opportunities should be mentioned for Ukraine, as the coun-
     try moved from 87 rank in 2014 to 83 rank in 2015 in the global rating, mostly due to significant im-
     provements in starting a business.


     Financial Inclusion

     3.58.	 Financial inclusion, estimated as access to financial accounts and loans, is among important
     dimensions of economic opportunities. According to the World Bank, access to accounts and payment
     mechanisms increases savings, empow­      ers women, and boosts productive investment and consumption
     (Demirguc-Kunt & Klapper 2015). As a whole, more than a half of total population of Ukraine had bank
     accounts in 2014 (54 percent of males and 51.7 of females), that was quite comparable with average of
     the ECA (Figure 3.22). During 2011-2014, a particular increase has been observed in women’s access to
     accounts, resulting in a significant decline of the corresponding gender gap. Presently, a share of women
     with accounts in financial institutions is even higher in Ukraine than in the ECA region. At the same
     time, very few persons use accounts at financial institutions for business purposes (3 percent of women
     and 5.5 percent of men) that may reflect the practice of informal activities.

     3.59.	 The gender gap is also observed in obtaining loans: a share of women, obtaining loans in the last
     year, was 43.2 percent in Ukraine in 2011, being by 4 percent point larger than the average for females
     in the ECA (Figure 3.22b). Still, a small gender gap in access to loans can be observed as in Ukraine, as
     in the ECA region, indicating smaller availability of finance programs to women. In total, one-third of
     women (33 percent) and 39.2 percent of men aged 15+ borrowed any money in the past year, 22 percent
     of both groups borrowed from family or friends, while only by 8 percent borrowed from a financial
     institution. As to purposes of these loans, the largest shares of respondents borrowed some money for
     medical purposes (12.9 percent of women and 7 percent of men), 3 percent of both men and women bor-
     rowed for education or school fees, while 4.9 percent of men and only 0.5 percent of women borrowed
     to start, operate, or expand their business (FINDEX 2015).

3.60.	 The gender gap is also observed in availability of savings. Based on 2014 FINDEX database,
17.9 percent of women and 20.8 percent of men saved any money in the last year (Figure 3.23a); a half
of males and about one-third of females (6.5 percent) had their savings in financial institutions. Most of
these savings were purposed to cover any future expenses, in particular, related to old age, emergencies,
or education fees (Figure 3.23b). Only 7.4 percent of men and 3 percent of women saved any money to
start, operate, or expand their farm or business.

     3.61.	 Finally, an important aspect of financial inclusion is seen in access to the advanced information
     and communication technologies (ICTs) in managing financial accounts. Men are more likely to use the
     Internet to pay their bills or buy any consumer goods (17.7 percent of men and 9.9 percent of women
     among population aged 15+); there are also more male users of electronic payment systems (7.6 percent
     of men and 5.4 percent of women among population aged 15+). Though these rates are quite comparable
     with ECA averages, Ukraine still lags far behind the EU members in terms of prevalence of ICTs use in
     personal financial operations. Thus, development of the comprehensive systems of electronic finance,
     and raising financial literacy of a population of Ukraine will contribute to better economic opportunities
     and access to financial resources.

Chapter 4.
CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1.	    The conclusions and recommendations presented in this Chapter address some particular gender
gaps revealed in the framework of the current gender assessment, including disparities in economic op-
portunities and access to income, endowments in terms of education and health, vulnerability to poverty
and representation in politics and decision-making, etc. The captured gaps are often mutually dependent
and originate from the same gender-based views and public attitudes, so the effective response re-
quires the systemic approach to cover the comprehensive efforts by various institutional sectors. In this
Section, we try to prioritize the gender gaps in terms of their impact on poverty and shared prosperity in
Ukraine. We start with highlighting the most important problems and continue with identifying the data
gaps and next steps to be taken. The recommendations are structured to address each particular gap with
consideration of the deep roots and causes of inequality. The findings of the Report could be incorpo-
rated into development strategies at the national and regional levels, targeted at reducing of the gender
disparities and inequalities. They might be used by the Government agencies, academic institutions and
think-tanks, international and civil society organizations, involved into developing, implementing and
coordinating gender policies in Ukraine.

The major gender gaps could be prioritized as follows:

4.2.	    Women’s political representation and participation in decision-making remains dispropor-
tionally low, hindering the progress in enhancing gender equality in other domains of public life. Thus,
ensuring the parity gender representation in politics and decision-making should call for the priority at-
tention. This task is particularly challenging because of a failure of affirmative actions taken to promote
the gender quotas in the electoral process. Due to a lack of the political will among stakeholders and ab-
sence of any sanctions for non-compliance with gender quotas, the recent practice showed that require-
ments could be ignored by political parties. Thus, the principal solutions should be seen in strengthening
the responsibility for non-compliance with norms on gender quota (such as exclusion of non-complying
parties from the electoral process) or legislative amendments to introduce mandatory proportional rep-
resentation of women and men within the elective lists of political parties. The advocacy campaigns
and proactive actions should be strengthened to promote women’s representation at top positions within
the parties as well. The experience of ‘soft’ quotas for women among chief executives in the system of
governance may be studied in details and discussed with experts. In general, to facilitate women’s activ-
ism, political parties, public authorities and civil society should be involved into leadership training for
young women that can encourage their engagement in politics and representation in decision-making.

4.3.	     The gender pay gap is the main manifestation of gender inequality in economic opportuni-
ties, reflecting the accumulated contribution of multiple gender disparities in employment. Whereas this
gap is largely dependent on sectoral segregation of employment (the largest disparities in wages are
observed in the ‘male-dominated’ economic activities, at large enterprises and at the competitive labour
markets of large cities), there is also an important correlation with socio-demographic background of
employed persons. The gender wage gap is increasing among workers with more extended length of
service, that may reflect the impact of maternity leaves. Also, empirical data reveal that obtaining of
high education can contribute to the increased women’s competitiveness in employment, and reduce the
gender gap in earnings. At the same time, the role of ‘unexplained’ part of the gender pay gap remains
quite important in Ukraine, being largely associated with direct discriminatory practices at the labour
market. Sociological surveys confirm the occasional cases of the gender-biased attitude of employers
and low population awareness on the instruments to defend their rights in case of discrimination. Thus, a
significant improving of the current anti-discriminatory mechanism is needed to provide its transparency
and accessibility to broad population groups.

4.4.	   The gender-based segregation in employment is progressing in Ukraine, being traced across
occupations and economic activities. In general, ‘female-dominated’ sectors are featured with lower


                                                                             Country gender assessment
                                                                                         for UKRAINE
                                                                                                               75
     Chapter 4.CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 



     average wages, lower social prestige and lower public value of work. The grounds of occupational
     segregation are formed yet in the system of education, though no significant gender gaps can be traced
     in terms of enrolment to the base educational levels. As to advanced levels, more men are enrolled into
     vocational training, being subsequently found in the blue collar jobs after graduation. More women tend
     to seek for tertiary education; the preferred fields of study also significantly differ across gender. To ad-
     dress this asymmetry, there is a pressing need in continuous gender expertise of the system of education,
     including curricula and manuals; gender sensivity of education workers should be also strengthened, as
     some of them still demonstrate the stereotypic attitudes to gender roles. Along with social stereotypes,
     the gender-based division of labour is largely dependent upon legislative restrictions of women’s em-
     ployment in hazardous works and occupations; some of these restrictions could be outdated at modern
     labour market and non-consistent with the principle of a freely chosen occupation. Thus, there is a need
     in re-viewing the current bans of female employment in accordance with the modern standards of the
     decent work and non-discriminatory principles. In contrast, development priorities should be focused at
     improving the working conditions for both women and men through short-cutting hazardous works in
     all economic sectors.

     4.5.	    Opportunities of entrepreneurship are associated with multiple constrains in Ukraine, access
     to finance and high expectations of corruption mentioned as the major ones by entrepreneurs. There are
     significantly more men in firm ownership and top management, while female entrepreneurship is mostly
     associated with smaller and less profitable businesses. The gender-based segregation contributes to the
     structure of entrepreneurship as well, as women’s firms are mostly operating in the ‘female-dominated’
     sectors. Whereas women and men have the equal access to finance through bank accounts, the gender
     gap is observed in obtaining bank loans. To address this challenge, some successful initiatives have
     been realized by international donors to promote women’s access to microcrediting in Ukraine; this
     practice turned out to be quite successful. Thus, the further efforts should be paid to supporting women’s
     entrepreneurship through conducting business trainings, providing individual consultancies on startup
     projects, and expanding women’s access to microcrediting.

     4.6.	   Multiple gender gaps could be traced in the patterns of employment, most of them associated
     with unequal distribution of family obligations across genders. There are more women in vulnerable
     employment, represented by own-account workers and contributing family members, whose work is
     performed for low pay or no pay at all. As compared with men, more women tend to be employed
     fewer working hours, having smaller opportunities of earnings and career advancement. Young women
     may face higher risks of unemployment, as the extended system of social protection on maternity and
     childcare could pose additional barriers related to a biased attitude of employers. The poverty risks are
     increasing among young women of the most active reproductive age (25-29); obviously single mothers
     represent another poverty ‘profile’ in a society. In this regard, it is important to ensure families with
     access to good quality and affordable childcare regardless of a type of settlement, as well as negotiate
     opportunities of flexible employment for workers with family responsibilities. Men’s role in parental
     duties should be reinforced through popularization of a good practice of paternity leaves and advocacy
     campaigns with employers. Though international experience provides evidence of positive contribution
     of the mandatory parental leaves in terms of gender equality, this practice has to be widely discussed
     through social dialogue and public hearings before implementation.

     4.7.	    Unequal women’s representation in public life is closely associated with impact of the per-
     sistent gender stereotypes, prioritizing the family roles for women and contributing to their devaluat-
     ed position at the labour market. In many cases, the gender-based views in a society are reproduced by
     school and family education; they are also widely broadcasted by the mass-media and advertising. To
     address these problems, the practice of introducing gender courses in education institutions should be
     extended along with conducting special training workshops for journalists, information and public rela-
     tions experts. The gender expertise of educational programs should be continued, including analysis of
     manuals and textbooks, as well as curriculum and programs; some target gender-sensitive training could
     be required for education professionals, who might demonstrate the stereotypic perceptions of gender

roles. The advocacy campaigns among employers are needed to promote employment opportunities for
workers with family obligations. At the same time, the target information campaigns should address the
problem of domestic violence that is also closely associated with public attitudes and unequal distribu-
tion of resources and powers between women and men. In this case, the key messages of campaigns
should be targeted as at prevention activities, as at transformation of the common stigma attitude put on
survivors of domestic violence in case of applying for any assistance.

4.8.	 Gender-based violence (GBV) and trafficking in human beings remain serious problems,
being particularly acute with regard to the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine and lost control of cen-
tral authorities over large territories. While the services for GBV survivors have been traditionally
poorly developed in Ukraine, the conflict posed new challenges in terms of vulnerability to violence
for such contingents as IDPs, residents of the ATO-affected areas, demobilized militarymen and their
families. In the on-going conflict, a particular attention should be paid to prevention of any forms of
violence against civil population, as well as biased attitudes towards displaced people, and support
of their comprehensive integration into host communities. Thus, there is a permanent need in insti-
tutional capacity building and strengthening the multi-sectoral cooperation to provide the adequate
response to GBV problems. A zero-tolerance attitude to GBV should be promoted in activities of all
public authorities, while the population awareness on its forms and risks should be addressed through
the target information programs.

4.9.	    The health problems are of particular concern in Ukraine, as significant efforts are needed to
address the current crisis. The gender gap in life expectancy results from the extra-high male mortality
in the working age, being largely associated with men’s exposing to occupational injuries, unsafe behav-
ioral patterns, stressful environment, unhealthy diets and life-style associated problems. The particular
risk factors include harmful alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, while the role of external death
causes (such as car accidents, poisonings, homicides, and suicides) is also important. The incidence of
communicable diseases is also higher among male population, contributing to the increased epidemi-
ology risks in terms of tuberculosis and HIV-infection. The large-scale health campaigns are needed to
address the outlined challenges, in particular with regard to the recently developed internal displacement
movements across the regions of Ukraine. Besides medical interventions and comprehensive coverage
with accessible medical services, the priority should be given to information programs targeted at rais-
ing the population awareness on a healthy life style and prevention of diseases.

4.10.	 The issues of reproductive health should be addressed in terms of youth knowledge of HIV/
AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, family planning and maternal health. The rate of HIV-
infection is increasing among women, following the increased share of sexual transmission. Unwanted
pregnancies still remain prevalent in Ukraine, while the adolescent birth rates are higher than those in
the EU Member States. The target information campaigns could address the use of contraception among
youth to prevent the risky behavior and improve the reproductive health for girls and boys. The problem
of infertility still remains poorly addressed, as the use of assisted reproductive treatment is less common
as compared with developed regions.

4.11.	 The population ageing is progressing in Ukraine, resulting from a sharp decline in fertility.
The respective challenges of the increased dependency rates will be faced by fiscal and pension systems,
while the systems of healthcare, education and social protection will require important adjustments to
address the need of elderly. As a result of the gender gap in life expectancy, there are significantly more
women among older age groups. Importantly, the gender pay gap determines the respective gender
disparities in pensions, affecting the living standards in old age. As a result, elderly women present a
particular poverty ‘profile’ in Ukraine, as their income opportunities are dependent exclusively on ‘gen-
erosity’ of the state social guarantees. Thus, there is a need in incorporating the gender approach into
development and implementation of social policies on old age. However, as there are no reliable grounds
to argue about the common feminization of poverty in Ukraine, any poverty alleviating policies should
be well-targeted to address specifically the needs of low-income population.

     Chapter 4.CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 



     4.12.	 The institutional capacity and multi-sectoral coordination of public authorities should be
     strengthened. Though most observers agree that Ukraine succeeded in developing progressive legis-
     lation and the core elements of national machinery on enhancing gender equality, the efficient imple-
     mentation of legislative provisions remains low. In this regard, the basic problems concern the lack
     of political will and low prioritizing of gender issues by decision-makers, as well as absence of the
     effective instruments to implement the norms. There is also no systemic approach in developing the
     gender-sensitive policies, while many of them used to have the declarative character, providing no
     efficient solutions. The current State Program on Gender Equality is mostly targeted at information,
     research and training components, so it might be difficult to assess its impact on transforming the public
     views without special population surveys. In addition, despite multiple gender gaps observed, no gender
     components have been clearly outlined in the national strategies of development, including the Poverty
     Reduction Strategy, the Strategy of Reforming the System of Public Health, the Strategy of Reforming
     the System of Tertiary education, etc. Thus, the role of Government in promoting gender equality needs
     to be expanded, as many of the current initiatives are pushed by non-governmental sector, being sup-
     ported by international organizations. Though many of practical initiatives on women’s empowerment
     turned out to be successful (such as facilitation of grass root women’s movements, women’s training in
     entrepreneurship and support through microcrediting, programs on professional reintegration of parents
     after child leaves realized in partnership with pilot enterprises, etc.), such efforts are still very fragment-
     ed and highly dependent on the external donor funding. To provide efficient response to the present gaps,
     the gender budgeting should be incorporated in developing and implementing of public policies. With
     regard to the current processes of decentralization of governance, it is important to ensure availability of
     gender machinery and proper resources at the local level.

     4.13.	 The further steps in addressing the understanding of gender gaps in Ukraine should be
     focused in three key areas: 1) improving the national statistics and obtaining additional data to un-
     derstand the nature of the revealed gender gaps; 2) making estimations of the cost of gender gaps to
     assess their impact on the economy and prospects of development; 3) monitoring and evaluation of
     the progress in promoting gender equality through stocktaking of policies and case studies. So far, no
     economic estimates of the costs of gender inequality have been realized in Ukraine. However, some
     particular fields of interest may include: the costs of unpaid domestic and care work or gender-based
     violence in a society; the impact of gender-based segregation on the labour market performance; the
     lost labour productivity associated with excessive mortality of males; the impact of the prolonged ma-
     ternity leaves on women’s skills and competencies; socio-demographic consequences of feminization
     of labour migrations in terms of the lack of care for children and elderly, etc. The national system of
     statistics should be expanded by comprehensive and publicly available gender-disaggregated indica-
     tors, while additional surveys might be needed to address some specific data gaps. In particular, there
     is a permanent lack of analysis of the impact of gender stereotypes on public attitudes and distribution
     of roles between women and men in a society. In this regard, the longitude approach to sociological
     surveys would be useful to monitor the trends in changing norms and to evaluate the efficiency of pub-
     lic policies. The launched process of setting the Sustainable Development Goals for Ukraine provides
     an opportunity to revise the priorities of gender development at the national levels and to ground the
     system of indicators for monitoring and evaluation.
