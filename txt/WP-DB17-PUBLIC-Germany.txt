This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

        The Building Procedures Regulation was amended on March 22,
        2013 and corrected on May 2, 2013. According to the
        amendment the building permission procedure documents must
        be submitted electronically since April 1, 2013.

        The building permit grants the right to build on a plot and
        authorizes construction as well. There are several building
        departments (Bauaufsichtsämter) located in the districts of Berlin.
        The location of the building site in Berlin determines which
        building department is responsible for issuing the building
        permit.

        To obtain a construction permit, BuildCo must provide the
        building authority with, among other documents, project design
        drawings, a building specification including a detailed
        description of the future use of the building, proof of stability,
   1    and other necessary proofs (e.g. heat insulation, sound                    25 days               EUR 6,642
        insulation). The architect needs to sign the application for the
        building permit and must attach the design drawings, usually
        scaled at 1:100. Static calculations must be added. The building
        authority will produce static expert double-check calculations
        (carried out by a "Pruefstatiker"). The building authority will then
        forward the application to other relevant departments (e.g., the
        fire department, planning department).

        The Building Procedures Regulation (Bauverfahrensverordnung,
        abbreviated as BauVerfVO) was amended on 22nd March 2013.
        According to the amendment, the applicant is now obliged to
        submit the building permission procedure documents
        electronically in Portable Document (PDF/A).

        Under a revised Berlin State Law, the Building Code Berlin
        (Bauordnung Berlin, abbreviated as BauO Bln), effective
        September 29, 2005, amended by Regulation from June 29, 2011,

      (Section 64 BauO Bln) or a waiver (Section 63 BauO Bln,
      maximum value EUR 3,000.00). In the case of a simplified
      building permit under Section 64 BauO Bln, the application will
      be deemed to be complete and sufficient unless the building
      department notifies the applicant to the contrary within three
      weeks of receiving the application. If the building department
      remains silent for four weeks, the application will be deemed
      granted and construction may commence (Section 70,
      Paragraphs 3 and 4 BauO Bln, and Section 71, Paragraph 7, Item
      1 BauO Bln). It is the duty of the architect or the engineer to
      supervise compliance of the construction project with the
      applicable state law.

      In addition, upon receiving the application for a normal building
      permit, the building department has to notify the applicant
      within 14 days if the application is complete or if additional
      documents or plans are required (Section 70, Paragraph 1 and 2
      BauO Bln). If the applicant fails to amend the application within a
      period determined by the building authority, the application will
      be deemed abandoned. If the application is complete, the
      building department will contact other departments involved
      (i.e., the fire safety and public street supervision departments). If
      the other departments fail to make a decision within a month,
      they will be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the
      permit. If the application is not complete for the purpose of
      these other departments, then this period of a month is
      interrupted until the application is completed by the applicant.
      Upon receiving consent from the other departments, the
      building department again has a month to decide on the
      application for a building permit.

      The building authority appoints an independent engineer (either

      A legal certificate of static stability, issued by a “Pruefingenieur”,
      must be available at the time of start of construction.

      Prüfungsverordnung, abbreviated as BauPrüfV, effective February
      12, 2010, amended by Regulation from August 23, 2010). In the
      case of the warehouse considered here, the cost for an
      independent engineer is about EUR 3,586. The calculation is
      based on a volume of 3900 cubic meters and a chargeable
      building value per cubic meters (Appendix 1 to Section 27
      Paragraph 1 BauPrüfVO, Item 15). A structural framework of

      the federal states. Cost for inspection are based on Paragraph 6
      KÜO). The inspection may take more than one hour, but it will

      notice, probably 1 -- 2 weeks before the day of inspection.

      This procedure is for fire safety and for the cases where the
      heating is done by gas boilers. However, some buildings in Berlin
      will use a so called "long distance heating" system to heat the
      building, which is essentially heating by hot water from a
      centralized boiler. In this case, this procedure would not be
      required.

      operator (Guest License). There are no costs for the registration process.

      The installer identification from any other DSO of the electrician or the
      Master craftsman’s diploma, trading license and a standard form of the
      distribution operator is needed for the listing process. To be authorized
      to install internal wiring, an electrician has to be a Master electrician
      (“Elektromeister”). Master electrician ("Elektromeister") means he/she is
      licensed with the Chamber of Commerce and has a Craftsman Diploma.
      This is the general procedure and requirement to be allowed to work as
      electrician in Germany and to do the internal wiring. The Master
      electrician ("Elektromeister") is always legally responsible for the internal
      wiring. All Master electricians (“Elektromeister”) in Berlin are registered
      with Vattenfall. This license is valid for all his/her projects in the area of
      the local DSO.

       Electricians working in the field of industrial (warehouses) connections
      are registered with Vattenfall in a second form through training. Those
      electricians receive a number ("Installateurnummer") and are allowed to
      install the meter. All electricians in Berlin that are working in the field of
      industrial (warehouses) connections are certified by Vattenfall. The list of
      those certified electricians is on the website of Vattenfall and can be
      obtained at the Guild of electricians ("Elektroinnung") as well. There is no
      external and no internal inspection. The internal wiring is never inspected
      by Vattenfall DSO, as they trust the electricians through a process of
      registration and diplomas.

      Make payment and await completion of external works and meter
      installation by utility

      The customer pays the estimate at a bank through a wire transfer. The
      required external connection works are underground work for the cable,
      building of metering, building of the grid connection, and connection of
      the building to the grid. The meter gets installed at the same time when
      the connection is done and by the same or another department if the
      meter installation is done by Vattenfall DSO. However, in most cases, the
      private electrician (the Master electrician) who did the internal wiring
3     would install the meter.                                                  14 calendar days     EUR 15,500

      At this moment, this private electrician has to hand over to Vattenfall
      DSO a form ("Errichterbescheinigung") that certifies that he installed the
      internal wiring according to technical and safety standards. In 98% of all
      cases, the internal wiring and the external connection works are done at
      the same time and usually the external connection works are completed
      before the internal wiring as this is usually more complex. Electricity
      starts flowing immediately

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for

      Fulfill the pre-conditions for the validity of the purchase price

      The following pre conditions have to be fulfilled for the maturity of the
      purchase price: (i) Registration of the priority notice in the Land Register
      (not mandatory but usual practice to secure the purchasers rank in the
      land register and avoid a third party purchasing the property in good
      faith); (ii) Consent to the cancellation of existing encumbrances.

      (The priority notice prevents a purchase by a third party of good faith
      between the conclusion of the purchase agreement and registration of
      the purchaser; it usually ranks after the existing encumbrances and prior
      to any future encumbrances at the time of notarization. This notice
      provides a very high level of legal and economic security and certainty.
      Upon registration, the notice protects against all intervening interests
      (including seller’s insolvency) pending completion of the transaction and
      actual change in registered ownership. By use of this notice, a purchaser        20 days         EUR 1548

      authentication of the purchase contract. From that moment onward, the
      purchaser can rest assured that he can acquire title to the property if all
      prerequisites to maturity of the purchase price are fulfilled.

      If all pre-conditions to the maturity "Fälligkeit" of the purchase price,
      usually collected and examined by the notary, have been fulfilled, the
      notary issues a statement of maturity "Fälligkeitsmitteilung" to the
      purchaser. If the respective declarations in rem have already been
      provided for in the sale and transfer agreement, the notary is usually
      bound by an escrow agreement not to forward them to the land register
      until the purchase price has been paid.

        After the purchase price has been paid and the tax authorities have
        provided the innocuousness statement, an application for the
        registration of the purchaser as new owner and deletion of the priority
        notice is submitted. A registration fee is paid depending on the property
        value. The deletion fee for the cancellation of the priority notice also
        depends on the value. It is important to note that there is a possibility to                  EUR 3,095

Taxes and mandatory contributions are measured at
all levels of government.


Assumptions about the VAT refund process:

    In June 2015, TaxpayerCo. makes a large capital
     purchase: one additional machine for
     manufacturing pots.
    The value of the machine is 65 times income per
     capita of the economy.
    Sales are equally spread per month (that is,
     1,050 times income per capita divided by 12).
    Cost of goods sold are equally expensed per
     month (that is, 875 times income per capita
     divided by 12).
    The seller of the machinery is registered for VAT
     or general sales tax (GST).
    Excess input VAT incurred in June will be fully
     recovered after four consecutive months if the
     VAT or GST rate is the same for inputs, sales and
     the machine and the tax reporting period is
     every month.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                        Mirage management is obligated to commence insolvency proceedings
                                        without undue delay and no later than three weeks after the company
                                    becomes insolvent. The management can also request self-administration and

                                    plan proposed by Mirage. If the plan is denied, the administrator will attempt

market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
