This report was initiated based on the findings and results of the World Bank Report
on Tajikistan’s Winter Energy Crisis (2012), which showed that measures targeting
improvements of the heating sector in Tajikistan are important to help the country
addressing its recurrent winter energy shortages. It further complements the
Assessment of Household Energy Deprivation in Tajikistan, which was conducted by
the World Bank in 2014 and evaluated the social impacts of energy depreviation on
the population. The content of this report is based on a technical assessment of the
urban heating sector in Tajikistan, which was conducted by Fichtner – Engineering and
Consulting.
This summary report was prepared by Ani Balabanyan (Task Team Leader), Kathrin
Hofer (co-Task Team Leader), and Joshua Finn and Denzel Hankinson (both DH
Infrastructure). Overall guidance was provided by Ranjit Lamech and the Country
Management Unit in Tajikistan. The team would like to thank the peer reviewers,

Executive Summary
Access to reliable and affordable heating is essential for the wellbeing of the
population and delivery of public services in Tajikistan. Given the cold climate and
long heating season, lasting one-quarter to more than one-half of the year, access to
reliable heating services is essential in Tajikistan. However, due to insufficient and
unreliable heat and electricity supply in winter, a substantial amount of the public and
residential heat demand remains unmet; in Dushanbe and Khujand alone, unmet heat
demand in public and residential buildings is estimated at 20 to 30 percent. This
negatively impacts the well-being of the population and public service delivery, as
demonstrated during the winter energy crisis of 2007-2008 when access to basic
health care declined significantly and school attendance rates dropped by 40 to 50
percent.
District Heating (DH) and small Heat-only-Boilers (HOBs) cover only 8 percent of the
households in Tajikistan and are characterized by poor service quality and supply
reliability. The majority of the DH system in Tajikistan is no longer in operation due to
rising natural gas prices, interruptions of natural gas supply and the poor condition of
the heating infrastructure. Radiators and building-internal heating infrastructure have
been dismantled in about 80 percent of the urban buildings previously connected to
the DH system as a result of the deteriorating supply reliability. Most of the remaining
DH assets operate at a fraction of their design capacity and are characterized by high
losses, increasing pollution and low efficiency, partly due to the conversion of HOBs
from gas to coal without modern flue-gas cleaning systems.
Low tariffs contribute to the decay of heating assets. Tariffs for heat and electricity
are well below cost-recovery levels. As a result, most heat suppliers operate at a loss
and don’t have sufficient funds for proper maintenance and rehabilitation. This
contributes to the continued decay of assets, and results in inefficiency, poor quality
of services and deteriorating supply reliability. Consequently, the heating sector has
become highly dependent on direct subsidy from national or municipal governments
to cover more than 50 percent of the estimated sector revenue requirements.
As a result of the deterioration of DH services, almost 50 percent of households in
urban areas rely on electricity for heating, which accentuates winter power
shortages. The high reliance on electricity for heating is a key driver for the increase
in winter electricity consumption. In Dushanbe alone, electricity consumption during
winter months increased by more than 90 percent between 2009 and 2013. Combined
with the poor condition of the ageing power infrastructure and low hydropower
output during winter, this increase in electricity load aggravates winter power
shortages.
With limited fuel alternatives, and lack of access to DH or reliable electricity supply,
more than one-third of urban households use inefficient and polluting coal- or
biomass-fired stoves. Outside of Dushanbe, around 37 percent of urban households
rely on traditional wood and coal stoves. Use of these stoves is associated with
detrimental social impacts due to low efficiency of the stoves and human exposure to
indoor smoke and particulate matter. Tajikistan ranks among the 25 worst-affected
countries for diseases resulting from indoor air pollution according to the World


                                           iii
Health Organization. Inefficient heating solutions also force households to spend more
on fuel than they would spend using more efficient heating alternatives – household
expenditures for solid fuel account for around 10 percent of the total expenditures in
urban households, and around 15 percent in rural households.
The energy performance of residential and public buildings is poor, aggravating the
gap between heat supply and customers’ needs. The age of the building stock, the
lack of maintenance, and the absence of proper insulation result in high heat losses
and low comfort levels in many buildings. Based on the results of energy audits, there
is significant potential (30 to 40 percent of consumption) for improving the energy
efficiency of the residential and public building stock.
A mix of supply- and demand-side investments are needed to meet residential and
public heat demand. The levelized cost assessment (see Figure 0.1 and Figure 0.2)
indicates that heat supplied by the CHP continues to be an economically viable heating
solution1 for buildings currently served by the DH system. Small HOBs are a viable
option for multi-apartment and public buildings with an existing building-internal
heating network, but no access to DH supplied by the CHP. For individual houses, the
most viable option would be to replace traditional coal- and wood-fired stoves and
boilers with more efficient models. The economic assessment also shows that
implementing energy efficiency measures ranks among the most viable options for
meeting heat demand.

The investments and related policy and implementation measures need to be
customized for different residential and public buildings. Specific recommendations
to improve the reliability and efficiency of heat supply to residential and public
buildings were identified based on a multi-criteria assessment, which compared
economic, technical, institutional, environmental and social advantages and
disadvantages associated with different investment measures. Heating options are
further customized to different consumer segments, taking into account their primary
heat supply infrastructure and available alternatives. The identified priority
recommendations include the following:
 Implementation of a scalable program to replace inefficient individual heating
  systems. Such a program would target the replacement of: (i) inefficient and
  polluting coal- and biomass-fired stoves with more efficient models to reduce fuel
  consumption and expenditures, improve comfort levels and reduce indoor air
  pollution; and (ii) electric heaters with efficient heat pumps to reduce electricity
  consumption for heating purposes by up to 70 percent, and help mitigate winter
  power shortages.
 Implementation of a targeted rehabilitation and construction program for small
  HOBs in urban areas, focusing on public buildings and multi-apartment buildings
  with high heating loads to reduce fuel or electricity consumption, improve comfort
  levels, and reduce indoor/outdoor air pollution (if efficient small HOBs with modern
  flue gas cleaning systems replace traditional solid fuel-fired stoves or inefficient
  small HOBs).
 Introduction of a national energy efficiency program. As a priority, energy
  efficiency investments should be implemented in buildings where the heating
  systems will be upgraded. The experience in other ECA countries demonstrates that
  linking improvements of heating systems with building energy efficiency measures
  generates significant operational and financial synergies. It is also recommended
  that the Government introduces a broader energy efficiency program with targeted
  financing and implementation mechanisms, starting with public buildings, such as
  schools and hospitals. This would help to reduce heat losses and complement the
  limited supply options, improve comfort levels and operation of key public services
  during cold winter months, demonstrate the benefits of energy efficiency, and
  build local market capacity.
 Rehabilitation of the DH network served by the new CHP plant in Dushanbe. This
  would help to reduce the reliance on electric heating and polluting solid fuel-fired
  stoves, while improving the service quality and heat supply reliability for residential
  and public customers in Dushanbe. The economically most viable investments
  include: installation of modern building-level substations, including heat and hot
  water meters; the replacement or re-insulation of dilapidated pipelines; and the
  installation of variable speed drives at pumping stations.
 Implementation of electricity and heat tariff reforms, along with social assistance
  reforms. Tariff reforms are important to enable investments to improve the
  reliability and service quality of heat and electricity supply, improve the financial
  performance of the energy sector, and incentivize the more efficient use of scarce
  energy resources in Tajikistan. To ensure that a basic level of heat consumption


                                            v
  remains affordable to the poor, the targeting of the social assistance program
  needs to be improved.
The required investments to ensure reliable heat supply are sizable and should be
carefully planned and sequenced, but the time for action is now. The investments
recommended for Dushanbe and Khujand alone are estimated at roughly US$200
million in the short-term and close to US$700 million in the medium- to long-term.
The investments would need to be carefully prioritized and financed through a
combination of public (including concessional donor funding) and private sources.
However, actions need to be taken now to help address recurrent winter energy
shortages affecting more than 70 percent of the people in Tajikistan. The current
heating situation in the country is not sustainable and has serious repercussions on
the living and working conditions of the population during winter months. There is
also a significant risk that the benefits expected from the construction of the CHP 2
will be limited and short-lived without accompanying efficiency and reliability
improvements of the related DH network.

1      Introduction
This report identifies the most viable heating options and related investment
measures to meet heating demand in urban residential and public buildings in
Tajikistan. The report provides an overview of the condition and performance of the
urban heating sector and building stock, and assesses, in detail, the situation in
Dushanbe and Khujand. The two cities were selected for the following reasons:
 The cities collectively account for more than one-third of the total urban population
  of the country;
 Dushanbe and Khujand have a building stock that is typical of urban areas in
  Tajikistan in terms of building types and heat demand;
 Sixty-five percent of the total urban area is located within the same two climatic
  zones as Dushanbe and Khujand;
 The heating systems in use in the two cities are representative of the situation in
  other urban areas, including the high reliance on individual heating solutions (e.g.,
  coal stoves, electric oil radiators), limited coverage of small Heat only Boilers
  (HOBs) in both cities and the District Heating (DH) system in Dushanbe, which is the
  only remaining DH system still in operation.
The report begins with an overview of the physical, institutional and regulatory
characteristics of the urban heating sector in Tajikistan (Section 2) and includes an
analysis of the urban building stock. Sections 3 and 4 describe the heat supply and
demand characteristics of Dushanbe and Khujand and estimate the unmet heating
demand in these cities. Section 5 evaluates the available supply- and demand-side
heating options and investment measures that could be implemented to improve the
heating sectors in the target cities. Section 6 recommends priority investment
measures for each building type, identifies related policy actions to facilitate
implementation of the recommended investments, highlights key implementation
issues and describes the next steps necessary to implement them.

2      Overview of the Urban Heating Sector
Roughly 25 percent of Tajikistan’s 7.8 million people live in urban areas. About 10
percent (720,000) reside in the capital city, Dushanbe. Other large cities include
Khujand (160,000), Kurgan-Tube (80,000), Kulyab (100,000) and Istaravshan (60,000).
Figure 2.1 below shows the country’s administrative divisions.
Figure 2.1: Administrative Divisions of Tajikistan




Tajikistan’s climate is continental, with large seasonal and daily changes in
temperature and relative humidity. The country has four basic climatic zones. Roughly
65 percent of the total urban area is located within climatic region III (Dushanbe,
Khujand, Istaravshan, Pendzhekent). The climatic zones are described in Table 2.1.

2.1     Overview of the Urban Building Stock
In urban areas, there are 167,474 residential buildings, which consist of individual
family houses and multi-apartment buildings. Individual family houses make up 44
percent of urban households and 55 percent of the residential building floor space.
The remaining households in urban areas live in multi-apartment buildings, consisting
of 215,655 apartments and over seven million m2 of floor space. In addition, there are
about 6,626 public buildings.
Most residential and public buildings in Tajikistan are characterized by low energy
performance due to the lack of investment in maintenance and rehabilitation and
insufficient thermal insulation. In many cases, the internal heating systems of
buildings connected to DH systems or HOBs are in poor condition, which leads to
uneven heating within buildings and contributes to under-heating.

2.1.1 Residential buildings
In 2012, the aggregate floor space of residential buildings in Tajikistan, including
individual family houses and multi-apartment buildings, amounted to 88.98 million
m2, of which 28 percent was located in urban areas.2
Most of the urban population (54 percent) lives in individual family houses, which
account for 94 percent of the urban building stock and 55 percent of the floor space.
The remaining 46 percent of the population lives in multi-apartment buildings. Table
2.2 shows the number of buildings, the floor space and the population for each
housing type in urban areas.

There are seven building types in Tajikistan’s urban areas – five types of apartment
buildings and two types of single-family homes:
 Brick masonry apartments (type 1 and 2). These buildings are made from masonry
  of traditional, metric perforated bricks. The standard thickness of the outside wall
  is 38-51 cm, depending on the level of the floor. The walls have exterior lime-
  cement render with paint finish or exposed masonry. There is almost no additional
  thermal insulation.
 Panel apartment buildings (type 3 and 4). These buildings are most commonly
  made with a three-layer wall panel and an integrated intermediate thermal
  insulation layer. They have a wall thickness of 30 cm.
 Monolithic concrete and concrete frame apartment buildings (type 5). These
  buildings typically have outside walls made of expanded clay concrete with
  expanded clay as a thermal insulating additive. The outside walls have a thickness
  of about 30 cm. There is almost no additional thermal insulation.
 Newly constructed apartment buildings (type 6). These buildings usually have a
  skeleton structure with brick wall filling. Some have sandwich panels, with and
  without insulation. The outside walls have a thickness of about 25-30 cm.

 Clay individual family houses (type 7). This type of individual family house is made
  from mud bricks/blocks or cob.3 The thickness of the outside wall is typically 30 to
  40 cm. The walls are sometimes plastered by a straw/clay mixture and are coated
  with an aqueous solution of slaked lime.
 Brick masonry individual family houses (type 7). This type of house is made from
  traditional solid bricks. The standard thickness of the outer walls is 38 cm. The walls
  have exterior and interior lime-cement render and lime paint finish or exterior
  exposed masonry. There is almost no additional thermal insulation of walls.
2.1.2 Public buildings
According to national statistics there are 6,626 public buildings in Tajikistan, about six
percent of which are located in the capital, Dushanbe. Schools and polyclinics account
for more than 80 percent of public buildings. The number of each building type is
shown in Table 2.3 below.

2.1.3 Energy performance of the building stock
Residential buildings
The residential sector in Tajikistan accounts for about 44 percent of electricity and
about 17 percent of final energy consumption.4 As described in Section 2.3, space
heating accounts for around 70 percent of the annual electricity consumption of an
average household. Average heat demand varies between 110 kWh/m2 and 350
kWh/m2 depending on the building type. The average estimated energy demand in
Tajikistan is substantially higher than in many other countries in Europe and Central
Asia (ECA). It is ten percent higher than its closest comparator (Ukraine) and 136
percent higher than Slovakia and Latvia.

Note: Energy demand for multi-apartment buildings in different ECA countries is degree days adjusted
      to Dushanbe and based on international studies and reports.


The energy performance of the existing building stock is poor, especially in multi-
apartment buildings built before 2000. Table 2.4 shows that there is wide variation in
the amount of energy consumed in different building types. Some buildings – such as

One of the main drivers for the high demand in residential buildings in Tajikistan is the
low efficiency of the aging building stock. More than 60 percent of the multi-
apartment buildings were constructed between the 1960s and the 1980s. Many
buildings are in poor condition. They are characterized by high heat losses due to the
lack of insulation, high air permeability through windows and doors and insufficient
maintenance. In apartment buildings, heat losses are especially high on the first and
top floors because basements are not heated, and roofs are poorly insulated.
Windows are also typically in poor condition, both within dwelling areas and in
communal areas. The walk-through energy audits conducted as part of this
assessment indicate that there is significant energy savings potential in residential
buildings, estimated to range between 30 and more than 40 percent.
Public buildings
Similar to residential buildings, the energy performance of the aging public building
stock is poor and characterized by high specific heat demand per m2. Most public
buildings were constructed 25 to 60 years ago during the Soviet period. The main
drivers for the poor energy performance include the use of energy-inefficient
construction materials and designs, the lack of thermal insulation, poor conditions of
windows and limited refurbishment and rehabilitation efforts since construction.

                                                7
Walk-through energy audits confirm that there is substantial energy savings potential
(up to 50 percent) in public buildings. However, the findings of the energy audits also
demonstrate that many public buildings, such as schools, hospitals and kindergartens
are severely under-heated. As a result, some of the efficiency potential is expected to
be offset by the need to increase comfort levels in public buildings.
The low comfort levels in public buildings, mainly resulting from high losses and
insufficient or unreliable supply of heat and electricity, can also have negative
repercussions on the provision of basic public services. According to the findings of a
recent World Bank Report,5 access to basic health care services and school attendance
rates have dropped significantly during rough winters, as unreliable or even
unavailable heat and electricity supply have forced public buildings to operate at low
comfort levels or restrict service hours.
2.2         Overview of Heat Supply Systems
Heat in Tajikistan is supplied by systems ranging in size from large, centralized DH
systems to individual, portable heating devices. Coal, natural gas, heavy fuel oil,
electricity (which mostly comes from hydropower) and biomass (including wood and
dung) are used in heating. Section 2.3 provides more details about the fuel used in
heating.
Nationwide, the most prevalent primary source of heat supply is small coal- or
biomass-fired stoves, used by more than 74 percent of total households, followed by
electricity (18 percent), individual boilers and DH. In urban areas, around 48 percent
of households rely on electricity for heating, followed by stoves (37 percent),
individual boilers and DH. Figure 2.3 shows the major sources of heating nationwide
and in urban areas only.

2.2.1 District heating
Heat supply provided by DH systems fell dramatically after the country’s
independence in 1991 and the subsequent disintegration of regional energy
cooperation. In the past, the heat demand of around 35 percent of urban households
was met by DH systems available in Dushanbe, Khujand, Kulyab, Chkalovsk, Yavan and
Kurgan-Tube. In Dushanbe and Yavan, CHPs and large HOBs provided heat supply,
while large HOBs operating mostly on natural gas supplied the other cities. Except for
Dushanbe, the major DH systems in Tajikistan were decommissioned and dismantled
in the 1990s and early 2000s due to rising gas prices, interruptions of gas imports from
Uzbekistan and the deterioration of the DH infrastructure, which was driven by
insufficient investments and lack of adequate maintenance.
Today, DH supplies only about 3.5 percent of the urban households. This includes
mainly households living in Dushanbe, where DH is generated by the CHP 1 plant as
well as large HOBs in the “East” and “West” boiler houses (see further description in
Section 3.1). In addition, small centralized heating systems are available in the cities
of Vahdat, Vose, Gesar, Zafarabad, Rudaki, Temurmalik and Khujand. Heat in those
cities is generated by small HOBs (see description below).
Overall, the remaining DH systems are in poor condition due to their age, lack of
investment in rehabilitation and modernization, insufficient maintenance and supply
of untreated water (in particular during the 1990s). As a result of the deteriorating DH
supply reliability, many of the urban households previously connected to a DH system
have dismantled radiators and supply pipes. This is a major challenge for resuming
heat supply even after rehabilitation of generation facilities.
There are three main entities that provide DH services in Tajikistan, as shown in Table
2.5.

2.2.2 Small heat-only boilers
Small HOBs primarily provide heating for public buildings, as well as some residential
multi-apartment buildings. Most of the small HOBs serve one to three buildings and
are operated by the government-owned company “KMK” SUE. The company covers
areas outside of Dushanbe. It previously owned 56 small boilers houses, but only nine
are still operational, as indicated in Table 2.6 below. Most of the small HOBs were
originally designed to use gas as a fuel but were converted to coal due to the
unavailability and high price of natural gas. As a result, the efficiency of these boilers
decreased substantially to about 40 to 50 percent, while local pollution increased due
to poor flue gas cleaning systems (if installed at all). Despite the rehabilitation of some
boiler houses in recent years (for example: Gissar, Khujand, Rudaki and Vahtad under
the World Bank-financed Emergency Project), the poor condition or dismantling of the
building-internal heating infrastructure represents a major challenge for resuming
heat supply.

In addition, some government institutions own and operate their own small HOBs

2.2.3 Individual heating systems
Because of the decrease in availability and reliability of heat supplied by DH systems
and small HOBs, more than 80 percent of the households in urban areas rely on
individual heating solutions, such as electricity (48 percent of households) or stoves
(37 percent of households). Individual heating systems for space heating in urban
areas include electric oil radiators, air conditioning units that can be used as heat
pumps, individual coal boilers, small coal stoves, individual space heaters and hot
water boilers. As shown in Figure 2.4 below, the type of individual heating systems
and related fuel use differ by type of building and location. Households not connected
to DH and living in multi-buildings rely mostly on electricity for meeting their heating
needs, while individual family houses generate about a third of heating each from
electricity, wood and coal.

The high reliance on electricity for heating aggravates the recurrent winter power
shortages Tajikistan is facing (see Section 2.3 for further explanations), while the use
of inefficient and polluting coal- or biomass-fired stoves has detrimental health and

                                                                    11
environmental impacts for the population. Specifically, Tajikistan ranks among the 25
worst-affected countries for diseases resulting from indoor air pollution according to
the World Health Organization. Tajikistan is one of the few countries where indoor air
pollution causes more death and disability than smoking. In 2010, 64 per 100,000
deaths were due to household air pollution from solid fuels, making this the third
leading cause of death in Tajikistan.
2.3         Fuel Supply for Heating in Tajikistan
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Unified Energy System significantly altered
the use of fuels for heating in Tajikistan. While the heat supply system was designed
for natural gas, unreliable gas supply and substantial price increases since the 1990s
have resulted in massive fuel switching for heating. During the last decade, many
boilers originally designed for firing natural gas have been converted to fire coal,
causing a significant decrease in the efficiency and capacity of these boilers.
Coal
Tajikistan has significant indigenous coal reserves with about 40 deposits under
exploration. There are 14 coal companies that extract coal and bring it to market
within the country. Coal production has been rising in recent years. Between 2003 and
2009, it doubled to 106 thousand tons per year. However, high depreciation of the
existing mining equipment, lack of financing and working capital and the lack of
transportation infrastructure to bring coal from remote areas of the country to the
end-users constrain coal production in Tajikistan. Coal is mostly transported from
mines by truck. As a result, transportation costs are estimated to be two to three times
higher than the cost of coal extraction itself.6
Gas
Natural gas consumption significantly decreased from 1,863 million m3 in 1991 to
about 230 million m3 in 20117 and further dropped since then. In 2012, Uzbekistan
shut off natural gas supplies to Tajikistan, resulting in price spikes and natural gas
shortages in Tajikistan.
Electricity
Hydropower is the main source of electricity in Tajikistan. It makes up over 90 percent
of the installed capacity in the country. Residential electricity consumption varies
considerably over the year due to the heavy reliance on electricity for heating
purposes. As a result of the excessive use of electricity for heating, estimated
electricity consumption per household is substantially higher than in many other
countries in ECA (Figure 2.5 below).The high demand for heating in winter coincides
with the minimum availability of electricity generation from hydropower plants (due
to hydrological conditions). Combined with the poor condition of the aging power
infrastructure and the loss of electricity imports since 2009 and gas imports since
2012, this situation results in significant power shortages during winter months.
Unmet electricity demand was estimated at 3,100 GWh during winter in 2012,

equaling a gap of about 24 percent. As a result, for about 70 percent of the population,
access to electricity is limited to four to six hours per day during the winter with serious
repercussions on their well-being.8

2.4         Overview of Institutional, Legal and Regulatory Framework of the
            District Heating Sector
One of the main policy issues facing the heating sector are the low heat and electricity
tariffs, which are well below cost recovery levels. This has led to a chronic lack of
funding for new investments and even routine maintenance. The main heat and power
supply entities rely on direct government subsidies to pay for their operational
expenditures.
Building energy efficiency norms and standards do exist, but the standards are not
enforced and do not address the low efficiency of the existing building stock.
2.4.1 Energy policy and laws
There are three pieces of legislation that define the regulatory responsibilities,
principles and specific energy saving targets for the heating sector in Tajikistan:
 The Energy Law (2000) lays out the principles guiding energy sector development
  and establishes the government bodies responsible for the regulation of the sector
  in Tajikistan.
 The Law on Energy Savings (2002) was enacted to promote the efficient use of
  energy in the country.

                                                         13
 The Law on the Use of Renewable Sources of Energy (2010) regulates the legal
  relationships between government agencies, individuals and legal entities to
  ensure the effective use of renewable resources in Tajikistan.
In the building sector there are also a number of standards relevant to building
performance:
 The Building Climatology Standard (2007) stipulates the climate parameters that
  must be incorporated into the design of new buildings and structures.
 The Standard for Residential and Public Buildings Parameters of Indoor
  Enclosures (1999) establishes the indoor temperature range that buildings must
  meet during the heating season.
 The Standard for Thermal Performance of Buildings contains mandatory energy
  efficiency indicators and rules for evaluating energy efficiency for the design,
  construction and operation of buildings in Tajikistan.
 The Standard for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning stipulates the
  requirements for reliability and energy efficiency of heat supply systems, heating,
  ventilation and air-conditioning units of buildings and structures.
These laws and standards provide a relatively comprehensive framework for the
heating and buildings sectors, but implementation and enforcement to date have
been limited and ad hoc. There are a number of technical, institutional, financial,
regulatory and policy barriers which explain this implementation gap and impede
energy efficiency investments in the residential and public building sector in Tajikistan.
Among these barriers are: the low market capacity for preparing, implementing and
financing energy efficiency investments (e.g., energy auditing companies, design
companies, financial institutions, construction companies, etc.); lack of awareness
among the population and public institutions; lack of access to affordable financing
for energy efficiency; the low financial viability and lack of incentives to invest in
energy efficiency due to the low energy tariffs and norm-based billing practices; and
the incomplete regulatory and enforcement framework for energy efficiency (e.g.,
standards for energy efficient appliance and materials, enforcement of building
codes).
In addition, a specific barrier to energy efficiency in the residential sector is a
misalignment of incentives and responsibilities within multi-apartment buildings.
Common spaces in residential buildings and centralized building-level heating systems
often account for a large portion of energy savings potential. Simple repairs to doors,
windows and hallways in common areas as well as heating system upgrades can yield
substantial savings in heating costs to individual apartments. Experience from other
countries in the ECA region indicates that low-cost weatherization can raises the
indoor temperature by three to five degrees Celsius. More elaborate measures can
save up to seven degrees Celsius. Homeowner associations (HOAs) in multi-apartment
buildings could facilitate the implementation of energy efficiency improvements.
However, even where HOAs exist, the contributions of tenants to repair funds are
generally very low. A large proportion of tenants refuse to make any payments into
these funds. Furthermore, similar to other countries in ECA, it is very difficult for HOAs



                                           14
to gain access to financing for improvements. Banks are reluctant to lend because they
cannot foreclose on residents if they do not repay their loans.
Institutional framework
The heating sector is at the intersection of three major industries: energy,
construction and housing and many different institutions are involved in the sector.
Multiple ministries and governmental agencies are involved in the regulation of the
heating sector. Table 2.8 below sets out the responsibilities of the government bodies
involved.

2.4.2 Tariff regulation
Heat and electricity tariffs are well below cost recovery levels. This results in a
shortage of funding for routine maintenance and capital improvements in both the
heat and electricity sectors, and accentuates the poor operational and financial
performance of sector companies.
Electricity tariffs for public and residential customers are set as increasing block rate
tariff. Tariffs for power use above 2.5 kW are set at double the baseline rate for
residential and public customers to discourage the use of large electric boilers.
However, the tariff structure has had an unintended consequence: buildings are often
heated by individual radiators (each smaller than 2.5 kW) in each room, as this is less
expensive than introducing a more efficient, electricity-based system for the whole
building. Electricity tariffs in Tajikistan are well below cost-recovery levels – as part of
the World Bank Winter Energy Crisis Report for Tajikistan, the economic cost of
electricity supply was estimated at US$0.14/kWh (0.77 Somoni/kWh).
Table 2.9 shows the electricity tariff schedule for public and residential customers.

There are two tariff schedules for DH: A wholesale tariff for customers that purchase
directly from DH generation companies such as Dushanbe CHP (see Table 2.10) and
retail tariffs for residential, commercial and budgetary customers that purchase heat
from Dushanbe Teploset JSC (see Table 2.11).

 For all other consumers                              excluded   168.50
Note: 1 Somoni=US$0.21


Retail tariffs for residential customers are set based on standard assumptions for the
total area of the apartment (for heat) and number of residents in the household (for
hot water). The tariffs for public buildings are based on the calculated consumption
for the volume of the building.

Because heat tariffs are so far below cost recovery levels, Dushanbe Teploset JSC and
Dushanbe CHP JSC rely on national government and city government subsidies to
cover more than 50 percent of their revenue requirements. Dushanbe Teploset JSC

                                             16
relies on subsidies from the city budget to cover costs, and Dushanbe CHP JSC receives
a subsidy from state-owned Barki Tojik JSC to meet the costs not covered at the
wholesale heat supply tariff.
2.5         Affordability of Heat Supply
Roughly 34 percent of the population of Tajikistan lives in poverty (with a poverty line
defined at US$2.50 per day), giving Tajikistan the second highest poverty rate in the
ECA region. Energy affordability is therefore an important concern, in particular during
Tajikistan’s harsh winter months when energy needs are highest. Tajikistan has the
highest prevalence of energy poverty in former Soviet Union countries and one of the
highest in the ECA region. Roughly 60 percent of households spend more than 10
percent of their monthly expenditures on energy.9 Households in rural areas spend on
average almost 10 percent of their total expenditures on energy, but this reaches 15
percent during the heating season. In Dushanbe the annual average is five percent but
increases to seven percent in the heating season. In other urban areas, households
spend an average of 6.5 percent of their total consumption on energy and 11 percent
in the heating season.10
Figure 2.6 shows the estimated percentages of household income spent on energy by
different income groups in Dushanbe, other urban areas and rural areas. It also shows
the different resources that different groups use for heat supply. It appears that higher
use of non-electricity based fuels for heating correlates with higher energy
expenditures as a portion of total household expenditures.




9   Households are considered to be energy poor if they spend more than 10 percent of their monthly expenditures
    on energy.

The financial burden of energy costs increases significantly for all households during
the winter. In urban areas, energy costs are especially difficult for households in the
poorest quintile. In urban areas outside Dushanbe, these households spend
approximately 15 percent of their income on energy, while in Dushanbe this figure is
14 percent. The poorest and near poorest fifths of the population in rural areas spend
24 percent and 19 percent respectively of their total consumption on energy during
the heating season.11 Figure 2.7 compares energy expenditures by income quintiles
during the off-season and the heating season.

Social support mechanisms for energy are decentralized and vary quite considerably
across regions, but overall are small and poorly targeted. In the past, energy-related
benefits covered less than two percent of the population and were not sufficiently
targeted towards the poor households. According to a recent survey, households use
different strategies to cope with the higher energy expenditures in winter, as shown in
Figure 2.8.

during the Heating Season

Energy scarcity and high cost also affect public consumers, such as hospitals and
schools. Most public buildings in Tajikistan use electricity and coal for heating as the

                                                19
supply of electricity outside of Dushanbe is unreliable and as there is no functioning
DH system. So-called “red lines” exist to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to
some schools and hospitals in densely populated areas, but there are often illegal
connections to these lines, which can disrupt service.
The shortage of electricity and the use of indoor stoves for heat in public buildings
have caused local government funds to be diverted to covering energy expenditures
for these facilities. Local government funds have been used for the purchase of coal
and for repairs to walls and equipment from long-term exposure to smoke. Energy
shortages have forced hospitals to restrict hours, which has decreased access to health
care and contributed to temporary school closures. During the winter of 2008,
UNESCO reported that school attendance rates dropped by 40 to 50 percent.
Anecdotal evidence collected through in-depth interviews also suggests that parents
often contribute to heating expenses in schools. Box 2.1 provides a qualitative analysis
of the current situation in a hospital and two schools in Tajikistan.

 Box 2.1: Access to Energy in Social Buildings
 General clinic, Khujand. This clinic has an unlimited electricity supply due to its central
 location in the biggest city of Sughd region. The main heating source is electricity, and
 every room has an electric radiator. The original central heating system no longer
 functions. The local government authority of Khujand and the clinic pay the electricity bill,
 which is highest during November through February, and declines in the summer, despite
 use of air conditioning. The amount allocated for electricity is enough for a year. During
 the past two years there have been no electricity shortages, but the clinic previously
 experienced shortages of two or three hours per day.
 Secondary school, Vose (rural Khatlon). The school’s main energy sources are electricity,
 coal, firewood, dung, dried cotton sticks and shrubbery growing in the schoolyard. The
 school receives annual state funding based on the number of students. This money is
 typically used for fuels and other sources of energy, school improvements and repairs and
 teaching supplies. In winter, the school faces the same electricity supply limits as the
 residential sector. The main source of heating is coal. Annual state funding provides 10-12
 tons of coal – enough for only 1.5 to 2 months. As a result, a parents’ association was
 organized to supply the school with additional dung, firewood or dried cotton sticks. It was
 claimed that parents provide around 40 percent of winter heating supplies, especially in
 elementary schools. The ‘on-duty’ teacher and student arrive early in the morning and
 heat the classroom. This is common in rural areas.
 Secondary school, Dushanbe. The main energy sources are electricity, coal and wood. The
 school budget comes from two sources: state funds and payments for extra classes. These
 are collected by the school cashier and sent to the Raion financial department and then to
 the bank. Some funds are returned to the school. Sixty percent is for school staff salaries
 and the remainder is used to improve school infrastructure and buy fuels. This year the
 school experienced some electricity supply shortages and had to rely on their 16kW
 generator.

3           Heat Supply and Demand in Dushanbe
Dushanbe is the capital and largest city of Tajikistan, and also has the status of a
region. It has a population of 764,300 people with an historical growth rate of about
2.4 percent per year. Dushanbe has a continental climate and belongs to climatic
region III, with 1,566 degree days.12 The average length of the heating season is 110
days long.
The residential building stock in Dushanbe consists of 31,735 individual family houses
that house 20 percent of the population and make up 20 percent of the residential
floor space, as well as 3,275 apartment buildings where the rest of the population
lives. These buildings make up the rest of the residential floor space. The city also has
around 370 public buildings. All residential and public buildings are characterized by
poor energy performance, and individual family houses have particularly high specific
energy demand levels.
Most of the space heating in Dushanbe is provided by individual electric heating
systems. CHP, large and small HOBs, and individual solid fuel-fired stoves are also
used. There is a sizable gap between heat demand and supply in Dushanbe, with an
estimated heat supply gap of 23 percent of overall demand in residential and public
buildings.13 The space heat supply gap is greatest in public buildings, where 27 percent
of space heat demand goes unmet each year. The gap is the result of the poor energy
efficiency of most buildings, as well as insufficient and unreliable heat and electricity
supply.
This section describes the current state of the heating sector in Dushanbe. It provides
an overview of the heating systems in place and describes their condition. It also
describes the challenges currently facing Dushanbe’s heating sector and provides an
estimate of the current space heating supply-demand gap in the city.
3.1         Heat Supply in Dushanbe
Heat in Dushanbe is provided by the following systems:
 CHP, including one existing and one planned plant
 Large HOBs (boiler house “East” and boiler house “West”)
 Other small HOBs (building-level boilers)
 Individual heating systems (mostly electric)
DH or small building-level HOBs supply about ten percent of the multi-apartment
buildings and less than one percent of individual family houses. This means that
around eight percent of all households living in Dushanbe receive some form of
centralized heat. The remaining 90 percent of multi-apartment buildings and 99
percent of individual houses (comprising 92 percent of all households) rely on
individual systems to heat their homes. Twenty-seven percent of public buildings are

12   Days with a 5.76°C average outdoor air temperature during the heating season; 20°C normative indoor air
     temperature.
13   Hot water demand numbers were not available, so the heat supply gap analysis was only conducted for space
     heat demand.

3.1.1 The DH system
The DH system in Dushanbe consists of two CHPs, two large HOBs and the related
heating networks. Most of the heating infrastructure was constructed more than 30
years ago and has not been in use for the last decade due to its poor condition and
the lack of heat supply. A map of the system specifying the location of the major assets
is shown in Figure 3.1.

Since 1990, the amount of heat supplied by the DH system has decreased significantly.
Heat supply capacity of the system decreased from about 657 Gcal/h in 1990 to an
estimated available capacity today of about 75 Gcal/h at the CHP and the Boiler House
East. This decline over the past 25 years is mainly due to the following reasons: (i) poor
reliability and high cost of natural gas; (ii) the poor condition of the DH assets resulting
from age, severe under-maintenance and lack of investment in modernization; and

                                            23
(iii) the fact that residents have dismantled the DH infrastructure within about 80
percent of the residential buildings. As a result, the number of customers served by
DH declined by almost 90 percent between 1990 and 2012. Figure 3.2 shows the
number of customers of different types served by the DH system in 1990, 2008 and
2012.

The CHP 1 plant first began operations in 1961. It is in poor condition as a result of its
age and severe under-maintenance. Only about 30 percent of the original design
capacity (613 MW) is still operational and heat output is less than half of the plant’s
design capacity. Four of the seven boilers are non-operational because of a lack of fuel
and the need for extensive repair. Only one of the four steam turbines at the plant is
in operation, although the other three are in working condition. The plant also has
three boilers for process heat but these have not been in operation since the 1990s.
While the plant was designed to run on gas, it currently runs on fuel oil (mazut) and
gas.14 Table 3.2 shows key data on the CHP 1 plant.

Boiler House West
Boiler House West has two gas boilers that have not been in operation since the early
1990s because of the lack of a reliable and affordable gas supply. It also has three
boilers that were converted from gas to coal. These are no longer operational because
a lack of maintenance and rehabilitation has damaged almost all technical systems.
Heat generated at the boiler house West was previously sold to Dushanbe Teploset
and supplied residential and other customers.
There are two new HOBs under construction, which will use liquefied coal. Each HOB
is rated at 35 MWth. The boilers are designed to supply heat to residential and public
buildings in the western part of the city not served by the CHP 1. The liquefied coal
technology is an experimental technology that has been developed and is produced in
Russia, but has never been used on a larger scale as proposed in Dushanbe. The
expected commissioning date of this plant is not yet known because there is currently
insufficient funding to complete the plant. Table 3.4 provides key data on boiler house
West.

Boiler House East
Boiler House East was designed to run on gas, but was converted to run on gasified
hard coal in 2012. However, only one gasification unit and one of the two boilers are
in operation. The conversion to gasified coal reduced the operating capacity of the
plant to only 34 percent of the original design capacity. Significant maintenance and
service efforts are required to keep the remaining boiler running. Despite the high
operating costs, conversion of the second unit of this plant was planned for
2013/2014. No meters are installed at the outlet of the boiler house making it difficult
to track the output of the boiler. Table 3.5 provides key data on Boiler House East.

The CHP 2 plant
The CHP 2 plant, financed by the Chinese Eximbank and Bank of Development of China
is under construction. This project is being implemented by the Chinese company
Tebian Electric Apparatus and has a reported cost of US$30 million.
The first unit of this new plant (50 MW) was commissioned in autumn 2013, and
pipelines to connect the CHP 2 to the main network have been installed. Two more
units of 150 MW each are expected to become operational in 2016. CHP 2 will be
fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. It will only operate during the
heating season. Although the new CHP will increase heat supply capacity in Dushanbe,
the poor condition of the main transmission and distribution network, including the
building-internal heat infrastructure, may prevent the full utilization of the new CHP
(see below).

DH transmission and distribution networks
The transmission and distribution networks operated by Dushanbe CHP and Dushanbe
Teploset JSC consist of three independent networks that distribute heat from the CHP
1 and the two large HOBs (boiler houses East and West). The networks are two-pipe
‘open’ systems for space heating and DHW. As shown in Table 3.7, only 14 percent of
the DH transmission and eight percent of the distribution network are still in service
today. Within the last six years a large portion of the network has been taken out of
service.

Transmission network losses are reported by the DH companies to be about nine
percent. However, these losses are based on norms due to the lack of metering.15
Given the state of the system the DH companies are likely underestimating the
magnitude of losses on the system. Total distribution and transmission network heat
losses are in the range of 20 to 30 percent as a result of leakages within the network
and the poor condition of the insulation layer seen in Figure 3.3. Make-up water was
not properly prepared during the 1990s and this has resulted in thick deposits inside
the pipelines, which were observed during inspections performed as part of this
assessment.16




15   The lack of installed heat meters between the transmission network operated by Dushanbe CHP and the
     distribution network operated by Dushanbe Teploset also results in significant discrepancies between the
     reported amounts of thermal energy supplied.
16   Make-up water is water supplied to compensate for evaporation and leakages of water within the DH system. If
     this water is not properly treated before use, it can damage DH infrastructure.


                                                        28
Figure 3.3: Poor Condition of Insulation Layers of Transmission Pipelines




It is estimated that about 90 percent of the transmission and distribution network is
in urgent need of replacement or repair. Recent rehabilitation measures applied to
the distribution network have included only minor replacement of pipelines. Current
plans will replace only a few km of the underground pipelines in the city center.
Further, the open system (providing both space heat and hot water) impedes the
efficient operation and maintenance of the DH system, obstructs the introduction of
modern controls and shortens the lifetime of the entire system (e.g., through high
corrosion of the network pipes due to poor water quality/treatment). The open
system is a limiting factor in using the full heat supply capacity of the new CHP by
limiting the maximum flow temperature in the network, and thus the transmission
and distribution capacity. Without investments in the transmission and distribution
network, the network will not be able to absorb the additional heat supplied by the
new CHP. Accordingly, the sizeable investment in the CHP 2 may not generate the full
potential benefits for the population, public service delivery and businesses.
Dushanbe Teploset JSC operates five DH pumping stations with a total installed heat
and DHW capacity of 367 MWth. The average reported efficiency of the pumps is 64
percent. The pumping stations and other equipment examined during the walk-
through audits were assessed to be in good condition, particularly relative to the
condition of the transmission and distribution pipelines. Pumping stations are typically
situated in small buildings that protect equipment from weathering.
Building-level DH infrastructure
Most of the residential buildings connected to the DH are heated through direct
connection to the DH system with building-level hydro-elevator or through group
substations. The production-driven mode, where the quality of heat delivered to
consumers is controlled by supply temperature from the heat source, leaves
customers no or limited options to regulate their heat consumption. Building-level
metering and apartment-level temperature controls and heat cost allocators are
largely non-existent. This significantly affects the quality of service and comfort levels,
resulting in frequent under- or over-heating of buildings. It also means that end-

                                            29
consumers are billed based on their floor area rather than consumption. Combined
with the low tariffs and the lack of temperature control devices, these billing practices
provide no incentives to end-consumers to save energy.
For buildings previously served by a DH system, it is estimated that about 80 percent
of the building internal DH infrastructure (such as radiators and piping inside the
buildings) has been dismantled by residents because a large part of the DH system has
been out of operation for so long. As a result, even if the operational generation
capacity of the DH system were increased, most buildings would not be able to use
the heat unless their internal infrastructure was rebuilt. This represents a major
challenge for reconnecting buildings to the DH network given the associated
investment costs, and various institutional issues (e.g., collective decision-making to
reconnect multi-apartment buildings, access to individual apartments for replacing
radiators and piping, etc.).
3.1.2 Small HOBs
Small HOBs are small boilers that serve one or more buildings through a short
distribution network. Dushanbe Teploset JSC owns 24 small HOBs, of which 15 are still
operational (with total capacity of 20.34 Gcal/h or 23.64 MWth) as listed in below.
These HOBs supply public buildings, such as hospitals, kindergartens, and schools, and
a residential area that includes two multi-apartment buildings. The HOBs were
originally gas-fired but were converted to coal between 2008 and 2010, resulting in a
significant reduction in their efficiency (estimated between 45 and maximum 60
percent). Nine small HOBs (comprising 26 gas-fired boilers) are no longer operational
because of the lack of supply and the high cost of natural gas.

In addition to the small HOBs listed above there are some other small HOBs, which
have the same owner as the building to which they supply heat. No data are available
on these HOBs, but they do not play a significant role in Dushanbe’s heat supply.
3.1.3 Individual heating systems
Residents and occupants of public buildings who are not connected to the DH system
or small HOBs use individual heating systems as their primary source of heat. Overall,
more than 90 percent of the residential buildings and more than 70 percent of the
public buildings are heated by individual systems, such as oil or spiral radiators, coal
or wood burning stoves and boilers and combination heat pumps/air conditioning
units.
Based on yearly residential electricity and heat consumption data, it is estimated that
about 91 percent of residential heat in Dushanbe (432,769 Gcal) is supplied by
individual electric systems with five percent (22,745 Gcal) from coal-based stoves or
individual boilers in houses.
Table 3.10 shows the number of buildings, amount of heat supplied and share of total
heat supply that comes from individual systems in Dushanbe.

The use of electrical heating systems contributes to high residential electricity
consumption during the winter months. In 2012, residential electricity consumption
in January and December was about three times as high as in June. As described in
Section 2, the high reliance on electricity for heating aggravates recurrent winter
power shortages – the electricity system supplying Dushanbe suffers from limited
outages, but the Tajik system as a whole is subject to frequent shortages during the
winter months as a result of low hydrological flows, high demand for heating purposes
and poor condition of the power sector assets. Figure 3.4 shows monthly electricity
consumption in the residential sector for 2010 to 2012.

3.2      Heat Demand in Dushanbe
Heat demand was estimated for Dushanbe for 2012 and was compared to the amount
of heat supplied to these buildings to help understand the magnitude of unmet
heating demand. The residential housing stock in Dushanbe consists of 35,010
residential buildings with a total residential area of 8.17 million m². Individual family
houses account for more than 90 percent of the number of residential buildings, but
only 20 percent of the floor space.
Table 3.11 provides a breakdown of Dushanbe’s housing stock area, population, and
households by building type.

Panel buildings constructed in the 1970s and 1980s are the most prevalent form of
multi-apartment buildings, followed by brick buildings that were constructed in the
1930s to 50s. Figure 3.5 displays the percentage of total residential area in Dushanbe,
by building type.

The housing stock is generally in poor condition and energy inefficient. Based on walk-
through energy audits performed as part of this study, only a limited share of
apartments has replaced old wooden frame windows with PVC frame windows over
the last decade. Insulation of walls, roofs and basement ceilings is nearly non-existent.
Maintenance, repair and energy efficient retrofits in multi-apartment buildings are
very limited for the following reasons: (i) lack of incentives given low electricity and
heat tariffs and lack of consumption-based billing practices; (ii) lack of funds to finance
major repairs and costs of routine maintenance, management and cleaning services;
(iii) lack of HOAs and/or institutionalized decision-making structures in most multi-
apartment buildings, making it difficult to organize improvements in maintenance and
repair; and (iv) lack of professional management services – most residential buildings
are managed by one of the tenants/owners.
The public buildings stock in Dushanbe includes some 370 public facilities, such as
schools (136), kindergartens (100), other educational buildings (29), health facilities
(41), cultural and other buildings.17 The total estimated volume of these buildings is
5.5 million m3 with schools accounting for about half of the total. Figure 3.6 shows the
percentage of Dushanbe’s total public building volume by building type.

A standardized set of assumptions about the amount of heat demand per unit of area
was developed for each type of residential and public building described in Section
2.1. Heat demand assumptions were based on walk-through audits of residential and
public buildings. Heat demand by building type and total heat demand for Dushanbe
was calculated by combining these assumptions with data on the area of each building
type in Dushanbe.
Table 3.12 and Table 3.13 show the heat demand assumptions for space heat and hot
water for different types of residential and public buildings for a typical year in
Dushanbe.

Table 3.12. About 50 percent of residential heat demand is for hot water. Individual
family houses account for about 30 percent of total current demand, which is
significantly more than their 20 percent share by area.
Heat and hot water demand for public buildings amounts to 135,892 Gcal per year, as
shown in Table 3.13. It is assumed that heat for DHW preparation is used only in
hospitals and kindergartens. About 65 percent of public building heat demand is from
educational buildings.
Current total peak heat demand for residential and public buildings is estimated at
almost 1,200 MW.

3.3      Heat Supply-Demand Gap
The estimated amount of heat demanded in 2012 was calculated and compared to the
estimated amount of heat supplied in that year to help understand the magnitude of
unmet heating demand in Dushanbe—the heat supply gap. The heat supply gap was
calculated based on data for 2012. Tajikistan had a substantially colder than average
winter in 2012; there were 15 percent more heating degree-days than in a typical year.
Therefore, in order to more accurately calculate the supply gap that occurred in 2012,
adjustments had to be made to the demand numbers for an average year (as
presented in Section 3.2) to account for the colder temperatures. These adjusted
demand numbers were then used in the calculations to determine the heat supply-
demand gap.
The heat supply gap was estimated for 2012 as follows:
 Total heat demand in residential buildings was estimated based on the
  characteristics of the building stock in 2012, taking into account the specific
  number of the degree days in Dushanbe in that year and the normative
  requirements for indoor temperature.
 The amount of heat supplied in 2012 was then estimated based on the data on the
  heat supply provided by the DH and electricity supply companies. Estimates of the
  amount of electric top-up heating were made based on available statistical data.



                                                39
 The supply gap or unmet demand is assumed to be the difference between the
  calculated demand level and the amount of heat supplied as of 2012.
Table 3.15 below shows the amount of space heat supplied to residential and public
buildings by each heating source in Dushanbe.

The above analysis shows that the space heat supply gap is 23 percent of overall
demand in residential and public buildings.18 The space heat supply gap is greatest in
public buildings, where 27 percent of space heat demand goes unmet each year. This
confirms earlier findings of severe under-heating and low comfort levels in both public
and residential buildings.

4           Heat Supply and Demand in Khujand
Khujand is the second-largest city in Tajikistan and the largest industrial and cultural
center of northern Tajikistan. It is also the capital of Sughd, the northernmost province
of Tajikistan. The official population is 167,400 people with an historical growth rate
of about three percent. Khujand has low humidity with warm summers and
moderately mild winters. It belongs to climatic region III with 1,984 heating degree
days.19 The average length of the heating season is 122 days.
The residential building stock in Khujand consists of 10,600 individual family houses
that house 30 percent of the population (and which make up 30 percent of the
residential floor space), as well as 598 apartment buildings where the rest of the
population in Khujand lives. These make up the rest of the residential floor space. The
city also has around 147 public buildings.
There is no DH system in Khujand. Individual heating systems provide almost all of the
space heating, although some public buildings use small HOBs. There is a space heat
supply gap estimated at 29 percent of overall demand in residential and public

18   Hot water demand numbers were not available, so the heat supply gap analysis was only conducted for space
     heat demand.
19   3.74°C average outdoor air temperature during the heating season; 20°C normative indoor air temperature.

buildings. Like in Dushanbe, the space heat supply gap is the result of the poor energy
efficiency of most buildings and the undersupply of heat. The gap is greatest in multi-
apartment buildings, where 30 percent of space heat demand went unmet in 2012.
This section describes the current state of the heating sector in Khujand. It provides
an overview of the heating systems in place and describes their condition. It also
provides an estimate of the current space heating supply-demand gap in the city.
4.1    Heating Systems in Khujand
Heat in Khujand is supplied by the following systems:
 small HOBs
 individual heating systems.
There is no operational DH system remaining in Khujand. All but a small number of
public buildings are supplied with space heating and DHW preparation from individual
heating systems. Table 4.1 shows the coverage of public and residential buildings by
different heating systems.

4.1.1 Small HOBs
In 1993, “KhMK Khujand” JSC (the local subsidiary of “KMK” SUE) operated 16 boiler
houses to supply heat to all apartment blocks and all public buildings in Khujand.
Today, the company has only three operational small HOBs. Two HOBs supply heat to
hospitals, and one recently rehabilitated HOB was designed to supply multi-apartment
buildings but is not in operation. The reason heat cannot be delivered to the multi-
apartment buildings is that the internal heating systems in the buildings have been
dismantled and the residents cannot/are unwilling to finance the rehabilitation. The
total capacity of the two HOBs in operation is 3,600 Gcal/h (4,187 MWth). While the
small HOBs were designed to operate on gas, they have been converted to run on coal
and as a result are relatively inefficient. Table 4.2 below presents key data on the
existing “KhMK Khujand” heat supply systems.
Table 4.2: HOBs Owned by “KhMK Khujand” JSC
Installed capacity:   Boiler house (Hospital No.1): 1,800 Gcal/h (2,093 MWth)

In addition to the HOBs owned by “KhMK Khujand”, some additional boiler houses are
owned and operated by the public facilities they supply. Table 4.3 shows the number
of customers and amount of heat supplied by small HOBs, whether owned by “KhMK
Khujand” or autonomous. While all of the heat supplied by “KhMK Khujand” HOBs is
coal-fired, supply by autonomous small HOBs in Khujand is 55 percent electric, 40
percent coal-fired and five percent gas-fired.

Because small boilers mainly supply just one consumer each, the pipelines connected
to each boiler house are usually very short (100 to 150 m), but are poorly insulated.
As a result of the poor condition of the network, technical losses in 2012 were 12
percent. This is low compared to the overall losses on the DH system in Dushanbe, but
it is high given the short length of the networks in Khujand.
4.1.2 Individual heating systems
All residential buildings and the majority of public buildings in Khujand rely exclusively
on individual heating systems. These consist of oil or spiral radiators, coal or wood
burning stoves and boilers, and/or air heat pumps that also function as air conditioning
units. About 40 percent of the individual family houses use individual coal or wood
burning boilers or stoves in addition to electrical heating systems. It is estimated that
about 70 percent (94,627 Gcal) of total residential heat is supplied by individual
electrical systems and about 30 percent (42,365 Gcal) is supplied by individual
wood/coal fired systems.20 Public buildings also rely heavily on individual electrical
heating systems.

The prevalence of electricity for heating contributes to high residential electricity
consumption during the winter months. In 2012, residential electricity consumption
in January and December was three times as high as residential electricity
consumption in June. Figure 4.1 shows monthly electricity consumption in the
residential sector for the years 2010 to 2012.

4.2       Heat Demand in Khujand
Heat demand in Khujand was estimated for 2012 and compared to the estimated
amount of heat supplied to understand the magnitude of unmet heating demand in
the country. The housing stock in Khujand consists of 11,198 residential buildings with
a total residential area of 2.5 million m². Individual family houses account for 95
percent of the total number of residential buildings, but only 30 percent of the
residential floor space. Table 4.5 provides a breakdown of Khujand’s housing stock
area, population, and households by building type.

Residential sector demand for space heat and hot water in Khujand amounts to
293,892 Gcal per year as shown in Table 4.6, of which DHW preparation accounts for
about 40 percent. While individual family houses account for about 30 percent of the
residential floor area, they make up 40 percent of total residential heat demand.
Public building demand for heat and hot water in Khujand amounts to 65,732 Gcal per
year, as shown in Table 4.7. Only hospitals and kindergartens are assumed to have
access to DHW. Public buildings account for about 18 percent of overall heat demand.
Educational buildings account for 38 percent of the public sector demand.

demand in residential and public buildings. The space heat supply gap is greatest in
multi-apartment buildings, where 30 percent of space heat demand goes unmet each
year. Overall the gap is slightly lower in public buildings and individual houses.

5           Evaluation of Measures to Improve the Heating
            Sectors of Dushanbe and Khujand
Based on the current infrastructure, heat loads and fuel availability, the options for
meeting space heat demand in Dushanbe and Khujand are limited and range from the
rehabilitation of the existing DH system to small coal-fired HOBs and individual heating
solutions.
This section evaluates the economic viability of the main heating options and
associated investment measures for meeting the space heat demand of residential
and public buildings in Dushanbe and Khujand. The technical, institutional,
environmental and social advantages and disadvantages of each measure are
assessed. For each customer segment, the available heating options and investment
measures are ranked based on the results of this multi-criteria assessment to inform
the recommendations outlined in Section 6.
5.1         Assessment Approach
The following approach was used to select the most viable options and associated
investment measures to meet heat demand in public and residential buildings in
Dushanbe and Khujand:
1. Identification of main supply- and demand-side options. The main supply- and
   demand-side options for meeting residential and public heat demand were
   identified based on the existing heating infrastructure and the availability of fuels
   in each city. These options include: DH with coal-fired CHP (Dushanbe only); DH
   with coal-fired large HOBs (Dushanbe only); small coal-fired or electric HOBs;
   individual coal/solid fuel stoves or boilers; individual electric radiators; individual
   electric heat pumps; and energy efficiency in residential and public buildings.
2. Identification of a long list of investment measures. A comprehensive ‘long list’
   of 30 specific investment measures associated with each of the main heating
   options was identified.22
3. Development of a short list of investment measures. An initial economic and
   technical viability screening was applied to the long list of measures. Measures
   found to have very high investment costs, low potential for improving the heat
   supply, or limited technical feasibility were excluded in order to develop a ‘sho rt
   list’ of the most viable investment measures.
4. Assessment of economic viability. The economic viability of the 21 short listed
   investment measures was evaluated based on a two-tier analysis: (i) a levelized
   cost assessment of the main heat supply- and demand-side options to determine
   the most viable options for meeting the heat demand of different types of
   residential and public buildings; and (ii) a cost efficiency analysis of the 21 short
   listed specific investment measures associated with each of the main heating
   options.


22   The evaluation of the long listed measures was conducted as part of the technical background report prepared
     by Fichtner.


                                                        51
5. Assessment of non-economic advantages and disadvantages. Non-economic
   advantages and disadvantages of the short-listed investment measures were also
   evaluated. These non-economic considerations primarily include, technical,
   institutional, environmental and social advantages and disadvantages.
6. Ranking of investment measures. The investment measures were ranked for each
   customer segment based on the results of the multi-criteria assessments. The
   most cost-efficient investment measures associated with economically viable
   heating options and without major social and environmental disadvantages were
   recommended for implementation.
Table 5.1 below lists the main heating options and the associated investment
measures included in the long list.23 Measures that were selected for the short list are
highlighted in green and assigned an identifying number.

The remainder of this section describes the evaluation of the heating options and
related investment measures (steps 4-6 above).


5.2     Analysis of the Economic Viability of Heating Options and
        Associated Investment Measures
The economic viability of heating options and the related investment measures was
assessed. First, the Levelized Cost of Heat Supply (LCHS) for each heating options was
assessed. Then, the cost efficiency factor (CEF) of investment measures was analyzed.
5.2.1 Economic Viability of the Main Heating Options
The LCHS (see description in Box 5.1 below) for the heating options takes into account
the current heating infrastructure used by different customer segments as described
in Sections 3 and 4 (i.e., individual family houses currently using different individual
heating options, multi-apartment and public buildings with/without access to DH). The
different heating options serving the same customer segment were compared to each
other in order to determine the most viable solution for that segment.




                                                 53
     Box 5.1: Levelized Cost of Heat Supply (LCHS)
     The LCHS is the average discounted cost of a unit of heat supplied or a unit of demand
     reduced by a heating option over its lifetime, taking into account all capital, operating and
     fuel costs associated with that option. The LCHS is calculated in terms of US$ per kWh of
     thermal energy produced or saved by a given option. For the purposes of this report, the
     LCHS has been calculated based on international and regional benchmarks adjusted to
     local conditions (local suppliers, fuel cost, etc).

Table 5.2 shows the building types that are currently served by different heating
systems, and which of the identified main options would be available for each building
type and heating system.24 The deployment of individual coal-fired heating options is
limited to those buildings currently relying on coal.

         by that resource is the amount of energy saved by the energy efficiency measures, i.e., the
         capital cost of the energy efficiency measures is levelized over the energy saved over the
         measures’ lifetime.

The heating options that are most economically viable for each customer segment
based on the results presented in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 are described below.
Economic viability of heating options for individual family houses
For individual family houses currently using coal stoves or boilers, the available
options with the lowest LCHS is their replacement with more efficient models.
For individual family houses currently served by electric boilers or radiators, it would
be more economically viable to switch to electric heat pumps and improve energy
efficiency than to use electric radiators. Heat pumps, which take advantage of the heat
in the outside air, can operate in colder climates. Box 5.2 describes the applicability of
air-to-air heat pumps in cold climates.


                                                  56
 Box 5.2: Applicability of heat pumps in cold climates
 Air-to-air heat pumps (the type of heat pump evaluated in this report) use the heat present
 in the outside air to heat the air indoors. These devices use refrigerants that absorb heat
 from the outside air and release it indoors even when that air is as low as -30°C (as shown
 in Table 2.1, the average winter ambient temperature in Dushanbe and Khujand is greater
 than 0°C). For especially cold days, modern air-to-air heat pumps typically have a built-in
 “peak load” heating element.
 Unlike electric resistance heaters that convert electric energy to heat energy, heat pumps
 use electricity to run compressors and circulate refrigerants that absorb the heat in
 outdoor air. Therefore, air-to-air heat pumps are capable of generating more thermal
 energy than is required to operate them. For instance one kWh of electric energy can be
 used to generate three kWh of thermal energy (based on a realistic Coefficient of
 Performance of 3). While the efficiency of heat pumps decreases with lower ambient
 temperature, even during very cold days, the coefficient of modern heat pumps does not
 drop below 1.5, thus being more efficient than traditional electric oil radiators.



Economic viability of heating options for multi-apartment buildings
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by DH with CHP, heat supplied by the
CHP plant is the most economically viable option.
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by large HOBs, the analysis suggests
that installing small HOBs would have slightly lower economic costs, but the difference
in cost between the two options is relatively. Energy efficiency measures are also an
economically viable option to help reduce the heat demand of this customer segment.
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by small HOBs, small HOBs appear to
continue to be the most viable option. Energy efficiency measures also appear to be
an economically viable option to help reduce energy demand in these buildings.
For multi-apartment buildings that rely on individual electric radiators, switching to
individual electric heat pumps or installing small HOBs would both be more
economically viable options for meeting demand. Given the high economic cost of the
current electricity-based heat supply, energy efficiency measures are also
economically viable.
Economic viability of heating options for public buildings
For public buildings served by CHP-based DH or small HOBs, the most economically
viable option is to continue their current forms of heat supply. Energy efficiency
measures would also be an economically viable option for helping to meet demand in
public buildings. For buildings that are served by large HOBs, it appears that small
HOBs have a slightly lower LCHS than large HOBs, but the difference is relatively small.
For public buildings that are currently heated with electric radiators, the installation
of small HOBs and energy efficiency measures would be a more economically viable
heating option.

5.2.2 Economic analysis of the short listed measures
In order to determine relative economic viability of specific investment measures that
are included in the short list, the CEF (see description in Box 5.3) of each investment
measure was calculated, and the measures were compared on the basis of their CEFs.
A low CEF indicates economic viability. The CEF of each measure was taken into
account when selecting measures for recommendations.

 Box 5.3: Cost Efficiency Factor (CEF)
 The CEF evaluates the investment cost per unit of energy saved or produced by a given
 measure. The CEF is calculated by dividing the total investment cost of a given measure by
 the total amount of energy that it will save or produce over that measure’s lifetime. The
 CEF provides a rough estimate of the cost of an energy infrastructure investment per unit
 of energy saved or produced. However, the CEF should be used with caution because it
 does not account for the operating costs of a given investment. Measures with very low
 capital costs but very high operating costs may appear economically viable, though they
 are actually high cost after operating costs are taken into account. The CEF is useful
 nonetheless, because it provides insight into the economic viability of the non-heat
 producing measures (e.g., installation of variable speed drives, transition to consumption
 based-billing, etc.) compared with the heat producing measures.


Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 show the CEFs of all measures short-listed for Dushanbe and
Khujand, respectively. The analysis indicates that many of the rehabilitation measures
to improve the DH system in Dushanbe are economically viable, especially the
installation of variable speed drives, the re-insulation of over ground distribution
pipes, the installation of building-level temperature and hydraulic regulation or the
installation of building-level substations. With regards to investment measures to
improve autonomous heating options and individual heating systems, the analysis
suggest that the use of more efficient individual coal stoves, followed by small HOBs
and individual heat pumps are the most viable investment measures. The building
energy efficiency-related measures, on the other hand, have relatively high CEFs,
which is largely because they are capital-intensive and the CEF only takes into account
capital costs.

5.4    Summary of the Analysis of the Heating Options and Short List
       Measures
Based on the results of the economic assessment and the evaluation of other
advantages and disadvantages, the applicable investment measures for each
customer segment were prioritized to help inform the recommendations. The
prioritization was done taking into account first the economic viability of the main
heating options, second the results of the cost efficiency analysis for the specific
investment measures, and third the other advantages and disadvantages associated
with each measure. The weighting of the latter is a policy choice; for the purpose of
this report, advantages/disadvantages related to the impact on winter power
shortages and comfort levels were weighted the most. The multi-criteria approach
was used to determine priority heating options as well as fallback heating options for
each customer segment.
Figure 5.5 presents an overview of the priority and fallback heating options for each
customer segment in Dushanbe and Khujand, based on the multi-criteria assessment
of economic and non-economic benefits of each heating option. A more detailed
description is provided in Section 6.

6      Recommendation of Measures to Improve the
       Heating Sectors of Dushanbe and Khujand
The investment needs of the heating sector are sizable, estimated to amount to about
US$200 million in the short and close to US$700 million in the long-term. The
implementation of the investment measures will therefore need to be adequately
phased and prioritized. This could be achieved by preparing detailed investment and
implementation plans for the heating sector based on the viable investment measures
recommended in this study. Heating companies could also use the investment plans
to ensure well-planned and coordinated fund raising from bilateral and multi-lateral
development partners and the private sector. Also, deployment of efficient
autonomous and individual heating solutions, such as switching to small HOBs or
replacing inefficient coal stoves and heaters with more efficient models, will require
demand-driven programs supported by public consultation and outreach campaigns
in addition to appropriate implementation, financing and incentive mechanisms.
This section summarizes the recommended investment measures and related policy
actions needed to improve the reliability and efficiency of heat supply in Dushanbe
and Khujand. For each recommendation, the investment measures and the scope of
their implementation are described. Some of the most important implementation
issues are also highlighted, and immediate next steps are outlined.
6.1    Recommendation 1: Implementation of a Scalable Program for the
       Replacement of Inefficient Individual Heating Sources
Inefficient, individual heating systems are a key challenge for Tajikistan’s urban
heating sector. The use of inefficient coal- and biomass-fired stoves and boilers results
in high indoor pollution and low comfort levels, while the high reliance on electric
heaters is an inefficient use of valuable electricity resources. The proliferation of
inefficient, individual electric heating systems has also destabilized the power grid and
increased the frequency of blackouts and power shortages.
6.1.1 Recommended measures
A scalable program for more efficient small heating technologies is recommended,
including more efficient individual stoves, boilers and heat pumps. International
experience shows that such programs can bring substantial benefits to residential
consumers by reducing coal consumption and costs (by up to 35 percent), decreasing
electricity consumption and related costs for heating (by up to 70 percent), lowering
indoor air pollution and increasing comfort levels. The program would also have a high
replication potential in both urban and rural areas given the large share of households
currently relying on inefficient individual heating solutions.
6.1.2 Scope of implementation
The target group for such a program would be residential and public consumers
currently relying on inefficient individual heating solutions as their primary heat
source and for which small HOBs are not an option. This includes residential and public
consumers using traditional coal- and biomass-fired heating stoves or boilers as well
as those using inefficient electric oil radiators.


                                           65
 Replacement of inefficient coal-/biomass-fired stoves or boilers with more
  efficient models. Switching to more efficient and less polluting solid fuel-fired
  stoves and boilers should be incentivized for households and public institutions that
  are currently using traditional solid fuel-fired models for heating.
 Replacement of inefficient electric oil radiators with heat pumps . Individual heat
  pumps could be promoted for residential and public buildings that currently rely on
  electric heating options. However, in Dushanbe, the detailed scope of priority
  buildings for individual heat pumps needs to take into account the planned
  coverage area to be served by the CHP 2.
6.1.3 Implementation issues
Ensuring adequate equipment supply and efficient distribution channels: In order to
ensure that the individual heating technologies promoted as part of the program (i.e.,
coal stoves and boilers, heat pumps) result in significant efficiency gains and comply
with safety and emission requirements, the supply chain for such equipment must be
strengthened. To this end, potential design elements for the program should take into
account: (i) adoption of technical, environmental and safety performance standards
for products; (ii) eligibility criteria for products and suppliers, including supply capacity
of producers; (iii) quality verification and enforcement mechanisms to ensure
adequate performance of products; (iv) regulating supply chains and distribution
channels to avoid non-compliant copy-cat models, e.g., through dedicated distribution
centers; (v) eligibility criteria for households to ensure targeted replacements and
incentive schemes; (vi) organizing efficient return and disposal systems for old
equipment; and (vii) capacity building and technical assistance for local producers, as
needed.
Enhancing demand through dedicated financing and incentive mechanisms and
public outreach campaigns: Financing and perception are the principle challenges to
developing and implementing a program to promote efficient individual heating
technologies. The experience in Tajikistan and other countries suggests that
households are reluctant or unable to fund the higher upfront investment for new,
individual heating solutions unless payback periods can be shortened. Given the
relatively high unit price of more efficient models compared to traditional options
(stoves, boilers and electric heaters), the market penetration of efficient technologies
at scale would require a dedicated financing mechanism and a well-targeted incentive
program from the Government. Experience from ongoing pilot projects in Tajikistan
as well as countries with similar programs could offer useful lessons learned and
design options for implementation and financing schemes. International models used
include the development of dedicated (micro-) credit-lines for eligible households,
results-based financing schemes or demand-side management programs combined
with targeted subsidy schemes (e.g., disbursement after verified installation). The
subsidy schemes could be designed to reflect the affordability of target households,
reward the use of models with higher performance and/or promote rapid penetration
of new equipment. Box 6.1 and




                                             66
 include examples of programs in Mongolia and Armenia. In addition to such
programs, extensive public outreach activities and information campaigns will be
required to increase awareness and enhance demand. The design of a program for the
deployment of efficient heating solutions at household-level should also build on the
implementation experience and lessons learned from ongoing pilot programs in
Tajikistan, which aim to address the winter energy crisis through the deployment of
energy efficient stoves and improving the insulation of individual houses. This includes
initiatives supported by the German development agency for international
cooperation (GIZ), the Asian Development Bank, Non-Governmental Organizations
(e.g. Habitat for Humanity, l’Agence d’Aide à la Coopération Technique et au
Développement) and some microfinance institutions. While the scale and impact of
the initiatives vary, a few key points can be distilled at this stage: (i) a range of
technologies are on the market but adequate performance, safety and quality
standards are not ensured; (ii) demand has been less than expected and has declined
in recent months due to the impact of the Russian economic crisis on Tajikistan; (iii)
public awareness is a critical component of stimulating demand, however more needs
to be done; (iv) existing initiatives do not target the very poor; and (v) public buildings
(schools and clinics) continue to face challenges in improving their comfort levels.

Box 6.1: Clean Stove Initiative in Mongolia
The Clean Stove Initiative for Mongolia (Mongolia-CSI) sold nearly 98,000 subsidized, low-
emission stoves in five districts in Ulaanbaatar between June 2011 and November 2012,
reaching 55 percent of all households in the target area. The program was funded by the
Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Mongolian Clean Air Fund, and followed a
number of smaller pilot programs that were financed by the Asian Development Bank,
Gesellschaft for Internationale Zusammernarbeit, Millennium Challenge Corporation, the
World Bank and World Vision.
In order to identify models of stoves to subsidize, the Mongolian University of Science and
Technology tested the emissions performance of 14 models of energy efficient solid fuel-
based stoves, and four were selected for the program. Two of the models were
manufactured in Turkey, and two were from China. Stoves were sold in “Product Centers”
in each administrative subdivision, and each household was eligible to purchase one
subsidized stove. Many of the product centers were operated by XacBank, a commercial
bank that supplied sales and support staff and offered micro-loans to households who
could not afford even the subsidized prices. Depending on the model of stove, subsidies
ranged from US$195 to US$319 per stove. After subsidies, the stove price to the consumer
was 60 to 75 percent below the market prices for the same stove. To receive the subsidy,
households were required to turn in their old stove. This ensured that polluting stoves
were no longer in use. New stoves were delivered to the household. Customers completed
a training program learn proper use of the stove.
Mongolia’s program contains several key lessons and best practices that should be applied
to stove and heat pump subsidy programs in the Tajikistan. These are as follows:
   Subsidy programs should allow consumers to choose among several models, and
    subsidy payments should only be made after installation is confirmed.
   Final prices after subsidy should not be so low as to allow purchases by consumers
    who will not use and maintain the equipment properly.
   Equipment should be distributed through local product centers to ensure quality of
    the product and eligibility for the subsidies.
   Confirming installation of the equipment and training consumers ensures that
    equipment is used properly, and prevents re-selling of subsidized products.
   Removing old equipment from use ensures large and sustainable improvements in
    efficiency.
   Programs should be implemented in partnership with the private sector in order to
    provide good customer service and respond to market demands.

     Box 6.2: Efficient Gas Stove Subsidies in Armenia
     As its gas distribution network gradually expanded, Armenia launched a program to
     distribute efficient gas stoves to poor urban households with limited access to heating.
     The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid, the World Bank’s Urban Heating Project and
     the Government of Armenia funded the program.
     Families were eligible for participating in the subsidy program if they were enrolled in the
     Poverty Family Benefit Program, a social protection program for Armenia’s low -income
     households. In addition, families had to live in an urban multi-apartment building that was
     connected to a functioning gas network. Finally, the family had to contribute US$25-50.
     Armenia’s Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2) administered the
     program. The R2E2 Fund publicized the program and encouraged poor urban families to
     apply. After determining eligibility, the R2E2 Fund collected the family cash contribution
     and worked with the gas company to organize installation and connection of new stoves.
     The R2E2 Fund then independently verified the installation of the stoves and delivery of
     gas service. It refunded the payments made by the gas company to the contractors who
     installed the stoves.
     Armenia’s experience in subsidizing gas stove installations provides several key lessons
     that are worth noting if a coal stove program is implemented in Tajikistan:
        Early preparation for implementation is crucial to adjust reporting and monitoring
         mechanisms to the program’s requirements.
        Households should be made to apply for the program and provide cash payment, as
         these activities foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the program.
        Procurement needs adequate planning, including the ability to allow contract
         extensions with the providers who win the bidding for the project.

6.1.4 Next steps
The next steps for developing and implementing a program promoting efficient
individual stoves, boilers and heat pumps are described below.
Conduct a detailed market assessment. The scope of the market assessment should
include a review of: (i) the current use of inefficient coal- and biomass-fired
stoves/boilers and electric heaters, including the types of devices, average lifetime in
use, market prices, equipment suppliers and available products; (ii) the efficiency,
environmental and safeguard performance of internationally available efficient
models; (iii) the supply chain and local market for more efficient technologies; (iv) the
energy savings potential and pollution reduction benefits that are possible from the
deployment of more efficient models; and (v) for heat pumps, the evaluation of grid
stability and frequency fluctuations and their potential for damaging heat pump
equipment and measures to mitigate this risk.25


25   For instance, one potential mitigation option could be the installation of adequate protection devices such as
     surge protectors, power conditioners or Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)


                                                         69
Develop and design targeted implementation and financing schemes, including the
mobilization of grant resources. As indicated above, international experience from
countries with similar program could offer useful lessons learned and design options
for implementation and financing schemes.
Implement pilot projects. A pilot project is recommended to: (i) demonstrate the
benefits of more efficient individual heating models in terms of energy (cost) savings,
indoor air pollution, and comfort levels; (ii) test the adequacy of the selected
implementation and financing schemes; and (iii) investigate the willingness of
consumers to switch to new stoves and boilers under the chosen implementation and
financing schemes.
Conduct early public outreach campaigns. International experience confirms that
extensive awareness and promotion campaigns are important to educate the public
about benefits related to more efficient individual heating options and inform people
about the dedicated financing and implementation mechanisms.
6.2         Recommendation 2: Implementation of a Targeted Rehabilitation
            and Construction Program for Small HOBs
Around 90 percent of the multi-apartment buildings and 73 percent of the public
buildings rely on individual systems for heating. Many of these buildings were
previously served by either DH systems or small HOBs that are no longer in operation.
The large majority of the few small HOBs still in operation are in poor condition with
low efficiency and high pollution levels due to the absence of modern flue gas cleaning
systems.
6.2.1 Recommended measures
In selected residential and public buildings with large heating loads and without access
to DH, it is recommended to: (i) replace dilapidated or non-operational small HOBs26
with efficient small HOBs that are equipped with modern flue gas cleaning systems;
and (ii) substitute electricity- or solid fuel-based individual heating sources in selected
buildings with efficient small HOBs (with flue gas cleaning systems).
The recent World Bank report on Tajikistan’s Winter Energy Crisis showed that
switching from electricity to coal-based heating options is needed to help reduce the
winter energy deficit and meet future demand. Compared to current small HOBs in
use, modern HOBs can save between 20 and 50 percent of the coal consumption and
help reduce pollution due to modern flue gas cleaning systems. Compared to
individual coal-based stoves or boilers, the efficiency and pollution reduction gains are
likely to be even higher. Substituting electricity-based heating with small HOBs would
also help to reduce power shortages, while meeting heating demand in a cost-efficient
way.




26   There are 15 small HOBs owned by Dushanbe Teploset, three small HOBs owned by KMK Khujand, and a number
     of small HOBs owned by individual public and residential building owners.


                                                      70
6.2.2 Scope of implementation
For residential and public buildings without access to DH in the medium-term, the
construction and rehabilitation of small HOBs should be considered for the following
priority building types:
 As a first priority: (i) public buildings relying on unreliable and inefficient individual
  heating solutions or old HOBs with large heating loads, such as hospitals; and (ii)
  new public and multi-apartment buildings under construction.
 As a second priority: (i) construction of small HOBs for multi-apartment buildings
  with large heating loads and an existing internal heating network (including those
  in need of substantial rehabilitation), which are currently relying on individual
  heating systems; and (ii) new multi-apartment buildings which will be built in the
  future .
 As a third priority, the construction of efficient small HOBs and related networks
  could also be considered for multi-apartment buildings with large heating loads and
  currently relying on electricity-based heating and without an internal heating
  network. Construction of small HOBs in these residential buildings should be
  demand-driven, with the apartment owners opting to switch to a central heating
  system.
To ensure the sustainability of investments, it is also recommended that the internal
building heating systems are rehabilitated, as necessary. Whenever the internal
heating network is rehabilitated or newly constructed, the investments should also
include building level metering, allow apartments to regulate their heat consumption,
enable the introduction of consumption based-billing and disconnection of individual
apartments (in case of newly built internal heating infrastructure).
6.2.3 Implementation issues
Environmental impact: In order to minimize the environmental impact of coal
combustion, new small coal-fired HOBs should have an efficiency of 80 percent and
modern flue gas cleaning systems. As indicated earlier, replacing old coal-fired small
HOBs with more efficient and cleaner models can save 20 to 50 percent of the coal
used and will therefore have a positive environmental impact. Similarly, replacing
individual coal-fired stoves (e.g., in public buildings) with efficient small HOBs is
expected to result in significant efficiency gains and reduce indoor air pollution.
However, substituting electricity-based heating in selected buildings with coal-fired
HOBs will increase pollution and would need to be carefully considered and prioritized
for selected buildings only. A prioritized investment and implementation plan should
be prepared and detailed feasibility and environmental and social impact assessments
conducted before implementing a program targeting the replacement or construction
of small HOBs. In addition, to reduce heat losses in buildings (and therefore
consumption), the upgrades of the heating system should be accompanied by energy
efficiency measures in the selected buildings.
Building-internal heating infrastructure: The recommended priority buildings either
have an internal building heating infrastructure or are under construction. The
replacement of small HOBs should be accompanied by the rehabilitation of internal
heating networks to ensure reliable and efficient supply. Where possible, thermostatic

                                            71
valves and heat cost allocators should be installed. For greenfield installations of small
HOBs for new buildings, it is advisable to opt for horizontal designs of internal heating
networks to allow for individual apartment metering and disconnection (for non-
payment). However, implementation experience from other countries shows that
resuming centralized heat supply in buildings where the building-internal heating
infrastructure has been dismantled is institutionally challenging. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in multi-apartment buildings where collective decision-
making is required, and given that low electricity tariffs provide no incentives to switch
to alternative sources for heating. Options to help promote collective solutions
include: focusing first on public buildings; developing a demand-driven program for
multi-apartment buildings accompanied by adequate financing and incentive
arrangements; and conducting extensive public outreach and information campaigns
to inform customers about expected benefits and investment requirements.
Financing: As described in Section 2, heating companies are in poor financial
condition. They lack the funding to pay for the up-front capital cost of new small HOBs.
Because the companies operate at a loss, their borrowing capacity is seriously
constrained. Securing concessional financing for rehabilitation may also be
challenging, in particular for coal-fired HOBs. However, greenfield installations in
newly constructed multi-apartment buildings, or replacement of boilers owned by
public institutions may offer new business opportunities for engaging private sector
participation (for example, private heat suppliers or private maintenance companies),
in particular if the tariffs for small HOBs are deregulated.
6.2.4 Next steps
The next steps for the implementation of small HOBs are as follows:
 Select target buildings for constructing or replacing small HOBs. Depending on the
  availability of funds and the planned coverage area of the CHP 2, the selection of
  priority buildings could focus first on public buildings with large heat demand,
  followed by large residential buildings with existing building-internal heating
  systems (if the majority of residents are willing to switch collectively to centralized
  heat supply).
 Conduct a feasibility study to confirm the costs and scope of the recommended
  investment, and to assess the technical condition of selected buildings and/or
  boilers; heat demand; availability of internal building heating systems and the need
  for rehabilitation; the suitability of these systems for supply with small HOB
  (required space for small HOBs, flue gas cleaning and coal storage, options for the
  transport of coal, etc.); and potential environmental impacts. In case of the
  installation of a small HOB in public buildings, ownership issues must also be
  clarified. Currently, some of the small HOBs are owned and operated by the utility
  while others belong to the building owner.
 Develop targeted financing and implementation schemes and public outreach
  campaigns. Given the challenge noted above of incentivizing building owners to
  switch to collective heating solutions, and taking into account the low affordability
  level, targeted financing and subsidy schemes accompanied by extensive public
  outreach campaigns are needed to construct or rehabilitate small HOBs and the
  related building-internal heating infrastructure. Potential options include: partial

                                           72
  subsidies, recovery through temporarily adjusted heating bills, micro-credits for
  building-internal rehabilitation, etc.
 Combine with energy efficiency measures. Experience from other countries
  demonstrates the importance of reducing building structure-related heat losses
  when improving the heating system in order to help achieve better results in terms
  of efficiency and financial viability.
6.3    Recommendation 3: Improving the Reliability and Efficiency of the
       DH network in Dushanbe
Measures targeting reliability and efficiency improvements of the DH network in
Dushanbe have been identified among the most viable investment opportunities given
that the construction of the new CHP is already funded and ongoing. Furthermore,
early investments in rehabilitating the DH network are needed to ensure that the
network can absorb the additional heat supplied, avoid excessive losses and provide
heat to parts of the city that are no longer served by it.
6.3.1 Recommended measures
It is recommended to implement a priority package of investment measures that
improve the reliability and efficiency of the DH network supplied by the new CHP in
Dushanbe. These include:
 Install building-level substations. Modern substations with heat exchangers will
  allow supply to be matched with demand through better temperature control at
  the building level, and should be installed in all multi-apartment and public
  buildings. Transitioning to a ‘closed’ DH system (via heat exchangers at substations)
  will further enable an increase of the heat delivery to end-consumers, improved
  water quality, safer operation and less corrosion of network pipelines.
 Implement metering, temperature regulation and consumption-based billing.
  These measures will allow heat service companies to bill customers based on the
  amount of energy consumed, rather than simply on the area heated. The transition
  to consumption-based billing also enables households to control their heat
  consumption and bills and provide them with an incentive for more economic use
  of thermal energy. Given the limited resources, it is recommended to focus in a first
  step on the installation of building-level heat meters and apartment-level hot water
  meters. The second phase could then involve the installation of temperature
  regulation and heat cost allocators at apartment level.
 Replace priority transmission and distribution pipelines and re-insulate
  overground distribution pipelines. Replacing worn-out pipelines with pre-
  insulated and accurately dimensioned pipes and re-insulating overground pipelines
  would improve supply reliability and service quality, decrease heat losses and
  reduce service interruptions.
 Install variable speed drives in DH substation pumps. Variable speed drives allow
  the system to adjust the output of DH substation pumps to match the required fluid
  throughput, rather than running at a single, high throughput level all of the time.
  Estimates indicate that this would reduce electricity consumption in pumping
  stations by more than one third.


                                          73
While in principle the measures listed above could be implemented separately, it is
recommended that building-level substations (M6) be implemented together with
metering (M2), temperature regulation (M3) and consumption-based billing (M4).
Implementing these measures together with the re-insulation of above ground
distribution lines (M9); the installation of variable speed drives in DH substation
pumps (M10); and the rehabilitation of internal building heating systems (M11) would
help to ensure maximum efficiency gains and technical sustainability of investments
at the network level.
6.3.2 Scope of implementation
The reliability and efficiency investment package should only be implemented in
public and multi-apartment buildings that are supplied by a reliable generation facility.
Accordingly, it is recommended to consider first the implementation of these
measures only for the network and buildings supplied by the CHP 2. As feasibility
studies for the modernization of other DH generation assets (e.g., East and West boiler
houses) are conducted, and once financing is mobilized (depending on the outcome
of the feasibility study), implementation of the efficiency and reliability investment
package could also be considered for the network and buildings served by these
generation facilities.
6.3.3 Implementation issues
Tariff reform: Heat tariffs in Tajikistan are well below cost-recovery levels and
gradually would need to be adjusted towards cost-recovery levels to improve the
financial and operational performance of the heating sector and ensure the
sustainability of any investments in the DH system. Without tariff increases,
companies will not be able to make investments to improve the reliability of heat
supply. To track improvements in reliability and service quality as tariffs increase, it is
recommended to develop and adopt a transparent performance monitoring and
reporting framework, including key performance indicators, for heating companies. It
is important to note, however, that heating tariff increases should be implemented in
parallel with increases to electricity tariffs. Increasing heating tariffs alone may
accelerate fuel switching from DH to electricity, putting further strain on the power
grid during peak winter months.
To ensure that a basic level of consumption remains affordable to the poor, tariff
reforms need to be accompanied by improved targeting and coverage of the social
protection program. Additional measures the Government may want to consider to
help mitigate the impact of tariff increases include, for instance, an energy efficiency
program for buildings (see Section 6.4) that can help to reduce energy consumption
and expenditures; the gradual transition to consumption-based billing would also help
to ensure that consumers can control their consumption and match it with what they
can afford. Consumption-based billing will also increase pressure on heating
companies to show value-for-money by improving service quality and reducing
network losses. Experience from other countries in the ECA region indicates that heat
metering and consumption-based billing can generate substantial energy savings
(around 25 to 30 percent of the heat consumed), and reduce energy costs for
consumers compared to norm-based billing practices. However, implementation of
consumption-based billing is politically and institutionally challenging. It will require


                                            74
careful planning and phasing and should be accompanied with extensive public
outreach campaigns.
Efficiency improvements at the apartment level: The installation of thermostatic
valves and heat cost allocators in individual apartments can be challenging (e.g.,
access to apartments, financing arrangements, etc.) despite the benefits for
consumers. This will require careful planning, extensive information and public
outreach campaigns to inform customers about the benefits of these improvements,
and adequate financing/implementation arrangements (e.g., direct-to-consumer
subsidy and distribution programs, through the heating utilities). Therefore, as a first
step, it is recommended to prioritize the installation of building-level heat and
apartment-level hot water meters before moving to the institutionally more complex
implementation of thermostatic valves and heat cost allocators in individual
apartments.
Ensuring technical sustainability of investments: The technical sustainability of
efficiency measures targeting the distribution network should be evaluated for the
total network (over- and underground transmission and distribution network) in order
to identify and address urgent rehabilitation needs. This also includes internal heating
network within buildings. Issues and challenges related to the poor condition of the
building-internal heating infrastructure are highlighted as part of Section 6.2, and are
equally applicable for DH systems.
Financing: The current financial condition of the DH companies, coupled with the low
end-user tariffs means that the DH companies will struggle to attract commercial
financing for the investments recommended above. The DH companies and the
Government may want to consider mobilizing different sources of concessional
financing. As highlighted above, the rehabilitation of the building- and apartment-level
heating infrastructure (usually not owned by the DH company) is expected to require
special financing and implementation schemes, as well as some regulatory changes.
Box 6.3 describes how similar actions were implemented in Poland.




                                           75
 Box 6.3: World Bank Program Supporting DH Reforms in Poland
 During the mid-1990s, Poland experienced many of the problems facing Tajikistan today.
 In the early 1990s, the Government of Poland transferred ownership and responsibility for
 DH companies to the municipalities. The decentralization of ownership and a phasing out
 of investment subsidies meant DH companies lacked funds to effectively operate,
 maintain, and rehabilitate their infrastructure. This, in turn, led to high heat and hot water
 losses, which further deteriorated the financial sustainability of DH companies.
 The World Bank supported the Government in tackling some of the key issues in the DH
 sector. From 1991 to 2000, the World Bank provided US$340 million for the Heat Supply
 Restructuring and Conservation Project in Poland. The project included support for: (i)
 energy restructuring, commercialization of restructured enterprises, introduction of a
 transparent regulatory framework, and pricing policy reform; (ii) rehabilitation and
 modernization to extend DH infrastructure asset life; and (iii) energy conservation and
 pollution reduction through investments in energy efficiency improvements.
 The Government’s support for energy efficiency and conservation investments and pricing
 policies led to gradual increases in residential tariffs. The Government also reduced budget
 layouts for energy subsidies. These two efforts were key to the project’s success. Energy
 efficiency measures carried out by DH companies achieved a 50 percent reduction in heat
 transmission and distribution losses, which led to 22 percent energy savings, equivalent to
 roughly US$55 million per year.
 Building-level heat metering was a crucial component of these energy efficiency
 improvements. Metering in the buildings covered by the five DH companies targeted in
 the project increased from 21 percent at the start of the project to 100 percent by project
 completion. Further evaluation of the project underlined the significance of metering:
 without accurate measurement of the heat supply, DH companies often vastly
 underestimated the level of heat transmission losses in the network. Heat transmission
 losses can reach 20 percent of heat purchased and represent up to 17 percent of variable
 operating costs. As a result, the companies failed to properly prioritize heat loss mitigation
 and lost major opportunities for cost savings. Evaluation of the project concluded that:
 “Future Bank projects with DH companies should assign top priority to metering of total
 purchases and sales of heat as early as possible during project implementation.”

6.3.4 Next steps
Prepare a detailed investment and implementation plan for the DH reliability and
efficiency improvement measures. This should include: a detailed list of investment
measures and implementation steps; cost of each investment measure based on local
market prices (including imports); estimated energy (cost) savings or other benefits
associated with each measure; and sequencing of implementation steps with related
timetables. The investment plan should prioritize/rank the investment measures
based on heat supply reliability and efficiency criteria and the results of an economic-
financial analysis. As part of the detailed assessment, the following aspects are
recommended to be included:
 Assess which buildings should be prioritized for the installation of modern
  substations; consider switching from open to closed system through the use of heat

                                              76
  exchangers; include an analysis of associated substation reconstruction needs, and
  detailed cost estimates; conduct an economic-financial analysis of different options
  to help prioritize investments.
 Assess costs and benefits for building-level and apartment-level heat metering
  (including the installation of thermostatic valves, bypasses, balancing valves and
  heat cost allocators); conduct an economic-financial analysis for each option;
  prepare implementation plan with detailed sequencing.
 Assess the needs and related cost estimates for the rehabilitation of building-
  internal heating systems to ensure the technical sustainability and optimal
  efficiency gains associated with the other building- and apartment-level heating
  upgrades; include a company-level evaluation of relevant Management
  Information Systems (MIS) to facilitate the transition to consumption-based billing,
  and strengthen the consumer focus (e.g., through Customer Management
  Systems).
 Identify required replacements and re-insulation of the transmission and
  distribution network in order to ensure reliable operations of the DH system;
  include detailed cost estimates, an economic-financial analysis and safeguard
  issues (e.g., asbestos).
 Analyze the installation of variable speed pumps/drives at pumping stations and
  DH network pumps; include detailed cost estimates and an economic-financial
  analysis.
 Prepare a detailed implementation plan outlining the sequencing of works for each
  measure; prepare technical specifications; design possible implementation and
  financing mechanisms, in particular for the installation of building- and apartment-
  level devices; and conduct extensive public information campaigns for customers.
 Develop a time-bound transition path towards consumption-based billing, taking
  into account implementation of required investments at building- and apartment-
  level; adopt a tariff structure to enable consumption-based billing; introduce
  changes in the billing/collection practices of the DH companies; introduce required
  legal, regulatory and institutional changes for tariff and social protection reforms.
6.4    Recommendation 4: Implementation of an Energy Efficiency
       Program in Buildings
Improving the efficient use of energy in buildings is one of the most cost-effective and
environmentally friendly ways to help meet heat demand in Tajikistan. It is estimated
that energy efficiency improvements could reduce energy consumption by 30 to 40
percent, and generate savings of up to nearly 270,000 MWh per year in Dushanbe and
Khujand. Given the poor energy performance of the majority of buildings in Tajikistan,
this would also have a number of other co-benefits, including improved comfort levels
in buildings, reduced air pollution and reduced energy expenditures for households
and public institutions.
6.4.1 Recommended investment measures
Energy efficiency retrofits in public and multi-apartment residential buildings are
recommended in both Dushanbe and Khujand (M1). Depending on the conditions of

                                           77
the buildings, recommended retrofitting measures include the insulation of walls,
basements and/or attics; repair/replacement of external doors and windows; window
optimization (partial replacement of existing windows with walls while complying with
day-light requirements); and improved operations and maintenance practices.
6.4.2 Scope of implementation
The LCHS indicates that energy efficiency, in conjunction with individual stoves and
DH supplied by the CHP, is the most viable option to meet demand in public and
residential buildings.
As a priority, energy efficiency measures in Dushanbe and Khujand should be
implemented in all public and residential buildings where the heating systems will be
upgraded. Experience in other ECA countries demonstrates that linking improvements
of heating systems with building energy efficiency measures generates significant
operational and financial synergies.
It is also recommended that the Government consider developing a broader energy
efficiency program for public and/or residential buildings nationwide. To streamline
limited resources, the Government should consider focusing initially on an energy
efficiency program for public buildings. This would help to demonstrate the benefits
of energy efficiency, benefit a large share of the population, and improve provision of
key public services by increasing comfort levels in schools, hospitals, kindergartens
and other social facilities during winter. Starting with the public sector can also help
to catalyze the energy efficiency market before moving to the institutionally more
complex residential sector. Multi-apartment buildings in Tajikistan often lack well-
functioning collective decision-making structures, sufficient financial incentives for
private investments and access to affordable financing.
6.4.3 Implementation issues
Energy efficiency building programs supported by the World Bank and other
development partners in ECA have demonstrated that substantial energy savings
(between 20 and 50 percent) and co-benefits (e.g., increased comfort levels) can be
achieved. However, effective implementation requires a strong enabling environment
and targeted financing and implementation mechanisms. Decisive government
actions and long-term commitment is required to enact and enforce legislation, adopt
policy and regulatory enhancements, improve market conditions, build local capacity
and provide access to affordable financing. Some of the priority actions and
implementation issues are highlighted below.
Tariff reform: The transition to cost-reflective energy prices for both heat and
electricity is key to improving the financial viability of the energy efficiency
investments (see Section 6.3.3). In addition, the introduction of consumption-based
billing practices for customers connected to the DH system is a pre-requisite for the
generation of energy cost savings for households and public institutions investing in
energy efficiency.
Developing targeted financing and implementation mechanisms: The Government
should consider developing and designing effective financing mechanisms to support




                                           78
implementation of an energy efficiency program targeted either for public or
residential buildings.
Financing mechanisms for public buildings: International experience indicates that
there are a number of different financing options ranging from public financing (e.g.,
grant-financed pilot programs) to commercial financing (e.g., credit lines, partial credit
guarantees, energy service company (ESCO) financing, etc.). Based on the local market
capacity and the maturity of the financial and credit markets in Tajikistan, the
following two mechanisms may be the most suitable short-term financing options to
support energy efficiency investments in public buildings:
 Budget financing with piloting of more sustainable models: To build capacity,
  demonstrate energy efficiency benefits, reduce public energy cost spending and
  improve comfort levels in schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other public
  facilities, the Government should consider the implementation of a budget/grant-
  financed energy efficiency program for public buildings. Under such a program, the
  Government provides funding (e.g., as part of a project financed by international
  financial institutions and/or other development partners) to public
  facilities/municipalities to cover the up-front costs of energy efficiency
  investments. Gradually, the program could include more sustainable financing
  features, such as ‘budget capture models’. In this case, future energy budgetary
  provisions for the benefit of public institutions are reduced until the loan has been
  (partially or fully) repaid. The Government can then use some of the cash saved
  through the budget capture system to finance additional projects. Another option
  would be the phasing-in of co-financing arrangements with the beneficiaries.
  Budget/grant-financed energy efficiency programs are typically implemented
  through a project implementation unit (PIU), which provides support for selecting
  buildings, conducts technical preparatory activities and related procurements (e.g.,
  energy audits, designs) and supervises and implements the energy efficiency
  measures and monitoring of results.
 Revolving Fund for energy efficiency: Some developing countries (e.g., Armenia,
  Bulgaria, India, Romania, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have or
  are planning to create revolving funds to finance energy efficiency measures in
  public buildings. In this case, a Fund (typically an independent entity established by
  the government) provides the up-front investments and technical assistance for
  preparing and implementing energy efficiency measures. The benefitting public
  institution repays the investment costs based on the estimated or verified energy
  cost savings achieved. This allows the funds to revolve (by re-investing the repaid
  funds) while the benefitting public institution can maintain a positive cash flow.
  Such a Fund may offer different financial products and technical assistance services
  to cover the needs and capacity of different public institutions (e.g., loans, grants,
  guarantees for commercial bank loans, technical assistance for energy auditing,
  procurement, supervision, etc.). Key issues in Tajikistan that could hamper
  implementation of a revolving fund scheme include: (i) the low energy tariffs (which
  keep savings from reduced energy consumption low); (ii) unmet demand in public
  buildings (which means that when building energy efficiency is improved, energy
  consumption does not drop); and (iii) the limited technical and financial market


                                           79
  capacity. Box 6.4 provides an example of experience with a revolving energy
  efficiency fund in Armenia.


 Box 6.4: Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund in Armenia
 The R2E2 Fund was established in 2005 initially as a PIU for a World Bank-supported
 energy efficiency/renewable energy project. The Fund operates on a fully commercial
 basis and is governed by a board of trustees made up of representatives from the
 government, private sector, NGOs, and academia. A government-appointed executive
 director, supported by technical and financial staff, manages day-to-day activities. The
 Fund is currently implementing a World Bank/GEF-supported energy efficiency program
 in public sector facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals, and administration buildings, street
 lighting) using a revolving fund scheme. The Fund offers two financing products to eligible
 public entities:
 Energy Service Agreements (ESA) are used for schools and other public entities that are
 not legally or budget independent. Under the ESA, a public entity pays the Fund its
 baseline energy costs (with adjustments for energy prices, usage, and other factors) over
 the 7-to-10-year contract period. The Fund designs the project, hires subcontractors,
 oversees construction and commissioning and monitors the subproject. In this case, the
 client entity incurs no debt. Rather, the Fund directly pays the energy bills to the utility on
 the client’s behalf. The Fund retains the balance to cover its investment cost and service
 fee. The ESA is designed so that the duration can be adjusted if the Fund recovers its full
 investment earlier (or later).
 For municipalities and public entities with revenue streams independent of the state
 budget, loans are provided. These loans count as municipal debt, with fixed repayment
 obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years. The repayment
 amounts are designed to allow clients to repay the investment costs and service fees from
 the estimated energy cost savings. The client can pay additional fees for the Fund to
 implement the project on its behalf.
 R2E2 uses simplified performance contracts to shift some performance risks to private
 construction firms/contractors. Under these contracts, firms are selected based on the
 net present value of the projects they propose. A portion of their final payment (around
 30 percent) is based on a commissioning test.
 The R2E2 Fund is expected to finance an estimated 85 projects worth about US$6 million
 between 2012 and 2015 and to demonstrate a sustainable financing and implementation
 model for the public sector. As of January 2014, the Fund signed 20 loans and ESAs valued
 at US$3.05 million since 2011.

Financing mechanisms for residential buildings: International experience indicates
that there are four major financing options for a residential energy efficiency program:
energy efficiency funds, commercial bank financing, partial credit guarantees and
utility energy efficiency programs. Energy efficiency funds (similar to the public
sector), commercial bank financing (e.g., micro-credit loans to residential consumers),
and utility energy efficiency programs, combined with grant-based incentive schemes,
are the most suitable financing options for kick-starting energy efficiency in residential
buildings in Tajikistan. Regarding energy efficiency programs implemented through a

                                               80
utility demand-side management program, international experience shows that
utilities can be well placed to deliver energy efficiency programs because of their
established relationships with customers and knowledge of local energy use patterns.
They also have billing systems in place that can be used to recover costs from
customers. Because electricity and heating companies in Tajikistan currently lose
money on each unit of heat supplied and have insufficient supply capacity, they also
have incentives to implement programs that will reduce demand.
Strengthening HOAs: Split incentives in multi-apartment buildings and weak HOAs are
key challenges to both energy efficiency investments and upgrades of collective
heating solutions (i.e., small HOBs or DH). Without decision-making structures for
investments and mechanisms for financing more capital-intensive upgrades, it will be
very difficult in multi-apartment buildings to reach consensus on upgrading/switching
to collective heating solutions or implementing building-level energy efficiency
measures. Experience in the ECA region has shown that governments can support the
development of HOAs by drafting better legislation for decision-making in multi-
apartment buildings; by setting and enforcing standards for apartment-building
maintenance; and by providing training and public outreach on collective decision-
making, building management and maintenance.
However, experience in the region has also shown that many efforts to strengthen
HOAs meet obstacles that prove difficult to overcome. Such obstacles include: 27
 The mix of residents from different economic levels living in the same building.
  This accentuates the challenge of collective decision-making as poorer residents
  may refuse or not be able to make contributions toward the cost of implementing
  energy efficiency measures.
 The technical capacity of HOAs. It is difficult for apartment owners to establish and
  operate HOAs on their own, especially for low-income households, whose buildings
  are typically in the most need of repair. HOAs typically hire professional managers,
  but it is important for apartment owners to understand their rights and
  responsibilities as members of the HOA.
 The poor condition of the buildings. Residents may fear that they will not have
  enough money to address the magnitude of the problems.
 The absence of incentives. Low tariffs have kept services affordable, but have also
  led to poor service quality and reliability. Meanwhile, the use of norm-based billing
  practices and the related lack of metering and controls gives residents no reason to
  cut their consumption.
 Limited access to financing. HOAs have difficulty borrowing because banks do not
  view them as creditworthy and are typically unwilling to lend on a project finance
  basis.

Given the difficulty of working through HOAs, Tajikistan may want to consider other
approaches. Lithuania offers an example of an alternative approach in which a
municipality initiated and managed energy efficiency improvements in buildings. The
program retrofitted more than 2,400 residential buildings between 1996 and 2013—
saving about 82.3 GWh per year—despite the fact that homeowners and HOAs lacked
borrowing and technical capacity. Box 6.5 provides insight from experience improving
HOAs in Lithuania.

     Box 6.5: Approach to Address the Lack of Borrowing Capacity by Homeowners
     and HOAs in Lithuania
     The residential energy efficiency program in Lithuania, initiated in 1996, provided loans
     and subsidies, combined with technical assistance, to support energy efficiency
     investments in residential buildings. To address the limited technical and borrowing
     capacity, the lack of awareness and split incentives of homeowners and HOAs, the
     program1 allowed building renovations to be initiated by the municipality. The
     municipality appointed a project administrator for multi-apartment buildings with weak
     or inexistent HOAs. The appointed building administration company (mostly municipally
     owned) took loans on behalf of the homeowners to finance the energy efficiency
     investment costs. The company recovered the investment costs through a monthly
     building-management fee paid by homeowners based on the estimated energy cost
     savings achieved. Homeowners were not obliged to borrow. The municipal project
     administrator assumed the loan repayment risk. While the consent of homeowners was
     required to implement the energy efficient retrofits in their buildings, the program also
     provided additional incentives to facilitate consent from low-income households. After
     completion of the renovations, all low-income households received a subsidy covering 100
     percent of the preparation and renovation costs. The state reduced the heating subsidy
     by 50 to 100 percent over three years for low-income households that opposed the
     implementation of energy savings measures.

Ensuring enforcement of building codes for new buildings: The legislative framework
for efficient energy performance standards is relatively well advanced in Tajikistan.
However, in reality, few of the newly constructed buildings comply with these
buildings codes. In order to establish an enforcement system, the following
components are typically needed: dedicated unit/department with sufficient budget
and staffing to administer and implement building codes; clear compliance process
with administrative procedures, compliance forms, checklists and procedures, user
manuals or guidebooks, compliance tools, etc.; awareness raising, training and
capacity building among officials, designers, architects, engineers, manufacturers and
other key stakeholders; and evaluation and monitoring arrangements28.
6.4.4 Next steps
The next steps required for implementation of an energy efficiency program are as
follows:

 Set up priority/target buildings for an energy efficiency investment program. For
  reasons indicated above, the Government may want to consider starting initially
  with an energy efficiency program focusing on the public sector before moving to
  the more complex residential sector.
 Conduct a comprehensive market assessment for the targeted sector. This will
  help to: (i) analyze the technical, economic and financial energy efficiency potential
  for various building types; (ii) evaluate the energy efficiency supply market (e.g.,
  energy auditors, equipment suppliers, design and construction companies, etc.) to
  provide an overview of the market capacity and quality of services/products; (iii)
  assess key policy, regulatory, financial and institutional barriers to realize the
  energy efficiency potential and identify specific ways that these barriers can be
  addressed; and (iv) inform the selection and design of an adequate implementation
  and financing scheme.
 Select and develop targeted implementation and financing mechanisms for the
  energy efficiency program. To incentivize energy efficiency investments, careful
  design of effective implementation and financing schemes is needed. In addition,
  broad stakeholder consultations are recommended to ensure that the selected
  mechanisms and design features reflect the needs of the target market segment
  and other stakeholders. In parallel, the Government may want to explore different
  financial resources, including grant funding for technical assistance and investment
  incentives. During preparation and throughout implementation of an energy
  efficiency program, extensive public outreach, awareness raising and capacity
  building activities will be critical for the success of the program.
6.5    Recommendation 5: Feasibility Studies for the Rehabilitation and
       Modernization of Large HOBs in Dushanbe
The DH system supplied by Boiler House East currently serves approximately two
percent of the multi-apartment buildings and two percent of the public buildings in
Dushanbe. Poor gas supply and the deterioration of assets have led to decreased use
of the DH system supplied by large HOBs (boiler houses East and West) in the past
decade.
The LCHS assessment showed that DH in Dushanbe supplied by large HOBs is
economically more viable than current electricity-based heating options. Increasing
the output and supply reliability of the two large HOBs could help to address power
shortages in winter by reducing reliance on electric-based heating options. However,
the LCHS assessment also indicated that small HOBs may be an economically more
viable solution compared to the rehabilitation of large HOBs. Accordingly, an in-depth
study to determine the viability of rehabilitating or replacing the large HOBs is
recommended.
6.5.1 Implementation issues
The implementation issues specific to the rehabilitation of large HOBs should be
identified and studied in greater depth in the recommended feasibility study. The
rehabilitation of the large HOBs will likely face similar implementation issues as the
improvements to the rest of the DH system in Dushanbe, and the rehabilitation of
small HOBs. These implementation issues are described above in Section 6.3.3.

                                           83
6.5.2 Next steps
In order to determine the exact scope and investment requirements for this task, a
detailed feasibility study should be conducted with the goal of accomplishing the
following:
 Determine whether HOBs require rehabilitation or complete replacement. As part
  of the assessments, also investigate whether their replacement by small HOBs may
  be a more viable option.
 Conduct a detailed cost assessment and comparison of the technical and economic
  feasibility of heat supply with large HOBs and other heat supply options. Include a
  detailed analysis of the cost of rehabilitating building-internal heating systems for
  the buildings that would be supplied by the large HOBs.
 Evaluate the environmental and health-related impacts of rehabilitating and
  modernizing the large HOBs. Compare with alternative heating options for
  consumers currently connected to the large HOBs.
 Develop a prioritized investment and implementation plan. This will ensure
  optimal benefits in terms of cost-efficiency and supply reliability.
 Forecast the likely reliability of fuel supply for large HOBs in the years to come.
6.6    Action Plan for Dushanbe and Khujand
As the recommendation sections highlighted, a comprehensive package of policy
reforms and investment measures is needed to improve the operational and financial
performance of the heating sector, and adequately meet residential and public heat
demand. Table 6.1 recommends a roadmap with a timeframe in which actions should
be implemented, and demonstrates which challenge these actions will help address.
