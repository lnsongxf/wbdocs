It is a great pleasure to present this first edition of the Guatemala Economic DNA (Diagnostic for National Action)
prepared by the World Bank. For those of us that have had the privilege of working with Guatemala over the years,
it is clear that there many Guatemalan development experiences that are worth sharing with the global community.
For example, if we think of macroeconomic stability (an element that should be at the center of any development
plan) Guatemala is an example to follow, and therefore for the World Bank analyzing and sharing the country’s
track record on this front is of great interest. At the same time, there are experiences from other countries that
we also believe could be of use to Guatemala. This would include experiences of countries that have managed to

countries with a good track record of job creation that has helped translate economic growth into welfare gains for
the whole society. The global community has now a renewed emphasis to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 and
promote shared prosperity and we believe that the World Bank can contribute to these objectives by promoting an
exchange of development experiences, taking those where Guatemala excels to the rest of the world and bringing
to Guatemala those where other countries have been recognized.

Indeed this first edition of the Guatemala Economic DNA brings together, in a compelling way, the important
achievements of Guatemala on the macroeconomic stability front. It also argues that these achievements will
need to be secured and makes the case for an increased focus on accelerating economic growth. For example, this
edition highlights that in 2013 the country’s economic activity expanded by 3.7 percent in 2013, and is projected
to grow around 3.6 percent in the near-term, in line with the growth of Central American economies but below
the growth rate in emerging markets. Meanwhile, inflation has been managed and the authorities deserve to be
recognized for their commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability.

A typical Economic DNA will be published every six months and will (i) review the most recent developments in
the Guatemalan economy; (ii) reflect about future economic prospects; and (iii) analyze development topics of
interest. In this first edition the focus is on jobs. This is a key linkage between performance at the macroeconomic
level and prosperity at the microeconomic level. We find this topic particularly relevant in Guatemala given that
even though the economy grew continuously in the past decade, the country created fewer jobs than other
countries with the same level of income. Moreover, employment growth fell sharply in the years following the
global financial crisis, more so than in other countries, and therefore there is a need to revert this trend.

I hope you will enjoy this new report series which reflects the best analysis and knowledge of the World Bank for
Guatemala.

and research institutions tend to be more efficient,
which in turn contributes to making them more
competitive and expanding their ability to generate
new employment opportunities. The analysis in this
report reveals that a 10 percent improvement in a
firm’s “technology capability index” score (which
measures the extent to which firms use different types
of technologies) is associated with a 1 percentage
point increase in employment growth.

Several cross-cutting factors are also closely
correlated with job creation in Guatemala, including
financial depth, exposure to corruption, and
informality. There is a strong correlation between
access to finance and employment growth, while
exposure to bribery and other forms of corruption
constrains firm growth and slows job creation.
Asymmetric competition from the informal sector also
correlates with slower employment growth. While
causation cannot be definitely established, measures
to promote formalization and leveling the playing field
between the formal and informal sectors are likely
to have a significant impact on employment in the
formal sector. Indeed, over ¼ of informal businesses
in Guatemala report that they would like to become
formal, and many of them are willing to pay to do so.

Ultimately, the extent to which Guatemala’s
economy will be able to capitalize on an incipient
global recovery will depend less on the government’s
ability to pass further reforms than on its capacity to

consumption continued to rise. The textile and food & beverage industries led the secondary
sector, spurred by a mix of external and domestic demand. In the primary sector, agricultural
production targeted for the domestic market also contributed to growth, while agricultural
exports (particularly coffee) suffered from a combination of exogenous shocks and adverse
price changes in global export markets. Building upon Guatemala’s recent macroeconomic
resilience, the coming years present an opportunity to reduce poverty through more rapid
economic growth. Indeed, Guatemala’s per capita GDP increased by less than 1 percent per
year over the past decade. Achieving higher growth will depend upon continued reforms to
mobilize greater private investment, while building upon recent tax reforms to improve revenue
mobilization to fund important growth-enhancing investments in infrastructure and human
capital.

Manufacturing continued to grow at a steady pace of 3.4 percent in 2013, with food and beverages and
textile production leading the sector. The food and beverages industry accounts for about 45 percent of total
manufacturing activity. It grew by 4.6 percent, slowing modestly from 6.3 percent in 2012. Favorable weather
conditions contributed to strong sugarcane harvests in 2012 and 2013, which generated a 15 percent increase in
sugar production (Figure 10). Around 70 percent of Guatemalan sugar is exported. Textile production expanded
by 3.7 percent in 2013, as rising foreign demand boosted exports by around 25 percent over the previous year,
reversing the contraction that occurred during 2011-12. Nevertheless, the overall development of manufacturing
continues to be hampered by a large informal sector and rigidities in the formal labor market. These issues are
discussed further in the Special Focus Section of this report.

      two out of ten live in extreme poverty (Figure
      9). Coffee accounts for over two-thirds of
      agricultural production in the 50 municipalities
      with the highest level of extreme poverty.

Construction continues to underperform, reflecting weak residential and non-residential investment, despite
strong growth in remittances and credit growth. In 2013 construction activity grew by just 1.7 percent, up slightly
from 2012. The sector was hit hard during the global financial crisis; construction activity fell by 10.8 percent in
2009 and by a further 11.5 percent in 2010. Despite its recent growth construction has yet to recover to its pre-
crisis level. The construction sector accounts for a small percentage of GDP, below the average of Central America
(see Figure 11). There are two possible explanations for the weak performance of the construction sector. First,
weaker rural incomes from declining coffee production, especially in the north and west of the country, may have
weighed on self-construction activity, which accounts for half of total construction activity. Second, the Guatemalan
Chamber of Construction determined that the sector’s poor performance was due in part to uncertainty regarding
Articles 34 and 35 of the Actualizacion Tributaria Law, which stated that the total income tax on construction
projects should be paid in advance at the beginning of the project. These articles were nullified in November 2013.

                                           Improving Guatemala’s Growth Performance Could Boost Prosperity



                Guatemala’s well-diversified economy has proven resilient to shocks, but its growth has been weaker than
                its regional peers. Since 2000 real per capita GDP growth has averaged about 0.9 percent, roughly three-
                quarters of a percentage point less than the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and significantly
                less than other middle-income countries. Shared prosperity, as measured by income growth among the
                poorest 40 percent of the population, has lagged behind the region. Shared prosperity in LAC increased by 5
                percent over the past decade, yet in Guatemala it declined by 1 percent between 2001 and 2011. Guatemala
                endured the 2008-09 global financial crisis better than all Central American countries except Panama, but
                in the last 4 years its per capita GDP growth was slower than that of most countries in LAC. Moreover,
                Guatemala’s recent growth has not been necessarily less volatile than that of other regional economies, yet
                it continues to lag the average. As shown in Figure 12, seven LAC countries have achieved higher growth
                rates than Guatemala while maintaining similarly low or even lower levels of volatility.

                 Slow growth is the result of low productivity growth, which has lagged regional peers. A comparison of
                 total factor productivity reveals that Guatemala’s productivity is lower than in other peer economies, as
                 Guatemala failed to keep pace with most Latin American countries that boosted total factor productivity
                 (TFP) during the 20001. During the 1990s productive efficiency was a major contributor to Guatemalan
                 growth, boosting the real GDP growth rate by an average of 1.5 percentage points over the decade. But
                 during the 2000s productive efficiency declined, cutting annual GDP growth by an average of 0.2 percentage
                 points. Although this trend has since reversed, with an increase in TFP adding around 0.7 percentage points
                 to annual GDP growth since 2011, Guatemala’s TFP growth rate remains well below the regional average

      TFP is a measure of the efficiency with which an economy uses productive factors to generate goods and services; it is obtained by subtracting
     changes in the stock of labor and capital from GDP growth.

Low and stable inflation remains a pillar of macroeconomic stability, underscoring the success of Guatemala’s
inflation-targeting framework. Though it remains sensitive to domestic food prices, Guatemala’s inflation rate
is lower than that of other Latin American countries, and its performance compares favorably with that of other
countries that use inflation-target bands.

In order to increase tax revenues, in 2012 the Guatemalan Congress approved a comprehensive tax reform,
which largely took full effect in 2013 (see Box 3). The tax reform, which comprised two laws—Ley de Actualización
Tributaria and Ley Antievasión II—was considered a major milestone, since similar reform efforts over the past two
decades had been reversed, on occasions after being challenged at the Constitutional Court. The tax reform aimed to
modernize the income tax system by expanding the tax base and eliminating tax exemptions through more effective
controls on deductions and an elimination of the payroll tax credit. Furthermore, the reform sought to improve tax
administration efforts to improve monitoring, control and management of records.

                   A Timeline of Guatemala’s Recent Reform Efforts Towards Revenue Mobilization


In 2012 the Guatemalan Government launched a tax reform in order to broaden the revenue base and
strengthen tax administration, which came into effect over 2012-13 (Figure 17). The reform comprised two
decrees: 04-2012 (Provisions for Strengthening the Tax System and Combating Fraud and Smuggling) and 10-
2012 (Updated Tax Act). These decrees aimed to modernize income tax collection by increasing the tax base
and eliminating tax exemptions through controls on deductions and elimination of the payroll tax credit. The
reform also eliminated several Value Added Tax (VAT) exemptions and strengthened tax administration efforts.



Figure 17: Full implementation of the reform comprises gradual steps over three years and withstood legal challenges, unlike previous reform efforts
which had been rolled-back.

Following passage by Congress, several unconstitutional claims against the tax reform were made. In summary,
about one of every three articles saw challenges (or 68 articles out of the 258 articles in the tax reform laws),
of which only 9 were amended by the Constitutional Court, at the time of writing. Importantly, none of the
amended articles affected the technical structure of the tax reform. However, the Government did reverse
reforms to the tax on the circulation of motor vehicles (ISCV), foregoing revenues representing 0.1 percent of
GDP (the original Law envisaged a doubling of the ISCV, but in mid-2013 Congress granted a 50 percent discount
on this tax).

Among its most significant aspects, the reform aimed to improve the progressivity of the tax system by
increasing the share of income taxes. Key features of the new tax law included the simplification of income
tax structure, the introduction of a 5 percent tax on capital gains; increases in income tax rates for the simplied

     payments for the general regime; and an increase in the single deduction for personal expenses to Q.150,000
     annually while eliminating the VAT tax credit for salaried workers and small taxpayers. Formerly, a VAT tax credit
     allowed salaried workers to offset VAT payments against income taxes by presenting receipts gathered during
     the year. This practice was considered to allow for tax evasion, in addition to being regressive, since higher
     income earners that paid more in VAT taxes received the greatest benefits from the exemptions

     Reforms to indirect taxes focused on implementing the First Registration Tax on Vehicles (Impuesto a la
     Primera Matrícula). This tax was created in order to replace tariffs on vehicle imports and the regular VAT on
     imported goods, while providing an overall lower tax rate for imported vehicles.




Overall, tax revenues rose in 2013 following the

                    In Search of the Lost Tax
                    Assessing the 2013 Performance of Taxes Related to Foreign Trade


      Despite growth in imports, VAT collection on imported goods remained flat in 2013. Imports grew by 4.9
      percent in 2013, led by higher spending on consumption goods, raw materials and capital goods. A closer
      look at those imports not exempted under a Free Trade Agreement or a special regime shows that almost
      all import categories increased (except fuels and lubricants, which fell by 11.6 percent), which should have
      accorded with higher customs revenues. Instead, however, VAT collections on imports remained broadly
      unchanged in nominal terms.

      between 2012 and 2013. Meanwhile, the
      international price of oil rose during this period. According to the Guatemalan Association of Oil Retailers,
      tax evasion on oil and derivatives increased by 40 percent in the last two years and could be equivalent to
      Q400 million. On the other hand, the total volume carried by containers grew by 10.3 percent in 2013.

      Improving on current weak tax administration of taxes on foreign trade could generate a significant
      boost to government revenue. In November 2013 the Government approved a comprehensive reform
      package aimed at improving public financial and debt management, internal and external audit systems,
      and tax administration. In particular, the Government has set down implanting regulations for the National
      Customs Law that define customs infringements and related sanctions and procedures to combat fraud
      and contraband, while also establishing an international taxation unit with the Ministry of Public Finance.
      If successful, recent reforms could support a significant increase in collections from foreign trade taxes.
      For example, if VAT collections on imported goods in 2013 had grown at the same pace as overall imports,
      as seen in previous years, and had customs duties reflected their historical trend rate of growth, less the
      changes made to duties on motor vehicles, government revenues would have been higher by 0.2 percent
      of GDP in 2013.

The poor performance of both VAT on imports and customs duties reduced the potential impact of the
Tax Reform. If VAT collections on imported goods had grown at the same pace as overall imports, as seen
in previous years, and had customs duties reflected their historical trend rate of growth, less the changes
made to duties on motor vehicles, government revenues would have been higher by 0.2 percent of GDP in
2013.




Public debt as share of GDP remains low, but the ratio of public debt to tax revenues continues to grow, reflecting
low government revenues. Guatemala’s debt-to-GDP ratio in 2013 remains stable around 25 percent, having risen by
2 percentage points of GDP since 2009. Nonetheless, the government’s ability to finance debt commitments from tax
revenues continues to weaken. Measured as a percentage of annual tax revenues, Guatemala’s public debt rose from
178 percent of annual taxes in 2008 to 227 percent of tax revenues in 2013. Further, with capital expenditures trending
down in recent years, it is clear that rising public debt has been directed to consumption rather than investment.

close to 5 months of imports.

In 2013 the balance of payments remained broadly sound despite a widening current account deficit on the back
of strong capital inflows. The current account deteriorated modestly in 2013 as a consequence of a higher deficit
in the trade balance of goods and services, amid stronger remittances. However, this was offset by capital inflows
from foreign direct investment and public external financing, and resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus.
Although the external accounts may appear solid, Guatemala remains vulnerable to shocks to global commodity
prices, the performance of major trading partners and access to offshore financing.

Guatemala is becoming more reliant on external savings. The current-account deficit stood at 2.7 percent of GDP in
2013, similar to the share in 2012, and was driven by rising domestic demand and deteriorating terms of trade. The
widening current-account deficit was exacerbated by a drop in domestic savings, particularly in the private sector.
While the public savings-investment gap has narrowed over the last few years, the former surplus in private savings
over private investment has reversed in recent years, reflecting robust consumption amid increasing remittances
from abroad, causing the overall external gap to expand since 2010 (Table 2).

Exports were affected by adverse conditions but the diversity of Guatemala’s export mix compared to other Central
American economies, helped mitigate the effect of product-specific supply-side shocks. Coffee exports fell sharply
by 22 percent in 2013 due to a combination of lower production volumes as a result of coffee rust disease, and falling
global prices following record harvests in Brazil, India and Vietnam. In addition, cardamom prices declined by 14
percent, as a result of higher world inventories following strong production in India and Guatemala. However, the
strong performance of banana, sugar and non-traditional exports (especially textiles) limited the damage arising from

lower coffee exports to the trade balance. Higher sugar and banana exports reflected higher global prices for these
products, especially following weaker banana exports from Ecuador, the world’s largest producer. Overall, however,
Guatemalan exports remain highly concentrated among primary agricultural commodities, and thus prone to shifts
in global prices for these commodities.

                           What Determines Remittance Levels in Guatemala?



         Roughly 1.2 million Guatemalans—over 75 percent of the country’s migrant community—live and work in
         the United States4. Yet Guatemalans make up just 2.3 percent of the Hispanic population in the US, the sixth
         largest share. Mexicans, by contrast, account for 64.6 percent. Guatemalan migrants tend to be younger,
         poorer, and less educated than other US Hispanics. In addition, many Guatemalans work undocumented in
         the US, and deportations are not uncommon; in 2013, 47,769 Guatemalans were deported5. Guatemalan
         migrant populations are largest in California, Florida and New York.



         Remittances play a major role in household
         consumption and in the Guatemalan economy                              Figure 23: Remittances represent an important component of the

         Developments in the US labor market have a strong impact on remittances to Guatemala, and rising
         unemployment among the Hispanic community in the US is associated with weaker remittances flows.
         Since the Guatemalan diaspora is highly concentrated in a few US states, closely examining trends in these
         states reveals the impact of local labor-market dynamics on remittances. Wage data from California and
         Florida, which are home to the largest Guatemalan migrant communities, show a close relationship between
         wage rates and remittances. The data also suggest that changes in wage rates impact remittances for at least
         the next three quarters. Data from California on mass layoffs of Hispanics in the non-farm private sector
         shows that such layoffs are associated with a temporary increase in remittance flows to Guatemala. This is
         likely the result of migrant workers anticipating imminent layoffs (and perhaps subsequent deportation) and
         liquidating and remitting their entire wealth stock.

Remittance flows are not solely dependent on the labor markets where they originate; the inflation rate in
Guatemala also significantly affects remittance flows. Econometric analysis suggests a strong correlation
between remittance flows and inflation in Guatemala. Inflation reduces households’ purchasing power,
diminishing the real value of remittances and increasing demand for them. This effect is associated mainly
with consumer-price inflation, and not so much with food prices.

Based on these observations an econometric model can be developed using US economic growth,
Guatemalan inflation, remittance lags, and interest rate differentials to predict changes in remittance
flows in Guatemala (see Figure 24). We calculated the correlation between remittance flows and 30 different
variables related to economic activity, prices, labor market indicators, and exchange rates. Under different
specifications of the model, we select a group of key variables that exhibit the highest forecast accuracy
(Guatemala exchange rate, interest rate differentials, Guatemala inflation, remittance lags, and US growth).
To estimate the contribution of these variables, we consider both the contemporaneous and lagged effect

Remittances registered strong growth as the US economic recovery continued. Remittances amounted to US$5.2
billion in 2013, equivalent to almost 10 percent of GDP and nearly half of total goods exports, and almost offset
the trade balance deficit. Over 90 percent of Guatemala’s remittances come from the US. This important flow of
resources has been boosting consumption (both in durable and non-durable goods) and investment in physical and
human capital. Even though the high dependence on remittances raises questions regarding Guatemala’s external
vulnerabilities, Guatemala’s remittances have proved especially resilient during the global financial crisis compared
to those of other Central American countries because most Guatemalan workers in the United States are employed
in the relatively stable agricultural and service sectors (see Box 5).

The growth in foreign direct investment, the issuance of Treasury bonds in the international markets and
disbursements of loans contracted by the Central Government increased overall capital inflows in 2013. The
agricultural sector accounted for about one third of all FDI, followed by the financial and the energy sectors; and
by origin the main flows of foreign investment came from Canada, United States, Russia and Colombia. In 2013 the
Government issued US$ 400 million in bonds, lower than the US$ 700 million issued in 2012, which in turn reduced
the flow of financing associated to net portfolio investment. However, other investment flows increased due to the
disbursement of loans to the Central Government and to commercial banks.

The international reserve position has been strengthening as the Central Bank accumulated reserves. Reserves
grew by US$580 million and reached 13.5 of GDP as a consequence of net investment related to bonds in US$ dollars,
net disbursements of external public debt and the yields over the reserves invested in the foreign markets. Reserves
in months of imports are close to five months, and are enough to cover 6 times the short-term debt of the country. It
is worthy to mention that even though the Central Bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market, the net purchases
of the Central Bank only account for 7 percent of the increase in reserves.

hike in interest rates, which was reversed in November 2013 as inflationary pressures receded,
and subsequently reduced in March 2014. The quetzal remained stable in nominal terms during
2013, but the real effective exchange rate continued to depreciate as Guatemala’s inflation
rate exceeded those of its major trading partners. Conditions in the financial sector remained
generally positive, and private-sector credit has grown at a robust pace. Nevertheless, a recent
increase in foreign-currency lending merits close monitoring.

Guatemala’s financial sector remains sound and is among the healthiest in the region. Banks are profitable,
liquid, well-capitalized and domestically funded. Guatemala’s robust financial sector is reflected in its reliably strong
performance in recent years on key financial-soundness indicators. For example, the ratio of non-performing loans
has continued to fall and remains below that of similar countries in the region. In addition, 60 percent of loans have a
remaining maturity of more than one year due to steady growth in the residential mortgage market.

The expansion of domestic credit is having a positive impact on economic growth, but the rapid expansion of
foreign-currency lending has raised concerns. Nominal credit growth slowed modestly in 2013 but remains robust at
11.4 percent, down from 18.8 percent in 2012.

Corporate lending also saw strong growth, rising from

one third of total outstanding loans, encouraging
further financial dollarization, and underscoring the
importance of strong macro-prudential policies to
limit risks to financial stability.

There is considerable scope for further financial deepening and the continued strengthening of domestic capital
markets. Private sector credit as a share of GDP reached 32 percent in 2012, yet it remains below the levels
observed in other countries in the region, including Panama (90 percent), Honduras (52 percent) and Costa Rica
(49 percent). Domestic capital markets remain relatively shallow, with a highly concentrated investor base and
a virtually nonexistent secondary government-debt market. Moreover, domestic interest-rate spreads on loans
denominated in local currency have widened despite the growth of the financial sector, while spreads on foreign-
currency-denominated loans have narrowed. Finally, despite the expansion of credit access in the provinces
supported by the government’s financial-deepening agenda, Guatemala City still accounts for over 60 percent of
outstanding loans8.

  It should be noted that in some cases loans may be recorded by bank branches in Guatemala City even if they finance investments in the provinces; e.g.,
loans contracted by firms with head offices in Guatemala City may be used to fund operations elsewhere in the country.

                   Picking Up the Investment Pace
                   Accelerating Guatemala’s Long-Term Growth Rate Through Greater Investment



      Guatemala exhibits one of the lowest levels of investment in the world. Guatemala’s total investment
      rate is currently about 14 percent of GDP, well below the 21 percent average for Latin America. This low
      level of investment negatively affects Guatemala’s productivity, constraining the pace of economic growth
      and weakening the competitiveness of Guatemalan firms. Low levels of investment hinder Guatemala’s
      long-run potential GDP, underscoring the urgency of the structural reform agenda as a means to build long-
      term productivity. For example, Swiston and Barrot (2011) suggest that raising investment in physical and
      human capital to the average level of Brazil, Mexico and Peru (i.e., to around 25 percent of GDP) would raise
      Guatemala’s economic growth by more than 1 percentage point per year. In order to raise investment levels,
      both public and private, the quality of the undergoing and future projects should be enhanced to widen
      their social returns, public-private partnerships should be strengthened, and reforms in the investment
      environment ought to be sustained to attract domestic and foreign investment.

      Improving Guatemala’s public investment management system would improve the effectiveness of
      public investments and ensure that any increases in investment spending would translate into improved
      development outcomes for Guatemalan citizens. Raising the quantity of investment, especially public
      investment, without improving its quality would result in only limited improvements in Guatemala’s
      growth prospects. Building the necessary administrative and institutional capacity to effectively scale up
      investment spending will help to ensure that financing is directed to projects that further the government’s
      development goals, that these projects are executed efficiently and transparently, and that monitoring and
      evaluation mechanisms are in place to review performance and incorporate lessons learned into the design
      of subsequent projects.

      Public-private partnerships (PPPs) could provide an important avenue to raise investment levels in
      Guatemala without placing greater pressure on public finances (Figure 34). Provided that they are well
      regulated, public-private partnerships provide the opportunity to leverage private sector capital and
      expertise to deliver major investment projects, such as by addressing Guatemala’s infrastructure needs. The
      Government has already established the National Agency for the Development Partnerships in Infrastructure
      (ANADIE) to boost investment levels through public-private partnerships. ANADIE has identified more than
      USD 1.7 billion in private investment for thirteen infrastructure projects, which are currently at the study stage
      (Figure 35). Moreover, greater use of public-private partnerships would require investment in the processes
      for assessing and regulating PPPs, for example to ensure that PPP tenders are awarded transparently, and
      that contract terms are effectively specified and regulated.

      Improving the overall investment climate would help encourage greater private investment in Guatemala,
      particularly via increased foreign direct investment. Private investment levels remain low in Guatemala,
      despite macroeconomic stability, while Guatemala has made strong progress in improving the investment
      climate as noted in the 2014 World Bank’s Doing Business report. However, challenges remain, in particular
      in areas such as “starting a business” and “protecting investors.” Moreover, the investment climate is
      constantly threatened by the high rates of crime and security issues, which increase companies’ operational
      costs.

Further increasing exchange-rate flexibility could enhance external resilience, though any move toward a
less active policy stance would have to be carefully managed. A more flexible exchange rate would facilitate
adjustments in the domestic economy in response to external shocks, and it could buttress the Central Bank’s
inflation-targeting framework. Indeed, greater flexibility would support Guatemala’s international competitiveness
in the face of weakening global commodity prices, which have been trending downward since 2011. However,
efforts to increase nominal flexibility would have to be undertaken with caution given the significant dollarization
of the domestic economy, as a more flexible exchange rate would affect individuals and firms with incomes, savings
and liabilities denominated in US dollars.

Meanwhile, Guatemala’s external accounts would remain sustainable following this shock.

Flexible fiscal and monetary policies would be critical to managing a shock to remittances. With weaker domestic
demand, tax revenues would be expected to decrease, especially with lower taxes on imports. Following the shock
to remittances, the fiscal deficit would be expected to rise on average by 0.2 percentage points of GDP during
2014-2016. However, without the assumed government efforts to aim to mediate the macroeconomic impacts of
the shock (e.g., counter-cyclical fiscal policy measures that raise expenditures), this impact would in fact be larger.
Meanwhile, monetary policy is assumed to remain flexible.

Employment growth slowed down between the 2006 and 2010 surveys across middle-income countries, but
the slowdown in job creation was acute in Guatemala (Figure 44). Positive sales growth did not translate into
better employment growth overall. Indeed, average employment growth in Guatemala fell significantly from 5.5
percent among those firms surveyed in the 2006 wave (firms were asked to self-report on employment growth
over the 2002-2005 period), a period in which the Guatemalan economy was growing relatively robustly, down
to employment growth of 0.3 percent for firms surveyed in the 2010 wave (reporting on the 2007-2009 period)16.

   While WBES allows for a diagnostic assessment of employment creation by Guatemalan firms, further analysis would be necessary to establish clear causal
relationships in order to understand the reasons that explain job creation. Conclusions presented in this report thus represent important opportunities for additional
investigation. Nevertheless, we have made an effort to rule out “endogeneity” by controlling for a series of factors and variables of interest. This is evidenced later in
the Focus Section. For instance, when examining how bribes may drive down firm growth, as presented later in this Focus Section, it could be that growth “explains”
bribery, such as when growing firms are able to hire more skilled managers who are able to navigate a difficult business environment and avoid paying bribes.

To date, two waves of the World Bank Enterprise Survey (2006 and 2010) have been completed for
Guatemala. These surveys have expanded the possibilities for microeconomic analysis in Guatemala by
providing data on a sample of firms broken down by a number of key characteristics, including the firm’s
economic sector, its size, location, and ownership type, among others. As noted in Guatemala’s 2010 WBES,
“the Enterprise Surveys collect information from a representative sample of the non-agricultural formal private
economy. In addition to collecting information on the business environment the surveys collect information
on the characteristics of the firms interviewed. Consequently, the data collected provides a description of the
representative private firm in the country and also an estimate of how some of the attributes of the average
firm are distributed across the population of firms.” For more information on the WBES, including the raw
datasets and a description of its methodology, see www.enterprisesurveys.org.

The WBES surveys provide valuable information from the perspective of private firms―the principal sources
of job growth in the economy―but important data limitations should be noted. While the survey sample
is designed to be representative of the economy as a whole, the samples used in the two previous WBES are
not sufficiently large to guarantee accuracy. In addition, although the WBES includes sample weights, these
weights may not fully reflect the diversity of firms in Guatemala. In this Focus Section we use medium sample
weights to ensure that the data are as representative as possible. An expanded WBES with larger samples
and more comprehensive content would strengthen the quality of future analysis of Guatemala’s business
environment and the challenges facing local firms.

What Drives Job Creation in Guatemala?

While job growth in Guatemala has been positive over the last decade, the pace of job creation has varied
significantly across groups of firms. While national economic statistics provide a broad overview of trends in job
creation, the WBES is a key source for firm-level information on employment patterns, revealing which types of
firms are adding jobs in Guatemala and which are shedding them.

across sectors. Averages17 indicate that in 2006
the manufacturing sector led job creation with an
employment growth rate of 5.5 percent. Meanwhile,
employment in services and in construction and                                    7.0

in employment growth resulting from the global                                    5.0

rates across sectors generally stagnating and some                                3.0

manufacturing turned negative in the 2010 survey,                                 1.0

  Averages may differ depending on whether or not employment growth rates are calculated geometrically or through the Davis-Haltiwanger (1992, 1999)
method. In the latter, employment growth rates are defined as the change in employment over a given period divided by the average employment level
during the period. The use of sampling weights may also impact the result. For the purposes of this analysis the geometric employment growth without
sampling weights is preferable due to the relatively small sample size, which increases sensitivity to outliers. The patterns reported here, however, are
generally robust regardless of the analytical technique or sampling weights used.

  The measure of financial depth used in this analysis is based on Love (2009). It tallies the number of credit products reported by a firm, giving one point
for each of the following: an overdraft provision, a loan or credit line, bank credit for working capital, bank credit for investment, and traded stock. The total
number of financial products, up to a maximum of 5 products, is then divided by 5, yielding an index of financial depth ranging from 0 to 1.

   Bribe payments are measured as a variable that equals one in either of these three instances: (1) a firm responds with a percentage greater than zero to
the question: “It is said that establishments are sometimes required to make gifts or informal payments to public officials to ‘get things done’ with regard
to customs, taxes, licenses, regulations, services etc. On average, what percentage of total annual sales, or estimated total annual value, do establishments
like this one pay in informal payments or gifts to public officials for this purpose?”; (2) a firm responds with a percentage greater than zero to the question:
“When establishments like this one do business with the government, what percentage of the contract value would typically be paid in additional or informal
payments or gifts to secure the contract?”; and lastly, (3) a firm answers affirmatively to any of the following questions in reference to a electricity, water, or
telephone connection; a construction permit; tax inspections; and an import or operating license: “Was an informal gift or payment expected or requested
to obtain the [public service]?”. Bribe payments equals zero if the manager answers “zero” to the first two questions and “no” to the final set of questions
(public services).

   These results suggest that there is a great opportunity for improvement in the technological capability of
   Guatemalan manufacturing firms21. Guatemalan manufacturers have an average TCI score of 4.23 and a median
   score of 4.0. The average firm is engaged in fewer than 13 of the 29 activities recorded in the TCI. About 20 percent of
   all manufacturing firms have TCI scores lower than 0.2, and only 6 percent have scores higher than 0.8. Firms involved
   in the production of chemicals and rubber and plastics tend to score highest, while those in the non-metallic mineral
   products industry score lowest on the TCI scale. In addition, larger firms, export-oriented firms, foreign-owned firms,
   firms based in Guatemala City, and firms with access to loans all exhibit higher-than-average TCI scores.

Low rates of technological uptake are contributing to the deterioration of total factor productivity in Guatemala,
discouraging investment and slowing firm growth (Figure 51, Figure 52, Figure 53, Figure 54). The rate of technological
uptake in the manufacturing sector suggests in Guatemala is relatively low, as evidenced by the low rates of adoption
of behaviors that facilitate technological linkages between firms, such as collaboration with other firms, suppliers,
clients or research institutions. These linkages not only affect the productive efficiency of individual firms, but also
the diffusion of technology throughout the economy. This implies that there is vast scope to improve productive
efficiency and competitiveness in Guatemalan manufacturing.

The relationship between employment and technological capability appears to be stronger for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) than it is for large manufacturing firms. As noted above, in the manufacturing sector as a whole a
10 percent increase in the TCI score is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in employment growth, but among
SMEs this rises to 1.3 percentage points. TCI scores are also strongly correlated with total factor productivity (TFP), which
affects the returns to labor and indirectly influences employment and wage-rate dynamics. A 10 percent increase in TCI
scores is associated with a 5.1 percent increase in TFP, and the relationship between TCI scores and TFP is driven primarily
by productive technologies.

Although causal relationships are difficult to clearly establish, a number of firm characteristics correlate with greater
degrees of technological sophistication and consequently with higher rates of job creation (Figure 55). These include
firm size, export orientation, ownership status, location and access to finance. As noted above, larger, export-oriented,
foreign-owned firms located in Guatemala City with ready access to finance tend to exhibit the highest TCI scores and the
fastest rates of job creation22.

  There is no clear link between TCI scores and the firm age. Although the coefficient estimates suggest that younger firms have lower TCI scores, these
differences are not significant when controlling for other characteristics.

Job Creation and the Informal Sector in Guatemala


Although the informal sector is often regarded as a weaker counterpart to the formal economy, consisting of
numerous microenterprises marked by low productivity and low remuneration, this view has gradually evolved
over time. A growing literature on informal economies has shown that business operators in the informal sector
demonstrate as great a capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship as their formal-sector peers. Rather than
being driven into informal activities by economic necessity, many workers and business owners freely enter the
informal sector to take advantage of emerging opportunities and exploit niche markets. Although recent studies
that provide rigorous evidence of the benefits of formalization, they recognize that in many cases these benefits
may be modest, ambiguous or only accessible to a small share of firms23.

Guatemala’s formal-sector firms cite the “practices of the informal sector” as their primary constraint to doing
business. Smaller formal firms are disproportionately likely to identify the informal sector as an obstacle to growth,
likely reflecting the generally small size of informal firms, which tends to put them in direct competition with small
firms in the formal sector. While determining precisely which practices are perceived as damaging to formal firms
is an area for further study, this finding underscores the potential advantages, as well as drawbacks, to operating in
the informal sector. Freedom from taxes and regulation may allow informal firms to cut their operating costs, which
in some cases could offset the benefits of formalization, especially since their closest formal-sector competitors
tend to operate in the same markets under very similar conditions.

In view of the informal sector’s enormous and largely untapped potential to support job creation, the World
Bank has begun collecting detailed data on informal firms in Guatemala. A 2010 survey of informal enterprises in
Guatemala provides a revealing portrait of the sector. About 300 informal entrepreneurs participated in the survey;
most enterprises were very small, with over 85 percent employing no more than two workers. Entrepreneurs in
the informal sector were mostly female (56 percent) and married (65 percent). On average, they were 40 years
old and had close to 10 years of experience in their fields. About half of respondents had at most a primary school
education; a quarter had some secondary schooling; and the rest reported either university-level or vocational
education, or no education at all.

At the aggregate level informal firms exhibited strikingly different characteristics from firms in the formal sector.
For example, formal sector firms were larger, employing an average of about 6 workers. Only about a third of
formal firms were owned by women. Operators of formal sector firms were also more experienced, averaging
about 20 years in their field.




23
  One study was based on panel data in Vietnam using a matched double difference approach, an econometric technique that controls for factors that may
simultaneously influence the decision to formalize and the performance of the firm thereafter. It found that firms that formalize enjoy greater profits, invest
more and provide better working conditions for their employees (Rand and Torm 2011). A field experiment in Sri Lanka, however, found more concentrated
benefits (De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff, 2012). In this experiment, firms were randomly provided financial incentives to formalize. Those that did so
realized increased profits—on average—but these benefits were concentrated among a few enterprises. This seems broadly consistent with the findings in
the section that suggest that some firms in the informal sector are opportunity-driven, and given adequate financing they could be much more productive
than other firms.

                                   The Challenges of Understanding Informality
                                                                                                           BOX 8
                                                      Surveying Informal Firms in Guatemala




In order to collect information on unregistered businesses and study economic conditions in the informal
sector the World Bank has recently begun conducting Informal Enterprise Surveys (IES). The IES are usually
implemented in parallel with the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) and, like the WBES, the survey
questionnaire typically focuses on the basic characteristics of the enterprise, its employment dynamics,
the state of the business environment and related subjects. Since 2008 over 20 IES have been conducted
in nearly every region in which the WBES is also used. In 2010 IES were conducted in Argentina, Brazil,
Guatemala and Peru. In Guatemala the survey was a joint undertaking by the World Bank and the Inter-
American Development Bank.

The survey’s primary sampling units are unregistered businesses. In Guatemala, businesses that are not
registered with the Superintendent for Tax Administration (Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria)
or the Commercial Registry (Registro Mercantil) are considered informal. The majority of informal forms
operate in the manufacturing or services sector, with a roughly equal share in each sector. Strictly illegal
activities, such as drug trafficking, or the provision of individual services, such as domestic labor, are not
included.

In each country the IES is conducted in two urban areas, and its findings are designed to complement those
of the WBES. The survey team sets a target number of interviews to be divided between the two urban areas
according to their relative level of business activity, population size and other criteria. The two urban centers
used in the Guatemalan survey were Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango.

See: World Bank (2010) “Description of Guatemala Informal Survey Implementation.”




More than a quarter of informal business owners in Guatemala report that they would like to register their firms,
and many would be willing to pay to learn how to register. Of those who would like to formalize their businesses,
the majority (53 percent) would be willing to pay for registration training. According to these respondents the
most important benefits of registration are improved access to finance, legal protections, and the ability to issue
valid receipts. Formalization also generates important benefits for the broader national economy by expanding the
tax base and levelling the economic playing field by equalizing marginal costs and incentives between formal and
previously informal firms.

However, a substantial majority of entrepreneurs in Guatemala’s informal sector stated that they did not want
register their businesses, citing the tax and regulatory burdens as well as exposure to bribery as the most
important reasons for not registering. This suggests that the prevalence of bribery holds back the growth of

                             Last Resort or New Horizon?
                             Necessity and Opportunity in the Informal Sector


         The literature on labor markets has typically viewed the informal sector as the disadvantaged component of
         a segmented or a dualistic labor market. This literature tends to regard the informal sector as a last resort for
         workers and entrepreneurs who are unable to access more secure, better remunerated opportunities in the
         formal sector. Indeed, wages and profits in the formal sector are typically higher, while job openings are limited
         and barriers to formalization are frequently significant. However, this case is largely circumstantial, and it should
         not be taken for granted that all informal workers and entrepreneurs are forced to operate in the sector for lack of
         a better alternative.

         A number of recent studies have challenged the conventional view, arguing that certain entrepreneurs choose
         to enter the informal sector to take advantage of specific business prospects that are only available to informal
         firms. And while jobs in the informal sector are generally considered “unprotected,” that is, not covered by labor
         laws or social protection institutions, workers who decide to enter the informal sector may consciously weigh
         this drawback against the advantages of employment in the informal sector and rationally decide that it is in their
         best interest to seek employment there. Analyzing data from the IES has allowed researchers to classify informal
         entrepreneurs as either “opportunity-driven,” because they are voluntarily exploring unique business prospects
         in the informal sector, or “necessity-driven,” because they are turning to the informal sector out of desperation.
         While it is difficult to clearly identify the specific motives and alternatives available to each entrepreneur, his or her
         previous occupation is a useful guide. Firm owners may be described as opportunity-driven if they were already
         gainfully employed before entering the informal sector, and as necessity-driven if they were previously unemployed
         or out of the labor force.

  Innovation and entrepreneurship in the informal sector is still an emerging field of study, but evidence from a small sample of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
suggests that opportunity-driven firms typically comprise a little more than 60 percent of informal enterprises.

                                                                                                                                                                     53
Opportunity-driven entrepreneurs are more willing to pay for both management training and registration training.
Access to finance and legal protection top the list of expected benefits of formalization, both for opportunity- and
necessity-driven firms. Unfortunately, some 36 percent of all entrepreneurs in the Guatemalan informal sector
state that they lack access to the relevant information on how to register their businesses.

Though opportunity-driven firms in the informal sector are numerous and diverse, they still tend to underperform
compared to firms in the formal sector. A comparison between opportunity-driven informal firms and small firms
in the formal sectors (i.e., those with fewer than ten employees) indicates that formal-sector entrepreneurs have
many more years of experience (21 years versus 10), have much larger annual sales volume (more than four times
that of informal firms), and offer much higher wages (18 times the monthly salary of informal firms). Formal
firms are also able to provide greater quantities of physical capital and inputs per worker, boosting their marginal
productivity. However, the formalization of opportunity-driven firms may narrow some of these disparities, and
studies show that opportunity-driven informal entrepreneurs expect that formalization will allow for greater access

                                                Conclusion


Rates of job creation in Guatemala have on average been lower than in peer economies. At the firm level, rising
output has not been matched by commensurate increases in employment. Guatemalan firms grew in terms of
sales, on average, during both the global economic expansion of the mid-2000s and the protracted slowdown that
followed it. However, overall employment growth was below the average for LAC and middle income countries, and
employment growth in Guatemala fell significantly during the 2007-2009 period, more so than in peer economies.

Headline employment growth masks substantial heterogeneity between firms, and job-creating enterprises
share a set of common characteristics. Large, foreign-owned, export-oriented firms based in Guatemala City with
ready access to capital have taken the lead in job creation. Younger firms tended to perform well in the years prior
to the global financial crisis, but lost their advantage in the post-crisis period. Meanwhile, firms characterized by
greater financial depth and the ability to mobilize resources have enjoyed especially robust growth in recent years.

Guatemala’s experience both before and after the crisis has yielded important policy lessons, and there is an
opportunity to speed job creation. Recent improvements in the business environment are a key step in the right
direction. The government’s efforts to reduce administrative costs, streamline regulatory processes and otherwise
enhance the business climate have been reflected in Guatemala’s rise in the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings.
Guatemala can build on these gains by focusing further reform efforts on priority policy areas that have a particularly
strong impact on growth and job creation:

Crime and corruption are among the most serious constraints on enterprise growth in Guatemala. More than
a third of Guatemalan firms cite one of these two factors as the most important obstacle to expanding their
business. Compared to other countries in the region, crime and corruption appear to have especially significant
negative effects on enterprise performance in Guatemala, including the rate of job creation.

The informal sector has the potential to contribute to job growth, but barriers to entry into the formal sector
diminish its impact on employment. Informal entrepreneurs in Guatemala are likely to be pursuing emerging
business opportunities, and many “opportunity-driven” firms in the informal sector report that they would like
to register and would be willing to pay for the cost of registration. However, the registration process is both
excessively complex and poorly understood. In addition, there is evidence that formalization increases exposure
to corruption. Easing the administrative costs and other barriers faced by firms attempting to enter into the formal
sector could provide important benefits to both the public and private sectors. Formalization expands the tax
base—a key macroeconomic objective in Guatemala—and ensures a more level playing field between firms,
which is especially important given the large share of formal entrepreneurs who identify unfair competition from
the informal sector as a major obstacle to enterprise growth. Finally, formalization entails benefits for the firms
themselves, by increasing their access to financial resources, inter alia, and for the economy as a whole, since
formal firms experience faster rates of job creation than their informal counterparts.

Formalization outreach efforts will be most effective if they target opportunity-driven firms. These firms are
operated by entrepreneurs who have voluntarily turned to the informal sector to explore new possibilities in
markets that are inadequately served by their formal-sector peers. Facilitating the transition of these firms into
the formal sector will help them to prosper and expand their operations, but eliminating the perverse incentives
that prompted their initial choice to operate in the informal sector will have a permanent and continuing impact

on formal-sector growth. While formalization efforts could focus first on opportunity-driven firms, formalizing all
informal firms would be beneficial for job creation and overall economic growth25.

Improving the business climate should continue to be the government’s overarching policy objective; creating
an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship could both accelerate job creation and boost
productivity. A combination of the perverse incentives favoring informality and the asymmetrical competition
between the formal and informal sectors, described above, blunts the impact of innovation on productivity and
job creation. While this phenomenon is especially pronounced in Guatemala, it is not unique to it. A recent World
Bank Regional Report on innovation and entrepreneurship in the LAC region underscores two critical constraints:
limited competition and a pervasive lack of human capital26.
