     This Note was prepared as part of the Bolivia Multidimensional Poverty Non-Lending
     Technical Assistance (P132327-P151095) led by the Poverty and Equity Global Practice
     of the World Bank. The work was made possible thanks to the support of two multi-do-
     nor trust funds: the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE) and the Rapid Social
     Response Program (RSR). The UFGE is designed to strengthen awareness, knowl-
     edge, and capacity for gender-informed policy making; and the RSR provide support to
     help the world’s poorest countries build effective social protection systems.


     The analysis and writing of this Note was led by Jonna Lundwall, with the following
     team members: Santiago Garriga, Anna Tabitha Bonfert, Emcet Tas, and Maria Cecilia
     Villegas. The Note benefited from the comments of Erwin Tiongson, Maria Ana Lugo,
     Jennifer Solotaroff and Maria Eugenia Genoni, comments that strengthened the analysis
     and interpretation.


     The team wishes to thank the National Institute of Statistics (INE, for its acronym in
     Spanish) and the women’s rights NGO La Coordinadora de la Mujer for providing access
     to the data used in this study. Furthermore, the team thanks Karem Edwards Izquierdo,
     Julio Ricardo Loayza, Veronica Cronembold and Gabriela Orozco, as well as the World
     Bank Country Office in La Paz for the continuous support to strengthen the dialogue on

ings from a World Bank-supported Perception
Survey of Gender Discrimination and Exclusion
that was recently conducted in Bolivia to shed
light on women’s capacity to take advantage of
existing services and economic opportunities.
The Note also explores whether the gaps be-
tween men, women, and other social groups are
manifestations of deeper processes of exclusion
that block positive development outcomes for
certain members of Bolivian society. Given that
about half of all Bolivians identify themselves as
indigenous, specific attention has gone to an-
alyzing well-being outcomes along ethnic divi-
sions. In the Note, the term “indigenous” refers
to all people self-identifying as members of an
indigenous or native group, as well as Afro-
descendants.2 Consequently, the term “non-in-
digenous” refers to all people who did not iden-
tify themselves as members of these groups.

information on the census data analysis; Annex

2 See Annex 1 for more details on the identification of the
ethnicity variable. Alternative indicators of ethnicity have
been proposed, such as mother tongue, either combined
with self-identification or in isolation. However, to maintain
a consistent analysis, this Note uses self-identification as
the basis for defining the indigenous and non-indigenous
variable, as does the Perception Survey. The use of
mother tongue is particularly useful when analyzing data
over a longer period of time, due to fluctuations in self-
identification, but because this Note focuses on recent data,
there is no significant difference between using mother
tongue or self-identification to determine the ethnicity
variable.

Box 1. 	 The Bono Juancito Pinto Conditional Cash Transfer Program’s Limited Effect on
         Access to Education




To address gaps in access to education, the government of Bolivia in 2006 initiated Bono Juancito
Pinto (BJP), a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program for primary students. Different evaluations have
found that CCT programs in general have the potential to improve access to education and help fight inter-
generational poverty through the encouragement of human capital accumulation (Schultz, 2004, and Yáñez et
al., 2011). Baird et al. (2013) show that while CCTs may have positive effects on enrollment and attendance,
particularly for secondary education, there seems to be limited impact on improving test scores. In addition,
CCTs provide incentives for families to acquire legal documents such as ID cards for the exercise of political
and economic rights (Molyneux and Thomson, 2011). However, whether or not these programs increase school
enrollment and completion among the most excluded groups is not as clear. In the case of Bolivia, they have
uncertain impact on indigenous groups in general and on indigenous women in particular.

Unlike CCT programs for education elsewhere in Latin America, Bolivia’s are universal rather than tar-
geted at the poor or groups disadvantaged on the basis of gender or ethnic identity. The Bono Juancito
Pinto contributes Bs 200 (almost US$30) per year to every student enrolled in public education up to eighth
grade, regardless of their parents’ income status. Students need to have attended at least 80 percent of classes
and be less than 18 years old. The BJP payment is given at the end of the school year to the father, mother,
or tutor of the student. Household data from 2011 indicates that slightly more men (29 percent) than women
(27 percent) collect the Bono and that more people living in urban areas, as well as in the more urbanized de-
partments of Santa Cruz, La Paz, and Cochabamba, receive the Bono. This indicates that physical location may
affect ability to access the Bono. Since the rural population is less likely to benefit, the program may actually
perpetuate rather than alleviate the rural-urban gap in educational outcomes. To the extent that rural residency
overlaps with ethnic identity or with specific forms and degrees of gender discrimination in schooling, the in-
tervention can also contribute to, rather than redress, disparities based on gender and ethnicity.

The data do not indicate any major differences in what women and men use the Bono for, but the largest share
of the funding received is spent on clothing and shoes (57 percent), followed by savings (18 percent). Overall,
there is little data on how much of the money is spent on actual school-related expenses.

Evaluation of the impact of the BJP on enrollment, attendance, and drop-out rates as well as on child
labor, poverty, and inequality, has proven difficult. Yáñez et al. (2011) conducted an ex ante impact simula-
tion using 2005 data and found that enrollment rates may increase 4 percent as a direct effect of the BJP. Navar-
ro (2012) argues that the BJP has had a positive impact on school attendance and a slight impact on preventing
drop-out, while its effects on enrollment are not as clear. McGuire (2013) found that, compared to other Latin
American CCTs, the BJP was less effective in improving school attendance and enrollment. Two main reasons
were identified. The first was that the Bs 200 provided is too little to offset the higher opportunity cost of study-
ing. The second reason was related to lack of incentives to send children to school based on the poor quality
of education service provision, with a lack of trained teachers, deficient school buildings and infrastructure,
and sometimes the need for children to work. In addition, McGuire highlights the fact that the small stipend is
unlikely to have a significant impact on income poverty or income inequality, as it amounts to only 4 percent
of the average annual consumption of a Bolivian household. In the case of countries where transfers had sig-
nificant beneficial effects on enrollment and attendance, the stipends amounted to 27 percent of the average
annual consumption for Nicaragua’s Red de Protección Social, 20 percent for Mexico’s Oportunidades, 17 percent for
Colombia’s Familias en Acción, and 10 percent for Ecuador’s Bono de Desarrollo Humano. For the BJP, the difficulty
of evaluating the impact on child labor, poverty, and inequality stems from the fact that the program did not
include a randomized control trial or a baseline study..

Female entrepreneurship in Latin America tends

household and child-caring responsibilities, and
smaller enterprises offer more flexibility, though

     greater access that urban dwellers have to sex-

Education
Women’s access to education in Bolivia has
improved considerably in recent years, but
challenges remain to making access uni-
versal. Even though boy and girl rates of com-
pletion of primary schooling and the female-to-
male enrollment ratio for secondary schooling
are close to parity, major gender gaps persist
for indigenous and rural students. Indigenous
and rural women have higher levels of illiteracy
and school drop-out, which hinder their ability
to take advantage of economic opportunities.
Almost all Bolivian women (92 percent) would
have wanted to study more. Since the level of
education closely interacts with and in some
cases determines life-span opportunities, de-

Note, Bolivian women in general get pregnant at
a fairly early age. Women in rural areas tend to
have their first sexual experiences and first child
at a very early age, while there do not seem to be
any significant differences based on indigenous/
non-indigenous status.


Further study of prevailing social gender
norms about the role of women in the polit-

In terms of violence against women, norms
concerning acceptance of violent behavior
and the seeking of support are important, and
it would be useful to more fully understand
access to and use of existing services to pre-
vent and respond to situations of violence.

         Annex 1. Methodological Note and Results
         of the Census Data Analysis



     The scope of the census data analysis is limited because the data include only a few socioeco-
     nomic variables which can be analyzed as outcome indicators or included as control variables
     in regressions. In analyzing the link between basic outcomes and gender and indigenous status (both
     together and separately), the following model is adopted from Tas, Reimao, and Orlando (2013):34


     Wi = f (α + β1 Gi + β2ETHi + β3 (Gi * ETHi) + γXi + ϵi)	                 (Equation 1)


     where Wi is a well-being outcome for individual i (such as literacy, school completion, and access to
     health facilities and health insurance); Gi and ETHi are individual i’s gender and ethnicity, which takes
     the value of 1 for women and indigenous/Afro-descendants, respectively; Gi * ETHi is an interaction term
     depicting additional impact on indigenous/Afro-descendant women; and Xi is a vector of control vari-
     ables (including a dummy for the respondent’s age, age-squared, and a set of dummies for age cohorts).


     When the dependent and explanatory variables are all categorical—which is the case in this anal-
     ysis (see below)—the interpretation of the model becomes analogous to the difference-in-differ-
     ences and the outcomes of a “treatment group” can be compared against a “reference” group.
     Accordingly, the marginal effects on the three terms above capture outcome disparities for women,
     indigenous groups, and indigenous women with respect to non-indigenous men. Table 1 summarizes
     these links, whereas Table 2 shows marginal effects from probit estimation of Equation 1 with literacy
     and school completion rates as dependent variables.

Even though the 2012 census allows respondents to self-identify themselves as “indigenous
or Afro-Bolivian,” it is possible to undertake a more detailed analysis of different indigenous
groups based on self-identification into sub-categories. Extending the empirical framework present-
ed above, the role of (self-identified) ethnicity and gender on well-being outcomes is estimated with the
following reduced form model, which measures the penalty of being female and a member of an indige-
nous group relative to non-indigenous males:


Wi = f[α+β1Gi + β2Ai + β3Qi + β4Ii + β5 (Gi * Ai) + β6 (Gi * Qi) + β7 (Gi * Ii) + γXi + ϵi],                   (Equation 2)

where Wi and Gi are as defined above; Ai indicates self-identification as Aymara; Qi is self-identification
as Quechua; and Ii is self-identification as an indigenous person other than Aymara or Quechua, includ-
ing Afro-Bolivians. The ethnicity variables are interpreted in the same way as summarized in Table 1,
except that the disadvantages faced by different indigenous groups are captured separately. In addition,
to account for the fact that specific indigenous groups reside in certain parts of Bolivia, the vector of
control variables Xi includes 115 dummy variables indicating individual i’s province of birth, as well as
age and age-squared. In the context of sub-group analysis of different indigenous groups, place of birth
is a more refined control than rural/urban location, since it accounts for the possibility that location not
only has an impact on education outcomes, but is also correlated with ethnicity. We know this to be true
in Bolivia, since the Aymara are primarily concentrated in the department of La Paz where education
outcomes are above the country average. Tables 3-5 show marginal effects from probit estimation of
Equation 2 with literacy and school completion rates as dependent variables, estimated separately for
different age cohorts to illustrate the fact that gender- and ethnicity-based education gaps are smallest
among younger cohorts.

   Annex 2. Methodological Note on the
   Perception Data Analysis



The Perception Survey on Women’s Exclusion and Discrimination explores the perception of indig-
enous and non-indigenous women’s situation in Bolivia in the areas of education, health, and eco-
nomic opportunities, focusing on discrimination and exclusion. The survey was conducted between
December 2013 and February 2014 by the Bolivian NGO La Coordinadora de la Mujer.


The universe of the survey is the economically active female population in Bolivia, i.e. women between
the ages of 15 to 75. It is important to note that the survey contains two distinct samples. The first is
the national sample with a total of 2,620 observations representative at the national, departmental, and
urban/rural levels. This sample forms the basis for all analysis presented in this Note.


The second consists of data collected on subsamples of the population, adding another 609 observa-
tions to the dataset. The oversample of women of lowland and highland indigenous communities was
included to capture the specific realities of these regions, but is not part of the analysis presented in
this Note.


The sample design considers each of the nine departments of the country as a sampling stratum. The
municipality was treated as the Primary Sampling Unit (PSU). In total, the national sample covers 51
municipalities selected randomly controlling for the population weight within the department. Within
each PSU, four clusters were identified and eight interviews were conducted in each cluster.


The Perception Survey requires the use of weights to estimate the distribution of a given variable in the
population. The weights are proportional to the population sizes and stored as variable peso1 in the
dataset. Preceding the analysis, the weights are to be applied (using the “svyset” command in Stata)
if one wishes to make inferences about the characteristics of the population.
