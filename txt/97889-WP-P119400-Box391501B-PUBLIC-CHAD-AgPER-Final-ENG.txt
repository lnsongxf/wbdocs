This report synthesizes the conclusions of a team of World Bank Consultants who visited N’Djamena on
two occasions in November 2013 and March 2014 to help the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
(MoAI) conduct a Retrospective Agricultural Public Expenditure Review. The team consisted of Jean-
Claude Balcet and César Déring (Consultant Agro-Economists) assisted by Paulette Zoua and Berte
Tayélim (Program Assistants, World Bank Office in N’Djamena). Manasset Guéalbaye (Consultant
Economist) contributed to part of the team’s work.

A Technical Steering Committee was formed under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
(MoAI) and charged with leading the participants. This committee brought together the focal points of the
technical ministries of the agricultural sector: MoAI, Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal
Production (MoPDAP), Ministry of Environmental and Fishery Resources (MoEF), and the Ministry of
Rural and Urban Water Supplies (MoW),1 the economic ministries: Ministry of Finance and Budget
(MoF) and Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC), and representatives from the
private sector and civil society. The Committee held several working meetings under the direction of Mrs.
Khadidja Abdelkader, CAADP Focal Point for the Republic of Chad, in order to orient and guide the
work of the consultants. A Launch Workshop was organized in the MAEP in November 2013 and
presided over by the General Secretary of the MoAI with the participation of the Resident Representative
of the World Bank, representatives of the Government services involved, civil society, and Development
Partners (DP). Several other meetings were held as the consultants’ work progressed, notably in March
2014 to review the second mission and in early May to discuss the agricultural public expenditure
database. Finally, a validation workshop was held on September 9-10, 2014. This workshop involved all
of the stakeholders from the Government, the DPs, the private sector, and civil society.

The series of meetings held throughout the review process made it possible to identify and keep open the
lines of communication between all of the collaborators and technicians who contributed to this work.
This collaboration was extremely valuable for the work of the review, and the Consultants would like to
offer their profound thanks to all of those who participated in the various projects and meetings. The
review and data analysis work would not have been possible without their active participation.

The Consultants would like to express their gratitude to the Chad authorities, the DPs, and the other non-
governmental partners for their warm welcome, their availability, and their excellent collaboration. They
would particularly like to thank Mrs. Khadidja Abdelkader for her help in steering the review process, Mr.
Nangtourbaye for providing the necessary insights into the budget process, Mr. Mbaiguedem for
providing access to the MoPIC database, the DPs for providing the necessary information about their
financial support, and the members of the Technical Steering Committee for their guidance in the data
collection and analysis work throughout the review process.

Within the World Bank, the Consultants would particularly like to thank Adama Coulibay (Resident
Representative of the World Bank in N’Djamena), Stephen Mink (TTL, Principal Economist, World Bank
GAGDR), Nicaise Ehoué (Agricultural Economist, AFTAR, in charge of Chad), and Olivier Béguy
(Economist, World Bank Office in N’Djamena) for their advice and insightful comments. They would
also like to thank Paulette Zoua and Berthe Tayélim (Operations Assistants, World Bank Office in
N’Djamena) for their continued support throughout the review process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.     Within the context of the CAADP, the Government of Chad (GOC) wished to undertake a review of
       agricultural public expenditures in order to draw lessons from past budget implementation in this
       sector with a view to improving future program performance. Following a request by the Ministry
       of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI), the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency gave Chad its
       backing for this review. This process was undertaken by the Program for Strengthening National
       Comprehensive Agricultural Public Expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa, co-financed by the Bill and
       Melinda Gates Foundation and the CAADP Multi-Donor Trust Fund. This program, which is
       implemented by the World Bank, aims to improve the impact of the limited public resources
       available to governments in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to foster agricultural development and
       combat poverty in rural areas, where most of the poor in these countries, notably Chad, live.

ii.    This study follows and builds upon a number of similar studies conducted in recent years on public
       expenditure management, in particular in Chad the Action Plan for the Modernization of Public
       Finances (PAMFIP). However, these studies have focused on national budget management as a
       whole and none to date has looked at the agricultural sector specifically. Hence the opportunity to
       undertake the present Diagnostic Review of Basic Public Expenditure in the Agricultural Sector in
       Chad.

iii.   This Review aims to:

       a. Gain a better understanding of the country's performance in the context of the 2003 Maputo
          Declaration;

       b. Draw lessons from the past in terms of budget implementation in the agricultural sector in order
          to improve the performance of future programs;

       c. Increase the GOC’s and the Development Partners' (DP) understanding of the sector’s
          absorption capacity so that an appropriate decision can be made to increase the financial
          resources allocated to agricultural development; and

       d. Contribute to ownership of the public expenditure review process within the two sector
          ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (MoAE) and the Ministry of Livestock
          and Hydraulics (MoLH) with the more general goal of strengthening their capacity in terms of
          data collection and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

iv.    Unlike other countries where the process of agricultural development is underway, Chad is an
       outlier in that: (i) foreign aid is in recovery mode after the socioeconomic troubles of recent years,
       and (ii) in-depth reforms to the functioning of the State are ongoing. In this context of change, it is
       crucial to draw lessons from past budget implementation by internalizing the analytical process as a
       vital tool for success in implementing the new National Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR,
       2014-2020).


Trends in budget expenditures

v.     Over the review period covered by this report (2003-2012), the budget allocated to agriculture
       increased noticeably more than the sector’s contribution to GDP. This reflects a notable effort by the
       Chad authorities to increase the budget to boost this sector’s development in recent years. In this
       proactive context, Chad signed its CAADP Compact in December 2013 to continue supporting
       agriculture’s revival. The CAADP is being implemented in Chad even as the terms of the National
                                                      x
        Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR, 2014-2020) are being finalized.

vi.     The country’s total budget expenditures increased sharply over the period 2004-2012, rising by a
        factor of 3.4 over the period (from CFAF 436 to 1,480 billion) and corresponding to a budget
        implementation rate of 91.8%. COFOG agricultural expenditures also increased, although at a
        slower rate, from CFAF 42 to 115 billion, or a factor of 2.7. On the other hand, the implementation
        rate of these expenditures was higher, exceeding 100% on average over the period 2003-2012.2 It
        should be noted that in the Chad context, the level of public expenditures is of less importance than
        the low efficiency of this expenditures in terms of its impact on the beneficiaries. This lack of
        efficiency is due to the public sector’s poor implementation capacity and to a lack of transparency in
        the use of public funds. It is difficult to examine the degree of efficiency in public expenditures
        given the lack of available data and impact analyses, and this could not be carried out for this
        Review.

vii.    Trends in COFOG expenditures. In the period 2003-2012, public agricultural expenditures as
        measured using the COFOG methodology accounted for: (i) 5.7% of total public expenditures; (ii)
        4.1% of agricultural GDP; and (iii) 1.1% of total GDP. These figures place Chad at the lower end of
        Sub-Saharan African countries in terms of support for the agricultural sector. To lift the level of
        support toward the upper end of the range for low-income countries (e.g., 8% of agricultural GDP)
        and reach the target of 10% of national expenditures allocated to the sector, Chad would have had to
        practically double its expenditures in order to reach an average of CFAF 100 billion per year in the
        period 2004-2012, or CFAF 190 billion equivalent for 2012. Yet this would still be insufficient to
        meet the ambitious needs of the PNISR, which are estimated at CFAF 2,800 billion for the period
        2014-2020, or approximately CFAF 400 billion per year.3

viii. Trends in overall agricultural expenditures. Total public agricultural expenditures including
      expenditures on rural development and food security in the broad sense amounted to: (i) 10.26% of
      the national budget; (ii) 7.2% of agricultural and livestock GDP; and (iii) 1.93% of total GDP. These
      figures are much more positive than the strict COFOG figures. It is clear that as the Chad authorities
      see it, agricultural expenditures need to be analyzed from a broader viewpoint beyond the narrow
      COFOG framework. Indeed, some expenditures, such as food aid, drinking water, feeder roads, and,
      more broadly the setting up of basic services, are vitally important for rural and regional
      development to be effective.

Breakdown of budget expenditures

ix.     This Review breaks down public expenditures in three ways: (i) administrative breakdown (MoAE
        vs. MoLH, central services vs. decentralized services, and supervised bodies and NFSP); (ii)
        economic breakdown (payroll and operational, capital, and transfer expenditures); and (iii)
        operational breakdown (expenditures by sub-sector: agriculture vs. livestock breeding).

x.      The administrative breakdown of public agricultural expenditures by sector ministry shows that
        MoAE expenditures accounted for approximately 79% and MoLH expenditures for approximately
        21% of the combined budget of these two ministries. These expenditures are highly centralized,
        with 96% allocated at the national level. Over the period under review, expenditures by affiliated
        agencies and the National Food Security Program (NFSP), corresponding to appropriations granted
        on the basis of transfers,4 represented 37.4% of MoAE and 4.3% of MoLH expenditures. The NFSP

2
     This very high rate includes off-budget capital expenditures from external resources (see Annex 1).

     In Chad’s budget nomenclature, resources appropriated to affiliated agencies and independent programs are
     booked as transfers.
                                                       xi
         was the largest recipient, with 41% of total expenditures by these entities, followed by Cotontchad
         (24%) and the National Bureau of Food Security (ONASA, 20%). Note that Cotontchad’s share
         corresponds solely to subsidies aiming to cover its deficits and one-off losses in certain years.5 This
         review questions why some expenditures were implemented through autonomous entities or
         independent programs (e.g., NFSP) when it could have been channeled directly through the
         technical directorates of the sector ministries, where the responsibility usually lies.

xi.      The economic breakdown of public agricultural expenditures vs. the overall national budget reveals
         the following: (i) payroll expenditures: 12% vs. 21%; (ii) operational expenditures: 4% vs. 9%; (iii)
         transfers: 40% vs. 20%; and (iv) capital expenditures: 44% vs. 43%. As a result, payroll and
         operational costs as a proportion of the total MoAE and MoLH budget are markedly lower than
         those of the civil service as a whole, while their transfers are twice as high and capital expenditures
         are of the same magnitude. It is clear that the operational expenditures of the MoAE and the MoLH
         are sorely insufficient and should be increased at least to a level similar to that of the overall civil
         service.

xii.     COFOG capital expenditures6 were calculated by taking into account only eligible expenditures
         under the COFOG nomenclature, i.e., approximately 35% of the share of expenditures on integrated
         rural development projects, and by excluding food aid expenditures and other non-COFOG
         expenditures (e.g., feeder roads). The results show that capital expenditures represented
         approximately 45% of total public agricultural expenditures, with this proportion remaining stable
         over the course of the review period. MoAE and MoLH capital expenditures from external
         financing dipped early in the review period (2003-2012) before returning to their initial level of
         around CFAF 55 billion at the end of the period. A breakdown of these capital expenditures by type
         shows that integrated rural development projects (or regional projects) represent the largest category
         (29%), followed by technical assistance projects and capacity building (12.8%). Meanwhile,
         agricultural production and livestock and fisheries represent only 11.3% and 10.6%, respectively. A
         breakdown by donor shows that the AfDB (16%), France (10%), Germany (8%), the European
         Union (6%), the World Bank (6%), and the BADEA (6%) were the leading donors, excluding jointly
         financed multi-donor projects (8.3%). Capital expenditures from national financing increased
         strongly over the period, from CFAF 6 billion in 2004 to CFAF 26 billion in 2012. The ratio of
         capital expenditures from national financing to total capital expenditures also increased. Despite this
         sharp increase, internal financing equated to only one-quarter of the amount from external financing
         on average over the review period. This proportion should be increased.

xiii. The operational breakdown of budget expenditures reveals a bias in favor of agricultural
      expenditures in the narrow sense as opposed to livestock expenditures. These expenditures relate to
      the MoAE’s budget and constitute 4.5% of the national budget, whereas agriculture’s contribution to
      national GDP is only 12.9%. In contrast, livestock expenditures pertain to the MoLH’s budget and
      equated to only 1.3% of implemented national expenditures, whereas the livestock sector
      contributes 13.6% of GDP.

Efficiency of the budget process
xiv. Although the situation has improved recently, we note that budget management is weak on the
     whole. The Supplementary Budget Law generally contains significant modifications to the Initial
     Budget Law. This reflects: (i) an inability at the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoF) to
     accurately estimate revenue and to rigorously allocate expenditures according to sectoral priorities;
     and (ii) poor macroeconomic projections and forecasts by the Ministry of Planning and International

5
    During the period under review, Cotontchad received grants only in 2005, 2006, and 2007.
6
     Total capital expenditures (COFOG and non-COFOG) from external financing are summarized in Annex 1.
                                                        xii
      Cooperation (MoPIC), which lead to unrealistic or unreliable revenue forecasts and to an allocation
      of sectoral budget appropriations that fails to consider real priorities.

xv.   The implementation of public expenditures by the agricultural sector ministries is affected by three
      major problems: (i) cumbersome procurement procedures; despite the large number of
      improvements that have resulted from the Action Plan for the Modernization of Public Finances
      (PAMFIP), current procurement procedures are both lengthy (4 to 6 weeks at least) and inefficient;
      (ii) breakdowns in communication between donors and project managers and, in some cases, the
      cumbersome procedures of donors themselves; and (iii) problems mobilizing government backing
      for projects due to various problems such as lower prices for hydrocarbons in international markets
      and the resulting fall in government revenue (e.g., in 2011).

xvi. Such bottlenecks echo the overall process of preparation, implementation, and monitoring and
     evaluation of budget expenditures by the agricultural sector ministries.

Conclusions and recommendations
xvii. This Review makes the following conclusions and recommendations with regard to public
      agricultural expenditures:

      a. The overall amount of agricultural expenditures should be increased. Agricultural expenditures
         (using the COFOG methodology) relating to crop and livestock production activities should have
         more than doubled over the 2003-2012 review period if the Maputo target of 10% of the national
         budget allocated to the agricultural sector were to have been met. This would have amounted to
         approximately CFAF 190 billion in 2012 (compared with expenditures of CFAF 93.3 billion in
         2012). Several priority areas where public financing is clearly still insufficient are livestock
         farming (see b. below), irrigation systems, pastoral watering, and feeder roads, given both the
         needs and the potential in these areas. Farming and livestock services are another area that needs
         strengthening. The combined effect of these budgetary measures would pave the way for an
         increase in agricultural output, in particular with regard to crop production;

      b. The budget allocated to livestock activities should be increased. Efforts aiming to increase the
         agricultural budget in particular (to at least double it; see above) should be deployed, with
         particular emphasis on supporting livestock activities. In relation to total national expenditures,
         the share of expenditures on livestock activities (1.3% pertaining to MoLH expenditures) as
         opposed to expenditures on agricultural activities (4.5% for the MoAE) is insufficient in light of
         their respective contributions to national GDP (13.6% vs. 12.9% for agriculture). On this point, it
         would be advisable to substantially increase the MoLH budget, in particular the budgets of the
         technical directorates under the former Ministry of Pastoral Resources and Animal Production
         (MoPDAP). Pastoral watering will also require particular attention;

      c. Budget allocations granted to the regions should be increased. Chad is a large country with
         diverse resources. The government should establish efficient decentralized services with the
         resources to respond to the needs of local populations. The current 4% allocation of budget
         resources to the decentralized branches of the sector ministries is manifestly insufficient. First,
         the resources allocated to these branches should be increased markedly. Next, the objective
         should be to undertake institutional reforms with a view to giving more power and responsibility
         to the decentralized organizations and grant them the corresponding additional resources;

      d. Appropriations for operational expenditures should be increased. The accounting breakdown of
         MoAE and MoLH expenditures reveals that only 4% of total expenditures are allocated to the
         operational costs (including equipment maintenance) of these two ministries. Experience shows

                                                    xiii
        that this level of allocation is highly insufficient to adequately cover their operations. This level
        should be adjusted to at least the level of the overall civil service, i.e., approximately 9%;

     e. The technical directorates should implement expenditures directly. This concerns in particular
        the NFSP, which represents over 15% of the total MoAE budget. This budget covers
        expenditures (e.g., irrigation systems, pastoral and village waterworks, and intensification of
        crop, livestock, and fisheries production), which ought to be implemented by the technical
        directorates (or specialized bodies under supervision). The NFSP budget should therefore be
        adjusted downward so that it contains only expenditures strictly related to food security and the
        remaining budget transferred to the directorates and other technical entities; and

     f. National financing should play a greater role in capital expenditures. National financing of
        capital expenditures equated to only one-quarter of capital expenditures from external financing
        on average during the review period. This share should be raised. In fact, donors have sought
        such an increase. They consider that given its oil resources, Chad should be able to contribute
        more of its own funds to capital expenditures. Likewise, the Chad government could also
        contribute to the necessary increase in the MoAE and MoLH budgets (see above).

The implementation of the above recommendations will require a strengthening of planning and
programming, management, and monitoring and evaluation systems at the levels of both the central
ministries (MoF and MoPIC) and the two sector ministries (MoAE and MoLH), as described below:

     g. Planning and programming should be strengthened. Budget planning and programming remains
        an extremely weak link in the budget process in Chad at the levels of both the two economic
        ministries (MoPIC and MoF) and the technical ministries (MoAE and MoLH in the case of the
        agricultural sector). The fact that the Supplementary Budget Law is often out of step with the
        Initial Budget Law is a clear illustration of this shortcoming.

        The agricultural sector strategy documents that do contain quantitative data, such as the
        Agricultural Master Plan (AMP, 2006-2015) and the Five-Year Agricultural Plan (2013-2018),
        do not include sufficiently complete databases to draw up accurate budget expenditure forecasts
        relative to the objectives set in general policy documents. This drawback undermines the
        foundations of the budget cycle. In fact, the documents cited above have become obsolete as
        they have been included in the National Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR 2014-2020)
        under the aegis of the CAADP with assistance from the FAO. In this respect, the current support
        from the FAO in defining the terms of the PNISR is welcome as it will give a much-needed
        sense of direction to the planning and programming of capital expenditures in the agricultural
        sector. It should be noted that this drive is taking place with the participation of all stakeholders.
        The MoAE and MoLH Directorates of Economic Planning and Programming (DEPP) in
        particular are closely involved, as is the MoAE’s Permanent Agricultural Programming and
        Monitoring Unit.

        The collection and compilation of budget data is another shortcoming that needs to be addressed.
        In particular, this concerns: (i) the projected external financing of development projects not yet
        systematically accounted for in budget allocations, and (ii) disbursements of external financing
        that do not appear in the Computerized Expenditure System (CES) managed by the MoF.

        This Review makes the following recommendations for remedying the above shortcomings in
        budget planning and programming: (i) Prepare valid strategy documents that can be used as a
        framework for programming and planning activities and can be quickly put into operation; (ii)
        Systematically insert external financing in the budget database both for projected appropriations
        (Initial and Supplementary Budget Laws) and commitments (CES); on this point, data
                                                    xiv
  concerning projected financing and disbursements for development projects from donors to the
  MoPIC should be systematically and promptly passed on to the MoF to be included in the Initial
  and Supplementary Budget Laws and in the CES, respectively; (iii) Increase coordination
  between participants; coordination between the MoF and the MoPIC needs to be enhanced,
  especially considering that it is the MoPIC that communicates with the DPs; collaboration with
  the group of DPs also needs to be improved to ensure that donors systematically and accurately
  pass on all the data concerning their financing; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of the MoAE and
  MoLH Directorates of Economic Planning and Programming (DEPP).

h. The Management Information System (MIS) should be strengthened. The MIS of both sector
   ministries is extremely weak and does not enable close monitoring of the ministries’ day -to-day
   recurrent expenditures (including payroll costs, operational costs, and other recurrent costs) or
   periodic evaluation of these costs. This shortcoming could be remedied by strengthening the
   Directorate of Financial Management (DAF) within each of these ministries and ensuring that a
   desirable level of collaboration is established with the corresponding services at the MoF; and

i. Monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened. Monitoring and evaluation of investment
   projects is deficient. Monitoring should be carried out regularly, in particular during the various
   stages of the donor project supervision cycle. This monitoring would make it possible to stay
   informed of progress in project implementation and to adjust budget forecasts accordingly.
   Likewise, project evaluation should be prepared systematically by project managers in order to
   determine the impact of public expenditures, and in particular capital expenditures, on the target
   populations. To date, this analysis is seldom carried out except on occasion in the context of
   specific completion reports with the support of DPs. Strengthening monitoring and evaluation is
   a matter of urgency and will require operational data to be systematically collected and impact
   studies to be carried out.

INTRODUCTION

1.   Over the review period covered by this report (2003-2012), the budget allocated to agriculture
     increased noticeably more than the sector’s contribution to GDP. This reflects a notable effort by the
     Chad authorities to increase the budget to boost this sector’s development in recent years. In this
     proactive context, Chad signed its CAADP Compact in December 2013 to continue supporting
     agriculture’s revival. The CAADP is being implemented in Chad even as the terms of the National
     Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR, 2014-2020) are being finalized.

2.   Within the context of the CAADP, the Government of Chad (GOC) wished to undertake a review of
     public agriculture expenditures to learn from past budgetary implementation in this sector with a
     view to improving future program performance. Following a request by the Ministry of Agriculture
     and Irrigation (MoAI), the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency gave Chad its backing for
     this review. This process was undertaken by the Program for Strengthening National
     Comprehensive Agricultural Public Expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa, co-financed by the Bill and
     Melinda Gates Foundation and the CAADP Multi-Donor Trust Fund. This program, implemented
     by the World Bank, aims to improve the impact of the still-limited public resources available to
     governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to foster agricultural development and reduce poverty in rural
     areas, where most of the poor in these countries, notably Chad, live.

3.   This study follows and builds upon a number of similar studies conducted in recent years on public
     expenditure management, in particular in Chad the Action Plan for the Modernization of Public
     Finances (PAMFIP). However, these studies have focused on budget management as a whole, and
     none to date has looked at the agricultural sector specifically.

4.   The Basic Agricultural Public Expenditure Diagnostic Review in Chad aims to:

     a. Gain a better understanding of the country's performance in the context of the 2003 Maputo
        Declaration.

     b. Draw lessons from the past in terms of budget implementation in the agricultural sector in order
        to improve the performance of future programs;

     c. Increase the GOC’s and the DPs’ understanding of the sector’s absorption capacity so that an
        appropriate decision can be made to increase the financial resources allocated to agricultural
        development; and

     d. Contribute to ownership of the public expenditure review process within the two sector
        ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (MoAE) and the Ministry of Livestock
        and Hydraulics (MOLH), with the more general and necessary goal of strengthening monitoring
        and evaluation (M&E) capacity.

5.   Unlike other countries where the process of agricultural development is underway, Chad is an
     outlier in that: (i) foreign aid is in recovery mode after the socioeconomic troubles of recent years,
     and (ii) reforms to the functioning of the State are ongoing. In this context of change, it is crucial to
     draw lessons from the past in terms of budget implementation by internalizing the analytical process
     as a vital tool for success in the implementation of the PNISR.

CHAPTER 1. STRATEGIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

1.1 The Agricultural Sector: Recent Context and Development

General Information about the Country

7.       In geographic terms, Chad has a surface area of 1,284,000 km2. It is a landlocked country
         located at the heart of the African continent. It is part of the Sahelo-Saharan zone, while the
         southern tip of the country is in the Sudanian zone, as shown in Map 1 below.

8.       In terms of climate, Chad is characterized by a hot continental climate, with a rainfall level
         that varies from the north to the south of the country between 100 mm and 1,200 mm per
         year, a pattern that has a significant influence on the agricultural production system. This
         rainfall is characterized by strong annual variability, with a significant risk of drought. The
         country is thus vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, with profound effects on
         agricultural and food production as well as forage production and livestock feed.
9.       As in the rest of Africa’s Sahelian belt, climate change is having an adverse effect on Chad’s
         climate cycle, with droughts or flooding occurring every ten years on average, with severe
         flooding in 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008, with an exception in 2012, and droughts in 1973,
         1983, and 2001, accompanied by food shortages and famines and sometimes epidemics
         (cholera, rinderpest, etc.).
10. In terms of natural resources, Chad has a wide range of potential resources at its disposal,
    which should allow for sustainable growth in production and poverty reduction:
          39 million hectares of cultivable land (30% of the territory), including 19 million hectares
           of arable land, composed of 13.3 million hectares cleared for agriculture and 5.6 million
           hectares with irrigation potential, of which 435,000 hectares can be easily irrigated;
          84 million hectares of natural pasture land and 23.3 million hectares of natural forest


                                                     3
        formations, which provide feed for a population of over 20 million ruminants as well as
        shelter for a still plentiful and varied fauna that constitutes a significant source of
        biodiversity;
       22.4 million hectares of protected areas and 7 million hectares suitable for fishery
        resources; and
       20 billion cubic meters of annually renewable groundwater and an estimated 260 to 540
        billion cubic meters of useable aquifer reserves. A volume of only 1.27 billion cubic
        meters is taken from these various resources each year.

11. In demographic terms, the country has a population of approximately 11.9 million
    (INSEED, 2011), with an average annual growth rate of 3.6%. According to the 2009
    census, Chad has a resident population aged 18 and over of 4.7 million, which represents
    43% of the total population. Given the demographic growth rate, Chad’s population will
    continue to be very young. This constitutes a significant human resource for the future. Chad
    has a working population of 5 million, of which only 5% are employed in the formal sector.
    Approximately 83% of the working population lives in rural areas.
Socioeconomic Development, Poverty, and Food Security
12. Despite its potential for development, since its independence in 1960, the country’s
    evolution has been characterized by near-stagnation or even regression in the population’s
    standard of living. Although the advent of oil resources since 2003 has partially reduced this
    decline, the country’s economic performance remains weak, with a downward trend in the
    rate of economic growth in real terms. From 34.3% in 2004 when oil wells were first
    exploited, the GDP growth rate fell to 7.5% in 2005, 1.4% in 2006, 4.0% in 2007, -0.6% in
    2008, 1.8% in 2009, and 5.2% in 2010.
13. The 2000s were marked by strong growth in Chad’s economy, primarily due to the drilling
    of oil. However, the emergence of the oil sector and its related financial opportunities have
    not yet had a significant impact on the real economy, whose annual growth rate was 3.7% on
    average in the period 2006-2011. Chad’s economic growth is erratic, primarily as a result of
    fluctuations in agricultural and oil production, which are related to weather conditions and
    the price of oil in the markets, respectively. This partially explains the erratic nature of
    public expenditures.
14. In 2009, the proportion of the population living below the poverty line was 45% nationwide
    and 87% in rural areas. Undernourishment continues to be a crucial issue, with the rate of
    underweight infants and children estimated at 30% in 2010 (MICS, 2010) and a significant
    number of people regularly finding themselves in a situation of chronic food insecurity.
    According to the 2003 report by the Economic Community of Central African States
    (ECCAS), Chad ranks last among the countries in the sub-region in terms of its ability to
    respond to the food issue.
15. Generally speaking, much remains to be done in Chad in terms of human development. The
    country’s per capita income, estimated at USD 426 in 2009, remains one of the lowest in the
    world. As concerns the Human Development Index (HDI) (UNDP Human Development
    Report, 2009), Chad was ranked 183rd out of the 187 countries for which figures were
    available. The main development indexes presented in Table 1 along with a comparison with
    the regional and global situation provide insights into the country’s socioeconomic situation.

16. Prior to the beginning of the 2000s, Chad was unable to meet its food deficit, which
    remained at approximately 30% on average. It has been estimated that 20% of Chad’s
    population was in a permanent situation of undernourishment. Efforts have been made in the
    past decade to eliminate this deficit. In the past ten years, agricultural production has
    increased substantially. This increase notably helped reduce the yearly grain deficit, which
    on average reached only about 10% (see Table 2 below). Consequently, food sovereignty
    remains a major challenge for the country.

The Agricultural Sector

17. Prior to 2004, the agricultural sector, including food and commercial agriculture, livestock,
    and hunting, fishing, and forestry, represented approximately 40% of national GDP. This
    figure has greatly decreased in recent years due to the significant increase in the country’s
    oil resources as oil exploration profoundly modified the production and exportation structure
    of Chad’s economy. After 2004, agricultural GDP (including livestock, fishing, and forestry)
    represented on average nearly 27.6% of national GDP between 2003 and 2012. The
    agricultural sector also contributes to export revenues, principally thanks to cotton,
    representing about 45% of non-oil exports. Agricultural production proper contributed
    13.2% on average to national GDP, and the livestock sub-sector represented 14.4% of
    national GDP on average between 2003 and 2012. Today, 78% of the population lives in
    rural areas, with agriculture as the primary source of income. The agricultural sector thus
    remains a key instrument for poverty reduction. Since oil resources are necessarily limited,

                                                   5
     the sector also forms the basis for sustainable economic development in Chad.
18. Despite its great potential (see paragraph 10 above), the agricultural sector experienced
    average annual growth of only 2% between 2007 and 2011, marked by strong variation, with
    a low of -14% in 2011 and a high of 27% the previous year. The year 2011 was marked by
    severe weather conditions, which had a significant effect on production. Growth in the
    livestock, fishing, and forestry sub-sectors was also relatively stable during the same period,
    with an annual average of 1.9%. By contrast, the foodcrop production GDP was subject to
    wide fluctuations, with an average annual growth rate of 3.6%, while the industrial
    agriculture GDP decreased.
19. The increase in production over the past decade was due to an increase in farmland rather
    than in productivity, with grain yields remaining virtually unchanged. This observation also
    applies to the yields of other crops, such as oilseeds (see Table 3 below).
Table 3: Grain and oilseed yields
                     Year              Grain Yields             Oilseed Yields

20. To exploit these opportunities, the agricultural sector must overcome numerous challenges
    involving, among others, access to inputs, water control, labor productivity and yields,
    zootechnical parameters, and transport and storage infrastructures in order to facilitate
    market access for commodities as well as weaknesses in extension and support services for
    producers. Moreover, the country is subject to external shocks such as droughts and
    flooding, exacerbated by the impact of climate change, locust invasions, and conflicts,
    leading to internal as well as cross-border movement of populations. These shocks expose
    the population to recurring conditions of famine.

1.2 Agricultural Development Policies and Strategies

21. In the period 2002-2012, several framework documents were drafted to guide development
    policies and strategies for the agricultural, rural, and food security sector. These documents
    all emphasize the fact that beyond the opportunities provided by the oil windfall, food
    sovereignty, the emergence of a diversified and competitive economy, and sustainable
    growth all depend on the agricultural and pastoral sector.
22. Maputo Declaration (2003). On an international level, the Chad Government has adhered to


                                                 6
     the 2003 Maputo Declaration. With this declaration, African governments agreed to increase
     the share of their national budget dedicated to agriculture and rural development, with an
     objective of at least 10%, in order to attain agricultural growth of at least 6% per year. As a
     result of this commitment, NEPAD detailed the procedures to be used to calculate the share
     of agricultural, rural development, and food security expenditures in national budgets
     (AU/NEPAD, 2005) in order to make homogenous comparisons between countries possible.
     These expenditures correspond to the definition provided by the Classification of
     Government Occupations (COFOG) (see paragraph 43).
23. Rural Development Support Program (PIDR – 2002). Drafted for the implementation of
    sectoral consultation on rural development, the PIDR emerged from the Geneva IV Round
    Table and reaffirmed the Government’s desire to make the agricultural and rural sector the
    priority sector. The PIDR aimed to increase the production capacity and incomes of
    producers and rural populations and restore the ecological balance needed for the improved
    management of natural resources. Based on these objectives, strategies for the agriculture,
    livestock, fishing, and environment sub-sectors were elaborated. The PIDR consisted of two
    major programs: the Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL), and the
    Producer Organization Support Project (PASAOP).
24. Water and Sanitation Master Plan (WSMP, 2003-2020). The WSMP is a strategic multi-
    sectoral policy framework for the sustainable development and management of Chad’s water
    resources with the aim of satisfying the population’s basic needs and ensure the country’s
    economic and social development while respecting its environment. The WSMP is an
    adaptive reference instrument for all of the internal and external stakeholders working in the
    water sector in Chad. In terms of agricultural water systems, this involves strengthening
    capacities in the field of rehabilitation, the management and exploitation of large irrigated
    surfaces, and the development of small private surfaces by focusing on training and farmers'
    associations.
25. Chad’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS I, 2003-2006 and PRS II, 2008-2011). The PRS
    placed the priority on the agricultural sector and the promotion of the rural environment,
    where 87% of the poor population lives. It focuses on food security, the intensification of
    cultivation, the diversification of products (groundnuts, acacia gum, fruit and vegetables,
    and roots and tubers), and the revival of cotton production, which sustains 350,000 farming
    families. The chosen means included: (i) more effective public interventions, notably the
    revival of research, seed production, and extension; (ii) a policy focusing on the
    development of farmers’ associations and the gradual delegation to these groupings and the
    private sector of activities previously monopolized by the public sector; (iii) the promotion
    of small-scale irrigation that can be managed by the producers themselves or their
    groupings; and (iv) the implementation of the roadmap for the restructuring of Cotontchad.
    In terms of poverty reduction, the objective was to lower the incidence of poverty in the
    cotton-producing zones from 55% to 40% in 2011.
26. Agricultural Master Plan (AMP, 2006-2015). The AMP was defined in reference to the
    PIDR. Its global objective is to contribute to a sustainable increase in agricultural production
    in a preserved and safe environment. It seeks to reach the specific objectives of: (i) food
    security; (ii) the creation of and increase in incomes in rural areas; (iii) a substantial increase
    in agriculture’s contribution to national GDP; (iv) sustainable improvement in the standard
    and quality of living for rural populations; and (v) the strengthening of regional integration
    in the area of trade. These specific objectives are underpinned by various programs ranging
    from support for public services to the revival of food and industrial production. Through
    these specific objectives, the AMP helps strengthen the priority strategic focus of the PRS,
    which is to coordinate all of the sectoral strategies in agriculture and rural development.

                                                  7
27. National Livestock Development Program (PNDE, 2010-2017). The PNDE adopted in
    November 2010 also used the PIDR as a reference framework for the rural sector, with the
    central objective to sustainably increase animal production in order to improve and increase
    the livestock sector’s contribution to the national economy, poverty reduction, and food
    security. This global objective is divided into eight specific objectives: (i) to increase
    production through intensification and diversification while ensuring the safety of the
    pastoral and agro-pastoral systems; (ii) to develop the livestock sector and encourage
    specialized production by promoting productive and economically viable livestock farming;
    (iii) to develop commercialization and exportation by introducing new processing and
    conservation technologies; (iv) to improve knowledge of the sector by monitoring data about
    the labor force and the zoo-economic characteristics of the livestock; (v) to preserve and
    strengthen an animal health and veterinary research policy; (vi) to establish a concerted
    development and management policy for pastoral resources; (vii) to strengthen the
    capacities of the technical services and professionals working in the livestock sector; and
    (viii) to ensure the substantial and regular financing of the livestock sector in order to allow
    for its promotion. The implementation of the PNDE is based on two major programs, which
    focus on: (i) the development of livestock production systems; and (ii) the strengthening of
    the capacities of the sector’s support services and professionals.
28. National Development Plan (NDP, 2013-2015). The three-year NDP aims to integrate all of
    the sectoral strategies previously contained in PRS I and PRS II and ensure their coherence
    with Chad’s vision for 2025. This vision advocates orienting investments toward the
    agricultural and pastoral sub-sectors, which have real potential for ensuring the emergence
    of a diversified and competitive economy and guarantee sustainable growth for the country.
    The NDP strives to improve the population’s quality of life and reduce poverty, especially in
    rural areas and among women and young people. For the period 2013-2015, the specific
    growth-related objectives are to maintain a yearly real GDP growth rate of at least 8.9% and
    ensure an investment growth rate of at least 6.7%. To this end, eight priority objectives have
    been established: (i) sustainable growth; (ii) food security; (iii) the creation of and access to
    employment; (iv) the development of human capital; (v) the development of the private
    sector; (vi) the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); (vii)
    the protection of the environment and adaptation to climate change; and (viii) improvements
    in governance.
29. Five-Year Agriculture Development Plan, 2013-2018). At a total cost of CFAF 1,023
    billion, or CFAF 204 billion per year,7 the Five-Year Agriculture Plan aims to ensure food
    security and, more specifically, food sovereignty by 2018 and contribute to growth in the
    national economy by greatly increasing agricultural production and improving productivity.
    The key objectives of the plan are to increase cereal supplies, which are a staple in the diet
    of Chad’s population, and to give real impetus to agricultural production, which remains
    inconsistent and dependent on rainfall. Within this framework, five priority fields have been
    defined: (i) water control and management; (ii) the intensification and diversification of
    agricultural production; (iii) strengthening food crisis prevention and management based
    primarily on an instrument consisting of a prevention and early alert system responsible for
    collecting, processing, and disseminating information about the food and nutritional
    situation, and a national food security reserve composed essentially of grains meant for
    emergency interventions in the case of food and nutrition crises; (iv) strengthening the
    capacities of services and Agricultural Producers’ Organizations (APO); and (v) supporting
    the promotion of promising agricultural sectors, including grains (rice and corn), oilseeds
    (sesame and groundnuts), horticultural products (onions and garlic), root and tuber plants,

7
    This includes all sectoral public expenditures, including the operating costs of sectoral entities.

     and fruit and vegetables.
30. Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). The implementation
    of the CAADP in Chad, which derives from the compact with the New Partnership for
    Africa’s Development (NEPAD) of the African Union (AU) signed in December 2013, is
    based on these various national strategic plans with the aim of preparing the on-going
    National Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR) with support from the FAO. The FAO’s
    early estimates suggest needs in the region of CFAF 2,800 billion for the period 2014-2020
    covered by the plan, or approximately CFAF 400 billion per year.
31. Observations. A review of governmental strategies reveals the following general issues: (i)
    Overlapping and lack of capitalization: Numerous overlapping strategies were observed
    over a relatively short period (a decade) as well as a lack of capitalization on the gains made
    by the various strategies; (ii) Weak coordination: The PIDR was established to integrate and
    coordinate all interventions in rural areas in order to ensure coherence and avoid duplication
    in the rural development sector; unfortunately, this coordination structure has not been
    implemented, thus allowing strategies to be implemented without national monitoring or
    coordination; the result is duplication in the announced programs within the various
    strategies; (iii) Insufficient articulation and redundancy: Although all of the governmental
    strategies are based on the PRS, they have not clearly demonstrated how they tie in with this
    national orientation framework in terms of socioeconomic development that would integrate
    global challenges; a thorough analysis of these strategies reveals numerous redundancies
    between the various plans and master plans; (iv) Compartmentalization: The approaches
    applied by the strategies are sub-sectoral and compartmentalized and do not integrate all of
    the dimensions of rural realities, which are multi-functional; (v) Lack of information: Those
    who benefit from governmental strategy documents as well as the services and structures
    meant to help implement them remain largely unaware of their content, which raises the
    issue of communicating this content, informing the public, and ensuring its application by
    the main stakeholders in the rural sector; and (vi) Poor strategy evaluation mechanisms:
    Although all adopted and implemented sectoral strategies include mechanisms designed to
    evaluate their interventions, very few are in fact used, with the exception of the PRS, which
    drafts an annual follow-up document.
32. As concerns documents incorporating expenditure estimates such as the Agriculture Master
    Plan (AMP, 2006-2015) and the Five-Year Agriculture Plan, 2013-2018), it is clear that they
    do not provide a sufficiently comprehensive basis for reaching detailed budget expenditure
    estimates for the objectives set in the context of budget planning and programming. The
    referenced documents have also become obsolete in that they are taken into account in the
    PNISR currently being drafted. It is hoped that the PNISR will provide all of the necessary
    details for the adequate planning and programming of sectoral public expenditures. It should
    be noted that the PNISR covers all sectoral public expenditures, including operating and
    staff expenditures.

1.3 Institutional Framework

33. Its central position has allowed Chad to be integrated into regional organizations such as the
    Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the Permanent Interstate
    Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), the Niger Basin Authority (NBA), the
    Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), and the Community of
    Sahelian-Saharan States (CENSAD).
34. The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (MoAE) and the Ministry of Livestock and
    Hydraulics (MoLH) along with their central directorates, regional delegations, and

                                                9
     organizations under their supervision are the lead agencies in terms of public expenditures in
     agriculture, rural development, and food security. These two ministries were created in April
     2014 through the merging of the following ministries: (i) MoAE: Ministry of Agriculture
     and Irrigation (covering agricultural development and hydro-agricultural improvements) and
     the Ministry of Environmental and Fishery Resources (covering water and forests, fishing,
     aquaculture, and agro-forestry); and (ii) MoLH: Ministry of Pastoral Development and
     Animal Production (covering livestock activities) and the Ministry of Rural and Urban
     Water Supplies (covering productive rural water systems and primarily pastoral wells). The
     other ministerial structures that intervene in the management and financing of the sector are:
     (i) the Ministry of Transportation (MoT) for feeder roads, and (iv) the Ministry of Spatial
     Planning (MoSP) for small-scale hydro-agricultural developments and other micro-projects
     as well as productive sub-projects as part of community development operations. Finally, the
     Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC) intervenes early on in the
     planning and programming process, and the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoF)
     intervenes in budget preparation and implementation.
35. Affiliated agencies and autonomous programs intervene alongside these ministerial
    structures. These include: (i) The National Institute for Agronomic Research and
    Development (INRAD), in charge of agricultural research and the production of plant
    material, the National Rural Development Agency (ONDR), in charge of the farm advisory
    system, the Lake Chad Development Corporation (SODELAC), in charge of the
    development of Lake Chad, and state organizations under the authority of the MoAE; (ii)
    Cotontchad, a state-owned corporation in charge of developing cotton production under the
    authority of the MoAE; (iii) the National Food Security Program (NFSP), an autonomous
    program within the MoAE; and (iv) the Livestock and Development Research Institute
    (IRED), an organization supervised by the MoLH.
36. Furthermore, a number of non-governmental stakeholders are also involved. Although their
    capacities vary, they are generally limited in terms of human resources as well as on a
    technical, financial, logistical, and managerial level. They include: (i) Professional
    Agricultural Organizations (PAO); (ii) civil society organizations (NGOs and associations),
    with many NGOs intervening randomly across the country, with varying activities and
    varying degrees of efficiency; (iii) microfinance institutions (MFI); and (iv) the private
    sector in the field of the production (including small producers) and marketing of
    agricultural products, agribusiness, and the supply of inputs (fertilizer and crop protection
    products) and agricultural equipment.
37. The final group of stakeholders in terms of agricultural and rural development and food
    security in Chad are donors. The socioeconomic turmoil that shook the country in 2008 led
    to the suspension of development aid by the majority of Development Partners (DP), and
    notably the World Bank. The national political accord and the legislative elections that
    followed restored the country’s political stability and renewed international cooperation. The
    donors involved in supporting the agricultural sector formed a Group of Technical and
    Financial Partners (GTFP), a dialogue, coordination, and interface group linking the
    Government and the DPs with a view to implementing the current National Development
    Plan (NDP, 2013-2015). The GTFP also supports the operations of the Comprehensive
    Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) within the framework of which the
    National Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR) is being prepared.
38. Weak institutions and a lack of coordination. The extremely limited capacities of the
    ministries and other sectoral public institutions impede the provision of quality services and
    obstruct the achievement of the sector’s development objectives. This results in low
    implementation rates for development programs. These substantially inadequate capacities

                                               10
     at all levels of the sector’s institutions constitutes the main challenge when it comes to
     implementing programs. These institutions are ill-equipped to conduct long-term strategic
     planning, elaborate sectoral policies, mobilize funding, ensure rapid and efficient
     procurement procedures, provide necessary goods and services in an efficient manner, and
     evaluate operational procedures and results. These low capacities in the key fields of
     planning, budget management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation undermine the
     effective implementation of national development programs and ultimately have a negative
     impact on development outcomes and the provision of services by sectoral public entities.
     Although limited progress has been made in the introduction of information systems to
     support planning, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation procedures, much
     remains to be done to strengthen the systems in place so that the government actors working
     in the sector are provided with the information they need in order to manage public funds.
39. The poor performance of the ministries and other sectoral public entities is affected by
    several factors. First of all, salaries and pensions in the sector remain low, as is the case for
    all public administrations. Interest in careers in the civil service is thus low. Secondly, the
    lack of modern and effective human resources management systems for recruitment and
    career management, including merit-based promotion and results-based management
    performance has resulted in the persistence of a public service culture that is inconsistent
    with accountability and initiative. Thirdly, political economic factors, including the
    prevalence of favoritism in the sector’s administration, have politicized the public servi ce
    and created rent-seeking conditions. For all of these reasons, civil servants in the sector
    remain part of the public administration, even when they reach an advanced age. Moreover,
    civil servants do not have access to quality continuous training or modern public
    administration systems that would allow them to work efficiently. This lack of available
    training in basic public administration operations limits the ability of current civil servants
    to upgrade their skills and of new recruits to develop theirs. Finally, the training currently
    available is not based on a real evaluation of training needs.

1.4 Recent Developments in Public Finance Management

40. Since the conclusion of the peace accord between Chad and Sudan in 2010, the country’s
    security situation has remained stable, despite the events that have occurred in the
    neighboring countries of Libya and Nigeria and more recently the Central African Republic.
    This situation presents a window of opportunity for the Government’s development efforts
    supported by the Development Partners to produce tangible results. However, Chad remains
    one of the poorest and less-developed countries in the world, with a per capita income of
    USD 740 in 2012 and is ranked 184th out of 186 countries on the 2013 Human
    Development Index (HDI). Overall governance remains poor. Progress has recently been
    made in the field of public finance management, notably with the adoption of the new
    Budget Law, the Government’s commitment to adopting the CEMAC’s public finance
    directives, and the operationalization of an integrated public finance management
    information system. Despite these efforts, public finance management remains extremely
    weak, as illustrated by the difficulties involved in collecting data for this Review.
41. In May 2013, Chad approved its Third National Development Plan (NDP) for the period
    2013-2015. To support the implementation of the NDP, a public finance management
    strategy was prepared for the period 2013-2016. In 2007, at the Government’s request, the
    World Bank approved a public finance management capacity-building project to the amount
    of USD 10 million. The objective of the project was to allow the Government to improve
    budget preparation and implementation as well as public finance control. In collaboration
    with other external partners, the project primarily financed the reorganization of the

                                                 11
financial services, the examination of budget and financial dispositions as well as public
finance methods and procedures, the strengthening of management tools, especially the
computerized expenditure chain, and the development and training of the human resources
working in the field of public finance management. After a slow start and a weak initial
performance, the project’s implementation improved over the years to the p oint where the
World Bank is contemplating granting an additional USD 10 million in financing for the
project. This effort complements those of other development partners, notably the African
Development Bank, the European Union, the French Cooperation, the United States, and the
IMF.

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH


42. This chapter presents the methodological approach on which this report is based with respect
    to: (i) defining agricultural expenditures based on the COFOG classification, which has been
    adopted by NEPAD and allows for international comparisons on a homogenous basis; and
    (ii) introducing the ministries involved, namely the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment
    (MoAE) and the Ministry of Livestock and Hydraulics (MoLH), and within these ministries,
    the central and decentralized structures and the administrative, economic, and operational
    breakdown of the expenditures; and (iii) the type of expenditures taken into consideration
    within the ministries concerned at both the central and decentralized level and as regards the
    NFSP and the organizations under its jurisdiction.8

2.1 Definition of Agricultural Expenditures

43. COFOG Expenditures. The expenditures taken into consideration in this review correspond
    to the categories defined by the United Nations’ Classification of Government Occupations
    (COGOG), which NEPAD has adopted. This classification, also adopted by NEPAD for the
    CAADP, allows for comparisons at the international level on a homogenous basis. In
    particular, it assists in evaluating the achievement of the Government’s objectives, notably
    and principally the objective of 10% of public expenditures being devoted to agriculture in
    the context of the Maputo Declaration. Specifically, the budgetary data taken into
    consideration corresponds to actual expenditures (and not to budgetary allocations) in the
    extended agricultural sector, including the domains of agriculture (vegetal and animal
    production), forestry (forest production activities, excluding forest conservation activities,
    for example in the context of classified forests), and hunting (including non-wood forestry
    products) and fishing. These expenditures include food security expenditures, interpreted
    broadly as the extent to which such expenditures are structural (and not cyclical). Food
    assistance per se is not covered. The rural development expenditures taken into
    consideration affect productive agricultural space (i.e., hydro-agricultural developments,
    pastoral water projects). However, social-related expenditures are not included (i.e., drinking
    water under the village water system classification). It should be noted that rural road
    expenditures are not included in the COFOG nomenclature.
44. Budgetary Commitments and Disbursements. The expenditures analyzed in this Review
    correspond to the commitments subject to financial review by the Ministry of Finance and
    Budget (MoF). These commitments, which are included9 in the Computerized Expenditure
    System (CES)10 database, are considered the best reflection of budget implementation. In
    fact, data on disbursements proper (source: Public Treasury) could not be obtained except for
    external financing for investments (source: MoPIC, corresponding to disbursements reported
    by funding partners). The budget implementation rate was calculated on the basis of
    disbursements in relation to budgetary allocations corresponding to the Supplementary


8
     Note: Where no data source is listed below the tables in this report, the source is the personal collection
     or compilation of the authors.
9
     These semi-public companies are not to be confused with government-controlled organizations or
     independent programs, which come fully under the MoAE and MoLH budgets.
10
     The CES was established in 2006. It integrated data from 2005 and 2004 but not 2003. For that year, data
     from the annual budgetary fascicles corresponding to the budgetary contributions were used. In fact,
     these expenditures (commitments or disbursements) are not included in the fascicles and could not be
     obtained elsewhere (i.e., from the Public Treasury).

                                                       13
       Budget Law (LFR).11 These budgetary allocations are not computerized and were obtained
       through manual transcription from the MoF annual budget fascicles. The expenditures of
       semi-public companies under the jurisdiction of the two sectorial ministries (MoAE and
       MoLH), which are not included in the ministerial budgets, were not taken into account. The
       same is true for the Cotontchad expenditures (including its expenditures on fertilizer and
       phytosanitary products paid for by producers). In accordance with NEPAD directives
       adopted under the CAADP, only subsidies granted in certain years to cover debts and
       exceptional expenditures were included.
45. Budgetary and Off-Budget Analysis. The analysis was first performed on a strictly
    budgetary basis. It was established by: (i) using the budgetary fascicles containing all of the
    expenditures included in the Initial Budget Law (LFI) and the Supplementary Budget Law
    (LFR) (complete 2003-2012 series), and (ii) by using the Computerized Expenditure System
    (CES) containing the expenditure commitments (for the period beginning 2004). Data from
    semi-public organizations, whose budgets are not reported in the fascicles or the CES, were
    used to supplement the analysis. Finally, the analysis incorporates expenditures from
    externally financed projects whose data were provided by the Office of International
    Cooperation of the MoPIC (see the following paragraph). MoPIC sends the comparative
    figures to the MoF. These are accounted for as off-budget for the purposes of this Review.
46. Special Treatment of Investments. Calculating investment expenditures using the COFOG
    classification required a determination of the proportion of these expenditures devoted
    strictly to productive activities (vegetal and animal) (see Chapter V). This required special
    treatment for integrated rural development projects as these projects are founded on the
    principle that rural development requires combined interventions in its productive and social
    planning and in basic infrastructures. They thus include highly diverse activities covering
    social aspects (health and construction of health centers, education and construction of
    schools, drinking water and construction of wells and drilling) and infrastructure activities
    (i.e., rural roads) that are not included in the COFOG nomenclature. A study of a
    representative sample of integrated rural development projects financed by various funding
    partners12 provided an approximate estimate of 35% of expenditures for these types of
    projects that met the criteria for the definition of COFOG expenditures. The MoPIC data
    were adjusted on this basis. However, it was not possible to proceed in the same manner with
    calculating internally financed COFOG investment expenditures due to the fact that the CES
    does not define expenditures by project. In the interest of clarity, it was decided to retain a
    fraction of expenditures similar to external financing corresponding annually to a ratio
    between COFOG expenditures and total expenditures.
47. Consistency in the Comparison of Budget Allocations and Budget Expenditures. This
    Review draws a parallel between budget allocations and disbursements. These classifications
    are similar to the definition of allocations and expenditures and can thus be legitimately
    compared. However, a review of the data shows that: (i) a portion of the budget allocations
    for certain classifications, in particular external investment financing, appears to have been
    underestimated (it does not appear that all projects receiving external financing are
    included); and (ii) on the other hand, as mentioned in paragraph 29 above, it was deemed
    preferable to use off-budget expenditures for investments receiving external funding as the
    expenditure line item. This sometimes gives unexpected results, such as a COFOG

11
     The Supplementary Budget Law (LFR) approved during the fiscal year, generally in August and
     September, reflects the final budget allocations for a given year. It amends the Initial Budget Law (LFI)
     approved before the start of the fiscal year and containing original budget allocations.
12
     See the list of all projects receiving external financing in Annex 2. The sample corresponds to projects
     financed by Switzerland and the European Union for which detailed information was available.

                                                      14
     expenditure implementation rate greater than 100% (see paragraph 57 below).
48. Review Period. The period used for the analysis of budget data in agriculture, rural
    development, and food security for this Review varies by classification: (i) the budget
    allocations correspond to the Supplementary Budget Law (LFR) and cover the 2003-2012
    period (10 years); (ii) budget expenditures correspond to commitments, with the comparative
    data being provided by the Computerized Expenditure System (CES) and available for the
    2004-2012 period only; (iii) the data for externally financed investments cover the entire ten-
    year period (2003–2012); and (iv) expenditures for affiliated agencies are included for the
    2005-2012 period only because the NFSP, which constitutes the principal expenditure item,
    was not created until 2005.

2.2 Ministries Concerned

49. The Two Sectoral Ministries. In Chad, expenditures corresponding to the COFOG
    nomenclature appear in the budgets of two separate ministries: (i) the Ministry of Agriculture
    and Environment (MoAE), and (ii) the Ministry of Livestock and Hydraulics (MoLH). Both
    ministries were newly created in April 2014 through the combination of the following
    ministries; (i) MoAE: Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation and Ministry of Environment
    and Fishery Resources; and (ii) MoLH: Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal
    Production and Ministry of Rural and Urban Water.
50. The expenditures used in this Review on a COFOG basis correspond to the following budget
    expenditures of these ministries: (i) MoAE: all agricultural and irrigation expenditures
    (formerly the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation); for environmental expenditures
    (formerly the Ministry of Environment and Fishery Resources), only expenditures for
    fishing, aquaculture, and agro-forestry are used; and (ii) MoLH: all expenditures for animal
    production (formerly the Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal Production); for
    water, (formerly the Ministry of Rural and Urban Water), only expenditures for productive
    rural water (i.e., essential rural wells) are used, while expenditures for urban water and
    sanitation and those for rural drinking water are excluded.
51. Respective Weight of both Sectoral Ministries in Terms of Personnel. Table 4 shows the
    personnel of the two sectoral ministries. The MoAE’s personnel of 1,689 (or 65% of the total
    for both sectoral ministries) confirms its dominance compared with the MoLH. It is also the
    ministry with the most sworn officers (military) due to its responsibility for monitoring
    protected areas and classified forests. The personnel of both sectoral ministries represents
    3.9% of the total number of civil servants.

52. Other Ministries. Rural road expenditures included in the budget of the Ministry of
    Infrastructure and Transportation (MoIT) are not ignored by this Review but are treated
    separately, for two reasons: (i) since they are not included in the analysis using CAADP’s
    COFOG methodology, their inclusion would make international comparisons impossible,
    especially, as will be shown later, they represent significant amounts in Chad; and (ii) for the
    period under review, they have not always been the responsibility of the MoIT (before 2007,
    they were the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation). The other ministry
    involved is the Ministry of Spatial Planning, Decentralization, and Local Freedoms (MoSP)
    for certain projects such as community development projects and spatial planning or regional
    development, of which certain components cover agricultural, pastoral, or fishing
    production. However, these projects are not far-reaching and are not therefore included in
    this Review.

2.3 General Context of Agricultural Budget Allocations in Chad

53. The budget allocations of each ministry included in the annual Budget Law break down in
    the following manner in relation to the internal ministerial structures:
       a. Central level: Cabinet, General Secretariat (GS), and Central Administration
          (Administrative and Financial Directorate – AFD, Directorate of Economic Planning and
          Programming (DEPP), including statistics and monitoring, and Technical Directorates;13

       b. Decentralized level: Regional Delegations (RD)14 located at the regional level, prefecture
          or sub-prefecture level, or the inter-regional level according to the ministries involved;
          and

       c. Autonomous Semi-Private Organizations: For the two main ministries involved in
          agriculture and rural development, these organizations and programs are as follows:
          ITRAD, ONDR, ONASA, SODELAC, NFSP for the MoAE, and IRED for the MoLH.

54. The Cabinet, the GS, the Central Directorates, and the RDs have separate budget lines for
    their contractual personal expenses, operating costs, and investments from both internal and
    external sources. Civil service personnel made available to ministries come directly under
    the GS budget, which is accounted for globally for the entire civil service at the level of the
    Payroll Office of the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoF). The budget for affiliated
    agencies and autonomous programs is included in the transfers and subsidies budget item,
    which constitutes their main source of financing.15 Under this line item, these entities pay for
    their operating costs, contractual personal costs, and a portion of their investments. As with
    the central directorates and the RDs, civil service personnel made available come directly
    under the GS budget of the relevant ministry.




13
     To pare the list down to only COFOG expenditures, expenditures associated with certain technical
     directorates were not included.
14
     The MoAE has regional delegations in each of the country’s 23 regions, with services and branches at
     lower levels (prefecture and sub-prefecture). The regional delegations of the other ministries
     (particularly the MoLH) often cover several regions.
15
     Their other resources come from their own profits from the sale of goods and services.

                                                    16
CHAPTER 3. CHANGES IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURES IN AGRICULTURE

55. This chapter first presents overall changes in the country’s total spending. It then details
    changes in spending in the agricultural sector as defined by COFOG at both current and
    constant prices.16 Changes in expenditures and the execution rate for the sector can thus be
    tracked against those same figures for total public expenditures. Calculations for COFOG-
    defined agricultural expenditures as a percentage of total expenditures, agricultural GDP,
    and overall GDP are also provided. These calculations permit country-by-country
    comparisons based strictly on COFOG-defined expenditures. The same percentages are then
    calculated for total spending by the two ministries in the agricultural sector using the
    COFOG definition of expenditures and the definition of expenditures used by the Chad
    government and some donors, which includes expenditures in agriculture, rural
    development, and food security.

3.1 Changes in Total Public Spending

56. Budgeted Funds. Graph 1 shows the change in the Chad government’s total budgeted funds
    for the 2003-2012 period. These budgeted funds show an upward trend for this period,
    growing on average by 19% per year at current prices. This growth continued into 2013
    since according to the supplementary budget law (LFR), the budgeted funds for that year
    were 4.6% higher than those of 2012. Total funds fell in 2009 due to: (i) the world economic
    crisis, which had a negative impact on Chad’s petroleum revenues; and (ii) socio-political
    instability, which led to a general economic downturn in the country. These two factors
    resulted in lower investment, especially externally financed investment.

    budget law compared with actual budget execution (including off-budget externally
    financed investment expenditures), and Table 4 shows the national budget execution rate

       during the 2003-2012 period, including and excluding externally financed investment
       expenditures. Over this period, the average budget execution rate was 92% when externally
       financed investment disbursements are taken into account. This rate rose consistently from
       2003 to 2010 due in part to improved budgetary management in the country. The average
       budget execution rate exceeded 100% in 2009 and 2010 but fell considerably (to below
       41%) in 2011. This decline can be explained by the contraction in available funds imposed
       by the country’s austerity measures. The average budget execution rate returned to a near
       average level of 85% in 2012. The execution rate excluding externally financed
       disbursements tracked the same progression. However, this execution rate averaged 72.4%
       only during the period under review.

3.2 Changes in Spending by the Two Agricultural Sector Ministries

58. This section presents the change in LFR-budgeted funds and commitments (CES) and
    disbursements (MoPIC) related to agriculture (as defined by COFOG) by the MoAE and the
    MoLH using data drawn from sections of the MoF’s annual budget and from the CES.
    Included in these commitments are COFOG-defined expenditures for externally financed
    agricultural investment not included in the CES (off-budget expenditures) and provided by
    the MoPIC. These investment expenditures are detailed in Chapter IV.
59. Budgeted Funds. Graph 3 shows the change of overall LFR-budgeted funds for the two
    agricultural sector ministries (MoAE and MoLH) for the 2003-2012 period. The budgeted
    funds of these ministries show an upward trend for this period, growing on average by
    23.3% per year in current prices, which was slightly higher than the average yearly growth
    for the national budget. This growth continued into 2013 since the budgeted funds (LFR, in
    current prices) for that year was 17.8% higher than that of 2012. Total funds fell in 2008 and
    again in 2009 to a greater extent than the national budget due to: (i) the world economic
    crisis, which had a negative impact on Chad’s petroleum revenues; and (ii) socio-political
    instability that led to a general economic downturn in the country. These two factors were
    responsible for a decline in agricultural expenditures that was greater than the decline in
    total public expenditures, especially for externally financed expenditures.

60. Budget Execution. Graph 4 shows the budgeted funds relative to commitments, and
    Table 5 shows the national budget execution rate for the 2003-2012 period. Over
    this period, the average budget execution rate of the MoAE and the MoLH was
    87.3%, noticeably less than the average execution rate for the national budget,
    which reached 91.8%. This rate showed an upward trend but with wide fluctuations
    from one year to the next. At 100.5%, the execution rate was very high in 2010,
    though it fell to 71.7% the following year as a result of the contraction in available
    funds, as prescribed by the country’s austerity measures. However, it grew robustly
    in 2012 when external financing resumed. It should be noted that the execution rate
    excluding externally financed investments remained very low for this period (at
    58.9%) and noticeably lower than the national budget execution rate (at 72.4%).

   3.3 Summary of Public Expenditures in Agriculture

   61. This section presents a summary of the expenditures of the two agricultural sector ministries
       (MoAE and MoLH), calculated first using the COFOG definition of expenditures and then
       using a definition that includes expenditures in agriculture, rural development, and food
       security (i.e., the total budgeted and off-budget expenditures of these ministries). This
       makes it possible to calculate the two sector ministries’ expenditures as a percentage of total
       public expenditures and to make other relevant calculations, such as MoAE and MoLH
       expenditures as a percentage of agricultural GDP, and overall GDP. These percentages can
       be used to make country-by-country comparisons: (i) based strictly on COFOG-defined
       expenditures (which is useful for meeting the objectives of the Maputo Declaration on
       Agriculture and Food security and other budgetary objectives); and (ii) based on a broader

                                                                   20

            expenditures, using the criteria of some donors such as the FAO and the Chad government.

      62. MoAE and MoLH Spending as a Share of Total Public Spending. COFOG-defined
          expenditures by the two agricultural sector ministries as a share of total public expenditures
          are presented in Table 7 below. This table also shows these expenditures as a percentage of
          agricultural GDP and overall GDP, which can be used for country-by-country comparisons
          of COFOG-defined expenditures (see Table 8 below). Using this classification, expenditures
          were calculated based on sectoral budgets net of revenue from affiliated agencies and net of
          ONASA food aid expenditures (considered ineligible under COFOG). Off-budget externally
          financed expenditures are included in the budgeted investment expenditures.

        63. Over the 2003-2012 period, public COFOG-defined expenditures in agriculture represented:
            (i) 5.7% of total public expenditures; (ii) 4.1% of agricultural GDP; and (iii) 1.1% of GDP.
            These figures put Chad at the bottom of the bracket for Sub-Saharan countries in terms of
            support to the agricultural sector when using COFOG definitions. To achieve levels of
            support consistent with the top of the low-income country bracket, i.e., 8% of agricultural
            GDP, and to meet the Maputo target of 10% of national expenditures devoted to agriculture,
            Chad must double agricultural expenditures, with net commitments of CFAF 120 billion per
            year. Yet this would still fall short of covering the proactive needs of the ongoing National
            Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR), which is estimated at CFAF 2,800 billion for the
            2014-2012 period, or approximately CFAF 400 billion per year.17

      65. Using this broader classification, the share of expenditures in agriculture, rural
          development, and food security rises to 10.26% when compared to the national budget, to
          7.2% when compared to agriculture and livestock’s share of GDP, and 1.93% when
          compared to total GDP. This puts Chad at the upper end of the lower-income bracket of
          Sub-Saharan countries. However, this comparison is not valid since these figures are
          calculated using different bases.

       CHAPTER 4. COMPOSITION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURES IN AGRICULTURE

       66. This chapter describes the administrative, economic, and functional composition of total
           public and COFOG-defined expenditures by the two agricultural sector ministries. These
           expenditures are compared, and the various headings are analyzed. The chapter then details
           how expenditures are allocated at the national and subnational level. The accounts of
           affiliated agencies and the NFSP are reviewed at the end of the chapter.

       4.1 Administrative composition of public spending

       Distribution of Budget Resources between the Two Agricultural Sector Ministries
       67. Share of Budgeted Funding Allocated to Each Agricultural Sector Ministry. Table 10
           compares the budgeted funding (at current prices) allocated to the two agricultural sector
           ministries for the 2003-2012 period. The predominance of the MoAE emerges clearly from
           this comparison. The MoAE’s budgeted funding accounted for 66% of total funding for
           sector ministries, whereas the MoLH’s budgeted funding made up only 34%. It should be
           noted that if spending by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI) and the
           former Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal Production (MoPDAP) are considered
           agricultural and livestock expenditures (respectively), the MoAI’s share is 79%, and the
           MoPDAP’s share is 21% of total funding allocated to the sector. These alternative fi gures
           confirm the predominance of budget allocations to agriculture relative to livestock.

       National and Subnational Distribution of Budgeted Funding (Non-Wage Current Expenses
       and Payroll)

       68. The national and subnational breakdown of budgeted funding for agricultural sector
           ministries is shown in Table 11 below. These allocations were calculated using LFR data for
           the former Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI) and the former Ministry of Pastoral
           Development and Animal Production (MoPDAP). These figures were used because a
           national/subnational breakdown was not available from the CES for the MoAE and the
           MoLH. Even when using this workaround, an analysis of the data still shows that resources
           remain excessively centralized. For the 2003-2012 period, 96% of total budgeted funds for
           sector ministries was spent on the payroll and the non-wage current expenses of central
           administrations, and only 4% was spent by agencies overseen by the Regional Delegations.

 expenditures by affiliated agencies were not taken into account, except for salaries for seconded personnel
 paid out of the payroll budget of sector ministries.

 Affiliated Agencies and the NFSP

 69. Affiliated Agencies and the NFSP. The following are the MoAE-affiliated agencies: (i) the
     National Office for Rural Development (ONDR), which provides agricultural extension; (ii)
     the Institute for Agricultural Research for Development of Chad, (ITRAD); (iii) the National
     Bureau of Food Security (ONASA), which provides food aid; and (iv) the Lake Chad
     Development Corporation, (SODELAC), tasked with the development of Lake Chad. Other
     agencies affiliated with the MoAE are Cotontchad and the National Food Security Program
     (NFSP). Affiliated with the MoLH is Chad’s Livestock and Development Research Institute
     (IRED). The following tables show the percentage of funds allocated to each of these
     affiliated agencies as a share of total funds allocated to its ministry and as a share of total
     funds allocated to the agricultural sector ministries combined. Revenues from ITRAD and
     NFSP are also presented. Detailed descriptions for the NFSP and each of the affiliated
     agencies are then provided.

 Note: The average is calculated based on the eight years between 2005 and 2012 due to the fact that the
 NFSP was only launched in 2005. NFSP’s commitments for 2012 were estimated conservatively at CFAF
 25 billion out of a planned budget of CFAF 28 billion. In fact, the level of commitments in the first quarter
 was already CFAF 13 billion, and NFSP’s spending has always closely matched allocated funds.

 70. NFSP. The National Rural Sector Investment Program (NFSP) shows by far the largest
     budget expenditures among affiliated agencies, at an average of 13.1% of total combined
     MoAE and MoLH expenditures, or close to CFAF 10 billion per year for the 2005-2007
     period. It should be noted that unlike affiliated agencies, NFSP is not a legal entity but an
     independent program created in 2007 to directly address the issue of food security. Its broad
     and ambitious objective is to contribute to eliminating hunger and to encourage the creation
     of an environment favorable to food and nutritional security for the entire population without
     discrimination at the national level. The work carried out by the NFSP seeks to sustainably
     increase productivity and production levels combined with measures likely to guarantee the
     population's access to food while preserving natural resources. The NFSP is considered both
     an essential tool for implementing the PRS in the rural sector and an immediate response to
     the issues of rural food insecurity and poverty. This program also forms a strategic
     framework for promoting the overall objectives of rural development geared specifically
     toward establishing food security in Chad by 2015. The cost of the first phase of the NFSP
     (2005-2012) was approximately CFAF 67 billion. Its strategic pillars are: (i) the

                                                      26
    intensification and diversification of crop, livestock, and fishery production; (ii) the
    development of natural resources; (iii) the creation of a national food security reserve and the
    implementation of a monitoring and alert system; (iv) health and nutrition; and (v)
    communication, including a geographical information system.
71. The NFSP is financed out of the MoAE’s budget. Spending by the NFSP represents 15.6% of
    the MoAE’s total expenditures for the 2005-2012 period and covers a wide range of activities
    (see Table 14 below). However, the NFSP does not directly carry out these activities. Other
    agencies (e.g., the ONDR) are tasked with actual implementation, or the private sector is
    called upon to provide subcontractors, such as those hired for hydro-agricultural projects.
    The NFSP also purchases equipment and inputs, which it resells at subsidized prices to
    agencies working with it, thereby generating revenues that help it meet its current expenses.
    The largest source of revenues is derived from payments by the ONDR from reselling inputs
    (i.e., approximately 6,000 metric tonnes for the 2005-2012 period) and agricultural
    equipment to producers. These revenues are not transferred to the Treasury but directly to
    accounts managed by the NFSP itself. These funds alleviate problems with the unavailability
    of funds with which to pay suppliers and transporters and therefore avoid delays in
    distributing products and equipment countrywide.

72. ONASA. The National Food Security Agency (ONASA) is an MoAE-affiliated agency
    created in 2001 to oversee food aid. With expenditures averaging CFAF 4.8 billion per year
    for the 2005-2012 period, the agency receives the second largest amount of funding from the
    MoAE, just behind the NFSP. Spending by ONASA represented 7.8% of MoAE expenditures
    and 6.6% of total MoAE and MoLH combined expenditures for the 2005-2012 period.
    However, ONASA provides only stop-gap food assistance to populations in need. Its
    activities therefore cannot be classified as structural in that they are not designed to support
    production prices or prevent production surpluses that cannot be absorbed by the market. For
    this reason, expenditures related to ONASA's activities must be excluded according to
    COFOG definitions. These expenditures were therefore deducted from the total COFOG-
    defined expenditures attributable to the agricultural sector.
73. COTONTCHAD. Cotton remains a high-priority sector in Chad given its importance in
    reducing poverty and in developing cotton-growing regions (see Box 1 below). Cotontchad is
    a state-owned enterprise that manages the cotton industry. It is administratively and
    financially independent and is authorized to generate profits. Cotontchad receives funding
    from the national budget only during very specific periods, when it requires government

                                                   27
       funds to cover deficits or to repay debt. This was the case for the 2005-2007 period, during
       which Cotontchad received total funds of almost CFAF 40 billion, with CFAF 21.7 billion
       disbursed in 2007 alone.
     Box 1: Continuing Crises in the Cotton Sub-Sector
     The cotton sub-sector, which dominated the rural economy for many years, appears to be
     emerging from a deep and persistent crisis. Three out of four cotton producers are poor. During
     the past decade, cotton production dropped dramatically, falling from 270,000 metric tonnes of
     cotton seed in 1997 to 180,000 metric tonnes in 2005 and continuing to fall to 47,000 metric
     tonnes in 2009. Production then recovered slightly, with an estimated volume of 105,000
     metric tonnes in 2013 and a projected production of 130,000 metric tonnes for 2014. However,
     the challenges faced by the cotton sector in the past years are still present today, including: (i)
     the fall in world cotton prices accompanied by a strengthening of the CFA franc against the US
     dollar; (ii) the volume of outstanding payments from producers’ organizations to Coton tchad,
     and (iii) institutional dysfunction within Cotontchad (e.g., payment delays, provision of
     inappropriate inputs, and delays in transferring cotton to factories). Despite these challenges,
     the major problem facing the industry is the bottleneck in production caused by low
     productivity resulting from obsolete agricultural practices and poor-quality seed. Many cotton
     producers are not only poor but also heavily indebted. These producers will gradually migrate
     to other sectors and seek to diversify their production toward more profitable crops. Although
     there is an urgent need for a plan of action, structural reforms remain unmet.


74. ONDR, SODELAC, ITRAD, and IRED. These agencies spend far less than the NFSP,
    ONASA, or Cotontchad, with combined expenditures for the 2005-2012 period representing
    only 4.7% of total combined MoAE and MoLH expenditures. In addition to the funds these
    agencies receive for current and capital expenditures, two of them, ONDR and ITRAD, also
    generate their own revenues from providing services (e.g., ONDR helps manage producers
    within specific projects as well as providing other services) or the sale of equipment and
    products (e.g., ONDR sells tractors on behalf of NFSP, and ITRAD sells pre-basic or basic
    seed). ITRAD also generates revenues from research or partnership contracts, as with
    CGIAR or foreign foundations. Revenues generated by ONDR and ITRAD are held directly
    in their own accounts and are not recorded in the national budget. Although these revenues
    constitute only a minor portion of their resources, they are important for these agencies in
    terms of availability of funds. These off-budget revenues were deducted from budgeted funds
    in calculating net COFOG-defined expenditures.18

75. Graphs 5 and 6 and Figures 2 and 3 below show (respectively) the economic composition of:
    (i) total public expenditures, and (ii) COFOG-defined expenditures in agriculture under four
    headings: Capital Investments, Transfers, Non-wage Current Expenses, and Payroll (while

     Note that the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative implements a system for
     tracking expenditures in technological research and development in agriculture under the aegis of the
     Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Further information can be
     obtained at www.asti.cgiar.org. In terms of funds received by research agencies, research in specific areas
     requested by CGIAR in each country and led by the national research system (represented by ITRAD
     and IRED in Chad) should be noted. Spending associated with these activities is reimbursed at the
     national level by CGIAR, thus constituting off-budget revenues. Their amount could not be obtained for
     ITRAD and IRED. However, these amounts are low and do not affect the overall results.

         Debt is also a heading in the national budget). As in the previous chapter, included in these
         commitments were COFOG-defined expenditures for externally financed agricultural
         investments not included in the CES (off-budget expenditures based on data provided by the
         MoPIC). Externally funded investment expenditures (COFOG and non-COFOG) are detailed
         in Chapter V.

Wage and Non-wage Current Expenses
76. The payroll of agricultural sector ministries represents 12% of total sector expenditures,
    whereas non-wage current expenses represent only 4%. These ratios compare unfavorably
    with spending at the national level, where the payroll constitutes 21% of total public
    expenditures and non-wage current expenses constitute 9%, demonstrating that sector
    ministries are relatively less well treated. It should be noted that, as for the entire public

                                                           30
    sector in Chad, salaries for sector ministry personnel remain extremely low. Moreover, the
    public sector payroll is overloaded and aging. It should also be noted that very little is
    devoted to non-wage current expenses in these ministries. This extremely low level of non-
    wage current expenditures is a result of penury within administrative services, especially in
    terms of means of communications and transportation. Low salaries and the shortfall in
    operational resources in sector ministries mean that employees are unmotivated and lack the
    means to carry out assigned tasks properly. As detailed earlier in this report, affiliated
    agencies keep any revenues they generate. These funds are essential for mitigating the lack of
    funds for operational expenses, delays in budget disbursement, and economic downturns
    (such as in 2011 and 2012, during which operational funds all but dried up).
Transfers
77. Transfers include all funds allocated to affiliated agencies and the NFSP for current and
    capital expenditures. The economic breakdown of expenditures by agricultural sector
    ministries shows that current transfers constitute a relatively large share (40%) of total sector
    expenditures. It should be noted that the percentage of current transfers as a share of total
    expenditures is far greater for agricultural sector ministries than for the government as a
    whole (20%), even though their percentage of investment as a share of total expenditures is
    comparable (43%). However, these figures are deceptive. In fact, for both agricultural sector
    ministries, current transfers are mostly used to finance capital investments. This is the case
    for the MoAE, whose expenditures include current transfers to the NFSP, which spends
    approximately 90% of its budget on capital investments. The other MoAE-affiliated agencies
    (ONDR, ITRAD, SODELAC, and IRED) all spend approximately 20% of their budgets on
    capital investments. The percentage of current transfers corresponding to capital investments
    can therefore be estimated at approximately 40% for the MoAE and the MoLH combined.
    Thus, spending on capital investments by agricultural sector ministries is more accurately
    estimated at 66% rather than 40% of total sector expenditures. This adjusted breakdown of
    the economic composition of agricultural sector expenditures is shown in Figure 7 below.
    This is noticeably higher than the 43% of total public expenditures spent on capital
    investments unless a large proportion of transfers from other ministries are also used for
    capital investments.

Capital Investment Expenditures

78. Methodology for Calculating Capital Investment Expenditures. This section deals
    separately with capital investment expenditures due to the complexity of working with data
    from different sources (i.e., LFR, CES, MoPIC). To arrive at the amount of externally
    financed investment expenditures as defined by COFOG, the percentage of spending on
    economic activities (crop- and livestock-related) as a share of rural development
    expenditures had to be first determined. In fact, projects falling under the heading of Rural
    Development combine elements of production, social welfare, and basic infrastructure.
    Projects whose primary focus is social welfare (e.g., construction of health clinics, schools,
    boreholes, and wells) or infrastructure (e.g., development of feeder roads) are excluded under
    COFOG. A review of a representative sample of integrated rural development projects funded
    by various donors provided an estimate that 35% of spending on these types of projects meet
    the COFOG criteria.
79. It was not possible to use the same methodology to calculate internally financed capital
    investment expenditures as defined by COFOG since the CES does not provide expenditure
    data for individual projects. For this reason, it was not possible to tease out COFOG-defined
    expenditures by applying a coefficient to total expenditures. To simplify, it was decided that
    the percentage of COFOG-compliant expenditures as a share of externally financed
    investment expenditures would also be used to calculate the percentage of COFOG-
    compliant expenditures as a share of internally financed investment expenditures.
80. Change in Total Externally Financed Investment Expenditures. Table 15 and Graph 7
    below show COFOG-defined expenditures for externally financed investment for the 2004-
    2012 period. These estimates were calculated by subtracting from total investment
    expenditures (source: MoPIC, see Annex 1) any expenditures considered non-eligible
    according to COFOG's definitions (i.e., 65% of total integrated rural development
    expenditures, expenditures on feeder roads, food aid, etc.). Table 15 also shows the
    percentage of COFOG-defined expenditures as a share of total investment expenditures.

 81. Table 15 and Graph 7 show that COFOG-defined capital investment expenditures did not
     grow significantly over the ten years under review. Expenditures fluctuated considerably,
     from CFAF 22.4 billion in 2005, nearly halving to CFAF 11.4 billion in 2009, then strongly
     rebounding to CFAF 26 billion in 2012. It should be noted that the percentage of COFOG-
     defined expenditures as a share of total public spending remained stable at around 45%, with
     a small standard deviation.
 82. Breakdown of COFOG-Defined MoAE and MoLH Expenditures for Externally Financed
     Investments. Table 16 shows the breakdown of COFOG-defined expenditures for externally
     financed investments by agricultural sector ministries. These figures again underline the
     MoAE’s predominance. Accounting for 76% of total COFOG-defined expenditures for
     externally financed investments, the MoAE is allocated the lion’s share of budgeted
     resources. This imbalance in externally financed investment expenditures in favor of the
     MoAE should be corrected since it does not correspond to a larger contribution by agriculture
     to overall GDP.

 83. Internally Financed Investment Expenditures. COFOG-defined expenditures for internally
     financed investment appears in Table 17 below. According to the chosen calculation method,
     these expenditures were arrived at by multiplying total internally financed investment

  * This percentage was used to calculate COFOG-defined expenditures for internally financed investments
  based on total internal investment expenditure data from CES. Using this method, this amount represents
  the percentage of COFOG-defined expenditures for externally financed investments as a share of total
  externally financed investment expenditures, for which data were provided by the MoPIC (see Table 13).

  84. Internally financed investment expenditures for the MoAE and MoLH grew consistently over
      the 2004-2012 period, except in 2011, when the budget contracted sharply. Commitments for
      2012 were considerably higher than for previous years. This undoubtedly points to the Chad
      government’s desire to increase the volume of investment in the agricultural sector.
  85. Total Investment Expenditures. These expenditures appear in Table 18 below, and are
      broken down by source of financing (external or internal) in Graph 8.

      86. Expenditures on capital investments by the two agricultural sector ministries remained stable
          during most of the 2005- 2011 period but rose dramatically in 2012. Internal financing for
          these expenditures grew considerably from 2008 onward, accounting for one-third of the
          total. This reflects the Government’s increasing capacity to finance its development thanks to
          domestic resources generated by petroleum and natural gas revenues. However, it also
          reflects changing donor attitudes, which believe that national counterparts should pay for a
          greater portion of investment spending.

88. Graph 9 shows that for the period under review, capital expenditures grew at the same rate as
    current expenditures. However, given the correlation between these two types of
    expenditures, this could not make up for insufficient funding for current expenditures over
    the period in review. This persistent shortage of funds for current expenses should be
    corrected.

        90. Comparison of COFOG-Defined and Total Expenditures by the Agricultural Sector with
            Agricultural GDP and Livestock GDP. The 21% increase in expenditures by the agricultural
            sector ministries was greater than the 14.7% increase in agricultural GDP, which
            demonstrates the notable effort by the Chad government to address the sector’s needs.
            Nevertheless, Table 21 shows that budgeted allocations favored agriculture over livestock,
            with agriculture garnering 4.5% of total expenditures while contributing 12.9% to combined
            agricultural and livestock GDP, whereas livestock received only 1.3% of total expenditures
            but contributed 13.6% to combined agricultural and livestock GDP. This unjustified bias
            should be corrected.

CHAPTER 5. EFFICIENCY OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

91.   This chapter provides an overview of the budget cycle as it applies in Chad for
      expenditures on agriculture, rural development, and food security. It identifies problems
      and bottlenecks and makes recommendations for each stage of this cycle.

5.1 Introduction

92.   Weak budget estimation and implementation capacity. The average implementation rate of
      the national budget for the agricultural sector ministries in the period 2004-2012 was
      slightly higher than 80%. Although the situation appears to have improved recently, this
      low implementation rate indicates managerial weaknesses in these ministries. Moreover,
      there have been constant modifications to the Initial Budget Law year after year. On
      average, the Supplementary Budget Law contains much lower amounts than the Initial
      Budget Law. The difference in these amounts between the Initial and the Supplementary
      Budget Laws indicates in particular an inability in the Ministry of Finance and Budget
      (MoF) to accurately estimate revenues and to allocate expenditures in strict accordance
      with sector priorities. This also underscores weaknesses in drawing up macroeconomic
      projections and forecasts at the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation
      (MoPIC), resulting in unrealistic or unreliable revenue forecasts, and to an allocation of
      sectoral budget appropriations that is inconsistent with real priorities.
93.   Causes and problems. The implementation of public expenditures by the agricultural sector
      ministries is affected by three major problems: (i) cumbersome procurement procedures;
      despite the large number of improvements that have resulted from the Action Plan for the
      Modernization of Public Finances (PAMFIP), current procurement procedures are lengthy
      (4 to 6 months at least) and inefficient; (ii) breakdowns in communication between donors
      and project managers, and in some cases, the cumbersome procedures of donors
      themselves; and (iii) problems in mobilizing government backing for projects due to
      various difficulties such as lower prices for hydrocarbons in international markets and the
      resulting fall in government funding (e.g., in 2011).
94.   These bottlenecks reflect the entire process of preparation, implementation, and monitoring
      of budget expenditures by the agricultural sector ministries. This process should be
      reexamined as the efficiency of public expenditures relies heavily on adequate preparation
      and implementation of the budget. Inadequate budget preparation impedes the selection of
      projects with the greatest impact and prevents efficient outreach to the beneficiary
      populations or areas targeted.
95.   Budget authorities. Officially, budget preparation primarily falls under the responsibility of
      the ministry in charge of finances, currently the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoF).
      The duties of the MoF include: (i) defining the overall economic scenario together with the
      MoPIC; (ii) elaborating budget preparation procedures; (iii) receiving and analyzing
      requests from the spending ministries; (iv) drawing up tradeoffs; (v) and drafting the
      budget documents to be submitted to the National Assembly along with the Budget Law
      (presentation notes, reports on the economic and financial situation, technical annexes,
      etc.). The Prime Minister also participates in the budget process, having authority over: (i)
      approving the macroeconomic scenario prepared by the MoF; (ii) endorsing the sectoral
      allocation of budgets; and (iii) arbitrating disagreements the MoF was unable to resolve.
      The MoPIC is responsible for programming public capital expenditures from external
      funds, while the Directorate General of External Resources and Programming (DGREP)
      carries out this task at the technical level.

                                                39
5.2 Macroeconomic Forecasts

96.      Participants. The task of drawing up the macroeconomic scenario is shared between the
         MoF and the MoPIC. The latest law concerning the general structure of government and
         the remits of its components (Decree 720 of July 13, 2009) bestows this role on the MoPIC.
         In reality, it is the Directorate of Research and Forecasts (DEP) in the Directorate General
         of the Budget (DGB) that draws up the macroeconomic scenario on which revenue
         forecasts and annual expenditure projections are based. MoPIC’s International Cooperation
         Directorate, the National Poverty Monitoring Department (Observatoire National de la
         Pauvreté), and the National Institute for Statistics and Demographic Research (INSEED)19
         also contribute to this task.
97.      Calendar. Preparatory work for the scenario begins in May-June of Year n-1 in order to be
         available for the launch of the budget preparation process in Year n. However, delays in
         making data available during the elaboration of the National Development Plan (NDP,
         currently 2013-2016) obstruct preparation of the scenario. If data are available and recent,
         the team in charge of the scenario may have as clear an insight as possible into the trends in
         the economic cycle and a well-founded, analysis-based understanding of the real barriers to
         development and of problems that could arise. Before August 1, the Government submits
         the medium-term scenario documents described above to the National Assembly,
         accompanied by a report on the macroeconomic situation and another on budget
         implementation for the current fiscal year. The National Assembly uses these documents to
         inform a budget policy debate in a public session but without a vote.
98.      Scenario elaboration process. Each year, on the basis of realistic economic assumptions,
         the Government drafts a medium-term budget scenario detailing the evolution over a
         minimum period of three years of: (i) total general government revenues and expenditures,
         including contributions by international donors; and (ii) corresponding general government
         borrowing requirement or capacity, funding components, and the overall level of general
         government debt. The macroeconomic scenario is elaborated using a macroeconomic
         forecasting model known as the Integrated Economic Management System for Chad
         (SIGNET). The scenario is revised in March, September, and at the end of December of
         Year n-1. In most cases, the scenario is approved by IMF missions. Based on the medium-
         term budget framework and within the limits it sets, the Government draws up a Medium-
         Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which breaks down the major categories of public
         expenditures by type and role or by ministry and program over a minimum period of three
         years. These medium-term scenario documents are made public. A comprehensive multi-
         year MTEF was adopted in 2003 and more recently in 2013 as part of the process of
         devising the NDP.
99.      The tasks of setting budget ceilings and reporting them are primarily the responsibility of
         the DGB, which is in charge of budget preparation and drafts guidelines for the sector
         ministries. Under MoF guidelines, the spending ministries are responsible for formulating
         and determining the cost of sectoral programs and for preparing ministerial budgets.
         Finally, both the MoF and the sector ministries are responsible for negotiations and
         tradeoffs.
100. Sector action plans. Sector action plans are elaborated for the priority sectors, in particular
     the agricultural development, rural, and food security sectors (covering agriculture,
     livestock breeding, environment, and hydraulics), based on the medium-term expenditure
     estimates. Although it is stipulated that the annual budget laws are to be consistent with the

19
     Regrettably, national accounts have not been drawn up or updated by INSEED for several years.

                                                     40
      first year of the medium-term scenario documents finalized following the budget policy
      debate, the MTEFs do not take account of all the needs of these sectors, in particular due to
      budget constraints.
101. Weaknesses in the elaboration of the macroeconomic scenario. The assumptions
     concerning the macroeconomic scenario are not subject to external approval. Coordination
     between the NDP, the MTEF, program budgets, and the annual budget is insufficient for
     several reasons: (i) sectoral budget allocations do not always reflect the priorities of the
     NDP; (ii) the high number of sector priorities complicates budget allocation; and (iii)
     delays in the implementation of the budget calendar are not conducive to dialogue with
     MoF services or the involvement of the sector ministries in determining their needs, despite
     the fact that the planning departments in the sector ministries have been strengthened by
     the setting up of Directorates of Research and Forecasts (DEP).

5.3 Budget Preparation

102. Participants. As with those of other sectors, the elaboration of the budgets of the rural
     sector ministries follows a long process consisting of numerous stages and involving
     numerous participants from the State and the National Assembly. Although responsibility
     for preparing the general national budget lies with the MoF (DGB), budget elaboration is
     also a participatory process that brings together a number of participants: the MoPIC, the
     Oil Ministry, INSEED, and the sector ministries and their decentralized services. Each
     participant takes part in specific stages of the process.
103. Stages of budget preparation. Budget preparation consists of the following stages: (i)
     Budget summits: these are mainly dedicated to expenditures from internal funds; externally
     funded investment programs are presented by the sector ministries and debated and
     approved by the Budget Commission in accordance with budget constraints; needs in terms
     of administrative equipment and buildings are also presented and debated; (ii) Budget Law:
     the draft budget law includes resources from external funds; the Computerized Expenditure
     System (CES) covers capital expenditures from internal and external funds; however,
     implementation of the budget from external funds is often adjusted to conform with donor
     procedures (outside of the CES); and (iii) Budget Review Law: the administrative account is
     put together by pooling the information taken from the CES and implementation data from
     the investment program provided by the MoPIC. The management account is put together
     by the Paymaster General (TPG), who assumes responsibility for the resources it manages
     (internal resources).

5.4 Selection and Elaboration of Investment Programs and Projects

104. Participants. The task of screening and elaborating investment projects and programs in
     the agricultural sector falls under the authority of the technical sector ministries. Several
     entities are involved in the process of preparation, evaluation, selection, implementation,
     and monitoring of investment projects: (i) the DGB’s Programming and Evaluation
     Directorate; (ii) the MoPIC’s General Directorate for External Resources and Programming
     (DGREP); (iii) the MoPIC’s Directorate for Public Investments and Project and Program
     Monitoring; and (iv) the sector ministries’ Directorates of Research and Programming
     (DEP). Since 2001, the budgeting of capital expenditures has been included in the budget
     preparation process. This includes expenditures from internal resources as well as
     expenditures from external funds along with their national counterparts. Investment budget
     estimates do not reflect total costs (for the whole project and recurrent project costs), only
     those of the fiscal year in question.

                                                41
105. The Three-Year Public Investment Program (PTIP). The PTIP comes under the
     responsibility of the Directorate General for External Resources and Programming
     (MoPCI), which is in charge of programming and managing external resources. Investment
     programs from national resources are drawn up by the DGB’s Directorate for Programming
     and Evaluation. However, there is no formal framework for the project cycle.
106. The process of drafting the PTIP and the management review for Year n consists of several
     stages. The objective is to establish an estimate of the overall allocation of external
     resources in Year n+1. The regular process is as follows: (i) background information is
     obtained; and (ii) estimates of project disbursements are provided by the sector ministries
     to the MoPIC and the MoF. At the start of each year (January-February), a general inquiry
     is launched, involving agents of the MoPIC’s Directorate General for External Resources
     and the MoF’s Directorate General of the Budget in order to: (i) update the existing
     external funding database; (ii) formulate a collection sheet for financial and physical data;
     and (iii) carry out an inquiry with the MoF in order to collect information on the annual
     budgeting of counterpart funds, projects funded from own resources included in the budget
     law, and disbursements by project and by ministry. Budgets for capital expenditures are set
     by taking account of: (i) amounts allocated to the continuation of ongoing investment
     projects; (ii) counterparts of projects funded by donors; and (iii) new projects planned by
     the ministries within the limits set by the overall budget.
107. Weaknesses in the process. The steps described above aim to ensure that the spending
     ministries record appropriations from previous commitments (contracts signed or being
     implemented). However, it leaves little scope for ministries to record new capital
     expenditures. In addition, the programming of public capital expenditures and their
     inclusion in the PTIP should adhere to specific screening rules covering feasibility studies,
     including assessments of projects' economic viability, their impact on fiscal resources or
     debt servicing (where required), and the existence (or absence) of a funding source for the
     project. The framework for programming capital expenditures does not provide for the
     rigorous monitoring of progress in project implementation, in particular for contracts that
     have already been signed or are ongoing. Moreover, the dichotomy created by the
     responsibility of the MoPIC to elaborate the PTIP and that of the MoF to prepare the
     standardized national budget means that there are two national budget appropriation
     authorizing authorities in Chad. This leads to difficulties in raising, budgeting, monitoring,
     and evaluating public capital expenditures. In addition, we note: (i) the large number of
     Government participants involved in raising external resources, including the MoEPIC, the
     MoF, the technical ministries, the fund management units, and the Ministry of Foreign
     Affairs (MoFA) in agreements designed to select headquarters or set up certain bilateral
     agencies; and (ii) deficiencies in the information and communications system.

5.5 Recommendations for Improving the Budget Process

108. The following organizational and methodological problems should also be taken into
     account:
       The PTIP calendar is out of step with that of the Budget Law;
       Donor budget cycles often differ to that of the Government;
       The slow pace of project aid disbursement is an impediment to meeting the
        Government’s development targets;
       The Government’s contributions to donor-funded projects are poorly covered by budget
        allocations following the budget summit debates;


                                                42
          Recurrent investment costs (maintenance, staff expenditures, operational expenditures)
           are insufficiently accounted for;
          There are insufficient resources for the external monitoring of projects and programs at
           the sector level;
          The Directorates of Research and Programming are weakly involved in the monitoring
           and evaluation of projects and programs; and
          There exists no national procurement procedures manual.

109. One solution would be to improve the preparation of the sector ministries’ budgets by
     elaborating more realistic MTEFs justified by investment projects and programs with
     proven economic, financial, and technical feasibility. This would require: (i) setting up a
     single framework for programming public capital expenditures and their management,
     programming only those projects for which funding has been secured, and establishing a
     national inventory of projects; (ii) centralizing information pertaining to external funds and
     including it in budget implementation progress reports by developing the necessary
     accounting methods in order to provide the National Assembly with a current
     implementation report for the overall national budget.

5.6 Budget Implementation

110. The budget calendar. The fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31, and budget
     implementation begins after the budget law has been approved, by December 31 of that
     year at the latest. Once the Initial Budget Law (LFI) has been promulgated, approved
     appropriations are made available to the sector ministries by MoF decree. Liaising with the
     sector ministries, the MoF is responsible for implementing the budget law and achieving
     the budget balances defined. It has the power to regulate the budget, which enables it to
     calibrate the pace at which appropriations are disbursed according to the financial situation
     of the Government’s accounts. If the situation or the outlook for the accounts requires it, it
     may during the fiscal year: (i) temporarily suspend the use of some appropriations by a
     decree issued to the financial controller, a copy of which is sent to the authorizing
     authority; and (ii) cancel some appropriations by decree, a copy of which is sent
     immediately to the National Assembly.
111. National budget commitments for a given fiscal year are made by November 30 at the
     latest. Payment orders for a fiscal year are made by December 31 of that year. A
     complementary period lasts until January 31 of the following year and is mainly reserved
     for accounting operations. The definitive closing date of the Government’s accounts is set
     for the end of February of the following year. No commitment is made before this period as
     the ministries wait, without being compelled to do so by law, for written notification of
     their budget by the MoF before commencing implementation of their expenditures.
112. Difficulties. In all, three months are needed for any new expenditure item to be initiated. It
     follows that contracts for the year are signed three to four and sometimes six months into
     the fiscal year. These various delays combine to reduce the actual time available for
     operations to run their normal course. In addition to this difficulty in budget
     implementation, there is: (i) a lack of supervision and compliance with the regulations in
     force;20 (ii) the Government’s financial constraints, which lead to frequent budget

20
     Although it was recently reformed, the public procurement system is an obstacle to adequate national
     budget implementation as: (i) waiting times are too long; (ii) internal control procedures of the
     procurement circuit are not standardized; and (iii) participants are generally insufficiently trained.

                                                     43
      adjustments and reductions; and (iii) poor oversight of public procurement procedures.
      While some of these factors can be traced to the technical ministries, others are attributable
      to the MoF or to higher political authority.
113. In effect, the lack of supervision and compliance with public procurement regulations
     prolong public procurement processes and give rise to much discussion between the
     administrations, the projects, and the Directorate General of the Public Procurement Office
     (PPO). The Government’s financial constraints lead to frequent bottlenecks in commitment
     proposals. These result from pressures on funds, the persistence of which since 2007 and
     2008 following the rebel attacks on the capital, N’Djamena, obstructs the activities of the
     administrative services and development projects. The large number of budget adjustments
     is destabilizing for the activities of the sector’s ministries, and allocations in the Initial
     Budget Law (LFI) are systematically amended.
114. To meet expenditure needs that have not been planned and therefore have not been written
     into the Initial Budget Law (LFI), appropriations are transferred by deducting resources
     from certain budget lines, which are then reallocated to other expenditure lines or other
     projects not yet included in the investment budget. These modifications can be requested by
     the ministries themselves or made by the MoF without notice, which leads to further
     destabilization since the ministries realize that their appropriations have been reduced only
     when they submit their expenditure proposals. Improved budget discipline that would
     adhere more closely to the budget estimates approved by the National Assembly would
     help reduce the considerable uncertainty surrounding budget implementation.

5.7 Budget Monitoring

115. Overview. Budget monitoring plays an important role in the budget cycle. It provides
     information on the level of expenditures implemented in the current year and gives an
     indication of the capacity of the different services, projects, and programs to absorb the
     resources allocated to them. Thus, it makes it possible to adjust upward or downward
     depending on actual performance of the estimates for the first year of the following three-
     year MTEF and to draw up the draft budget for the coming year. For externally funded
     projects and programs, the monitoring of technical and financial implementation is
     undertaken jointly by the donors and the Government, the latter often contributing only a
     small share of the funding (tax exemptions, national experts’ fees, etc.). Each rural sector
     ministry contains a Directorate of Research and Programming (DEP) responsible for
     monitoring the technical and financial implementation of various departments’ operational
     expenditures and of capital expenditures.
116. Weaknesses. At present, budget monitoring and evaluation (M&E) suffers from several
     weaknesses at both the central (DEP) and the service and project levels. Performance
     reports, a tool in budget monitoring, are not always produced systematically, and when they
     are, they contain very little information on the cost, incidence, and impact of interventions
     and in general are not accompanied by a baseline situation, which leads to very little
     capitalization on positive experiences with a view to replicating them.
117. Ex-post evaluation of development projects and programs is not highly systematized.
     While ongoing projects are monitored fairly regularly, evaluation (especially that of
     impacts) is seldom performed, and results are seldom shared with the beneficiaries or
     published. In the few cases of ex-post evaluation, results are seldom taken into account
     when the time comes to elaborate new projects or programs, nor do they give rise to
     capacity building within the ministries. The monitoring of operational expenditures is
     mixed in terms of quality, depth, and objectivity, and is difficult to make comparisons

                                                44
      across projects.
118. Donors’ supervision missions and mid-project and program reviews as well as annual
     reviews of Chad’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) are rare opportunities to exchange
     ideas with the other sectors and to present progress achieved in the implementation of the
     policies in sub-sector project or strategy documents. These processes are not conducted
     according to a defined methodology and do not give rise to any sanctions. Rather,
     information is simply provided on recent progress and on the constraints facing the sub-
     sector.
119. Recommendations. The ongoing reforms outlined below would help overcome these
     shortcomings. They include:
       Prime Ministerial order No. 4331/PR/PM/2012 of September 5, 2012, which lays down
        the guidelines for managing development projects and programs in Chad. Each minister
        is required to personally ensure that the targets set in funding accords and agreements are
        achieved, implement any new project within the structure of the ministry responsible for
        planning and implementing programs and projects, and draft a half-year progress report
        for the projects and programs in his or her department;
       Study concerning the introduction of a public capital expenditures management system
        designed to improve the standardization and elaboration of the budget;
       Application of program-based budgeting under the new organic law on budget laws, as
        per CEMAC directives;
       Strengthening of the link between operational budget and investment budget;
       Improvement in transparency and performance in public procurement by starting up the
        Integrated Public Procurement Management System (SIGMP);
       Revisions to the Public Procurement Code to align it with international standards; and
       Setting up of an earmarked account system as per the CEMAC directive, with support
        from DPs, which could be a compromise solution pending the complete overhaul in favor
        of budget support in accordance with the Paris Declaration.

120. It is imperative that all these ongoing reforms be accompanied by considerable strategic
     thinking in terms of implementing the CEMAC directives and by significant M&E capacity
     building at all levels, in terms of personnel, training, and operational resources. This
     reflection should include the issue of archiving and disseminating information, for which
     no systematic mechanism is in place at present.

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


121. The conclusions and recommendations presented in this chapter summarize the detailed
     conclusions and recommendations found in the other chapters of this report. They were
     endorsed during a workshop held in N’Djamena on September 10-11, 2014.
122. They can be summarized as follows:
     a. The overall amount of agricultural expenditures should be increased. Agricultural
        expenditures (following the COFOG methodology) relating to crop and livestock
        production activities should have more than doubled over the 2003-2012 review period
        if they were to meet the Maputo target of 10% of the national budget allocated to the
        agricultural sector. This would have amounted to approximately CFAF 190 billion in
        2012 (compared with expenditures of CFAF 93.3 billion in 2012). Two priority areas
        where public funds clearly remain insufficient are irrigation systems and pastoral
        hydraulics, given the needs and the potential in these two areas. Farming and livestock
        services are another area that needs strengthening. The combined effect of these
        budgetary measures would pave the way for an increase in agricultural output, in
        particular with regard to crop production;

     b. The budget allocated to livestock activities should be increased. Efforts to increase the
        agricultural budget in particular (to at least double it; see above) should be deployed,
        with particular emphasis on supporting livestock activities. In relation to total national
        expenditures, the share of expenditures on livestock activities (1.3% corresponding to
        MoLH expenditures) as opposed to that on agricultural activities (4.5% for the MoAE)
        is insufficient in light of their respective contributions to national GDP (13.6% and
        12.9%, respectively). On this point, it would be advisable to substantially increase the
        MoLH budget, in particular the budgets of the technical directorates under the former
        Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal Production (MoPRAP). Pastoral
        hydraulics will also require particular attention;

     c. Budget allocations granted to the regions should be increased. Chad is a large country
        with a diverse resource base. The government should establish efficient decentralized
        services with the means to meet the needs of local populations. The current 4%
        allocation of budget resources to the decentralized units of the sector ministries is
        manifestly insufficient. First, the resources allocated to these units should be increased
        markedly. Next, the objective should be to undertake institutional reforms with a view
        to giving more power and responsibility to the decentralized units and allocate them the
        corresponding additional resources;

     d. Appropriations for operational expenditures should be increased. The accounting
        breakdown of MoAE and MoLH expenditures revealed that only 4% of total
        expenditures is allocated to the operational costs (including equipment maintenance) of
        these two ministries. Experience shows that this level of allocation is highly
        insufficient to adequately cover their operations. This level should be adjusted to at
        least the level of the overall civil service, i.e. approximately 9%;

     e. The technical directorates should implement expenditures directly. This concerns in
        particular the NFSP, which represents over 15% of the total MoAE budget. This budget

                                              46
         covers expenditures (e.g. irrigation systems, pastoral and village hydraulics, and
         intensification of crop, livestock, and fishery production) that ought to be implemented
         by the technical directorates (or specialized affiliated agencies). The NFSP budget
         should therefore be adjusted downward so that it contains only expenditures strictly
         related to food security and the remaining budget transferred to the directorates and
         other technical entities;

     f. National funds should play a greater role in capital expenditures. National funding of
        capital expenditures amounted to only one-quarter of capital expenditures from external
        financing on average during the review period. This share should be raised. Donors
        have sought such an increase, arguing that given its oil resources, Chad should be able
        to contribute more of its own funds to capital expenditures. Likewise, the Chad
        government could also contribute to the necessary increase in the MoAE and MoLH
        budgets (see above).

The implementation of the above recommendations will require a strengthening of planning and
programming, management, and monitoring and evaluation systems in both the central ministries
(MoF and MoPIC) and the two sector ministries (MoAE and MoLH), as described below:

     g. Planning and programming should be strengthened. Budget planning and
        programming remains an extremely weak link in the budget process in Chad in the two
        economic ministries (MoPIC and MoF) and in the technical ministries (MoAE and
        MoLH in the case of the agricultural sector). The fact that the Supplementary Budget
        Law (LFR) is often out of step with the Initial Budget Law (LFI) is a clear illustration
        of this shortcoming.

         The agricultural sector strategy documents that do contain quantitative data, such as the
         Agricultural Master Plan (AMP, 2006-2015) and the Five-Year Agricultural Plan
         (2013-2018) and do not include sufficiently complete databases to draw up accurate
         budget expenditure estimates relative to the objectives set in general policy documents.
         This drawback undermines the foundations of the budget cycle. In fact, the documents
         cited above have become obsolete because they have been included in the National
         Rural Sector Investment Program (PNISR 2014-2020) under the aegis of the CAADP
         with assistance from the FAO. In this respect, the current support from the FAO in
         defining the terms of the PNISR is welcome as it will give a much-needed sense of
         direction to the planning and programming of capital expenditures in the agricultural
         sector. It should be noted that this drive is taking place with the participation of all
         stakeholders. The MoAE's and MoLH's Directorates of Economic Planning and
         Programming (DEPP) in particular are closely involved, as is the MoAE’s Permanent
         Unit for Agricultural Programming and Monitoring.

         The collection and compilation of budget data is another shortcoming that needs to be
         remedied. In particular, this concerns: (i) projected external funding of development
         projects not yet systematically accounted for in budget allocations, and (ii)
         disbursements of external funding that do not appear in the Computerized Expenditure
         System (CES) managed by the MoF.

         This Review makes the following recommendations for remedying the shortcomings in
         budget planning and programming: (i) prepare valid strategy documents that can be
         used as a framework for programming and planning activities and can be quickly be put
         into operation; (ii) systematically insert external funds in the budget database both for

                                              47
     projected appropriations (Initial and Supplementary Budget Laws) and commitments
     (CES); on this point, data concerning projected financing and disbursements for
     development projects from donors to the MoPIC should be systematically and promptly
     passed on to the MoF to be included in the Initial and Supplementary Budget Laws and
     in the CES, respectively; (iii) increase coordination between participants; coordination
     between the MoF and the MoPIC needs to be enhanced, especially given that it is the
     MoPIC that communicates with the DPs; collaboration with the group of DPs also
     needs to be improved to ensure that donors systematically and accurately pass on all of
     the data concerning their funding; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of the MoAE and
     MoLH Directorates of Economic Planning and Programming (DEPP).

h. The Management Information System (MIS) should be strengthened. The MIS of both
   sector ministries is extremely weak. It does not enable the close monitoring of the
   ministries’ day-to-day recurrent expenditures (personnel, operational costs, other
   recurrent costs) or the periodic evaluation of these costs. This shortcoming could be
   remedied by strengthening the DAF of each of these ministries and ensuring that a
   desirable level of collaboration is established with the corresponding services in the
   MoF;

i.   Monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened. The monitoring and evaluation of
     investment projects is deficient. Monitoring should be carried out regularly, in
     particular during the various stages of the donor project supervision cycle. Such
     monitoring would make it possible to stay informed of progress in project
     implementation and to adjust budget estimates accordingly. Likewise, project
     evaluation should be prepared systematically by project managers in order to determine
     the impact of public expenditures, in particular capital expenditures, on the target
     populations. Currently, this analysis is seldom carried out except on occasion in the
     context of specific completion reports with the support of DPs. Strengthening
     monitoring and evaluation is a matter of urgency and will require operational data to be
     systematically collected and impact studies carried out.

1. This annex covers total agricultural investment expenditures based on MoPIC data for
   external financing and on CES data for internal financing. Information provided here
   complements Section 4.3, which covers only expenditures meeting COFOG criteria.
   Explanations of how COFOG expenditures data was obtained by eliminating non-COFOG
   expenditures and the calculations used for integrated rural development projects are included.

2. Data on externally financed expenditures are provided by the Directorate for International
   Cooperation (DIC) of the MoPIC. The data represent projects funded by Chad’s Development
   Partners (DP). These data cover disbursements notified by the DPs to the MoPIC and sent to
   the MoF. However, these data are not incorporated into the CES. For all intents and purposes,
   these expenditures should be considered off-budget. Data on internally financed investments
   come from the CES. These data relate primarily to national counterparts to external funding.

External Financing

3. Changes in externally financed investment expenditures. Table 22A and Graph 11A show
   the changes in externally financed investment expenditures for the MoAE and the MoLH for
   the 2004-2009 period.

      4. Table 22A and Graph 11A show a significant decrease in externally financed expenditures for
         the 2005-2010 period, falling from CFAF 55.4 billion in 2005 to CFAF 31.8 billion in 2008
         and decreasing further to CFAF 30.4 billion in 2009. This steep decline was due to socio-
         political instability in the country during this period, during which some externally financed
         projects were put on hold, while other projects came to a standstill as some donors suspended
         their aid activities. The figures for 2012 show that external financing has recently resumed.
         These figures exceed those of 2005, with disbursements of CFAF 56.1 billion.

      5. Types of Investments. The MoPIC data on externally financed investments are grouped by
         project. Projects were reviewed and categorized according to the type of activity being
         financed. The project types defined by this database are presented in Table 23A below.

6. Table 23A shows that integrated rural development projects (or regional projects) accounted
   for the largest share of expenditures, or 29%, far ahead of technical assistance and skills-
   building projects, or 12.8%. By contrast, agricultural production and livestock and fishery
   projects accounted for only 11.3% and 10.6%, respectively. Food aid projects constituted a
   non-negligible share of expenditures, or 7.1%.

7. Integrated rural development projects undoubtedly constitute a special case not only because
   of the considerable funding they receive but also because they encompass a wide variety of
   activities. Projects belong to multiple sectors, dealing with activities as varied as crop and
   livestock production, basic infrastructure (e.g., hydro-agricultural projects, agricultural water
   supply, and feeder roads), and social infrastructure (e.g., health clinics and schools). These
   projects were therefore examined in detail with the assistance of DPs in order to determine
   the share of externally financed activities that meet COFOG criteria. The results of this
   analysis are presented in Section 4.2 above, which relates to COFOG-defined expenditures.

8. Distribution of Externally Financed Investment Expenditures between the MoAE and the
   MoLH. Table 24A shows the distribution of externally financed investment expenditures

                                                53
         between the two sector ministries. This table underlines the predominance of the MoAE in
         external financing for investment expenditures, absorbing close to 90% of funding compared
         with a little over 10% for the MoLH. This demonstrates that livestock receives a meager
         portion of total investment expenditures. This state of affairs should be corrected given the
         size of the livestock sector’s contribution to overall GDP.

  9. External sources of funding by donor. The percentage of funding by each donor as a share of
     total externally sourced funds is shown in Table 25A and Graph 13A. For the 2004-2012
     period, the African Development Bank (AfDB) was the largest donor to Chad’s agricultural
     sector, followed by France, Germany, the European Union (EU), the World Bank, the Arab
     Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), Switzerland, and the International
     Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The percentage of multi-donor projects is sizable,
     at 10%. Unfortunately, the lack of information on these projects made it impossible to
     calculate the contribution of each individual donor. The number of projects under the “Other
     projects” heading should also be noted. These are projects that do not meet COFOG criteria
     (e.g., projects addressing food security or feeder roads) or projects affiliated with the former
     Ministries of the Environment or Hydraulics.

  10. The distribution of funds by donors is important not only in determining the size of donors’
      contributions but also in evaluating the execution of funded projects. In this respect, the
      different implementation methods of donors should be differentiated. Some projects are
      carried out by partner organizations (e.g., NGOs, the FAO) or by a non-governmental project
      management unit. Partner-led projects are often characterized by rapid disbursement.
      Conversely, some projects implemented directly by the MoAE or the MoLH have
      experienced major delays and very low rates of disbursement due to complex procedures and
      communication problems between the Chad Government and donors.

  Internal Funding

  11. Table 26A and Graph 14A show the change in internally funded expenditures of the MoAI
      and the MoPDAP for the 2004-2012 period. Data related to these expenditures were extracted
      from the Computerized Expenditure System (CES). To a large extent, internal funding
      corresponds to the national counterpart of external financing for some projects. To a lesser
      extent, internal funding corresponds to the only funding for other projects.

  12. Internally financed expenditures by the two sector ministries trended upward during the 2004-
      2012 period, except for 2011, a year that saw an extremely low level of internally financed
      expenditures (CFAF 4.4 billion), corresponding to an almost 75% decrease compared to the
      previous year. This is hardly surprising given that budgets were slashed that year as a
      consequence of short-term issues. However, internally financed expenditures grew sharply the
      following year, reaching CFAF 25.7 billion, indicating a noticeable upward trend.

  14. Table 27A shows that total expenditures rose over the period under review. This growth was
      spurred as much by increases in externally financed expenditures, especially during the last

                                                               56
   few years of the period, as by increases in internally financed expenditures, except for 2011,
   an atypical year of austerity budgeting. A highly interesting aspect is the percentage of
   internally financed expenditures as a share of total expenditures in the sector (see Graph 15A
   below). This share grew consistently over the course of the period, indicating both Chad’s
   growing financing capabilities and the donor community’s desire to see Chad participating to
   a greater extent in the financing of investment in the country.

Feeder Roads

15. Although expenditures on feeder roads does not meet COFOG criteria, they are very
    important in reducing the isolation of production areas and improving access to markets for
    rural populations in a country as large as Chad.

16. Table 28A below shows the amount of investment devoted to feeder roads during the period
    under review. Note that the concept of feeder roads in Chad is very broad. That is, what
    qualifies as a feeder road includes roads that are a few kilometers long to roads that are
    hundreds of kilometers long, which is especially true in northern Chad. Table 28A shows that
    expenditures on feeder roads as defined above represented around 8.8% of total agricultural
    expenditures (COFOG and non-COFOG). Although this amount may appear sizable, it is
    insufficient given the level of need.
