Summary


 Key messages from this report:

■■   Most disaster risk assessment today is static, focusing only on
     understanding current risks. A paradigm shift is needed toward
     dynamic risk assessments, which reveal the drivers of risk and
     the effectiveness of policies focused on reducing risk.

■■   Global disaster risk is changing extremely fast, due to
     combined dynamics of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

■■   The drivers of disaster risk are in the control of policy makers,
     society, and individuals—but accurate assessment and
     continuous reevaluation of risk are required to enable effective
     risk reduction and prevent drastic increases in future losses.

           There is variability in annual losses and deaths from disasters, but annual
         total damage (averaged over a 10-year period) has increased tenfold between
         1976–1985 and 2005–2014, from US$14 billion to more than US$140 billion.
