 SECTION III – SCOPE

1.      A strong and contestable review process helps ensure a common standard and a high
quality engagement as well as supports the transfer of global knowledge across the World Bank
Group. The procedures for each element of this country engagement approach are set out below.

                               Regional Coordination Mechanism

2.      Each region will have its own cross-institution committee, known as the Regional
Coordination Mechanism (RCM), whose members are comprised of the World Bank Regional
Vice President (Bank RVP), the IFC Vice President (IFC VP), represented by the IFC Regional
Director (IFC RD) or another designee, and the MIGA Chief Operating Officer (MIGA COO) - or
their designees.

3.      The RCM decides on the extent of involvement of the Bank, IFC and MIGA in the
preparation and processing of various elements of upcoming country engagements (SCDs, CPFs,
CENs and PLRs). This decision determines whether concept and corporate review meetings are
jointly chaired by the Bank and IFC and/or MIGA (Tier 1) or chaired solely by the Bank (Tier 2).
The RCM decides which institution will be responsible for appointing the WBG Task Team
Leader(s) (WBG TTL(s)) to manage the processing and drafting of the various documents. Unless
otherwise noted by a subsequent RCM decision, the processing tier to be followed for a specific
country persists across the various elements of the country engagement approach. The agenda for
the RCM and the decisions of the RCM are noted in a RCM decision note prepared and issued by
the respective Bank’s ROC Secretariat to the participants of the RCM.

4.     The RCM will also determine whether a CPF/CEN will be complemented by joint
implementation plan(s) which provide more detail on how the different institutions of the WBG
intend to collaborate to support objectives in selected priority areas. The RCM will review
progress and provide guidance on existing cross-institutional collaborations.

                                  Systematic Country Diagnosis

5.      The SCD is conducted prior to the CPF process and is finalized (i.e., SCD ROC review
meeting has taken place and decision to proceed with publication of the SCD has been approved
by the ROC) before the CPF concept review meeting takes place in order to provide the analytical
foundation for the CPF. The SCD is subject to a corporate review process, with a World Bank
Group-wide concept and corporate review meeting. The chair(s) of the concept and corporate
review meetings is determined by the RCM. The IFC country teams, IFC Global and Regional
Industry Departments, global practices, cross cutting solution areas and, as appropriate, other units
and individuals of each of the institutions of the WBG are expected to participate actively upstream
and in formal reviews. As a WBG analysis, the Bank, IFC, and MIGA approve the final decision
note (as described below, under Tier 2 the IFC and MIGA concur on the final decision note).
Following approval, the SCD is made publicly available.

6.     The SCD is processed according to the following steps:

7.       All CPF/CENs require a concept and corporate review meeting. PLRs only require a single
corporate review. CLRs for the earlier strategy are attached as an annex to the following
CPF/CEN, and are reviewed as part of that CPF/CEN process. As with the SCD, IFC country
teams, IFC Country Framework Engagement team and Industry Departments, global practices,
cross-cutting solution areas and, as appropriate, other units and individuals of each of the
institutions of the WBG are expected to participate actively upstream and in formal reviews.

8.      Concept review document: After the strategy concept is defined, but before detailed
preparation of the CPF/CEN begins, the task team prepares a CPF/CEN concept document and
holds concept review meeting. The concept documentation is intended to provide a clear sense of
the country context, the country’s development vision, major developments, poverty reduction and
shared prosperity and sustainability issues, and the envisaged objectives of the Bank Group’s
strategy. If available, a draft of the CLR is also circulated as part of the concept review
documentation and discussed at the concept review meeting.

9.      ROC/OC corporate review document: For the purposes of the country engagement
approach, most corporate reviews are delegated to the relevant Bank Regional Operations
Committee (ROC) with IFC and MIGA participation. A small subset of most risky, innovative or
unusual CPF/CENs go to the Bank’s Operations Committee (OC) with IFC and MIGA
participation.

10.    The corporate review documentation comprises the final draft of the CPF/CEN, including
annexes, and the decision note of any prior review meeting (e.g., concept) of the CPF/CEN. The
CLR is circulated as an annex to the CPF or CEN as part of the corporate review documentation
and discussed at the corporate review meeting. Any issues surrounding the CPF/CEN that are
outstanding at the time of the review, in addition to those raised by advisors, are highlighted in the
meeting agenda.

                                 Performance and Learning Review

11.     The PLR is subject to one Bank Group-wide corporate review which is normally
conducted at the level of a Regional Operations Committee with IFC and MIGA participation. The
Bank RVP, with concurrence of IFC RD and/or MIGA COO may decide that a concept review is
also necessary (in which case the PLR follows the same concept review procedures as a CPF).

12.      PLRs follow that same clearance process as CPFs/CENs except that PLRs do not receive
a final clearance from the SVP/IFC VP/MIGACOO and are circulated to the Board on an Absence-
of-Objection Basis (AOB)1 unless there are substantive changes to the WBG program, in which
case a full Board discussion may be warranted. Since EDs may call for discussion of the PLR, a

Executive Director to schedule a discussion.

14.     Waivers to the Country Engagement Directive and Procedure are processed as set out in the table below.

15.     However, if the deviation from the Procedure relates to:

        (a) an administrative requirement in this Procedure (this includes failure to ensure the correct distribution of documentation,
        and failure to meet timing requirements), due to an oversight or other reason, it is remedied by subsequent action, as
        applicable, by sending the documents to individuals missed and explaining to the persons involved in the review/clearance of
        such a document as to why the deviation occurred (such as why the document is being circulated in less than the time
        required); or

        (b) a failure to obtain the required advice, clearance or concurrence due to an oversight or other reason, it is remedied by taking
        the necessary action after the fact and in accordance with the normal protocols (ensuring regional Management is kept abreast
        of any pending advice, clearances and concurrences; and decider ensuring that the follow up actions taken are appropriate).

                                   Definition of accountability and decision making roles
The roles of different actors are detailed below and may be assigned to participants in business decisions under specific delegations.


 Recommendation        A staff member performing the recommendation role (Recommender) is responsible for gathering facts, analyzing information and preparing
 Role                  a proposal for the decision-maker. In developing a proposal, the recommender obtains the required advice, clearances and concurrences;
                       addresses different views and approaches, and evaluates options.

 Advisory Role         A staff member in the advisory role (Advisor) is responsible for rendering relevant and current advice with respect to the portion of the proposal
                       that is within his or her specialty. An Advisor’s input should be given as early in the process as possible when it is likely to have most impact.
                       The Recommender considers the advice, but determines whether the advice should be taken or not, subject to the resolution of differences
                       as provided below.

 Clearance Role        A staff member in the clearance role (Clearer) is responsible for attesting that the proposal complies with essential requirements in his or her
                       specialty. A Clearer’s input should be given as early in the process as possible when it is likely to have the most impact. A Clearer is also
                       responsible for providing advice. As is the case with other advice, the Recommender must consider it, but determines whether the advice
                       should be taken or not, subject to the resolution of differences as provided below. A Clearer must specify whether his or her contributions fall
                       into the clearance or the advisory categories to inform the Recommender and the team about the nature of the input.

 Concurrence Role      A staff member in the concurrence role (Concurrer) is responsible for reviewing the entire proposal. Without an agreement from the Concurrer,
                       the proposal cannot be forwarded to the Decider. The Concurrer is responsible for engaging with the Recommender to test all aspects of the
                       proposal and understand the risks and trade-offs.

 Decision Role         A staff member performing this role (Decider) is responsible for considering the entire proposal and making a decision. The Decider has the
                       authority and responsibility for all aspects of the decision and commits the organization to action.

 Resolving             The Recommender is responsible for resolving substantive disagreements with advice received. If the disagreement is: (a) material to the
 differences of view   proposal; and (b) cannot be resolved at that level, the Recommender discusses the matter with the Concurrer. If there is no Concurrer, or if
 among participants    the Concurrer is unable to resolve the matter, the Recommender initiates a discussion with the Decider. The Decider either resolves the matter
 in business           or escalates it further up the management chain.
