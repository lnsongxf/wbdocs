       About infoDev’s Climate Technology Program
       The Climate Technology Program (CTP), housed at infoDev, empowers developing countries
       to proactively and profitably adapt, develop, and deploy climate-smart technologies and
       business models. The CTP is creating a global network of Climate Innovation Centers (CICs)
       that provide a country-driven approach to addressing climate change and fostering green
       growth. The CICs are designed as locally owned and run institutions that provide a suite of
       services and venture financing that address the specific needs of local climate technology
       SMEs and entrepreneurs. At the global level, the CTP is providing linkages between CICs by
       facilitating market entry, access to information, and financing for the private sector, while
       also offering important tools for policy makers to measure and improve domestic climate
       innovation activities. Currently, the program is establishing CICs in eight countries: Kenya,
       the Caribbean, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Morocco, South Africa and Vietnam.

       Building Competitive Green Industries:
       The Climate and Clean Technology Opportunity
       for Developing Countries
       By Anabel Gonzalez
       Senior Director, Global Practice on Trade and Competitiveness

       As we confront the challenge of climate change – a potentially lethal threat to our planet – it is vital that
       policymakers in every country resolve to take effective action to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. The
       technical challenge may seem daunting, yet taking far-sighted action to restrain climate-damaging
       emissions can have a net positive effect on the economy. As shown by a major 2014 World Bank Group report
       – “Climate-Smart Development: Adding Up the Benefits of Actions that Help Build Prosperity, End Poverty
       and Combat Climate Change” – making climate-smart investments can have, overall, a positive economic
       impact, particularly among the largest greenhouse-gas-emitting economies in the developed world.

       Reinforcing that analysis’ hopeful message, this new report shows that developing countries – like the
       world’s industrialized economies – can reap significant positive benefits by investing in technologies to
       restrain emissions and by developing new clean technology industries that can build resilience and limit
       further climate damage.

       This report analyzes the economic opportunity that developing and emerging countries can now seize, if
       they adopt policies to fight climate change and invest in low-carbon growth. This report, for the first time,
       quantifies the size of expected investment in clean technologies in the developing world over the next
       decade – and it finds that the opportunity is vast: the expected investment across a wide range of clean
       technology sectors, just in the world’s developing and emerging economies, will exceed $6.4 trillion over
       the next decade. Better still, about $1.6 trillion of that total offers an opening for small and medium-sized
       enterprises (SMEs) –key drivers of future job creation. SMEs also serve the local, rural and “base of the
       pyramid” markets that are often underserved by larger firms. Moreover, developing economies are already
       on the right track, with US$112 billion in clean-tech investments in 2012 – a 19 percent year-over-year
       increase.

       Doing the right thing for the environment could unlock a significant potential for a pathway towards a
       sustainable green economy. Creating competitive economic sectors is critical to stimulating the job growth
       that is indispensable to achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals: eliminating extreme poverty and
       fostering shared prosperity. Fostering home-grown climate and clean technology industries in developing
       countries can create a sustainable and wealth-producing sector of the economy, while simultaneously
       addressing such urgent development priorities as access to clean and affordable energy, clean water and
       climate-resilient agriculture.

       In welcoming this hopeful analysis, policymakers worldwide can benefit from its clear-sighted calculation
       that the clean technology transition can deliver strong new economic benefits even as it protects the long-
       term well-being of our fragile environment.

                                                                        it provides a set of actions that can be considered

      particularly hard hit and unable to adequately
      adapt (World Bank, 2013a). There are ongoing
      efforts to assist developing countries with efforts
      to mitigate and adapt to climate change through
                                                                        Developing Countries Are
      the deployment of appropriate climate and clean                   Increasingly Driving Growth

      of these efforts is to transfer technology from the               and Innovation in the Global
      developed world without regard to local industry

Actions to Support Clean
Technology SMEs
This report describes the importance of SMEs
to the growth of competitive clean technology
industries. It also illustrates that opportunities
exist for developing country SMEs across clean
technology industries and value chains. However,
the growth of these firms is also dependent on
consistent support to overcome the challenges
characteristic of clean technology firms, including
higher upfront capital requirements, longer
payback periods for investors and a heavier
reliance on government policy than other
technology sectors.

Five areas of action should be considered by
governments, development agencies and other
public and private actors to support clean
technology SMEs in developing countries.
                                                                                                                                        Photo: infoDev.

     The Climate and Clean Technology
     Opportunity for Developing
     Countries

         Main Points
         •	 Climate change represents an opportunity for developing countries to build local green industries that
            can drive sustainable economic growth as well as environmental benefits.

         •	 Climate and clean technology sectors are intrinsically innovative and compare favorably to other sectors
            in terms of innovation output, job creation and job quality.

         •	 This report provides an overview and estimate of the market opportunity for climate and clean technology
            business in developing countries over the coming decade, with particular attention to opportunities
            and barriers for SMEs. Using the results of a new survey of clean technology firms in India and Kenya,
            the report identifies key barriers for these firms and which parts of the value chain are already being
            targeted by local SMEs.

         •	 Finally, the report provides a set of actions that can be considered for countries that wish to support
            innovative SMEs within local green industries.

     Sizing Climate and
     Clean Technology
     Markets

         Main Points
         •	 Clean technology is a huge global market. In
            2011/2012 the sector was a $5.5 trillion global
            market and it is currently forecast to grow at
            around 4.1 percent annually until 2015/2016,
            significantly faster than the global economy.

         •	 Clean technology investment in developing
            countries is quickly catching up with investment
            in developed countries. In 2012, clean
            technology investment rose by 19 percent in
            developing countries compared with an overall
            decline of 12 percent globally, suggesting that
            clean technology investment is shifting towards
            developing economies in the near term.

         •	 Investment across 15 clean technology sectors
            in 145 developing countries is expected to top
            $6.4 trillion over the next decade, with $1.6
            trillion of that market accessible to SMEs.

         •	 Investment in wastewater treatment facilities
            represents over a third of the total likely clean
            technology investment in developing countries
            (about $2.7 trillion), with water treatment,
            onshore wind power, solar PV, small hydro
            and waste management the next largest
            sectors (each between about $300-800 billion).                                                              Photo: Dave Lawrence / World Bank.

            Renewables should attract about $2 trillion in
            investment.

         •	 Regionally, about $1.5 trillion will be invested
            in China, and slightly less will be invested in
            Latin America and the Caribbean. Roughly $900
            billion will be invested in each of Sub-Saharan
            Africa, Asia (excluding China and India) and
            North Africa and the Middle East; $440 billion
            will be invested in India, and $235 billion in
            Russian and Middle Income Europe.

         •	 The clean technology sector’s size and growth prospects make it attractive for SMEs, but it is not without
            challenges: failure rates are high, capital requirements are a barrier, reliance on government policy is a
            risk, and the technical and commercial capacity required of clean technology SMEs can be a challenge.

         •	 SMEs are most able to access opportunities in the middle segment of the value chain (including balance
            of systems components, installation, engineering, procurement and construction) and the final segment
            (O&M). Opportunities in the first segment (major equipment manufacturing) are less accessible but still
            possible.

         •	 This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges clean technology SMEs face and where in the
            value chain large commercial opportunities for SMEs are most likely to be found.

        investments account only for a small fraction of
        overall sector spending so its recent shrinkage
        does not undermine the sector’s prospects, which           while firms in construction or ICT are less exposed
        are dominated by deployment numbers rather than            to this risk since their sectors are more driven

     Case Study:
     Solar Energy
     in India

         Main Points
         •	 This case study takes a deep dive into the solar industry in India to illustrate the SME opportunity more
            clearly across the value chain segments and presents findings from a survey with 50 clean technology
            SMEs in India.

         •	 Solar is particularly interesting in India because of the Indian Government’s ambitious plans and targets
            for solar energy at small and large scales (as embodied in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission).
            India is by far the world’s most advanced market for small-scale concentrated solar power (CSP) for
            industrial heat, with supply dominated by local Innovative Indian technology suppliers.

         •	 The SME opportunity in on-grid solar PV and CSP technologies over the next decade in India is roughly
            $41 billion, including lifetime O&M.

         •	 The bulk of that opportunity is in the latter segments of the value chain: planning, installation, Balance of
            Systems, and O&M. Innovation opportunities also exist around customization of small systems for PV and
            accelerating the time between commissioning and operational readiness for CSP.

         •	 According to the survey, Indian clean technology SMEs are working across value chain segments and
            innovation activities. However, they point out several barriers and suggest targeted policy support areas.
            Addressing these could provide opportunities for additional industry growth and SME participation.

CSP technologies over the next decade is about
$41 billion, including lifetime O&M. The bulk of
that opportunity is in the latter segments of the

     Case Study:
     Bioenergy
     in Kenya

         Main Points
         •	 This case study takes a close look at the bioenergy industry in Kenya to illustrate the barriers and
            opportunities in the various subsectors, including examples of Kenyan SMEs. It also presents findings
            from a survey with 50 clean technology SMEs in Kenya.

         •	 Bioenergy already plays a significant role in Kenya’s energy mix. It is entrenched in Kenyan domestic and
            working life and as such presents an excellent opportunity for local SMEs to grow the sector and make it
            more sustainable.

         •	 The SME opportunity in bioenergy—efficient biomass, biogas, crop-based biofuels, and cogeneration or
            combined heat and power—is abundant but specific to certain technologies or geographical locations.
            Investment of $2.4 billion is expected in the East African bioenergy sector, with almost $1.4 billion
            accessible to SMEs, and Kenyan SMEs may benefit from these opportunities.

         •	 Kenyan SMEs face a number of barriers including incoherent bioenergy policies, high cost of investment/
            access to finance, lack of business skills, and so on. Despite the challenging environment, the survey of
            clean technology SMEs in Kenya suggests that firms are optimistic about the clean technology market
            and have strong growth ambitions. Some Kenyan clean technology SMEs are highly innovative and are
            developing pioneering financing models and new products and services.

         •	 Removing key barriers and providing targeted policy and business support could provide opportunities for
            additional industry growth and SME participation.

     Case Study: Climate Smart
     Agriculture in India and
     Kenya

         Main Points
         •	 This case study examines climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in India and Kenya, and highlights the
            differences between agriculture and other clean-technology sectors and the main challenges facing the
            two countries.

         •	 Agriculture is a major employer and source of economic activity in developing countries but faces many
            environmental, institutional, financial, and behavioral challenges that are exacerbated by climate change
            and rural poverty.

         •	 Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that aims to integrate social, economic and ecological
            objectives to increase agricultural yields, boost profits, reduce local pollution, address poverty, enhance
            climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

         •	 CSA differs from other clean technology sectors because it tends to rely on donor and government
            involvement and depends heavily on behavior change, education, and institutional reform, but
            nevertheless represents a commercial opportunity for SMEs.

         •	 Drip irrigation, food storage, and agroforestry are three innovative agricultural activities profiled in this
            case study; there are many other SME opportunities that align with CSA goals.

     Actions to Support
     Clean Technology
     SMEs

         Main Points
         •	 This report has described the importance of SMEs to the growth of competitive clean technology
            industries. It has also illustrated that opportunities exist for developing country SMEs across clean
            technology industries and value chains. However, as illustrated (particularly in the case studies in
            Chapters 4, 5 and 6), the growth of these firms is also dependent on consistent support to overcome the
            challenges characteristic of clean technology firms.

         •	 This chapter identifies five areas of action that should be considered by governments, development
            agencies, and other public and private actors to support clean technology SMEs in developing countries
            These areas are:
                 Entrepreneurship and business acceleration
                 Innovation finance
                 Market development
                 Technology development
                 Legal and regulatory framework

            Policy makers and other stakeholders can draw upon a broad tool-box of instruments in each of these
            five areas, to promote clean technology SMEs, listed in Appendix C and discussed in this chapter.

         •	 Policy makers, in particular, must adopt and adapt these instruments to fit their country‘s
            circumstances. They should also seek to mitigate key risks, including failures to coordinate policy design
            and implementation, market distortions, and the effects of policy discontinuity.

         •	 To illustrate considerations within specific national contexts, case studies of national programs targeting
            SMEs within green industry development are incorporated in the chapter. These include South Korea‘s
            Green Growth Strategy, India‘s National Solar Mission, Thailand‘s Energy Conservation Program, and
            Ethiopia’s Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy.

     Market Sizing Methodology


       The market sizing methodology has five main steps (further detail available upon request):
       1.	 Regional clusters were defined based on a variety of indicators that allowed for modeling of regional
           opportunities amongst similar countries. This allowed country-level data gaps to be filled by
           extrapolation. The clusters group similar countries within regions, with India and China treated as stand-
           alone, both because of their relative uniqueness, size, and better data availability.
       2.	 A short list of clean technology sectors was created and the overall market value for each sector for each
           region was estimated using a variety of data sources, including: investment projections, installed capacity
           projections, and national plans. Country data gaps within regions were filled by extrapolation using GDP
           as the main scaling factor.
       3.	 The value chains for each sector were mapped and the proportion of value in each segment estimated
           (for instance, 40 percent of the value is in major equipment; 10 percent in engineering, procurement
           and construction; and 50 percent in operations and maintenance). This was combined with the regional
           estimates of sector market value to estimate the addressable market in each segment.
       4.	 The share of each value chain segment that could be captured by local SMEs was estimated. A rating
           of Low, Small, Medium, or High was assigned to each value chain segment for each sector with a
           corresponding fixed percentage for each rating in order to estimate the value that could be captured by
           local SMEs. The ratings were based on the technical complexity and market structure of the segment and
           experience in the United Kingdom of working with SMEs in clean technology across the value chain.
       5.	 All of the estimates were sense checked against existing global estimates and the findings from the case
           studies. In the analysis of opportunities the subregions were reaggregated to more conventional regions
           for the purposes of presenting the findings.
