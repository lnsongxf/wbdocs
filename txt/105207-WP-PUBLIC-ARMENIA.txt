Challenge:
The irrigation System Enhancement Project (ISEP) is designed to address some of the irrigation and drainage (I&D) sector
challenges with the aim of contributing to the country’s ultimate goal of ensuring efficient, cost -effective, and sustainable
irrigation. ISEP will consolidate the results achieved to date through past operations and develop synergies with ongoing
and planned outcomes.
The Project Development Objectives are (i) to reduce the amount of energy used and to improve irrigation conveyance
efficiency in targeted irrigation schemes; and (ii) to improve the availability and reliability of important sector data and
information for decision makers and other stakeholders.
Results achieved to date:
    Energy savings of slightly more than 38 million kilowatt hours (kw/h), equivalent to about 30 percent of the total
        needs of the irrigation system in Armenia;
    Improvement in the conveyance efficiency of the outlet canals of selected schemes by reducing water losses from
        1.91 liters per second per 100 meters (liters/s/100m) to 0.71 liters/s/100m;
    Crucial information for irrigation water management made available, including: (i) an updated estimate of the
        operations and maintenance (O&M) needs of the I&D system; (ii) an updated estimate of the extraordinary
        maintenance (EM) needs of the I&D system; (iii) information on the amount of water made available to the
        system and to its operators—water supply agencies (WSAs) and water users associations (WUAs); and (iv) an
        analysis of the effectiveness of irrigation institutions (WSAs and WUAs) in the performance of their duties.

Key partners: The Bank works closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and State Committee of Water Systems (SCWS), as

Challenge:

Since the launch of the Lifeline Road Improvement Project (LRIP) in 2009, there have been noticeable improvements in
both local employment and journey time. Despite the extensive rehabilitation and visible improvement, about 50 percent
of Armenia’s Lifeline Road Network (LRN) remains in poor condition, and there is still an important investment shortage.
The degraded part of the LRN causes high transport costs and journey times for road users, restricting connectivity to key
markets such as agriculture and to important services such as health and education, as well as negatively affecting the
country’s competitiveness. This has occurred due to a historic pattern of underinvestment and deferred maintenance,
resulting in a considerable maintenance backlog. Deferred maintenance leads to a future burden of more expensive
rehabilitation and road reconstruction, which increases overall transport costs in the long run.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the access of rural communities to markets and services through the
upgrading of selected lifeline roads, and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Communications to
manage the LRN.
Results achieved to date:                                          IDA Core Indicators:

Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC), which is
responsible for the overall policy setting and for overall implementation of the project; (ii) Transport Project
Implementation Unit State Institution (Transport PIU), charged with coordination and management of implementation
activities on a day-to-day basis; and (iii) Armenian Roads Directorate State Non-Commercial Organization (ARD), which is
responsible for the technical aspects of project implementation.

Key development partners include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is implementing a similar project and
with which the Bank team coordinates closely on policy issues. The Bank also works closely with many other donors,
including the European Investment Bank (EIB), EDB, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
to coordinate investments in the water and wastewater sector, and these efforts bode well for future reforms in the sector.

Challenge:

For many years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of the water supply systems in Armenia were in a serious
state of disrepair. Despite an abundance of water in the country, in most cities and villages it was available only a few
hours per day and at low pressure. Over the past decade, the Government has succeeded in improving access to, and the
reliability and quality of, drinking water service through the increased use of public-private partnerships (PPPs), which
have brought about higher efficiency and improvements in the quality of service to customers. Considerable progress has
been made in the delivery of water services in small and medium-sized towns in Armenia. Despite such improvements,
however, the sector is still facing some challenges.

The Project Development Objective is to support improvements in the quality and availability of the water supply in
selected service areas of the Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC).

Results achieved to date:                                            IDA Core Indicators:

Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) State Committee on Water Economy (SCWE) and the Ministry
of Territorial Administration; SCWE reports to the ministry and is responsible for the overall policy setting in the water
and irrigation sectors; and (ii) Armenia Water and Sewerage Company, a water utility outside the Yerevan service area,
which covers about 45 percent of the country’s population and is the implementer of the municipal water project.

Key development partners include ADB, KfW, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and EBRD.
The Bank coordinates with ADB on water sector reforms, particularly on the exchange of information on mutual efforts
in the AWSC service area. EBRD invests in five treatment plants in the Sevan region. KfW is financing water supply
investments in the cities of Armavir, Vanadzor, and Gyumri. The Bank works closely with many donors to coordinate
investments in the water and wastewater sector, and these efforts bode well for the significant future improvement of the
sector.

Challenge:

Armenia’s power transmission infrastructure is old and undermaintained. The average age of transmissi on assets is 45
years. Some sections of the 220-kilovolt power transmission backbone are in urgent need of rehabilitation. The
Government’s Energy Sector Strategy and the Sustainable Development Program recognize this challenge, and an
increase in power supply reliability is among the key strategic objectives of the sector. The Government prioritizes the
replacement of one section of the power transmission backbone, the transmission line connecting two key generation
centers in the central part of the country (Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant) and in the South (Vorotan Cascade of
hydropower plants), and service for large electricity consumers in the central-eastern part of the country. Replacement of
the targeted section of the transmission line is critical, since it is in extreme disrepair and jeopardizes the reliability of the
power supply and overall network stability. The line was constructed in 1956–58 and has been in service since then.
Conductors, pylons, insulators, and other key pieces of infrastructure are obsolete and need replacement. There are also a
number of critical substations that are essential to the reliability of the power supply in the country and require urgent
rehabilitation, particularly given that some of the equipment dates back to the 1930s and has not been replaced since then.
The Additional Financing will be rehabilitating three of those substations: Haghtanak, Charentsavan-3, and Vanadzor-1.

The Project Development Objective is to increase the reliability and capacity of the transmission network.

Results achieved to date:

     The transmission line replacement works are in progress;
     The tender for the procurement of the contractor to rehabilitate the above three substations is expected to be
      announced in April 2015.

Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) High Voltage Electric Networks of Armenia, the power

Challenge:
Armenia has significant potential for energy efficiency and can recoup sizable economic benefits through the utilization of
this potential. While Armenia is one of the less energy-intensive economies in the region, largely due to structural changes
in the economy, large potential remains for further efficiency improvements. A 2008 World Bank study found that
Armenia could save 132 billion Armenian drams (more than US$360 million) annually, equivalent to 4 percent of its GDP,
through energy-efficiency investments. The study estimated that the energy-efficiency investments in public facilities would
have the highest returns, with paybacks of 2–10 years. The energy-efficiency potential has not been realized due to several
informational, knowledge, financing, and legal obstacles.

Improvements in energy efficiency will contribute to addressing the energy sector challenges. Specifically, higher energy
efficiency will contribute to: (a) a reduction of investment needs in new generation due to a realization of the energy-
efficiency potential; (b) an improvement in the country’s energy security due to a reduced demand for gas used for heating
purposes and as a fuel for electricity generation; and (c) the better affordability of energy for the poor, given that improved
energy efficiency will require less energy consumption to achieve the needed comfort level of heating, lighting, or other use.

The Project Development Objective is to reduce the energy consumption of social and other public facilities. The global
environmental objective is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions through the removal of barriers to the implementation of
energy-efficiency investments in the public sector.
Results achieved to date:

     Implementation of energy-efficiency retrofits has been completed at 44 facilities, which will help reduce their
      energy consumption by 216 million kWh during the economic life of the investments made;
     The above facilities experienced average energy savings of 40–50 percent during winter 2013–15;
     Procurement of retrofits at an additional 25 facilities is under way.

Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund, a nonprofit
organization established by the Government with a mandate to promote the development of renewable energy and energy-
efficiency markets in Armenia and to facilitate investments in these sectors; and (ii) Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources, which is responsible for the overall policy setting.

Challenge:
The livestock sector in Armenia faces serious challenges, such as unsustainable pasture management and underutilization,
persistent livestock diseases, processing and marketing constraints, and reduced productivity. This project builds on World
Bank experience and successes in agriculture, rural development, pasture and livestock management, and participatory
community development to help Armenia address these urgent challenges and provide investment support.
The Project Development Objective is to improve the productivity and sustainability of the pasture/livestock livelihood
systems in selected communities.

Results achieved to date:
 Support for services for farmers involved in livestock production are being improved. Between 2010 and 2014, milk
    productivities for cattle and sheep have increased by 11 and 6 percent, respectively, from 1,428 to 1,585 kg/year for
    cattle and from 66 to 70 kg/year for sheep. The growth rates of animals for cattle and sheep have increased by 12 and
    3 percent, respectively. The efficiency of communal pasture management as measured by increased communal
    budgetary revenues from the lease of pastures has increased by 55 percent, while sales from livestock have increased by
    48 percent.
 Efficient and sustainable community-managed pasture/fodder-based livestock production systems have been
    introduced in selected mountainous communities through establishing farmers associations and leasing pastures and
    grasslands. In addition to the 55 originally planned pasture users associations (PUAs) under the project, 90 more have
    been established and registered. Preparation of 55 pasture management plans has been completed and the
    development of 14 others is under way. Community funds for the implementation of these plans are being established.
 Community animal health services are being improved through the mobilization of veterinarians with the provision of
    training. 76 veterinarians participated in the trainings, of which two were women. Disease control strategies are being
    implemented. Veterinary Service Centers (VSC) in the Artashavan community of the Aragatsotn marz (region) and in
    the Kndzoresk community of the Syunik marz have been completed, and VSCs are equipped and have started
    functioning, while construction works of VSCs in the Chambarak community of the Gegharkunik marz are under
    implementation.
 Activities for the Technology Assessment Program (TAP) are making good progress; 150 out of 262 proposals have
    been presented, of which 109 projects have been implemented and 40 are under implementation.
 Within the framework of Competitive Grants Program (CGP), five rounds of competition have been held and 37 grant
    projects were selected as winners. 18 projects out of the 53 have been completed, while 35 are at different stages of
    implementation. During the seventh round, 27 applications were submitted, 16 projects of which were recognized as
    winners.
Key partners: The Bank works closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and regional governors, as well as village mayors
and farmer groups.

Challenge:
The livestock sector in Armenia faces serious challenges, such as unsustainable pasture management and underutilization,
persistent livestock diseases, processing and marketing constraints, and reduced productivity. This project builds on World
Bank experience and successes in agriculture, rural development, pasture and livestock management, and participatory
community development promoted under the CARMAC project to help Armenia address these urgent challenges and
provide investment support.
The Project Development Objective is to (i) improve the productivity and sustainability of pasture and livestock systems
in targeted communities and (ii) increase the marketed production from selected livestock and high-value agri-food value
chains. This would be evidenced by: (i) increased livestock productivity as measured by milk productivity and an increase in
daily animal weight gain; (ii) the increased efficiency of communal pasture management, as measured by increased
communal budgetary revenues from the lease of pastures; (iii) increased farm sales from livestock; and (iv) increased
pasture management effectiveness.
Key expected results:
 Support for services for farmers involved in livestock production in another 100 communities in addition to the 89
     included under CARMAC will be improved. Between 2015 and 2020, milk productivities for cattle will increase by 20
     percent. The efficiency of communal pasture management as measured by increased communal budgetary revenues
     from the lease of pastures in targeted communities will increase by 150 percent, while the number of animals sold will
     increase by 2 percent for cattle and 20 percent for sheep.
 Efficient and sustainable community-managed pasture/fodder-based livestock production systems will be introduced
     in selected mountainous communities through establishing farmers associations and leasing pastures and grasslands. In
     addition to 89 pasture users associations (PUAs) under the CARMAC project, 100 more are planned under
     CARMAC2. Pasture management plans will be developed for all of them, and community funds for the
     implementation of these plans will be established.
 The ability of agricultural producers and processors to meet domestic demand and access international market
     opportunities in the food value chains of fodder-based milk and meat and in processed fruit and vegetables, where
     Armenia has a competitive advantage, will improve.
 The capacity of public sector institutions to facilitate business development and enable market access in the selected
     value chains supported under the project will increase.
Key partners: The Bank works closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and regional governors, as well as village mayors
and farmer groups.

Challenge:

The main challenge in the sector remains the lack of coordination in information and communications technology (ICT)
development efforts. The main constraints for ICT business development and innovation generation are still the lack of
adequate infrastructure for business incubation and the low access to credit and commercial investments, particularly in
the regions of Armenia.

The Project Development Objective is to address the constraints to a competitive e-society and enterprise innovation
in Armenia by strengthening the underlying infrastructure and enabling environment.
Results achieved to date:
 Citizens and businesses have been equipped with a tool for identifying and authenticating electronic transactions:
    number of electronic certificates (eIDs) issued reached 175,000 in 2013 from zero in baseline year (2009);
 Increased access to affordable computers: the share of population using a computer more than tripled during 2009–
    13, owing to investments by the private sector in the Computer for All program. More than 8,000 computers were
    financed under the project in all 11 regions of Armenia;
 First-ever Early Stage Venture Fund was established in 2013;
 Gyumri Technology Center (GTC) has been established and is contributing to the region’s enterprise innovation:
    GTC opened in February 2014;
 Enhanced capacity and growth of the ICT/knowledge-intensive sector through the establishment and support of IT
    labs and innovations centers: three labs were established owing to project support (mLab, Armenia-India ICT center,
    and Center of Innovative Solutions and Technologies).
Key partners: The World Bank team works closely with the Ministry of Economy and the Project Implementation
Units: Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF), E-Governance Infrastructure Project Implementation Unit (EKENG),
and Foreign Financed Projects Management Center (FFPMC), which are responsible for implementation of the project.

Key development partners include the recently completed USAID-funded Competitive Armenian Private Sector
(CAPS) project, which supported the IT industry as one of the identified competitive clusters with a series of trainings,
consultancy, and other capacity-building activities. Other donors currently do not have major specific projects in these
areas, but some of their projects have an indirect relation to the aforementioned area, such as cluster development,
development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), improvement of the regulatory environment,
community building, etc.

Note: Some of the amounts disbursed amounts may be on client’s bank
account.
Challenge:

The basic challenge has been change management in relation to the introduction of new systems and practices. Civil service
management became possible only due to strong government ownership, and only after the introduction of work planning
and performance and information management systems. Another big challenge is the management of conflicts of interest in
the public sector. Even after the increase of civil servant salaries of about 70 percent, the low level of public salaries remains
a challenge holding up the efficiency gains from the introduction of performance appraisal and pay systems.

The Project Development Objective is to enhance the performance of public sector management for better service
delivery by: (i) strengthening institutional capacity in policy formulation; (ii) maximizing the efficiency of human capital; and
(iii) developing information systems for internal work flow and external communication.
Results achieved to date:
                                                                                               Toward a paperless office
 The Commission on Ethics of High-Ranking Officials was established in
  January 2012 as part of a policy dialogue on conflict of interest management
  reform. The Commission is in charge of conflict of interest, income, and
  asset declarations from about 700 of the highest-level officials.
 The e-disclosures system launched in 2013 fully automated the online
  submission and publication of income and asset declarations. Yet the proper
  verification of collected information requires additional steps for ensuring
  interoperability with other state databases.
 An automated Information Retrieval System in the Traffic Police Service was
  launched in April 2012, reducing, among other indicators, the average time
  for registering a vehicle from one day initially to the current 30 minutes.
 An archiving system for the electronic document management system
  (Mulberry), operational in all ministries, all governors’ offices, and other
  public administration bodies (totaling 50 entities), was launched in 2012.

Key partners: The Bank team is working closely with the (i) Office of the Government of Armenia, which is the main
project counterpart and has been leading the policy efforts on public administration reforms; (ii) Civil Service Council
(CSC) in charge of civil service reform and administration; (iii) Commission on Ethics of High-Ranking Officials; and (iv)

Challenge:

Although the Ministry of Finance (which, following mid-2014 Cabinet reorganization, is in charge of both revenue
administration and public expenditure functions) has successfully maintained an adequate level of revenue collection through
the economic downturn, Armenia’s tax-to-GDP ratio remains low for its level of income. This is the result of narrow tax
bases with numerous tax exemptions and weak capacity to detect and penalize tax frauds, both of which undermine
compliance and contribute to widespread tax evasion and informal sector activities.

The Project Development Objective is to modernize Armenia’s tax administration to (i) increase voluntary tax compliance,
(ii) reduce tax evasion, (iii) reduce compliance costs, and (iv) increase administrative efficiency.
Results achieved to date:

The achievement of the project’s development objectives will be assessed through a number of quantitative outcome
indicators. A few project targets are already met as of end-2014 outcomes:

     US$12.2 million average adjustment results (as of end-2013) from audits against the project baseline of US$10.1
        million (end-of-project target of US$12.1 million);
     95.5 percent ratio of collected revenue to tax administration’s operational cost (as of end-2013) against the project
        baseline of 74 percent (end-of-project target of 83 percent);
     22 tax inspectorates against the baseline number of 39 (end-of-project target of 29);
     321 hours to prepare and pay taxes against the baseline 500 (end-of-project target of 400 hours);
     The percentage of total tax returns filed electronically grew from a baseline of 20 percent to 69.6 percent, exceeding
        the end-of-project target of 60 percent.
Key partners: Through the project’s design, the Bank team has ensured that implementation arrangements are designed to
ensure cross-departmental coordination within the Ministry of Finance.

Key development partners include the representatives from USAID, IFC, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The
project will work in tandem with the USAID Tax Reform project, where USAID will provide extensive complementary
technical assistance.

Challenge:
There is a concern that people may postpone seeking medical care because of a lack of resources, high out-of-pocket
payments, which constitute about 55 percent of total health spending, and the perceived low quality of care, especially in
rural areas. The main challenges in the health system are to ensure better access to health services and to pursue a
reallocation of the health budget toward primary health care (PHC).
The Project Development Objective of the APL2 and Additional Financing of HSMP is focused on (i) completing the
family medicine–based PHC reform (launched in 1996) to ensure that every Armenian citizen will have access to a qualified
and well-motivated family doctor and nurse of his/her choice; (ii) consolidating the hospital sector to minimize the waste of
scarce resources and improve the quality of care; and (iii) strengthening the Government’s competencies for effective
stewardship in policy making, regulation, oversight, and public accountability.
Results achieved to date:
 1,676 physicians have been retrained as family physicians and 1,804 nurses retrained as family nurses. About 90 percent
     of the population is covered by retrained family medicine providers.
 Infrastructure of 94 PHC facilities has been improved (45 new constructions and 49 renovations) in rural areas.
     Construction of one new facility is currently ongoing.
 200 PHC facilities were provided with a standard set of medical equipment, supplies, furniture, and IT equipment.
 Space vacated as a result of the modernization of Yerevan hospitals was 15,577 square meters, and in the regions,
     74,888 square meters.
 726 managers of hospital facilities participated in management training courses; as a result, 48 regional hospitals have
     trained key management personnel.
 Ten regional medical centers (MCs)—in the regions of Kotayk (population of 105,300), Tavush (49,200), Armavir
     (121,500), Ararat (95,300), Syunik (44,700), Aragatsotn (22,300), Gegհarkunik (57,800), Alaverdi (14,000), and Abovyan
     MC (111,5) as well as the new Gyumri Medical Center of the Shirak region (146,000)—were renovated and/or
     constructed and provided with modern medical equipment and furniture. Four regional medical centers are currently
     being renovated/constructed.
Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) Ministry of Health, responsible for the overall policy setting and
implementation of Bank-financed projects; (ii) Ministry of Territorial Administration, responsible for the programs on
regional developments; (iii) local authorities; and (iv) Ministry of Finance, responsible for the Sustainable Development
Program as well as for mid-term expenditures, projections, and programmatic budgeting.

Challenge:

Armenia today faces the dual challenge of the unfinished Millennium Development Goals (MDG) agenda and a record
increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The greatest burden of disease in Armenia, as in most European countries,
comes from NCDs, a group of conditions that includes cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental health problems, diabetes
mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, and musculoskeletal conditions.

The Project Development Objective is to improve (i) maternal and child health (MCH) services and the prevention, early
detection, and management of selected NCDs at the primary health care (PHC) level; and (ii) the efficiency and quality of
selected hospitals in Armenia.
Results achieved to date:

     Training of about 2,700 PHC providers was completed in 2014 during the preparation stage of population
        screening programs for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cervical cancer;
     85 percent of antenatal care (ANC) attendees screened for glycosuria, hypertension, and proteinuria in at least three
        antenatal visits;
     60 percent of population aged 40–74 screened for hypertension at least once in the past year (by gender);
     From 57 to 60 percent of population aged 40–74 screened for diabetes mellitus at the PHC level at least once
        during the past three years (by gender);
     50 percent of women aged 30–60 screened for cervical cancer at least once during the past three years and received
        the results;
     80 percent bed occupancy rate at the new Medical Center in Vanadzor;
     For 63 percent of MCH services and 66 percent of NCDs, the quality of care was provided by doctors measured by
        clinical vignettes.
Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the (i) Ministry of Health, responsible for the overall policy setting and
implementation of Bank-financed projects; (ii) Ministry of Territorial Administration, responsible for the programs on
regional developments; (iii) Armenian Medical Association; and (iv) Ministry of Finance, responsible for the Sustainable
Development Program, as well as for mid-term expenditures, projections, and programmatic budgeting.

Key development partners include several international organizations, in particular, WHO, UNICEF, World Vision, and
Save the Children, which are involved in different components of health care reform undertaken by the Government of
Armenia.

Challenge:

Since 1990, the continued investment in education has been aimed at the reduction of poverty by increasing access to, and
improving the quality of, general secondary education. The current project addresses the challenge of sustaining and
extending the accomplishments in general secondary education and at the same time, addressing equity and quality concerns
in both preschool and tertiary education.

The Project Development Objective of the second phase of the Education Quality and Relevance Project (EQRP)
continues to focus on reform of the general secondary education system and addresses key policy issues in preschool and
secondary and higher education through: (i) enhancing school learning in general education and improving the school
readiness of children entering primary education; and (ii) supporting the integration of the Armenian tertiary education
system into the European Higher Education Area.
Results achieved to date:

  337 preschool education microprojects benefiting over 8,000 students have been implemented since the beginning of the
     project (13,500 students since June 2008).
  The project has supported the training of over 12,500 teachers.
  Since January 2013, all public schools in Armenia are connected to the Internet with support from the project.
  Internet speed for the network has been increased from 256 kilobytes to at least 3 megabytes.
  1,360 schools have received hardware to support their administrative activities.
  Resource centers combining library and computer labs have been established in 108 high schools. Training has been
     provided to 105 librarians, and 2,300 high school teachers have received subject-based training.
  The National Center for Professional Education Quality Assurance completed pilot institutional accreditation of 10
     public and five private universities. From this, two public universities received pilot institutional and pilot program
     accreditation by an international accreditation agency (NVAO). 21 public and five private universities received grants to
     implement Internal Quality Assurance units.
  A tertiary education management information system (MIS) is in operation covering all vocational and higher educational
     institutions.
  Implementation of 10 subprojects under the pilot Competitive Innovation Fund (CIF) is ongoing.
  A long-term twinning arrangement took place between Armenia State Pedagogical University and Oulu University in
     Finland for technical assistance on reforming preservice teacher education.
Key partners: The Bank team works closely with the Ministry of Education and Science, responsible for the overall policy
setting as well as for the implementation of Bank-financed projects; and with the Ministry of Finance, responsible for

The Project Development Objectives of the Education Improvement Project focus on: (i) improving the school readiness
of children entering primary education; (ii) improving physical conditions and the availability of educational resources in
upper-secondary schools; and (iii) supporting improved quality and relevance in higher education institutions in Armenia.

Expected key results:
    About 120 new grant microprojects will be awarded to poor communities in Armenia to support preschool
       expansion benefiting about 2,500 children. Children who benefit from preschool are projected to score 9–13 percent
       higher in the early development indicator.
    17 (out of 107) high schools in Armenia will be fully renovated and retrofitted with seismic stability to meet current
       construction and safety standards. This means about 225 classrooms will be renovated in these 17 high schools.
    All 107 high schools in Armenia will be equipped with up-to-date education resources provided by the project.
    An integrated education management information system for general and higher education will be fully operational
       and expanded nationwide. About 4,000 staff will be trained to use the newly integrated system.
    At least 10 higher education institutions or consortium of universities will receive grants under the Competitive
       Innovation Fund to strengthen the relevance, quality, and efficiency of their academic programs.

Challenge: The improvements in living conditions witnessed in the country before the 2009 global financial crisis have since
reversed, with increased inequality and more instances of people falling below the poverty line. In post-crisis Armenia,
improvements in living conditions have remained slow, renewing the Government’s focus on the efficiency of the social service
delivery system and effectiveness of the Family Benefit Program. These efforts need further enhancement to cope with protracted
and high unemployment, poverty, and vulnerability, which disproportionately affect women.

The Project Development Objectives are to (i) improve social protection service delivery and (ii) strengthen the analytical and
monitoring and evaluation functions of the agencies delivering social protection benefits and services.

Key expected results:

    The project will support the model of the functional integration of four existing agencies responsible for pensions, social
       assistance, employment, and disability certification.
    This model will be rolled out to another 37 Integrated Social Protection Centers. The activities, from civil works to
       furniture and IT equipment with software provision, as well as trainings and on-the-job mentoring along with a proactive
       communication with the public, will ensure the fully operational nature of the centers, delivering high-quality services
       tailored to the needs of the beneficiaries.
    Among the beneficiaries, this project will also target the registered unemployed and employers by promoting employment
       intermediation and employer-employee matching, thereby increasing labor market efficiency and job opportunities.
    Implementation of the Government’s New Employment Strategy will come in a number of ways, such as by providing
       capacity building of the state employment agency via trainings and modernized IT infrastructure and expanding career
       orientation through skills-tailored distance learning programs. It is expected that about 1,400 men and women will benefit
       equally from this orientation program, along with 700 who are enrolled in the Youth without Education and Skills
       Program.
    The project will finance an integrated system of monitoring and evaluation of social protection benefits and services,
       targeting over 70 different programs. This would enable the Ministry of Labor and Social Issues to directly manage the
       beneficiary feedback, specifically collecting information on the quality of delivered services.
    The project will support the State Social Security Service in improving and upgrading its core business processes. A risk-
       based fraud-and-error supervision software and system, along with improved human resource management capacity, such
       as central payment services for the integrated social delivery system, will be developed and made fully operational. In
       addition, it is expected that by the end of the project, the average time required for processing a pension case would
       decrease by three times.
Key partners: The Bank works closely with the Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, as well as with its detached unit, the State
Employment Service Agency.

Key development partners involved in different components of the social protection reform are UNICEF and USAID.

Challenge:

Notwithstanding infrastructure investments in recent years, major local social infrastructure gaps have remained, largely reflecting
years of neglect in maintenance. Social infrastructure gaps have been most acute in the rural areas. Another main challenge was
improving the living standards of the poor as, despite the strong economic growth before the crisis, Armenia was facing critical
vulnerabilities, stemming from the global economic and financial crisis. Three Additional Financings were provided to support
small-scale infrastructure investments that also helped generate employment and mitigate the impact of the crisis by supporting
activities that can be quickly and effectively scaled up and implemented under the existing project.

The Project Development Objective is to support the Government’s policy to raise the living standards of poor and vulnerable
groups through: (i) improving the quality, access, and coverage of community services and infrastructure in poor communities; (ii)
promoting complementary institutional capacity building at the community and municipal level so as to improve the quality and
sustainability of community investments and service delivery, increase accountability, and enhance greater stakeholder
empowerment at the local level; and (iii) creating employment associated with the provision of community infrastructure and
services.
Key results achieved:
 320 community infrastructure microprojects were completed with 637,098 job-days of employment created and US$10.7
    million in wage income. The total number of beneficiaries of completed microprojects is estimated at about 1.7 million,
    almost half of Armenia’s population.
 The largest share of the completed microprojects belongs to schools (41 percent), followed by community and cultural centers
    (28 percent), kindergartens (14 percent), health care facilities (7 percent), and potable water supply systems (5 percent).
 The beneficiary communities were selected based on their poverty ranking. The poverty mapping and ranking methodology
    was developed under the project for 915 communities (866 rural and 49 urban) and was last updated in December 2011.
 Over 5,200 local community members (355 communities) received training on investment planning and management, and 716
    municipal officials from 145 communities received training on financial management.
 The Government, with World Bank support, developed an Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF) evolution strategy and
    approved it in March 2014. As of April 1, 2015, ASIF was transformed into the Armenian Territorial Development Fund.
Key partners: The Bank team worked closely with the (i) Ministry of Territorial Administration and Emergency Situations
responsible for the overall policy setting and implementation support; (ii) Ministry of Finance; and (iii) Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs, involved in policy dialogue and providing implementation support.
Key development partners included the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation (SDC), All Armenia Fund, Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), Aznavour pour

Challenge:

Armenia has had a relatively low export base and seen a declining sophistication in export products over the years, while its
export basket is primarily concentrated in commodities that have low value added and are vulnerable to volatility in global
markets. Another challenge is to attract efficiency-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) to maximize benefits to the local
economy. Furthermore, while the requirements to meet global quality standards are more crucial to promote products and
services, Armenia’s national quality infrastructure suffers from weaknesses that hinder technology upgrading and undermine
the competitiveness of its exports.

The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the Government’s capacity to provide export promotion, investment
attraction, and quality management services to firms.
Key expected results:
      At least 40 contracts with new customers for exporters will be generated through newly established foreign
         representatives of the Armenian Development Foundation (ADF);
      Seven facilities in the form of public private partnerships (PPPs) will be created to strengthen industry clusters
         (cluster development PPPs) and to facilitate efficiency-seeking FDI to strengthen their level of engagement in
         Armenia and facilitate skills development by funding joint projects between multinationals and academia (research
         and skills development PPPs);
      Four new FDIs will be generated through the services provided by ADF;
      Two Industrial Laboratories of the National Institute of Metrology will be internationally recognized;
      A National Accreditation Body will obtain international recognition;
      The project will support the training of technical staff of the national quality infrastructure.


Key partners: The Bank works closely with the Ministry of Economy (MoE), which is responsible for the overall
implementation of the project, the Project Management Unit (PMU) within the MoE, which is charged with coordination
and management of implementation activities on a day-to-day basis, and the Foreign Financed Projects Management Center
(FFPMC), which is responsible for the fiduciary aspects of project activities.

Challenge:
Armenia has no fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on energy imports. Underinvestment in renewable energy
projects, particularly in small hydropower plants, is one of the major barriers to greater energy self-sufficiency. At
the same time, long-term funding is scarce in Armenia.

Project Objective:
Ameriabank, one of Armenia’s strongest and most innovative banks, is seeking to pioneer local renewable energy
financing. IFC has lent the bank US$15 million for a series of smaller, green subloans. Related advisory services
from the IFC Armenia Sustainable Energy Finance Project helped the bank’s staff learn to develop sound
sustainable energy finance products.

The project has enabled the bank to provide long-term financing for small hydropower plants, which has helped
increase Armenia’s domestic electricity production, diversify its electricity supply, and decrease its reliance on fuel
imports. This has boosted the supply of renewable energy and cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Key results:
IFC’s US$15 million loan, together with advisory support from the IFC Armenia Sustainable Energy Finance
Project, has helped Ameriabank finance the construction of 12 small hydropower plants. They have a total installed
capacity of 40.1 megawatts and generate 124.91 gigawatt hours per year. They prevent the release of nearly 50,000
tons of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent, per year.

Donor Partners: Hungarian Partnership Funding/Hungary EXIM Bank and the Ministry of Finance of Austria

Challenge:
The World Bank Group has identified the promotion of sustainable growth and productivity as a pillar for
economic and social development in Armenia and outlined the steps necessary to create a more competitive
investment climate. The Armenia Investment Climate Reform Project is part of this effort. A previous Investment
Climate Reform Project implemented in 2011–14 helped the Government of Armenia design and adopt framework
reforms in inspections, trade logistics, food safety, and tax. However, some areas need further improvements.
Enhanced transparency, a stronger investment policy, and a reformed inspection process will boost private sector
growth and job creation by increasing investment and decreasing the costs for doing business, particularly in the
agribusiness sector.

The Project Approach:
The Armenia Investment Climate Reform Project II will provide specialized advisory services to the Government
in the areas of investment policy and inspections reform. The aim is to promote confidence and transparency,
strengthen effectiveness and compliance, and accelerate private sector growth by creating simple, efficient, and
business-friendly regulations while ensuring that public interests are protected.

Project Objective:
The Armenia Investment Climate Reform Project II has two main objectives: (a) improve investment policy by
enhancing the current framework in terms of investment entry, protection, and the transparency and governance of
investment incentives; and (b) reform business inspections by improving the system and enhancing regulatory
certainty and efficiency.

Expected Results:
    Generate new investment, especially in the agricultural sector;
    Increase the accessibility and quality of the implementation of investment policy;
    Improve the inspections system with a focus on regulatory certainty and optimization;
    Achieve compliance cost savings for the private sector through an improved inspections system;
    Increase the confidence and trust of businesses in the inspections system.

      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROGRAM IN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA (2012–15)

Donor partners: the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the Development Bank of Austria
(OeEB).

Challenge:
Good corporate governance assists companies and financial institutions in enhancing their sustainability, access to
capital, and performance. Yet many companies and financial institutions in Europe and Central Asia lack the
knowledge and experience necessary to strengthen their governance practices so as to realize the real benefits such
practices can bring. Local consultants and institutions also lack the skills needed to help businesses improve their
corporate governance. In addition, the corporate governance framework in many countries is in need of further
enhancement.

The IFC Approach:
The program provides in-depth advice to companies and financial institutions on implementing good corporate
governance practices, strengthens the capacity of local partner institutions to deliver director-focused training and
corporate governance services, and contributes advice on the corporate governance aspects of laws, codes,
                                                      30
regulations, and other tools.

Expected Results:
    The program aims to support its partners in Europe and Central Asia to raise US$180,000 in sales revenue
       through corporate governance work, to improve the performance of 32 companies through corporate
       governance improvements, and to help 24 companies access financing totaling US$100 million.


         RESOURCE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM IN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA (2010–15)

Donor partner: the Ministry of Finance of Austria

Challenge:
The efficient use of energy, raw materials, and water along a company’s value chain not only helps conserve
resources and reduce waste, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, but also reduces operating costs. Yet many
firms in Europe and Central Asia remain unaware of the potential cost savings and environmental benefits. As a
result, firms are reluctant to invest the upfront costs needed to identify and take advantage of resource-efficiency
opportunities.

The IFC Approach:
The program works at the firm and sector levels to stimulate investment in resource-efficient technologies and best
practices, improve management and operational practices across industries, raise awareness among policy makers
and financial institutions, and drive market transformation through sector studies, such as benchmarking and
assessment tools.

Expected Results:
    The program aims to facilitate the investment of US$90 million and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
       120,000 tons of CO2 equivalent annually in Europe and Central Asia.


  AGRIBUSINESS STANDARDS ADVISORY PROGRAM IN EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL
                                ASIA (2013–16)

Donor partner: The Ministry of Finance of Austria

The Challenge:
The agribusiness industry is a vital contributor to the economies of Europe and Central Asia. However, inadequate
food safety standards keep the region’s agribusiness industry from advancing, while food companies are shut out of
the modern food value chains, potentially aggravating global food security.

The IFC Approach:
The IFC program assists local companies in applying food safety standards throughout the agribusiness value chain
while also strengthening the capacity of local consultants. Improved standards will help agribusiness firms meet
regional and export market requirements while building a foundation to mobilize investments and help the
agribusiness industry realize its full potential.

Expected Results:
The IFC Program is expected to:
    increase the number of companies with food safety management systems in place, boosting their
       competitiveness, investment attractiveness, and export opportunities;
    facilitate an increase in domestic and export sales by client companies;
    facilitate investments as a result of improved food safety management;
    build capacity among local consultants and firms;
    create a demonstration effect for how to do business more sustainably, across the region and globally.

       ARMENIA: BANK ADVISORY PROGRAM IN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA (2009–15)

Donor partners: the Development Bank of Austria and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs

The Challenge:
The Europe and Central Asia region was among the hardest hit by the global financial crisis, and many financial
institutions remain vulnerable to further instability and lack the confidence to restart lending to the micro, small,
and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) sector in particular. This is a byproduct of insufficient knowledge of best
practice MSME lending skills and a limited understanding of how to manage risk and high rates of nonperforming
loans (NPLs).

The IFC Approach:
The program provides in-depth advice to help financial institutions reduce NPLs, improve risk management, and
increase lending to MSMEs. It also supports the development of a market for distressed assets, increases awareness
of best international practices in risk and NPL management, and supports the development of MSME banking with
a focus on gender finance.

Results achieved to date:
    The project has helped clients in Europe and Central Asia release more than US$51 million for new
        lending and facilitated a further US$17 million in new financing to clients.


                  ARMENIA: SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FINANCE PROJECT (2009–15)

Donor partner: the Ministry of Finance of Austria

The Challenge:
Despite good land and water resources, Armenia imports around two-thirds of its energy. Obsolete power
generation equipment and minimal investment in renewable energy, particularly in small hydropower plants, are the
major barriers to greater energy efficiency. The Armenian industrial sector could save up to 14.5 percent of its
energy costs by improving energy efficiency. Several international financial institutions are providing energy-
efficiency financing opportunities directly and through local financing institutions, yet significant potential remains
untapped. This is mainly due to the affordability of existing financing and low awareness among Armenian
companies of the potential for operational cost savings through energy-efficiency investments.

The IFC Approach:
The IFC Armenia Sustainable Energy Finance Project aims to establish a sustainable market for investments in
energy efficiency and renewable energy. The project works with local and international financial institutions to
develop Armenia’s energy self-sufficiency.

Results achieved to date:
    IFC invested US$55 million in energy efficiency and renewable energy financing through local banks;
    Over 40 megawatts of new renewable power generation capacity installed through client investments;
    Over 125 gigawatt hours-per-year increase in renewable energy generation through client investments;
    More than 35 gigawatt hours of energy saved each year.
