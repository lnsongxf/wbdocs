I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Botswana perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Botswana regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Botswana;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Botswana;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Botswana;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Botswana.
    Use data to help inform Botswana country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
From May to June 2013, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in Botswana were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from employees of the Office of the President,
Prime Minister; office of ministers; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation
agencies; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; and respondents from bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
financial sector and private banks; NGOs; CBOs; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and other
organizations. A total of 241 stakeholders participated in the survey (80% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Botswana; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Botswana; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Botswana.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Botswana: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Botswana is
    headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
    development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
    and generating economic growth in Botswana.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Botswana, staff preparedness to help
   Botswana solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses,
   the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Botswana, with which
   stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank
   should focus most resources, to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global
   development agenda, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed/slow reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Botswana’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across twenty eight development areas, such as job creation/employment,
   poverty reduction, education, health, and public sector governance/reform.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality. Respondents were asked to also indicate to
   what extent they believe that Botswana received value for money from the Bank’s fee -based
   products/services.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Ba nk’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Botswana’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Botswana: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Botswana in the near future and to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value. They were asked to indicate where greater
   support from the Bank would be most valuable in regard to economic diversification, social
   protection, natural resource management, information and communication technology,
   transport infrastructure, and public sector reform. Respondents were also asked to indicate
   the areas in which Botswana would benefit most from the Bank play a leading role, the areas
   where Botswana should receive little to no resources from the Bank, and areas that should be
   left to the Government to manage without the Bank’s support.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank ’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website, which Internet connection they
   primarily use when visiting a Bank website, and whether they use/have used the Public
   Information Centers in Botswana.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Botswana, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the Office of President, Prime Minister and the
        Office of Minister were combined; respondents from PMUs were combined with
        consultants/contractors working on Bank projects; respondents from bilateral agencies
        were combined with respondents from multilateral agencies; respondents from private
        sector organizations were combined with respondents from financial sector/private banks;

        with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectivene ss in Botswana, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the Bank’s perceived relevance to Botswana’s development,
        and the Bank’s perceived ability to help achieve development results in Botswana.

Headed in the Right Direction

       A majority of respondents from the Office of President/Prime Minister/Minister,
        bilateral/multilateral agencies, and CSOs, and employees of ministries/ministerial
        departments/implementation agencies indicated that Botswana was headed in the right
        direction, whereas most the respondents from the media, academia/research
        institutes/think tanks, PMUs and consultants/contractors working on bank-supported
        projects held an opposite view. Respondents from these stakeholder groups were
        significantly more likely to indicate that Botswana was headed in the wrong direction or
        they were not sure whether Botswana was headed in the right or wrong direction.

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s

        respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on Bank projects gave the
        highest ratings, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended
        to give significantly lower ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Botswana, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results inc rease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Botswana. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at gender;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at communication/non-communicable diseases.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Botswana, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at basic infrastructure;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Botswana or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Botswana, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Botswana. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Botswana. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer
a question, please leave it blank.
