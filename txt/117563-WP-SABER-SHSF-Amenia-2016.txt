   Policy Goals                                                                                        Status
    1. Policy Frameworks
       Although not specifically mentioned in the Armenia Development Strategy, school
       feeding is included in the Mid-term Expenditure Framework 2016–18 and mentioned in
       the draft Education Development Programme, 2016–25. There is no national school
       feeding policy but a Sustainable School Feeding Strategy.

    2. Financial Capacity
       School feeding is included in the national planning process, and the national funding is
       stable through a budget line but unable to cover all needs.

    3. Institutional Capacity and Coordination
       The minister’s decree of June 24, 2015, N613-A/Q establishes the Inter-ministerial
       Working Group. The Implementation Unit within the Ministry of Education is mentioned
       by strategy and is to be staffed with professionals. A regional-level coordination group
       was established in November 2013 in Vayots Dzor Province (province). However, the
       policies on institutional capacity and coordination should be revised to lead to an
       effective implementation.

    4. Design and Implementation
       A School Feeding Monitoring and Evaluation plan is not integrated into national systems.
       The national program has defined targets. Issues still remain with food safety and
       compliance with international nutritional requirements. The current system does not
       facilitate purchases from small farmers.

    5. Community Roles—Reaching beyond Schools
       School management committees exist. However, their roles are not clearly defined in
       any guidelines.

The last policy goal is community roles—reaching
beyond schools. School feeding programs that are locally
owned, incorporate contributions from local
communities, and respond to specific community needs
are often the strongest. These programs are most likely
to make a successful transition from donor assistance to
national ownership. Community participation should be
considered at every stage, but without overburdening
community members.

Use of Evidence-Based Tools

The primary focus of the SABER–School Feeding exercise
is to gather systematic and verifiable information about
the quality of a country’s policies through a SABER–
School Feeding questionnaire. This data-collecting
instrument helps to facilitate comparative policy
analysis, identify key areas to focus investment, and
disseminate good practices and knowledge sharing. This
holistic and integrated assessment of how the overall
policy in a country affects young children’s development
is categorized into one of the following stages,
representing the varying levels of policy development
that exist among different dimensions of school feeding:

    Latent: No or very little policy development
    Emerging: Initial/some initiatives toward policy
    development.
    Established: Some policy development

feeding program is estimated at $6.4 million. The
allocation from the state budget to the school feeding
program represents approximately 20 percent of the
entire school feeding budget, communities contribute
16.5 percent, and WFP provides the largest portion of
the overall budget with a 63.5 percent contribution.
Contributions from the private sector are not known. The
allocated budget per child per year is estimated at $50.

The figures indicate that the state budget allocated for
school feeding is not sufficient to cover all expenses. It is
also fixed over the year and does not account for
inflation and rising electricity and gas prices. Not all of
the ministries (other than the Ministry of Education and
Science) involved in the program have a budget allocated
to school feeding. The overall budget for school feeding
in Armenia is not conducive to diet diversity. Capacity
building could be further strengthened to ensure
budgets and plans are well elaborated.

The main constraints to community participation are
listed as lack of resources, limited legal framework, and
lack of initiatives and structure. Currently no formal
training is provided for school committees.

    Conclusion                                                    ¾ Develop a funding strategy and seek additional funding

    Although some sectorial policy documents refer to             ¾   Set up thematic technical working groups to address

    and does not account for inflation and rising electricity       school feeding
    and gas prices. Additionally, no suitable mechanism
    accounts for coordination and implementation of the
    national school feeding program. Interministerial
    coordination is of utmost importance, and the
    Interministerial Working Group should be revived and
    have a clear work plan and objectives. The necessity to
    create a unit specifically dedicated to school feeding with
    qualified personnel remains one of the priorities because
    it is a critical element for the program’s sustainability.
    Moreover, special attention should be given to small
    local producers and the implementation of mechanisms
    to increase local production purchases (home-grown
    school feeding model). Action must be taken to promote
    the participation and contribution of communities in
    implementing school feeding programs. The following
    policy options represent possible areas where school
    feeding could be strengthened, based on the conclusions
    of this report.

    Policy Options

¾ Ensure school feeding is included in national and all
  relevant sector policies
¾ Improve interministerial coordination and develop terms
  of reference for the involvement of the following
  ministries in the Interministerial Working Group:
  Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of
  Agriculture, Ministry of Territorial Administration and
  Development, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
     produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
     institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
     their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
     policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
     tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
     with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policy makers and business people—an accessible, objective
     snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
     system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

     This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of School Feeding.
