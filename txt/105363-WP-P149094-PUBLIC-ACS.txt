                                         Executive Summary

Introduction

1. For the economy to attain its full potential, the Philippines requires an efficient water
transport system. However, this is presently not the case. The domestic shipping industry is
characterized by high costs, low quality of service, and a poor safety record . Logistics cost
accounts for 24-53 percent of wholesale price, while shipping and port handling cost around 8
percent of wholesale price and 5 percent of retail price.2 Philippine domestic shipping is
generally more expensive than in Malaysia or Indonesia—2 other archipelagos. Moreover, it is
more expensive to transport goods between 2 Philippine ports than between 2 Philippine
ports via an international port. In the East Asia region, the Philippines trails behind its
neighbors in various logistics performance and connectivity indices. For instance, in liner
shipping connectivity, the Philippines ranked 66th out of 157 countries in 2013, and performs
the worst among a group of East Asian comparators. 3,4 Delays in shipment, slow cargo
handling, and frequent accidents are the top complaints of businesses. In the East Asia Region,
the Philippines has the highest absolute casualty rate and this is 40 percent higher than the
second ranked country, Indonesia.5 On average, there are 228 ships involved in accidents and
303 casualties per year in the Philippines.

2. Among the probable causes of the poor state of the domestic shipping industry are the
constraints on competition existing within the domestic shipping market. Removing
competition constraints and enhancing competitiveness of shipping companies would result in
greater efficiency, increased capacity, improved quality of ships, lower costs, and lower freight
rates that would enhance the competitiveness of Philippine agricultural products.

3. However, intensifying competition does not necessarily imply more competitors on
individual routes. In the Philippines, as in other countries, few operators serve most
domestic shipping routes. Of the 54 primary routes for which data was obtained in this
assessment, over 40 percent were served by a single operator. A further third were served by
just 2 operators, and less than one quarter were served by 3 or more competitors.

4. This concentration is not surprising. There are 2 main characteristics of the industry that
lead to this outcome:


2
  These prices are averages based on a sample of goods. See Tables 6 and 7 for a list of references for these
goods.
3
  The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It
is computed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) based on 5 components of
the maritime transport sector: number of ships, their container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number
of services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports.
4
  It can be argued that Philippine ships serving domestic routes are less efficient than Philippine ships serving
international routes, given the high rate of maritime accidents and complaints from businesses. In this case, the
liner shipping connectivity score for the Philippines provides an upper bound for the performance of domestic
ships.
5
  The Philippines also has the highest relative casualty rate, surpassing Myanmar. This is measured by the ratio of
total casualties to total fleet size.

                                                                                                                 4
       There are significant economies of scale in ship operations: many cost items — such as
        construction costs, crewing, insurance and repair and maintenance costs — increase
        less than proportionately with vessel size.
       Frequency is an important aspect of the quality of service that a shipping company
        offers to its major customers. All other things being equal, a service that offers 2
        sailings a week is likely to be more attractive to a potential customer — particularly a
        large shipper of perishable products — than a service offering only a single sailing.

A high degree of concentration on individual routes is therefore a natural consequence of
market characteristics, and is unlikely to change.

5. Given relatively concentrated markets, the threat of potential entry is often the major
force disciplining market behavior. Fortunately, natural barriers to entry in the shipping sector
are relatively low. Although significant capital investment is required, the overwhelming
majority of this investment is in the ships themselves. These assets are extremely mobile, and
can be readily redeployed to another market if entry is unsuccessful. Also, for the most part,
the technology used in the shipping industry is generic and readily available for potential new
entrants.

6. For these reasons, in the absence of regulatory or legislative barriers, the threat of entry is
likely to be real and constant. It is also likely to be effective in disciplining market behavior.
This is because the stakes for the incumbent operator are very high. One consequence of
concentration is that successful new entry may not mean that an incumbent simply loses
market share; it may mean it is forced to abandon the market altogether, if the incumbent
does not adjust their services.

7. In older regulatory regimes, such as that which existed in the Philippines prior to the
passage of the Domestic Shipping Development Act of 20046, this process was regarded as
destructive competition. However, it is more appropriate, and more consistent with the
deregulatory direction of the Domestic Shipping Development Act of 2004, to regard entry and
exit as essential parts of the dynamics of the market. It is the means by which competition
ensures that shipping lines operate efficiently and do not make excess profits.

8. In seeking to enhance competition in the delivery of domestic shipping services, this
assessment has therefore focused particularly on measures that would increase the
opportunities and incentives for new players to enter the market, and for existing operators
to expand or vary the services they offer.

The need for clarity and simplicity

9. The stakeholder consultation process undertaken as part of this assessment revealed that

 Republic Act No. 9295, An Act Promoting the Development of Philippine Domestic Shipping, Shipbuilding, Ship
Repair and Ship Breaking, Ordaining Reforms in Government Policies Towards Shipping in the Philippines, May 3
2004.
                                                                                                           5
the regulatory system is inconsistently understood. Amongst industry participants, there
were, for example, differences of views on the criteria that applied to the issuance of a
Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), and what this implied for the ease (or otherwise) with
which one could be obtained. There was uncertainty as to whether an operator who had
received a CPC as a tramper vessel (that is, without specifying the intended route for the
vessel) could then use that vessel to operate a scheduled service as a common carrier. There
were different understandings of the conditions under which foreign registered vessels on
charter to Filipino shipping companies could be used to provide domestic shipping services.

10. These regulatory uncertainties can in themselves constitute a barrier to entry. Potential
new entrants face a lower business risk when the rules that apply in the target market, and the
way in which they are applied, are clearly understood by all parties. Uncertainties tend to bias
the market in favor of incumbents: where the rules are unclear, those who have been
operating in the market for some time can draw on their experience of how things operate,
while newcomers do not have this advantage. Improving clarity and certainty will therefore
have a pro-competitive effect.

11. Improved communication can help, but the most powerful tool for improving
understanding is simplification. Over time, most regulatory systems accrue rules, practices
and procedures that may once have been necessary but which are no longer required or
appropriate to current conditions. These historical accretions make the system more complex
and less transparent than it need be. This appears to have happened in the case of the
regulation of domestic shipping in the Philippines. Enhancing the competitive environment
therefore requires a review of all regulations and practices that could — actually or potentially
— restrict the flexibility of shipping lines to provide services wherever, whenever and (subject
to safety and environmental constraints) with whatever ships they see a commercial
opportunity to do so.

Direction forward

12. The key task in enhancing the competitiveness of domestic shipping is to ensure the
effective operation in the market for shipping services. Many of the recommendations that
follow therefore focus on measures that will serve to ensure that some market participants do
not enjoy an unfair advantage over others, as well as measures that lower regulatory barriers
to entry.

13. But improving competitiveness also requires reform of regulations that increase the
costs faced by all shipping operators. The direction forward therefore includes
recommendations to reform regulations and practices that raise, or may tend to raise, the
costs faced by incumbents and new entrants alike. Since markets work more effectively when
decisions are based on timely and accurate information, the direction forward also includes
recommendations designed to improve the quality of information available to both regulators
and market participants.




                                                                                               6
14. Finally, successful implementation of the reforms is expected to generate an annual
increase of at least USD 18 million in aggregate private sector investments.7 By eliminating
the different regulatory barriers to investment in the shipping industry, the costs of entering
and operating new shipping capacity becomes less prohibitive for the private sector. This
should positively impact the profitability of shipping companies and lead to additional
investment in new capacity by both new and existing firms.

Creating a level playing field

Remove opportunity for incumbents to object to granting of the CPC

15. Any person wishing to operate a commercial domestic shipping service in the Philippines
must first obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience. The criteria that govern the issue of a
CPC, the process by which it is issued, and the conditions that are attached to it can therefore
all affect the extent of effective competition in the shipping market.

16. In the present process, an application for a CPC to operate a new service can be
challenged by an operator already providing services in the relevant market (based on the
Maritime Industry Authority’s (MARINA) implementing regulations). The incumbent
operators can contest the feasibility study of the new applicant by arguing that the market is
too small to accommodate an additional participant and that new entry would not be
financially viable.

17. There is a range of views on whether this provision has, in practice, a substantial effect
on the ease with which operators can introduce new services. But it clearly creates the
possibility that an incumbent will use the process to delay the entry of a new competitor (as
indicated by a small shipping operator); to add to the cost that the competitor faces in
entering the market; and, in the extreme case, to block entry altogether. The process appears


7
 Removing barriers to entry in the shipping sector is expected to generate an expansion of business by existing
shipping companies as well as the potential entry of new market players – these are assumed to increase
competitive pressure and lead to lower freight rates and better quality of services. The effects of removing
barriers to entry would be estimated on additional investment in the sector. In the Philippines, the six largest
companies that transport containerized goods invest around $36 million annually, given their evolution of fixed
assets and assuming that the annual investment consists in the year-on-year difference in the stock of fixed assets
plus the replacement of depreciating capital (8% depreciation rate). These companies capture about 88% of the
market shares, so by extrapolating we assume that total investment in container ships is around $40 million.
Therefore there is an assumption of a reduction in per nautical miles freight rates of 20% due to increase
competitive pressure. Price elasticity of demand for transport is assumed to be relatively low over four years - a
price drop of 20% is assumed to increase demand for transport of containerized goods on domestic routes. The
effects associated with removal of one of the barriers to entry (i.e., prior operator rule for the issuance of
certificate of public convenience) are expected to: 1) facilitate the purchase and lease of newer vessels and
younger vessels are more expensive and 2) give a one-off boost in the quality of ships (cold chain facilities etc.)
when ships are renewed. According to local industry experts the average age of vessels is expected to fall by 10%.
Locally gathered data of the prices of 3500-5000 GRT geared ships that can transport containerized goods
suggests that a 10% decrease of fleet age is associated with a 6% increase in the value of the vessel. According to
the industry experts it is expected that such a reform provides a 2% one-off quality boost. Taking these two
effects into account, the value of assets per metric ton transported would rise by 8% to $16.2. The investment
necessary to expand capacities to cover demand for transport of 1.1 million additional metric tons of
containerized goods would therefore amount to $18 million (over four years).
                                                                                                                 7
to be a legacy of the period of regulated domestic shipping that preceded RA 9295.

18. RA 9295 is expressly deregulatory in intent8, and formally established the ability of
domestic shipping operators to establish their own rates. It preserved the requirement that
operators obtain a CPC, and that, in their application for a CPC, operators specify the service
that they intend to provide. But it does not expressly require the MARINA to assess or form a
judgment on the effect of granting the application on the viability of pre-existing services.
Rather, insofar as it refers to the impact of the proposed service on third parties, the clear
focus is on “the economic and beneficial effect, which the proposed services shall have to the
port province or region which it proposes to serve”.

Focus CPC conditions on quality standards

19. Effective competition in domestic shipping does require that all participants are held to
the same safety and environmental standards. The process of issuing Certificates of Public
Convenience can be a useful regulatory tool in ensuring that this condition is met. The
intention that it should do so is clear in RA 9295, which requires that MARINA, in granting an
application for a CPC, take into consideration, “the financial capacity of the domestic ship
operator to provide and sustain safe, reliable, adequate, efficient and economic service”.9

Facilitating greater competition between operators

Streamline the CPC process

20. The application process for a CPC is quite expensive for the applicant due to the
application and other MARINA fees, publication requirements, and legal fees. Many of these
steps are repetitive and may be further streamlined to minimize the processing time and costs
for the issuance of the CPC.

21. Once the concept of objection by incumbents is eliminated from the process of awarding
a CPC, there is no longer any need for an ex ante quasi-judicial process. This should facilitate
a significant reduction in both the time and the cost involved in granting a CPC application, and
help refocus MARINA’s activities on ensuring that all participants are held to the same safety
and environmental standards.

Use a single form of CPC

22. At present, CPCs are divided into “liner CPCs” and “tramper CPCs”; however, there does
not appear to be any effective mechanism for preventing the holder of a tramper CPC from
operating a regular scheduled service that provides cargo space to a variety of customers;
that is, from operating a liner service. From an economic perspective, this is not a bad thing.
Operators of tramp ships are an important source of potential new entry on liner routes, and
allowing them to freely do so enhance the competitive environment. But there seems little to

be gained from continuing to formally distinguish between the 2 forms of CPC and the
interests of clarity and certainty would be served by eliminating this distinction.

Allow greater flexibility within a CPC

23. In applying for a CPC, the shipping operator is required to specify the ships that it will use
and the services that it will provide. Where the service is a liner service, this implies defining
the route(s) on which the vessels will be deployed.

24. This practice places limits on the flexibility that an operator has in responding to market
conditions by deploying vessels in other routes or replacing an existing vessel with another.
As the CPC is issued to the operator, it is able to vary which of the vessels is assigned to which
of the routes included on its CPC. But if the operator wishes to redeploy a vessel to a route
not specified in the CPC, or to introduce a new vessel, it is necessary to obtain approval to
amend the CPC.

25. In a market-based system, vessel deployment should be a management prerogative.
Seeking approval imposes additional costs on the shipping operator, as, for each amendment
to the CPC, MARINA imposes additional fees. This could be avoided while retaining the CPC
framework, by allowing an operator, once it has been granted a CPC, to vary the routes and
vessels covered by the CPC simply by providing notice to MARINA that it intends to make these
changes, rather than seeking approval to make them.

More efficient and cost effective logistics

Remove requirement to dry dock in the Philippines

26. Current regulations require domestic vessels to undertake their dry docking and ship
repair/maintenance requirements in domestic shipyards. This policy actually reduces the
level of competition faced by domestic shipyards and increases the costs faced by domestic
shipping operators.

27. Several private shipping companies consulted during the stakeholder engagement
process indicated that, particularly for larger ships, they would prefer to have their ships dry
docked and repaired in foreign shipyards, indicating that, for the largest vessels, savings of up
to 50 percent of dry docking costs could be saved if this requirement were eliminated.
Remove restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade

28. Current regulations impose restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade. These
laws require MARINA to evaluate and determine the capability of registered shipyards to build
and construct new vessels for the domestic trade. If MARINA finds there to be domestic
capability to meet domestic demand, all domestic ship operators are discouraged from
importing new or previously owned vessels that are less than 500 GRT for the domestic trade.
This policy reduces the ability of firms to source their vessels from the most efficient producer.

Allow approval for the chartering of foreign vessels to temporarily operate in
domestic trade

                                                                                                9
29. Shipowners’ costs can be reduced by ensuring that they have ready access to the pool of
vessels available on the global market. In many cases, this does not necessarily mean the
outright purchase of a ship which could be costly upfront, but could also mean the leasing of a
vessel for temporary use in the country.

30. It is possible for Filipino shipowners to temporarily operate a foreign-flagged vessel in
the domestic trade if they obtain a permit to bareboat-charter the vessel. Such a mechanism
allows domestic firms to lease a ship for a specific time period to test the feasibility of plying
new routes or using new vessel types, without needing to shoulder the full costs of purchasing
and importing the vessel outright.

31. While the chartering process could be further streamlined at MARINA, there is currently
policy uncertainty with the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR) as to the tax status of bareboat-chartered vessels. It had been standard
practice in the Philippines to allow the tariff and duty-free entry of bareboat-chartered foreign
vessels since the passage of PD760 in 1975, as long as the charter provides a re-export bond to
ensure the departure of the vessel from the country at the end of the charter period.

32. Current charters are now subjected to the full tariff and VAT payments required of
purchased vessels. There is a lack of a clear regulatory basis on said import status of bareboat-
chartered vessels, for which the DOF has decided to treat them as direct vessel importations.

33. The change in the tax status of bareboat chartering has limited the willingness of firms to
charter vessels. In certain instances, it has become unfeasible to recover the additional taxes
over the course of the limited charter period.

Remove nexus between Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) revenue and cargo handling
charges

34. Under current administrative arrangements, PPA regulates the charges that are levied by
cargo handling operators. But it is also a commercial beneficiary of increases in those rates:
the PPA receives a 10 percent and a 20 percent share of the domestic and foreign cargo
handling rates collected, respectively. This creates a conflict of interest for PPA.

35. It should be acknowledged that processes have been developed and adopted that
provide opportunities for user input into decisions on cargo handling rates, and to increase
transparency. These serve to mitigate the conflict of interest, and reduce the risk that it will
lead to cargo handling charges that are unnecessarily high. But it would be better to eliminate
the conflict altogether.

36. This could be done quite simply by changing the structure of the fee paid to PPA by cargo
handling operators. Rather than setting this fee as a percentage of revenue, it could be
specified as a fixed annual charge, or a fixed rate per unit of cargo handled. This would break
the nexus between cargo handling charges and PPA revenue, and remove the perception —
and the risk — that PPA’s regulatory decisions on cargo handling charges are influenced by its
commercial interests.

                                                                                               10
Promoting better decisions

Improve information on cargo flows and current services

37. While both MARINA and PPA collect information on the maritime transport system,
information on cargo volumes and shipping services are not systematically compiled. Much
of the data are captured at the regional level and are not consolidated to provide a system-
wide snapshot of maritime operations.

38. Better information would be beneficial for a variety of regulatory and planning purposes.
As the deregulation of the sector is pursued, a strong monitoring capability is necessary to
detect and remedy market failures as they arise. But MARINA has a limited number of regional
offices and does not have the resources to monitor all of the country’s shipping routes. Its
ability to monitor shipping operations in the whole country is compromised by the lack of
comprehensive and timely information. Better-integrated information should also help
support PPA in the execution of its planning functions and in monitoring the performance of
particular service provides within its ports.

Freely disseminate information to actual and potential market participants

39. Competition will be more effective if the basis on which the decision of individual market
participants is better. It is not only public sector agencies that are likely to benefit from
improved information. To some extent, commercial operators have an incentive to gather such
information themselves, and are likely to do so. But this is costly and wasteful — and it often
functions as a barrier to entry, since incumbents have the greater opportunity to assemble
privately held information on market opportunities. For the greatest benefit to be derived
from investments in maritime data collection, it is important that this data is — to the extent
consistent with commercial confidentiality — made widely available.

                                        Introduction

43. The World Bank Group Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice Group is
implementing a multi-year program focused on improving the productivity and
competitiveness of Filipino farmers and agribusiness as a means of contributing to the
sustainable economic development of rural Philippines. The program involves 3 interrelated
components which address system challenges to the competitiveness of Philippine
agribusiness, including low farmer productivity and poor access to infrastructure, poor farmer
access to finance and high transaction and compliance costs. The objectives of the program
include:

     Improved gross margins for smallholder farmers by raising their performance in
      partnership with large “lead firm” agribusiness to create or improve supply chain
      models that can meet market and customer requirements on a sustainable basis;
     Increased investments in agriculture and the agribusiness sector by providing advisory
      services to select Philippine financial institutions to help them better meet agribusiness
      and farmer’s financing needs through traditional lending mechanisms and t he
      development and application of new financial products; and
     Reduced compliance and transaction costs for farmers and the agribusiness sector by
      addressing regulatory and competition constraints in the agriculture supply chains
      around trade, transport and logistics and warehousing regulations

44. In response to the World Bank Group-wide priority to address food security concerns,
the Trade and Competitiveness Practice Group has committed to ramp up assistance in
investment generation for the agribusiness sector. Agribusiness is a critical sector of the
Philippines’ economy. It accounts for 18 percent of GDP and employs over 11.5 million
people accounting for almost 35 percent of the workforce. If the entire agribusiness value
chain is considered, its contribution to GDP reaches 35 percent and one half of all working
Filipinos are employed by the sector. While the sector is critical to livelihoods and poverty
alleviation, the sector is underperforming. Growth has declined from 4.9 percent in 2007 to
negative 0.5 percent in 2010 while employment levels remained relatively steady.
Productivity of the workforce has moved up by a modest 1.7 percent since 2004 but yield of
traditional crops have stagnated or declined and comparative advantages in key crops are not
being sufficiently exploited – the Philippines’ share and value of exports is among the lowest
in comparable ASEAN countries. The sector’s underperformance coupled with its importance
indicates considerable potential for improved contribution to inclusive economic growth,
rural development, and poverty reduction.

45. Transport and logistics are key inputs to the agriculture value chains and contribute to
food prices. Because of the nation's archipelagic geography, transport and agricultural
markets are linked together, as parts of a single joint production function. Supply chain
infrastructure and service limitations at the supply end of food chains directly affect the
timeliness, quality and price of food products delivered at the demand end. Clearly, inter-
island transport systems that fairly and efficiently facilitate the flow of agricultural products
and related inputs are becoming increasingly important.

46. The Government of the Philippines (GoP) recognizes these issues and is working to
address them through various policy and support programs. For example, the Philippine
Development Plan (PDP) 2011-2016 reaffirms the importance of agricultural development
to inclusive growth in recognition of its contribution to output and employment. However,
an area the private sector regularly identifies as a critical area of reform but is not well
addressed is improved efficiency in trade and logistics, which is relevant given the amount of
food being shipped from Mindanao to the larger urban centers. For this reason, this study
seeks to understand a number of agri-trade regulatory constraints, as well as competition
constraints that affect the domestic shipping industry in targeted jurisdictions to enable
commercial smallholders' improved market access and integration.

Indicators of competitiveness

47. The Philippine Development Plan 2011-201610 highlights the need for the agriculture
sector to become more competitive. In the 2012-13 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) of
the World Economic Forum, the Philippines ranked 65th of 144 countries for which data was
available (up from 75th of 142 countries included in 2010-11).

48. Transport infrastructure and services perform a vital role in the agriculture supply chain.
Table 2 compares the infrastructure quality index, which forms part of the Global
Competitiveness Index, for 9 ASEAN and South Asian countries. The Philippines ranked 8th of
9 countries in the overall quality of its infrastructure (98th out of 144 countries surveyed) and
very poorly in the quality of the port infrastructure (ranked 120 th out of the 144 countries
surveyed).

49. What is clear from the table is that infrastructure quality in general, and the quality of
port infrastructure in particular, acts as a drag on the competitiveness of the Philippines: on
these specific dimensions of competitiveness, the Philippines ranks much lower than it does

50. The insights of the GCI are supported by more specific analysis. The PDP and sector
studies11 identified many specific constraints on the competitiveness of the agricultural sector
including:

        Declining productivity
        Fragmentation of the farm sector;
        Concentration of public support to rice production;
        High input costs (such as seed, fertilizer, crop protection, machineries);
        Limited access to appropriate inputs;
        Insufficient research and development;
        Inadequate farmer-support services such as post-harvest facilities; and
        Inefficient domestic transport

51. In the transport sector, and in the shipping industry in particular, several shortcomings
were found to affect agriculture value chains, notably:

        Inadequate port and vessel capacities;
        Ineffective port management and administration; and
        Anti-competitive shipping policies and regulations

Objective of the study

52. To review options for improving the performance of the agribusiness sector through
enhanced competitiveness of the transport sector, the World Bank Group Trade and
Competitiveness Global Practice Group conducted an assessment aiming at identifying key
competition constraints to maritime transport and transport services with a focus on inter-
island shipping. The recommendations and collected information are important inputs to the
World Bank Group’s Agricultural Trade Logistics Competitiveness project, which aims to help
the GoP address trade logistics and transport constraints for commercial smallholders'
improved market access and integration. It also forms one of the legs of the WBG’s Shipping
and Ports reform agenda.

53. The goal of this 4-year project is to help the GoP achieve its objective to diversify its
agri-fisheries exports and ensure connectivity of farmers/ agribusiness to local, regional
and global markets. The objective is to enhance agri-trade connectivity through coordination,
transparency and predictability through focused interventions at-the-border and behind-the-
border. The project also supports improvements in the regulatory framework of the

domestic shipping market as a fundamental preparation for a more competitive environment
that makes trade easier, less costly and more efficient based on transparency, predictability,
non-discrimination of market players and simplification.

Methodology

54. The report builds on a number of studies and papers that have been produced,
presented and discussed over the years. These past studies and papers were reviewed,
serving as initial building blocks to the study (see Annex B for details). To explore the
continuing relevance of the issues raised in these papers, and to develop a comprehensive
understanding of the various issues, the team conducted interviews on main competition
issues in the shipping sector with various stakeholders including international development
institutions, government agencies/public officials, shipping and non-shipping corporations,
non-government organizations, World Bank Group experts, and industry associations. In
addition, information was collected based on the checklist on competition in transport
services developed by the World Bank Group Competition Policy Team around 8 components:

     Market structure of transportation services;
     Direct state control over business enterprises;
     Market behavior and outcomes;
     Entry regulation;
     Price controls;
     Sector-specific regulations;
     State aids and subsidies; and
     Unequal treatment of market participants

55. The report aims to achieve a clear and balanced understanding of subsector issues by
taking into account both previous reports and stakeholder interviews/data collection. The
focus of the study is on the key issues that affect competition in shipping and port services
and crosscutting issues that affect both subsectors.

Significance of the industry

56. The Philippine ports and shipping sectors account for a very small share of GDP and
employment. Between 2008 and 2013, the 2 sectors account for only 0.2 percent of gross
value-added. Average growth was slower at 3.9 percent compared to the economy-wide
growth of 4.8 percent (Table 3). In 2010, employment in these sectors was estimated at
around 54,000 (57,000 in 2013), of which around 18,000 are formally employed (Table 4). 12

57. Yet, the efficiency of ports and shipping operations has a significant impact on prices
and jobs, given the archipelagic geography of the country. For instance, around 15 million
agriculture workers in the Philippines depend on these 2 industries to connect to markets and
sell their produce. In the Visayas, 18 million people rely on shipping to access the majority of

their goods, including food. In Mindanao, 22 million people rely on shipping for most
manufactured goods given its trivial manufacturing sector. Its farmers also rely on shipping to
bring their produce to Manila and to the rest of the world.

58. Currently, the maritime industry is beset with a number of inefficiencies. These are the
high cost of shipping, low quality of service, and a poor safety record that manifests in
frequent maritime accidents. These issues strongly suggest that the liberalization of the
industry, which started in 1989, has yet to result in more efficiency and greater innovation in
the industry. Box 1 discusses liberalization in the domestic shipping industry.



                        Box 1. Liberalization of the domestic shipping industry

     Pre-reform regulatory framework

     Regulation of the domestic shipping industry was first introduced during the American
     colonial period and was patterned after the US Jones Act and the Passenger Vessels
     Services Act. This sought to balance 2 objectives: protect the public from exorbitant tariffs
     and prevent “ruinous” competition among shipping operators. The Board of Transportation
     (BOT) was initially charged with regulating the industry, which covers route entry and tariff
     determination, until the creation of the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) in 1985.13

     Between 1928 and 1985, the basic structure of tariffs remained largely unchanged. 14
     Tariffs were adjusted periodically and across-the-board for inflation. Upward adjustments
     were also made using the revenue deficiency method, which determined the tariff needed
     to provide a rate of return 15 (ROI) consistent with the Public Service Act of 1936
     (Commonwealth Act No. 146).

     The shipping industry was initially exempted from government regulation requiring
     operators of all public services to obtain a certificate of public convenience (CPC).16 Route
     licensing was introduced in 1972. It restricted competition to prevent “ overtonnage” on
     major routes and ensure the availability of service for the smaller and less lucrative routes.17




13
   MARINA was created under Presidential Decree No. 474 and mandated to provide effective supervision,
regulation, and rationalization of the organizational management, ownership, and operations of all water
transport utilities, and other maritime enterprises.
14
   See Renardet Sauti Consulting Engineers (1986) for more discussion.
15
   The maximum allowable ROI for public utilities has always been 12 percent.
16
   The Public Service Act stipulates in Section 13 (a) that “the Public Service Commission shall have no au thority
to require steamboats, motor ships and steamship lines, whether privately-owned, or owned or operated by any
Government controlled corporation or instrumentality, to obtain certificate of public convenience or to
prescribe their definite routes or lines of service.”

     Liberalization

     Beset with large-scale inefficiencies in the industry and frequent maritime accidents, the
     government embarked on a gradual liberalization of the industry beginning in 1989. The
     setting of both passenger and freight tariffs, as well as routes, was gradually and partially
     liberalized.

     The liberalization of tariffs began with the removal of ad valorem charges on passenger
     tariffs. In 1990, the 30 percent valuation surcharge for insurance premiums was abolished
     and freight tariffs for refrigerated cargoes, transit cargoes, and livestock were liberalized. In
     1992, freight tariffs for Class A and Class B cargoes were liberalized.18 Through Executive
     Order 213 of 1994, all freight tariffs were liberalized except for non-containerized basic
     commodities. Full tariff liberalization was achieved in 1999 with the abolition of the
     Domestic Shipping Consultative Councils (DOSCONs), allowing shipping operators to fully set
     their own tariffs.19

     In 1992, route liberalization was introduced through Memorandum Circular Nos. 71 and
     80, which opened routes to at least 2 operators. Protection for developmental routes (i.e.,
     low volume routes) was limited to a maximum of 5 years after which the route was opened
     to other operators.20 Executive Order 185 of 1994 further strengthened liberalization efforts
     by allowing operators to charge market-accepted freight and passage rates different from
     the fork rates (i.e., indicative or reference rates provided by MARINA) upon their provision
     of pioneering technological innovation of shipping service in a developmental route.

High cost of shipping

59. Domestic shipping costs per mile are high. On average, Philippine shipping cost is
significantly more expensive than Indonesia and slightly more expensive than Malaysia. The


18
   Class A cargo includes processed goods or high value manufactured goods. Class B cargo includes semi-
processed goods or low value manufactured goods.
19
   Prior to 1999, shipping operators were not allowed to determine their own tariffs. Instead, tariffs were
negotiated through the Domestic Shipping Consultative Councils (DOSCONs), which was composed of
shippers/consumers, operators, and government representatives.
20
   Before deregulation, protection was granted for an indefinite period (i.e., until the initial investment is
recovered).

60. Ironically, it is more expensive to transport goods between 2 domestic points than 2
domestic points via an international point. For example, transporting goods in a 40-foot
container from Manila to Cagayan de Oro costs some USD 1,860 but transporting between
Manila and Cagayan de Oro via Kaohsiung would reduce the tariff by USD 716 to only USD
1,144 (Table 6). Moreover, a comparison of shipping costs in selected domestic and
international routes indicates that domestic routes are more expensive than international
routes on a per mile basis. For instance, the shorter Manila-Davao route is more expensive
than the longer Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Port Klang to Manila routes (Table 7).

  These estimates are based on the average of available data. One issue with these estimates is that they do not
compare the same products. A better approach would be to acquire the shipping costs of multinational
companies, such as Nestle or Unilever, that are present in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, for the same
product. This could form part of future analysis.

61. As a result, domestic shipping costs are a substantial part of logistic costs in the
Philippines. Logistics costs account for 24 to 53 percent of wholesale price in the Philippines
compared to less than 20 percent in other countries in the East Asia region.22 Shipping and
port handling costs account for an average of 35 percent of logistics cost, 8 percent (to as
high as 30 percent) of wholesale price depending on the goods and routes, and an average of
5 percent of retail price (Tables 8 and 9).23

   Part of the high cost of logistics in the Philippines is driven by its archipelagic geography. However, Indonesia,
another archipelago, has lower unit shipping cost (Table 4). This indicates that geography alone does not fully
explain why the Philippines has high logistics cost.

62. However, such comparisons should be treated with extreme caution. There are several
factors that may generate differences in tariff rates, which should be taken into account:

        International shipping lines benefit from economies of scale as they tend to have larger
         container vessels carrying at least 800 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) compared to local
         cargo vessels with 150 – 200 TEU capacity and significantly less for passenger, break
         bulk, and container combination vessels;
        Vessels utilized in domestic shipping are geared vessels (i.e., with cranes),24 which are
         more expensive to acquire and operate, given the limited supply of geared vessels.
         Most ports in the Philippines do not have specialized cargo handling equipment needed
         to service gearless container vessels. Container vessels on international routes are
         normally gearless (i.e., without cranes) since the ports they serve have complete cargo
         handling equipment;
        International liner shipping operates under a different regulatory and market
         environment and is not subject to the same rules as domestic shipping in the
         Philippines. Vessels are often registered under so-called “flags of convenience,” which
         bring certain cost advantages;
        The international feeder routes, which feed into mega-container vessels with capacities
         of 12,500 TEUs at hub ports. Feeder tariffs do not necessarily properly reflect the stand-
         alone costs of the feeder ship operation;
        Freight rates are strongly influenced by the direction of trade. If trade is significantly
         imbalanced, rates in the higher volume direction will be much higher than in the


24
  Geared vessels or vessels with onboard cranes are slowly being phased out as major international ports
already provide their own gantry cranes to load/unload containers. Refrigerated vessels or reefer vessels are
specialized vessels used in the transportation of cargo requiring refrigeration such as pineapples, mangoes, etc.
With the widespread use of refrigerated containers by international cargo liners and their increasing allocation
of slots on vessels for reefer containers, the need for reefer vessels has also diminished significantly.

                                                                                                              25

        reverse direction; and
       Quoted freight rate may or may not include terminal handling charges at either end of
        the journey. These costs may comprise a significant percentage of total shipping cost
        (typically one-third, but can be more than 50 percent under some circumstances).

For these reasons, comparison between international and domestic freight rates cannot be
regarded as firm evidence that domestic freight rates reflect excessive costs, or that excess
profits are being made by domestic shipping operators.

Low quality of service

63. Domestic shipping is characterized by a low quality of service. In the East Asia region,
the Philippines trails behind its neighbors in various logistics performance and connectivity
indices. For instance, in liner shipping connectivity, the Philippines ranked 66th out of 157
countries in 2013, and performs the worst among a group of East Asian comparators. It is at
the bottom in terms of frequency with which shipments are delivered within expected time
and is third to the bottom in terms of arranging competitively-priced shipment (Figure 1 and

64. Low quality of service is also pronounced in cargo handling. The lack of high quality
shore-based handling equipment is reflected in poor cargo handling productivity and delays
in many ports. Interviews with various stakeholders reveal that cargo handling performance,
especially in the loading and unloading of break bulk cargo, is poor. This results in significant
delays in shipping, increasing shipping costs, and decreasing service reliability (IFC 2013b).

Poor safety record and high frequency of maritime accidents

65. The industry’s low quality of service and poor safety standards are most evident in the
high number of maritime accidents. A comparative analysis from the ASEAN-Japan Transport
Partnership database shows that in the East Asia Region, the Philippines has the highest
casualty rate and this is 40 percent higher than the second ranked country, Indonesia (Table

11).25 On average, there were 228 ships involved in accidents and 303 casualties per year in
the Philippines from 2004 to 2012. Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) data also show a similar
trend. From 1995 to 2006, there were 1,982 maritime accidents, or an average of 167
accidents per year. Casualties (both lives lost and missing people) numbered 2,482, or an
average of 207 casualties per year (Figure 2). Of the cases documented by the PCG, around 80
percent have the potential to compromise safety of cargo, and more importantly, of the
passengers and crew. The most frequent type of maritime accident was capsizing (30
percent), followed by ship grounding (18 percent), and sinking (17 percent) (Figure 3). Box 2
discusses some of the country’s major maritime accidents.

                               Box 2. Worst maritime accidents in the world

The Philippines is home to some of the worst peace-time maritime accidents in the world.
In December 1987, MV Doña Paz, a passenger ferry owned by Sulpicio Lines with a capacity of
1,518 passengers, collided with MT Vector, a small tanker carrying 8,800 barrels of gasoline.
The collision sparked a massive fire and resulted in the death of around 4,000 people, a clear
indication that MV Doña Paz was severely overloaded. Only 26 survivors were reported.
Preliminary investigations showed that the incident was a result of negligence and inability to
follow proper safety regulations.26 Despite ongoing investigation, Sulpicio Lines was allowed
to continue operating.27

In June 2008, MV Princess of the Stars, also owned by Sulpicio Lines, sailed during a strong
typhoon. Strong winds pushed it against the rocks. The ship capsized and resulted in over
1,000 casualties. Despite poor weather conditions, the ship’s captain took the risk of
continuing the trip, resulting in the country’s worst maritime accident in 20 years. The Board
of Maritime Inquiry concluded that human error led to the accident.

In August 2013, MV St. Thomas Aquinas, a passenger ferry owned by 2GO Shipping Lines,
and Sulpicio Express Siete, a cargo ship owned by Philippine Span Asia Carrier (formerly
Sulpicio Lines), collided in fair weather just 2 kilometers from the shore of Talisay City in


26
   An investigation by the Board of Marine Inquiry claimed that both owners and operators showed gross negligence and
complete lack of care. The board found that the Vector Shipping Corporation did not possess a license to operate the vessel
and that the crew of MT Vector was not qualified to run the tanker.
27
   In the absence of a final ruling, shipping companies can insist that they be allowed to continue operation.
                                                                                                                                       28

Cebu Province. Over 116 lives were lost. As in the past, human error was determined to be
the cause of the accident. According to preliminary investigations of the Board of Maritime
Inquiry, the accident occurred because of a failure of the 2 ships to communicate. Sulpicio
Express Siete, the outgoing vessel from Cebu, used the inbound lane leading to the collision
with the inbound MV St. Thomas Aquinas.28 The captains of both ships claim that they tried
to contact each other by radio in order to avoid crossing each other’s path but without
success. Both the ferry and cargo ship also reportedly failed to comply with labor standards
and safety regulations.29 One of the safety regulations violated by both ships was the lack of
the required safety committee or safety officers to ensure the health and safety of the
passengers and crew.

   This suggests that apart from human error, standard operating procedures and safety protocols were also violated as the
investigation revealed that it was common practice for outbound ships to take the inbound lane to avoid shallow waters.
29
   This finding is based on the Department of Labor and Employment’s initial investigation. The extent of non -compliance has
not been finalized.

                  Underlying reasons for the industry’s inefficiency

66. High shipping cost, low quality of service, and poor safety standards are the results of a
number of factors. In shipping, the oligopolistic market structure and low profitability leading
to lack of investments in new ships are the main reasons for the industry’s inefficiencies.
Other sources of inefficiencies are the lack of market scale, which is exacerbated by the lack
of connectivity, network planning, and consolidation, weak port infrastructure, and conflict of
interest in the Philippine Ports Authority.

Oligopolistic market structure

67. There are many companies offering commercial shipping services in the Philippines, 30
but scheduled operations (i.e., liners) are dominated by a few firms. 31 The bulk of sea
freight is provided by tramp services. They provide an alternative to scheduled operations,
mostly for bulk or break bulk cargo on a contract basis. Their ports of call cover those that are
not served by liners. Their rates are not reported to MARINA. While required to have a
Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) as a tramp operator, their operations are seldom
monitored and no statistics are available on the volume of cargo carried.

68. Scheduled operations are dominated by a few companies. In 2011, the 3 biggest
shipping companies, 2GO Group, Philippine Span Asia Container (formerly Sulpicio Lines), and
Solid Shipping, accounted for some 38 percent of the freight market.32 The next 2 largest
companies, NMC Container Lines and Asian Shipping, accounted for around 7 percent of the
market. Many of these liners are long time players.

69. Most routes are served by 1 or 2 shipping companies. Of around 54 primary routes, over
40 percent are served by a single operator. A third of the routes are served by 2 operators.
Less than one quarter of routes are served by 3 or more operators (Figure 4). In general, high
volume routes which are financially more attractive, such as Manila-Cebu, Cebu-Cagayan de
Oro, and Manila-Davao, attract many players, as many as 5, while de facto monopolies exist


30
   Between 1996 and 2008, there was an average of 37 shipping firms in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) list
of top 5,000 corporations. According to MARINA, there were 2,802 shipping operators in 2012, of which, 555 are
partnerships/corporations.
31
   The small number of dominant players in scheduled operations is the result of several mergers. For instance, in 2010,
Negros Navigation acquired Aboitiz Transport System Corporation (ATSC) and all its subsidiaries to form 2GO Group. This
new company also acquired several other major players such as Supercat Fast Ferry, Philippine Fast Ferry Corporation, and
Cebu Ferries Corporation. Philippine Fast Ferry, in turn, is the result of the merger between Universal Aboitiz and Sea Angels
Ferry Corporation (a subsidiary of Negros Navigation) in 1998. Cebu Ferries was established in 1996 as a subsidiary of WG&A.
ATSC emerged from Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the holding company of Aboitiz Shipping Corporation, and WGA. The latter was
formed in 1995 when William Lines, Gothong Lines, and Aboitiz Shipping Corporation merged. Magsaysay Lines was formed
when Lorenzo Shipping Lines and NMC Container Lines merged.

   Market share is computed as the share of the top 5 firms’ revenues to the total revenues of shipping companies included
in the SEC list of top 5,000 firms. Shipping companies are identified with PSIC codes 61102, 61103, and 61104 for ocean
freight transport, inter-island water passenger transport, and inter-island water freight transport, respectively. This includes
RoRo and tramp.

70. Significant market entry barriers exist. Current regulations favor incumbents and make it
hard for new firms to enter the industry. Incumbents are allowed by law to object to the
granting of a CPC, which authorizes the operation of a ship to new entrants. Cumbersome
and costly procedures and the lack of transparency surrounding the CPC process also deter
entry of new firms. In response to these inefficiencies, MARINA has begun to simplify
procedures in early 2014 by streamlining the steps needed to register a ship.

71. Several other regulations also contribute to the inefficient operation of the industry.
Currently, CPCs do not give priority to quality standards and this manifests in frequent
maritime accidents. Each new ship and/or new route requires shipping companies to apply
for a new CPC, which can be opposed by incumbents. The high cost of shipping is exacerbated
by the requirement to dry dock in the Philippines,33 which is generally more expensive (e.g.,
Chinese dry docks are reportedly up to 3.5 times cheaper than Philippine dry docks), and high
tax rates associated with leasing vessels.




33
   Presidential Decree 1221 requires locally flagged ships, even those engaged in international trade, to dry dock
in the Philippines, unless they get a permit.

Increased competition yet low profitability

72. There are indications of increased competition in the domestic shipping industry in the
last 15 years following liberalization. The share of revenues of the top 5 shipping companies
fell from 69 percent in 1996 to around 45 percent in 2011 (Table 12). The reduction in market
share was most evident in the 2 biggest companies, 2GO Group and Sulpicio Lines, while the
2 smallest players in the top 5 saw their market shares more than double.

73. Yet, profitability in the shipping industry is very low. The often claimed assertion that
shipping companies earn monopoly profits is not supported by available data. Financial
statements of shipping companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal
that shipping firms in the SEC Top 5,000 List of Corporations have very low return on assets
(ROA), return on equity (ROE), and profit margins (PM). The average ROA, ROE, and PM

between 1996 and 2008 were 0.6, 1.6, and 0.7 percent, respectively (Table 13). 34 These ratios
were slightly higher at 2.6, 5.3, and 3.2 percent, respectively, between 2005 and 2008 when
shipping rates were liberalized compared to the pre-rate liberalization period, suggesting that
competitive pressures have contributed somewhat to improved efficiency, though still below
international benchmarks. A breakdown of these ratios by firm size reveals that the top 2
firms were less profitable than the other firms.

74. Low profitability reflects competition from unscheduled and opportunistically operating
trampers, and from air and land transport. Trampers typically compete on flexibility and
price, with some of them operating sub-standard ships. Another major source of competition
comes from alternative modes of transportation: the roll-on roll-off (RoRo) services and air
transport. Improved arterial roads and strong support for RoRo services since 2003 are
making bus transport increasingly popular. Air transport liberalization since 1993 has brought
down average air fares by more than 50 percent in real terms, resulting in a five-fold increase
in domestic air passengers (see World Bank 2013 for more discussion). Finally, the high
incidence of maritime accidents has also drawn passengers away from liners.

75. High input costs also pull down profitability. The overall cost structure of the Philippine
domestic shipping industry is broadly similar to that of shipping companies in the East Asia
region. Between 2008 and 2012, operating expenditures35 of Philippine domestic shipping

  Operating expenditures exclude general and administrative expenses, finance costs, interest expense, and other non-

                                                                                                                  34

companies averaged around 70 percent of total revenues compared to an average of 80
percent among a group of comparators (Table 13). However, Philippine shipping firms pay
more for fuel and repairs compared to firms in other countries. Fuel is the largest cost item at
27 percent of total revenues, and at 41 percent of total operating expenditures (Tables 14
and 15). In contrast, comparator companies, such as Maersk Group, OOCL Hong Kong, and
NOL Singapore, registered lower share of fuel cost at around 20 percent of revenues. 36
Industry insiders explain that Philippine fuel is more expensive since it is not subsidized and a
12 percent VAT is imposed on top of excise tax and import tariff, while fuel in Singapore,
Malaysia, and Indonesia are subsidized and are levied lower tax rates.

76. Dry docking, repair, and maintenance are also major expenditure items, accounting for
an average of 11 percent of total operating cost (Table 15). Firm level data, however, show
that dry docking, repairs, and maintenance can reach as high as 26 percent of revenues. In
contrast, the average dry docking cost in the region was 50 percent cheaper and up to 3.5
times cheaper in the case of China (IFC 2013a). The high share of dry docking, repair, and
maintenance to total cost reflects government regulations that mandate domestic ships to
dry dock in the Philippines.37 This has resulted in higher repair and maintenance cost and
slower repair time.




36
   MISC Berhad of Malaysia (whose cost breakdown was not available) can also be assumed to have access to cheaper fuel as
it is a subsidiary of Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil company.

Lack of investment in ships

77. Low profitability has resulted in low rates of investment. The domestic shipping industry
lags behind its ASEAN counterparts in new ship acquisition. The average age of the country’s
domestic passenger, general cargo, and container ships is around 30 years old compared to 8
years old among top Asian shipping companies (Table 16).38 Aging ships are one reason for
the high incidence of maritime accidents in the Philippines. They also contribute to high cost
structure and inefficiencies in operation. The overall result of this vicious cycle is stagnation
of the industry, which adversely impacts the economy through high logistics cost, high food
prices, and weak job creation.

Lack of market scale

78. One of the key reasons for high shipping costs is small trade volumes that do not justify
big ships that can benefit from economies of scale.39 Economies of scale in shipping are
derived not from operating cost, as the difference in operating cost between a small vessel
and a large vessel is not substantial, but on the carrying capacity of the vessel. In the
international picture, the Philippines is a feeder destination, not a hub or main destination.

39
  The analysis of lack of scale leading to high shipping cost needs to be tempered by the possibility that these 2
variables are endogenous. Shipping cost can be high due to lack of scale but lack of scale can also be caused by
high shipping cost. For instance, businessmen and farmers may decide against expanding their business/planting
more because of the high cost of shipping. A reduction in shipping cost can therefore induce an increase in scale.
                                                                                                                 37

According to industry insiders, feeder vessels are generally a fourth of the size of mother
ships that serve hubs, and feeder ships add around USD 200 in additional unit freight cost.40

79. Within the Philippines, domestic cargo trade is also relatively small. In 2011, domestic
cargo throughput in the Philippines amounted to 102 million metric tons or equivalent to 35
percent of Indonesia’s 291 million metric tons.41 Ironically, compared to Vietnam, a non-
archipelagic country, Philippine throughput is only slightly higher than Vietnam’s 80 million
metric tons (Table 17).

80. Philippine commodity flow data reveal that most of domestic sea trade is concentrated
in just a few shipping routes. Routes servicing the Port of Manila, the largest port in the
Philippines, account for around 47 percent of total Philippine domestic sea trade. 8 other
routes, out of a total of 137 routes, account for another 10 percent of total domestic sea
trade.

81. The majority of domestic shipping routes have very small volumes. Table 18, which
shows commodity flows between major ports, reveals that majority of routes account for less
than 1 percent of total domestic sea trade.42 Small volumes do not warrant a further increase
in capacity or size of ships. An analysis of the Register of Ships maintained by MARINA shows
that a large number of ships are very small craft, many of them wooden-hulled, that operate
very localized service. Some 1,582 vessels or roughly 42 percent of total vessels have sizes
that are less than 50 gross register tonnage (GRT). For passenger and passenger/cargo
vessels, this proportion is much higher at over 80 percent (1,556 out of a total of 1,943
vessels). This in turn adds to high cost of shipping.




40
   See Philippine Inter-Island Shipping Association (2013) for more discussion. According to industry insiders, the
size of feeder vessels is typically around 2,000 to 3,000 TEUs (twenty feet equivalent units) while mother ships
are typically around 6,000 to 18,000 TEUs.
41
   Indonesia’s large domestic trade volume is partly attributed to its much larger economy and the presence of
natural resource commodities.
42
   Commodity flow data from the National Statistics Office are given only at the regional level. Commodity flows
between ports are not available. To arrive at port level data, the largest port (or 2 largest ports) per region is
given the entire region’s value.
                                                                                                                38

82. Moreover, many routes have predominantly one-direction traffic. For example, ships
plying the Manila to Cebu route are often filled to capacity, but the reverse route is filled way
below capacity. In terms of price, the Manila-Cebu leg amounts to around PHP 36,000 per 20-
foot container from pier to pier but the Cebu-Manila route amounts to only PHP 14,000,
reflecting weak demand. Moreover, most domestic shippers do not consolidate cargo,
contributing to unfilled capacity.

83. This lack of market scale is ultimately traced to the country’s weak agriculture and
manufacturing sectors, which are unable to produce more goods at low prices. Moreover,
variances in the quality of agricultural produce, such as corn, mean that farmers and
agribusinesses prefer to ship in sacks, rather than co-mingle them in bulk, thereby increasing
the per unit cost of packaging and shipping.

Exacerbated by the lack of connectivity, network planning, and consolidation

84. The lack of market scale is exacerbated by the lack of connectivity, network planning,
and consolidation. In general, national and regional transport planning is weak, resulting in
significant infrastructure gaps, such as missing regional arterial roads and farm to market
roads to connect farms to ports and ultimately to markets. These infrastructure gaps have in
turn contributed to the proliferation of public and private ports that spread the market too
thinly and therefore reduce scale. For example, Northern Mindanao from Ozamis to Surigao,
with a total coastline of around 497 kilometers, has 7 public ports: Cagayan de Oro (CDO),
Mindanao Container Terminal (MCT), Iligan, Nasipit in Butuan, Surigao, Bislig, and Ozamis,
alongside 29 private ports. Consolidating commercial traffic in the largest port in Cagayan de
Oro (MCT) can help increase scale and reduce cost, while allowing private ports to deal with
private cargo.

Lack of port and road infrastructure

85. Port infrastructure deficiencies also contribute to the high cost of shipping. According to
the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-14, the Philippines ranks 98th out of 148 countries in
the quality of overall infrastructure. Road infrastructure is ranked higher at 87th but it still
trails its neighbors. In terms of port infrastructure, it ranks 116 th and ironically was better
only compared to Lao (which is a landlocked country) (Table 19). The consequences of these
infrastructure deficiencies are severe congestion, long wait time for ships, delays in shipment,
and consequently higher cost of shipping.

86. Majority of the country’s major domestic ports are not equipped with modern port
facilities to handle today’s larger and more advanced vessels. In many of the country’s
ports, cargo handlers cannot deploy modern cargo handling equipment such as quay cranes
and other heavy equipment due to the poor condition of ports and weight limitations. In
these ports, vessels must rely on on-board cranes. As a result, the shipping industry is
constrained to use geared vessels (i.e., vessels with on-board cranes) to handle port cargo.
These vessels are more costly to construct and are increasingly short in supply, and
consequently more expensive to buy or charter, leading to higher cost of operations and
inefficiencies in both port and shipping operations (IFC 2013b).
                                                                                                40

87. Maritime access is limited by shallow berths in most Philippine ports. An important
factor determining access of ships to ports is the berth depth of both the origin and
destination ports. In the Philippines, 60 percent of berths at major public ports have depths
that are less than 8 meters.43 This means that mid-sized vessels would have to wait for high
tide before they can dock while large vessels cannot be accommodated even if demand
increases. The resulting reliance on smaller vessels means that shipping companies cannot
take advantage of economies of scale to reduce shipping cost even if the market expands.

88. Apart from port infrastructure, the country’s weak state of road infrastructure also
contributes to high logistics cost. The World Development Indicator (WDI) database shows
that the Philippines has only about 40,000 kilometers of paved roads out of 200,036
kilometers in 2003 (20 percent paved),44 compared to an average of 198,184 kilometers of
paved road (out of 455,702 kilometers or 43 percent paved) among East Asian countries.
More importantly, the country lacks adequate farm-to-market roads, which are important
conduits to connect farmers to markets. For instance, farmers in Benguet Province face up to
8 hours when bringing their vegetables to Manila (a distance of about 280 kms or 40 km/h),
when a more efficient road network can bring this down to at most 4 hours. Inadequate road
infrastructure also results in congestion and limits the efficiency of shipping services. For
instance, congestion around the Port of Manila decreases truck turnaround time and the
amount of cargo/containers that can be carried in a day, and thus adversely impacts the
efficiency of shipping services in the country. Port congestion, in turn, results in road
significant congestion. Overall, JICA (2013) estimates the total cost of congestion at around
PHP 876 billion (around 8 percent of GDP) or PHP 2.4 billion daily.

Conflict of interest in the Philippine Ports Authority

89. Finally, conflict of interest in the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) also contributes to
higher cost of shipping. The PPA is both a regulator and an operator of ports. It sets cargo
handling rates for all its ports but also receives at least 10 percent of all cargo handling fees.45
This not only raises the cost of shipping, it also gives rise to real or perceived conflict of
interest. This conflict of interest could be removed by shifting away from its port operations
mandate so that it can focus exclusively on its regulatory mandate.

                                  Domestic shipping reform

Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA)

90. Created on 1 June 1974 under PD No. 47446, MARINA started functioning as an agency
attached to the Office of the President mandating the agency to integrate the
development, promotion and regulation of the country’s maritime industry. In 1979,
through Executive Order No. 546, MARINA was made an agency reporting to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) for policy and program coordination47. The
succeeding years saw the development and evolution of MARINA — both in organization and
in function — to address the demand for reforms in the maritime industry. In 1985, MARINA
assumed the quasi-judicial functions of the Board of Transportation (BOT) in franchising
involving water transportation services48.

91. The Domestic Shipping Development Act of 2004 (RA 9295) and its implementing rules
and regulations further amended the mandate of MARINA, and gave MARINA jurisdiction,
powers and duties as given in Box 3.


                                  Box 3: MARINA’s powers and duties

     Pursuant to RA 9295, the MARINA’s power and duties are the following:

           Register vessels;
           Issue Certificates of Public Convenience, or any extensions or amendments thereto,
            authorizing the operation of all kinds, classes and types of vessels in domestic
            shipping: Provided, That no such certificate shall be valid for a period of more than
            twenty-five (25) years;
           Modify, suspend or revoke at any time, upon notice and hearing, any certificate,
            license or accreditation it may have issued to any domestic ship operator;
           Establish and prescribe routes, zones or areas of operations of domestic ship
            operators;
           Require any domestic ship operator to provide shipping services to any coastal
            area, island or region in the country where such services are necessary for the
            development of the area, to meet emergency sealift requirements, or when public
            interest so requires;
           Set safety standards for vessels in accordance with applicable conventions and
            regulations;

         Investigate any complaint made in writing against any domestic ship operator, or
          any shipper, or any group of shippers regarding any matter involving violations of
          the provisions of this Act;
         Upon notice and hearing, impose such fines, suspend or revoke certificates of
          public convenience or other license issued, or otherwise penalize any ship
          operator, shipper or group of shippers found violating the provisions of this Act;
          and
         Issue such rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this Act:
          Provided, that such rules and regulations cannot change or in any way amend or be
          contrary to the intent and purposes of this Act.


92. Under RA 9295, MARINA’s regulatory mandate may be summarized as follows:

      controlled by Filipinos or by corporations at least 60 percent of the capital of which is
      owned by Filipinos;
     Determine the conditions of entry for domestic liner and tramp shipping;
     Formulate and implement operational and safety standards for domestic shipping;
     Assure the financial viability of domestic shipping operators; and
     Determine the impact of new shipping services on the area to be served.

Domestic market structure

93. There are a large number of companies offering commercial shipping services in the
Philippines, but scheduled cargo shipping operations (liner services) are dominated by a
small number of these firms. Concentration has increased recently, as the domestic shipping
industry has seen the mergers/consolidation of existing liner shipping companies such as
Negros Navigation and Aboitiz Transport Services (now 2GO Group); and Lorenzo Shipping
Corporation and NMC Container Lines (Magsaysay Lines).

94. Many of these lines have a long history in domestic shipping operations. A relative
newcomer is MCC Transport Philippines Inc (MCC), which commenced operations in 2007.
MCC is a joint venture between MCC Transport Pte. Singapore Ltd., Mercantile Ocean
Maritime Co. (Filipinas) and ATS Consolidated Inc. This was not part of the Negros Navigation
Lines/Aboitiz Transport Services consolidation, as MCC is a separate investment of the Aboitiz
group. It operates 2 of the largest domestic container vessels with about 1,012 TEU capacity
each, compared to the usual 150 - 250 TEU vessels typically deployed by other domestic
liners.

95. MARINA does not keep statistics on the market share of shipping companies. As a
result, the estimates presented in Table 20 below are based on information acquired during
the interviews, and are indicative only.

96. While most attention has been focused on liner shipping, independent trampers carry a
large volume of sea freight. They provide alternative shipping services mostly for bulk/break
bulk cargo on a contract basis. Their ports of call include those that may or may not be served
by liner shipping and shipping contract charges are not reported to MARINA, remaining a
private transaction between the shipper and the tramp operator. While required to have a
CPC as a tramp operator, their operations are seldom monitored and no statistics are
available on cargo volume carried.

Concentration on individual routes

97. Market conditions vary by route, ranging from a monopoly operator in 1 route to 5
operators on the most crowded routes. A monopoly may exist on a route where there is less
                                                                                                  44

demand for freight and passenger capacity such as Bacolod City – General Santos City; Iloilo
to Davao; Cebu City – Zamboanga, On the other hand, routes with high cargo volume (such as
Manila – Cebu City, Cebu City – Cagayan de Oro City, and Manila – Davao City) attract several
operators because of the financial returns that could be generated. MCC, for example,
entered the domestic trade in the high volume routes given the large size of its vessels.

98. However, even on most primary routes the number of operators is low. Of the 54
primary routes for which data was obtained in this assessment, over 40 percent were served
by a single operator. A further third were served by just 2 operators, and less than one
quarter were served by 3 or more competitors.49

Complementary passenger operators

99. While the study is focused on pure cargo shipping, the configuration of a large number
of liner vessels is passenger/cargo. This allowed liner shipowners 2 sources of revenues –
passenger fares and cargo rates. Current market developments are increasingly leading to
specialization in the services offered. Except for the long distance routes, passenger services
are now being provided by fast ferries and bus/RoRo vessel mix.

100. With cargo service specialization, shipowners avoid the costly reconfiguration of
foreign acquired vessels to domestic service requirements. But domestic liner shipping has
lost a significant revenue stream, given increased competition from airline transportation
services,50 putting pressure on increasing freight rates for the passenger/cargo vessels or
acquiring/chartering cargo only vessels, i.e., container vessels. For cargo, new charters or
acquisitions have been for container vessels with a minimum of 150 TEU capacity, with MCC
deploying the largest vessels with more than 1,000 TEU capacities.

The RoRo system

101. Roll on-roll off vessels provide short haul services between nearby islands. Cargo is
carried on board these vessels on trucks that are driven on and off the ship. The development
of the country’s north-south and east-west road infrastructures and RoRo ports provided an
alternative to shipping transport.



49
   Vessel frequencies on the routes may be different among the shipping lines operating in a common route.
Other vessel operators may serve the route without knowledge of MARINA, either with a MARINA-issued
Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for another route (colorum operators), with a tramping CPC used as a
regular service or without any CPC. For the break bulk transportation, shipping operators may use RoRo or
fastcraft vessels and small wooden crafts (batels) serving the marginal routes, carrying mostly agricultural
produce such as copra or basic commodities, i.e., cement, fertilizers, canned foods, etc. in small quantities
50
   The market power of liner shipping in domestic passenger service has diminished due to competition from
other modes of transportation. The deregulation of domestic air transport has captured a major share of the
first- and second-class passengers, given the year-around low fares being offered by Philippines Airlines, Cebu
Pacific and other domestic budget carriers, with fares close to the first/second-class rates of shipping lines. The
shorter travel time and the comfort provided more than compensate for the minimal price difference, enabling
domestic airlines to capture a sizeable chunk of the passenger market from liner shipping.
                                                                                                                45
                                                   Working paper for comments and subject to change.


102. But so far, the impact has largely been on passenger traffic where provincial bus
transport offered more efficient terminal to door service for passengers destined to areas
along the major bus routes. This has eliminated the inconvenience of land transfers at the
port for the final leg of the trip to the destination.

103. The liner shipping industry does not consider RoRo as a competitor to its principal
cargo business. Improvement in road infrastructures has caused some short haul shipping
services to stop, but this is a natural progression of the supply chain where land transport’s
comparative advantage in the short routes is enhanced. Cargo trucks cannot offer the
capacity of domestic vessels in the number of containers and volume of bulk and break bulk
cargo that can be carried. In the end, it is still the shipper who selects the appropriate mode
for his cargo given transport costs and travel time.

104. A re-alignment in the supply chain has already occurred and will continue, where niche
markets will develop for RoRo/land transport and shipping, with shipping focusing on its
cargo services on the long haul routes.

Economic regulation of domestic shipping

105. Regulation of rates and entry in scheduled transport services was a common practice
in many countries up until the 1980s. However, beginning with the deregulation of transport
industries in the United States under the Carter administration, regulation of prices and entry
in most jurisdictions have been liberalized and, in many instances, completely abolished.51

106. Economic regulation of the domestic shipping industry of the Philippines has a long
history. The rates that liner shipping operators could charge were first regulated in 1928.
Control of entry on shipping routes was introduced in 1972. In line with developments
elsewhere, the past three decades have seen a gradual, if intermittent, move towards
deregulation.

Deregulation of rates and fares

107. Fares and freight rates were progressively liberalized through a series of Memorandum
Circulars between 1989 and 1994, culminating in the formal deregulation of most freight
rates and passenger fares through Executive Order 213 in 1994.52 However, in practice:
“[O]perators were not allowed to determine on their own the rates they will charge for their
services. Instead, the Domestic Shipping Consultative Councils (DOSCONs), composed of
shippers/consumers, operators and representatives from the government, was instituted to
provide a forum for consultations and negotiations for the implementation of the
deregulated rates or any upward adjustments of the rates. Hence, the deregulation, as
provided for in EO 214, only modified the process of fixing cargo rates —a task previously

exercised by the government through a quasi-judicial process.”53

Revised implementing guidelines that provided more effective rate-setting autonomy for
shipping operators were introduced in 1999, through MC No 15354, which, amongst other
things, abolished the DOSCON process.

108. The full deregulation of rates and charges was achieved with the passing into law of
RA 9295. Chapter III of this Act, which defines the future role of the MARINA, bears the title
“Deregulation of Domestic Shipping Industry – Authority of the Maritime Industry Authority”,
and Section 8 establishes the right of shipping operators to fix their own freight rates
“provided that effective competition is fostered and the public interest is served”.

109. These reforms appear to have been effective. The shipping industry has been freed
from rate regulation and rate competition is now the norm rather than the exception. There
are views that shipping rates are still high because shipowners are colluding in setting
shipping rates, but there appears to be no hard evidence of this and market conditions make
it unlikely.

110. Shipowners do group themselves into associations such as the Philippine Liner
Shipping Association (PLSA) and the Philippine Interisland Shipping Association (PISA), but
these organizations objectives are to represent the interests of the sector. It is not their
function to set shipping rates. Given the deregulation of shipping rates, there is no incentive
for the industry to set a uniform shipping rate as these could not be effectively enforced and
the market power of the big shippers (such as Nestle, Procter and Gamble, Unilever) enable
them to tender their business to the lowest bidder by making the shipping companies bid
against each other (Box 4).


                                Box 4: Rate discounting in shipping

     Rate discounting, particularly on freight rates, is a common practice in the industry. Even
     when there are government regulations on rate setting, the official rates become just a
     benchmark or a base from which to discount. Actual freight rates are usually the product of
     bargaining between shippers and shipping operators (Dick 1987).

     Discounting drives up price competition in the industry. To lessen the pressure for rate
     discounts, shipping companies with established financial position offer longer-term
     payments. On the other hand, forwarders, traders, and large companies that distribute
     their own products can make bargains for large discounts by offering a contract for their
     cargoes for a fixed period. Guaranteed by the security of a contract and a large volume of
     cargoes, a shipping company can thus settle for a low margin for its shipping rates.

 Any discount can be readily matched by competitors. Thus, in the face of intense rate
 competition, the best strategy for a shipping company is to become the market leader in
 terms of quality of service. In practice, freight rates are not the primary but the balancing
 item in the services negotiated with shippers, as shippers and traders are more concerned
 with the safety of their cargoes.

Liberalization of entry

111. Control of entry on shipping routes had the avowed objective of ensuring stability in
the provision of services by maintaining a balance between capacity and demand. The
rationale is outlined in Box.


                        Box 5: Rationale for entry regulation in liner shipping

 The common argument for the need to regulate liner shipping                    is based on the supposed
 danger of chronic instability due to inherent tendencies to                    ruinous competition and
 monopoly (Renardet Sauti Consulting Engineers 1986). That                      is, the industry is highly
 vulnerable to price and capacity fluctuations, which lead to                    ruinous competition and
 eventually to monopoly, after the weak firms are driven out.

 Vulnerability to price and capacity fluctuations, if there are no limits to competition is
 argued to be associated with the cost structure of the industry. Once a vessel is at berth,
 the only cost associated with carrying an extra ton of cargo is the cost of loading and
 discharging it; and such marginal cost is very low, an average of 25 to 30 percent of the
 freight rate. At such rate, an operator cannot survive. Hence, an operator will find it
 profitable to take an extra cargo at a rate higher than the handling cost. However, if there
 is free competition, the rate would be forced to go down to the level of the handling cost
 whenever there is any surplus in capacity. The industry will then become unprofitable for
 all operators.

 However, the above argument does not seem plausible, as shipping operators do not cut
 their rates to the level of marginal costs once the ship is at berth. Instead, what influences
 the behavior of operators is not the marginal cost of an extra ton of cargo, but the cost of
 an extra voyage or set of voyages and their relation to revenues at pre-determined rates.

112. In the domestic shipping industry, control of entry was implemented through
“grandfather rules” in the granting of license to operate:

“In general, these rules imply that if the demand warrants additional fleet in a route, priority
is given to the existing operator to put in the additional vessel to meet the demand; but if
there are several existing operators in the route, priority is given to the first applicant. If there
is no existing operator in a route, entry is allowed and the new entrant is protected in his
investment by not allowing another operator until he has recovered his investment. Under
the 3 rules, however, the past service records of the operator/s or the new applicant/s were
not taken into consideration”55.

113. There is now a fairly widespread economic consensus that fears of chronic instability
and “ruinous competition” were exaggerated, if not totally unwarranted. Moreover, a
series of studies in domestic shipping in the Philippines, undertaken during the 1980s and
early 1990s, concluded that the regulatory system was not serving the interests of the
community, leading to progressive liberalization of the system.

114. Significant liberalization of entry in shipping was achieved in 1994 with Executive
Order 185.56 This was intended to:

        Increase production and productivity in the various islands and regions of the
         archipelago through the provision of effective sea linkage;
        Provide for the economical, safe, adequate and efficient shipment of raw materials,
         products, commodities and people;
        Enhance the competitive position of Philippine flag vessel in the carriage of foreign
         trade; and
        Generate new and more job opportunities.

MARINA was instructed to:

        Liberalize the entry of new operators into the domestic water transport industry to
         enhance the level of competition and bring about reasonable rates and improved
         quality of services. Competition, provided it was not ruinous, was to be the norm to
         open up the industry to new investments and to stimulate further economic activity.
         Specifically, all routes were to be open to at least 2 operators, and any routes that “had
         been serviced by any operator for an aggregate period of at least 5 years shall be open
         for entry to additional operators without limit”.
        Encourage the entry of operators in developmental routes. An operator who pioneers
         in the provision of a certain technological level/type of shipping service in a
         developmental route shall be authorized to charge market-accepted freight and
         passage rates differing from the authorized tariff.

     Grant a Certificate of Public Convenience to an existing or new operator who acquires a
      vessel through importation, bareboat charter with option to purchase, lease-purchase,
      or local construction and allowed to operate such vessel in any route, even if already
      being served by existing franchised operators for less than 5 years, including
      developmental routes.
     Allow any change or amendment to the authorized routing pattern of a vessel by an
      existing authorized operator through: (i) omission or deletion of port(s); (ii) addition of
      other port(s); (iii) omission and subsequent addition of port(s); (iv) changing the
      sequence of port calls; and (v) retention of authorized routing pattern but with addition
      of one or more ports.

115. Deregulation was given a further impetus by the passage of RA 9295. Consistent with
the deregulatory direction of this Act, and with its emphasis on the goal of promoting
“effective competition”, as well as encouraging investment, in domestic shipping markets,
significant further steps have been taken towards easing constraints for entry into the liner
shipping business. However, MARINA retains the power and authority to issue Certificates of
Public Convenience to qualified domestic ship operators, and continues to exercise its
discretion on whether to grant a Certificate of Public Convenience to an aspiring entrant.

116. RA 9295 also reaffirms the reservation of the Philippines coastal trade for Philippine
operators (cabotage). Franchises, CPCs or any other form of authorization for the carriage of
cargo or passenger, or both, in the domestic trade can be granted only to domestic
shipowners or operators. Foreign vessels are not allowed to transport passengers or cargo
between ports or places within the Philippine territorial waters except upon the grant of a
Special Permit by the MARINA when no suitable domestic vessel is available to provide a
shipping service that is warranted by the public interest. These Special Permits are generally
awarded to vessels with specialized capabilities, like those equipped for oil exploration,
infrastructure development, or scientific study, that are not present in the domestic fleet.

The importance of further liberalization

117. The concentration of domestic shipping operations in the country is not surprising, as
it is a feature common to domestic shipping routes in most countries. There are 2 main
characteristics of the industry that lead to this outcome:

     There are significant economies of scale in ship operations: many cost items — such as
      construction costs, crewing, insurance and repair and maintenance costs — increase
      less than proportionately with vessel size.
     Frequency is an important aspect of the quality of service that a shipping company
      offers to its major customers. All other things being equal, a service that offers 2
      sailings a week is likely to be more attractive to a potential customer — particularly a
      large shipper of perishable products — than a service offering only a single sailing.

A high degree of concentration on individual routes is therefore a natural consequence of
market characteristics, and is unlikely to change.

                                                                                              50
                                               Working paper for comments and subject to change.


118. Given relatively concentrated markets, the threat of potential entry is often the major
force disciplining market behavior. Fortunately, natural barriers to entry in the shipping
sector are relatively low. Although significant capital investment is required, the
overwhelming majority of this investment is in the ships themselves. These assets are
extremely mobile, and can be readily redeployed to another market if entry is unsuccessful.
Also, for the most part the technology used in the shipping industry is generic and readily
available for potential new entrants.

119. For these reasons, in the absence of regulatory or legislative barriers the threat of
entry is likely to be real and constant. It is also likely to be effective in disciplining market
behavior. This is because the stakes for the incumbent operator are very high. One
consequence of concentration is that successful new entry may not mean that an incumbent
simply loses market share; it may mean it is forced to abandon the market altogether, if the
incumbent does not adjust their services. This process is an essential part of the dynamics of
the market. It is the principal means by which competition ensures that shipping lines
operate efficiently and do not make excess profits. In seeking to enhance competition in the
delivery of domestic shipping services, this assessment has therefore focused particularly on
measures that would increase the opportunities and incentives for new players to enter the
market, and for existing operators to expand or vary the services they offer.

The need for clarity

120. The stakeholder consultation process undertaken as part of this assessment revealed
that the regulatory system is inconsistently understood. Amongst industry participants,
there were, for example, differences of views on the criteria that applied to the issuance of a
Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), and what this implied for the ease (or otherwise)
with which one could be obtained. There was uncertainty as to whether an operator who
had received a CPC as a tramper vessel (that is, without specifying the intended route for the
vessel) could then use that vessel to operate a scheduled service as a common carrier. There
were different understandings of the conditions under which foreign registered vessels on
charter to Filipino shipping companies could be used to provide domestic shipping services.

121. These uncertainties can in themselves constitute a barrier to entry. Potential new
entrants face a lower business risk when the rules that apply in the target market, and the
way in which they are applied, are clearly understood by all parties. Uncertainties tend to bias
the market in favor of incumbents: where the rules are unclear, those who have been
operating in the market for some time can draw on their experience of how things operate,
while newcomers do not have this advantage. Improving clarity and certainty will therefore
have a pro-competitive effect.

122. Improved communication can help, but the most powerful tool for improving
understanding is simplification. Over time, most regulatory systems accrue rules, practices
and procedures that may once have been necessary but which are no longer required or
appropriate to current conditions. These historical accretions make the system more complex
and less transparent than it need be. This appears to have happened in the case of the
regulation of domestic shipping in the Philippines. Enhancing the competitive environment
                                                                                              51
                                               Working paper for comments and subject to change.


therefore requires a review of all regulations and practices that could — actually or
potentially — restrict the flexibility of shipping lines to provide services wherever, whenever
and (subject to safety and environmental constraints) with whatever ships they see a
commercial opportunity to do so.

Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)

The “prior operator rule”

123. The prior operator rule is a legacy of the period in which domestic shipping was tightly
regulated, and the policy priority was ensuring the stability of services provided by existing
operators. Existing operators were given the right to contest the entry of new firms in order
to ensure the continuity of service in light of the potential for ruinous competition.

124. In practice, the application of the rule has been progressively weakened over time (see
Box). In particular, where the applicant previously had to prove inadequacy of service, more
recently the burden has shifted to the existing operator to prove that existing capacity is
sufficient.


                              Box 6: Prior operator rule in shipping

 If the demand warrants additional fleet in a route, priority is given to the existing operator
 to put in the additional vessel to meet the demand; but if there are several existing
 operators in the route, priority is given to the first applicant. If there is no existing operator
 in a route, entry is allowed and the new entrant is protected in his investment by not
 allowing another operator until he has recovered his investment. Under the three rules,
 however, the past service records of the operator/s or the new applicant/s were not taken
 into consideration.

 Route liberalization was first introduced in 1992. 2 general principles are observed for the
 issuance of a license. First, the interest of the public shall prevail over the “grandfather
 rules.” Second, the presumption of public need for a service is deemed in favor of the
 applicant for a license while the burden of proving that the proposed service is not needed
 shall be with oppositor/s who is/are the current authorized operator/s.

 Given these principles, routes were opened to entry to at least 2 operators (MARINA MC
 No. 71 and MC No. 80 in 1992). Monopolized routes were opened for entry to additional
 operators. Operators in developmental routes, on the other hand, were accorded
 protection for their investment for a maximum period of five years, after which, the route is
 open to entry to at least one additional operator. This change in rule would definitely
 encourage the operator to increase his efficiency to recover his investments before
 competition from additional operators sets in. Entry of newly acquired vessels in routes
 already served by existing franchised operators, including developmental routes, is also
 deregulated provided that it will introduce innovative, technologically and cost-effective
                                                                                                52
                                                      Working paper for comments and subject to change.


     shipping services, among others.

     Increase in capacity is also allowed through replacement with a bigger vessel, introduction
     of additional vessels, and/or increase in frequency of existing vessels. An operator can also
     change his routing pattern through the omission of ports, addition of one or more ports, or
     the introduction of an entirely new route provided, however, that the change is not in
     conflict with the schedule and frequency of existing operators and that no route is left
     unserved by the rerouting.

     The initial liberalization efforts were further strengthened with the issuance of EO No. 185
     in 1994 and its corresponding implementing rules and regulations under MARINA MC No.
     106 in 1995. In particular, all routes that have been serviced by any operator for an
     aggregate period of at least five years shall be open for entry to additional operators… In
     addition, when a vessel is replaced to increase capacity, its license is revoked to ensure that
     it will not be used anywhere else and, hence, will not result in increased tonnage in the
     routes. Similarly, when capacity is increased through the introduction of additional vessel
     that is chartered from a franchised operator, the original franchise of the vessel is revoked.

     The implementing guidelines of EO No. 185 were revised under MARINA MC No. 161 in
     2000, providing further dimension to the liberalization efforts. In particular, the conditions
     or criteria under which possible protection could be accorded to operators were specified.
     These include conditions for the existence of ruinous competition and protection of
     investment of pioneering operators. Only under the conditions specified should entry of
     additional operators to a route be restricted. The conditions set therefore added greater
     transparency to the rules of the game.

125. Despite this progressive liberalization, the way in which the CPC process is currently
administered provides the existing operator with the opportunity to prove adequacy of the
existing service or, if it is inadequate, to provide the required capacity (prior operator or
grandfather rule). As discussed above, RA 9295 is expressly deregulatory in intent57, and
formally established the ability of domestic shipping operators to establish their own rates.
It preserved the requirement that operators obtain a CPC, and that, in their application for a
CPC, operators specify the service that they intend to provide. But it does not expressly
require the MARINA to assess or form a judgment on the effect of granting the application on
the viability of pre-existing services. Rather, insofar as it refers to the impact of the proposed
service on third parties, the clear focus is on “the economic and beneficial effect which the
proposed services shall have to the port province or region which it proposes to serve” (See
Box).

industry’.

                                Box 7: Issuance of authority to operate

     The MARINA shall have the power and authority to issue a Certificate of Public Convenience
     to qualified domestic ship operators, taking into consideration the economic and beneficial
     effect which the proposed service shall have to the port, province of region which it
     proposes to serve, and the financial capacity of the domestic ship operator to provide and
     sustain safe reliable, adequate, efficient and economic service in accordance with the
     standards set by the government regulation.

     Every domestic ship operator shall state in its application the route it proposes to serve, and
     the service it proposes to offer. Domestic ship operators who do not intend to operate in a
     fixed route shall nevertheless state in its application the service it proposes to offer.

Source: RA 9295 (2004), Section 7.

126. Since RA 9295 has come into force, MARINA has continued its procedures for
evaluating and hearing CPC applications and still requires the applicant to inform the
affected liner shipping operators of their application. The adequacy of existing services is
assessed through a quasi-judicial process where all parties present their arguments 58 .
MARINA staff conducts due diligence on the application including technical evaluation of the
applicant’s financial capacity, documentary evidences presented, and feasibility study of the
route applied for. MARINA also requires the operator-applicant to publish in a newspaper of
general circulation information on the application and the date and time of the hearing. It is
required to submit a list of the existing operators in the route so that these may be informed
of the application and invited on the hearing date for the presentation of arguments.

127. The “prior operator” needs only contest the feasibility study of the applicant and
prove that the existing number of vessels is already sufficient and that the route would no
longer be financially viable with the entry of an additional operator. The possibility to
contest an application delays the entry of a new shipping operator, and constitutes a barrier
to entry. It protects the existing operator or operators from competition, making it difficult
and risky for new applicants to enter the route.

128. There is a range of views on whether this provision has, in practice, a substantial effect
on the ease with which operators can introduce new services . But it clearly creates the
possibility that an incumbent will use the process to delay the entry of a new competitor (as
indicated by a small shipping operator); to add to the cost that the competitor faces in
entering the market; and, in the extreme case, to block entry altogether.




58
  Details of the relevant requirements and procedures are set out in MARINA Memorandum Circular No 74-A 13
July 1995.
                                                                                                       54

129. The abolition of the “prior operator rule” is not explicit in RA 9295 , but it would be
consistent with the general deregulatory intent of the Act. Given the criteria specified in
Section 7 of the Act (see Box), it appears open to MARINA to decide on the merits of the
application for a CPC without reference to commercial impact of new entry on existing
operators, and without according incumbents to right to object to new entry.

Cost of application

130. Authority to operate in any shipping route for liner and tramp shipping anywhere
within the Philippines is granted by MARINA through the CPC or “franchise”. The CPC is
issued to a domestic shipping corporation and has a validity for a period of not more than 25
years. An initial application fee of USD 0.26 (Php 11.00) per gross ton (GT) is charged, but this
does not include document certification fees, vessel registration fees, publication cost,
applicant’s legal costs and other expenses associated with the processing of the application.
The CPCs are issued to citizens of the Philippines, or a partnership/corporation that involved
at least 60 percent of the authorized capital stock owned by citizens of the Philippines.

131. There are three basic considerations for the grant of a CPC to an applicant shipping
operator:

        Proof of Filipino Citizenship. This is consistent with previous legislation including
         Chapter III, Sections 5 and 6 of RA 9295 which limits such trade to majority-owned
         Filipino enterprises (60 percent-40 percent). This is also consistent with Article XII
         Section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which states that “No franchise,
         certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall
         be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations
         organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least 60 per centum of whose capital is
         owned by such citizens”.
        Financial Capacity. Applicant is required to show proof that he has the financial
         resources to undertake the service applied for in a safe manner.
        Need for the Service. Applicant is required to show proof that there is need for the
         service (if none is being provided) or additional capacity (if there are existing operators
         in the route).
        In addition to the 3 considerations mentioned, the applicant is required, in the pre-
         approval stage, to submit various documents including vessel documents and PPA
         certification of berthing availability when there is no certainty that the application will
         be approved.59 The applicant typically incurs substantial expense even before MARINA
         starts the quasi-judicial process on the application.


59
    MARINA MC No. 169 enumerated the requirements for submitting an application for a CPC as follows: (i) duly
notarized application; (ii) vessel documents including certification of inspection and radio/ship station license;
(iii) provisional/final class certificate; (iv) passenger insurance coverage at P100,000.00/passenger; (v) oil
pollution cover; (vi) PPA certification of berthing space availability; (vii) financial evaluation documents; (viii)
NAMRIA certificate of distance (of the route); (ix) 3 colored photographs of the vessel; and (x) feasibility study
(for routes with 2 or more operators). In addition, certification as to publication of notice of hearing is also
required prior to the hearing of the application.
                                                                                                                 55

Differentiation between tramp and liner services

132. At present, CPCs are divided into “liner CPCs” and “tramper CPCs”. In principle, liner
CPCs are issued for the operation of scheduled services on fixed routes that offer space to a
number of shippers on each sailing, while tramper CPCs are issued to vessels that provide on-
demand services, typically to meet the requirements of a single shipper.

133. However, there does not appear to be any effective mechanism for preventing the
holder of a tramper CPC from operating a regular scheduled service that provides cargo
space to a variety of customers; that is, from operating a liner service. From an economic
perspective, this may be beneficial. Operators of tramp ships are an important source of
potential new entry on liner routes, and allowing them to freely do so enhances the
competitive environment. There seems little to be gained from continuing to formally
distinguish between the 2 forms of CPC and the interests of clarity and certainty would be
served by eliminating this distinction.

Flexibility within a CPC

134. In applying for a CPC, the shipping operator is required to specify the ships that it will
use and the services that it will provide. Where the service is a liner service, this implies
defining the route(s) on which the vessels will be deployed.

135. This practice places limits on the flexibility that an operator has in responding to
market conditions by deploying vessels in other routes or replacing an existing vessel with
another. As the CPC is issued to the operator, it is able to vary which of the vessels is assigned
to which of the routes included on its CPC. But if the operator wishes to redeploy a vessel to
a route not specified in the CPC, or to introduce a new vessel, it is necessary to obtain
approval to amend the CPC, or to acquire a Special Permit.60

136. In a market-based system, vessel deployment should be a management prerogative.
Seeking approval imposes additional costs on the shipping operator, as, for each amendment
to the CPC, MARINA imposes additional fees. This could be avoided, while retaining the CPC
framework, by allowing an operator, once it has been granted a CPC, to vary the routes and
vessels covered by the CPC simply by providing notice to MARINA that it intends to make
these changes, rather than seeking approval to make them.

days only) is for the use of a Philippine registered ship on a route prior to obtaining a new CPC, or during peak
times, holidays seasons, ships are drydocking, etc.

environmental performance of domestic shipping operations remains a matter of public
concern62. Serious maritime casualties are comparatively high for Philippine flagged vessels:
a comparative analysis by Lloyd’s List Intelligence shows that the Philippines has the 15th
highest casualty rate (measured as the number of serious maritime casualties divided by the
size of the national fleet)63. Inspection of relevant incidents recorded in the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) database indicates that the majority of these causalities relate
to domestic shipping operations.

138. As well as its obvious importance from a social perspective, the enforcement of
appropriate safety and environmental standards is also a competition issue. Effective
competition in domestic shipping does require that all participants are held to the same
safety and environmental standards. The definition and enforcement of quality standards is a
crucial part of the role of MARINA.64 The Philippines has subscribed and committed adhering
to almost all relevant international conventions in terms of International Maritime
Organization, International Labour Organization, International Association of Marine Aids to
Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities, and other global standards. By actually enforcing
compliances related to manning, safety, shipbuilding, stability, bending and torsion,
navigation, the maneuvering gap amongst vessel operators would shrink since obeying to
standards has a cost.

139. The process of issuing Certificates of Public Convenience can be a useful regulatory
tool in ensuring that this condition is met. The intention that it should do so is clear in RA
9295, which requires that MARINA, in granting an application for a CPC, take into
consideration, “the financial capacity of the domestic ship operator to provide and sustain
safe, reliable, adequate, efficient and economic service”.65

Chartering foreign vessels for deployment in the domestic routes

140. Ships undertaking commercial domestic shipping operations are, as a general rule,
required to be locally constructed or purchased and imported into the Philippines.
However, the Philippines provides 2 mechanisms for the chartering of foreign owned vessels
via a Special Permit and through a bareboat charter.

141. MC 2011-04 provides for the chartering of foreign-owned vessel by accredited
companies for operation on domestic routes under particular circumstances 66 . This
memorandum circular predicates the issuance of the Special Permit on the “objective of
insuring the provision of required shipping services where such is not readily available and

suitable from the domestic fleet” to ensure efficient trade and commerce, delivery of critical
service/commodities and infrastructure and development projects. This Special Permit is
awarded primarily to specialized ships, such as oil explorers, cable laying vessels and research
vessels, that have no counterpart in the country.

142. PD 760 allows for a second mode for chartering vessels through a bareboat charter.
This process allows domestic firms to lease a ship for a specific time period to test the
feasibility of plying new routes or using new vessel types, without needing to shoulder the full
costs of purchasing and importing the vessel outright.

143. While the chartering process has been in existence at MARINA for decades, recent
attempts by domestic companies to employ bareboat charters have been made more
expensive by the tax policies as interpreted by the Department of Finance and the Bureau
of Internal Revenue. Since the passage of PD 760 on the bareboat chartering law in 1975, it
had been standard practice in the Philippines to allow the tariff and duty-free entry of
bareboat chartered foreign vessels. Instead, bareboat charterers paid a withholding tax at a
4.5 percent rate on the value of the charter party (under PD 1540 and the Tax Reform Act of
1987 – RA 8424) and a re-export bond to ensure that the vessel leaves the country upon the
expiration of the charter agreement.

144. However, there is a lack of a clear regulatory basis on said tax status of bareboat
chartered vessels, for which the DOF has decided to treat them as direct vessel
importations. Current interpretation of the regulations now requires that companies pay the
full 3 percent import duties and a VAT of 12 percent on the total value of the vessel. The
interpretation of the DOF vis-a-vis the customs and taxes payable on such a transaction
remains in conflict with the policies currently understood by MARINA, as well as the shipping
industry.

145. The change in the tax status of bareboat chartering has limited the willingness of firms
to charter vessels. In certain instances, it has become unfeasible to recover the additional
taxes over the course of the limited charter period.

146. The ability to access the international charter market provides an important element
of flexibility to domestic shipping operators. This is especially so when innovative
technologies are being trialed or new services being tested, but more generally it allows
operators to take advantage of opportunities to secure tonnage at the lowest possible cost in
a highly competitive global market. With a substantial number of foreign-owned vessels
available for charter, due to the decline in international trade and the entry of new vessels
displacing older and lower capacity ones, capacity is immediately available that could replace
older vessels requiring high operating and maintenance costs and of low reliability due to
frequent breakdowns.

147. Ready access to the global charter market allows domestic shipping capacity to adjust
more quickly to market demand, and the deployment of chartered foreign vessels can help
address the high operating cost of older vessels in the fleet. Provided freedom of entry is
maintained, the benefits from such alternative would be passed on to shippers in terms of
                                                                                             58

     lower shipping rates and improvement in the levels of service. It is therefore important to
     achieve an appropriate balance between the policy objectives of, on the one hand, ensuring
     that vessels operating in the coastal trades are registered under the P hilippines’ flag and are
     thus taxed appropriately; and on the other hand, fostering the competitiveness of domestic
     shipping operations.

     Restrictions on inputs

     Restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade

     148. Current efforts to develop the quality and capacity of domestic shipping services are
     supported by Philippine law. It is the national policy to “encourage the development of a
     viable shipbuilding and ship repair industry to support the expansion and modernization of
     the Philippine domestic merchant marine fleet” as stated in RA 9295.

     149. Section 20 of RA 9295 imposes restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade. It
     requires MARINA to evaluate and determine the progressive capability of Philippine
     shipyards to build and construct new vessels for the domestic trade. If domestic shipyards
     are found capable of providing sufficient vessels to meet domestic demand for vessels up to a
     certain size threshold, then all domestic ship operators will be discouraged from importing
     new or previously owned vessels that are less than that size for the domestic trade. In the
     first year, the size threshold was set at 500 GRT, with the intention that this should be
     increased over time as the capability of domestic shipyards improved.

     150. This policy reduces the ability of firms to source their vessels from the most efficient
     producer. This provision has allowed for the creation of domestic shipyards that can serve
     the needs of the local shipping companies. Further deregulating this sector would expose
     these local shipyards to global competition and encourage greater efficiency among these
     producers.

     Requirement for drydocking of domestic vessels in domestic shipyards

     151. Presidential Decree 1221 requires that all Philippine-owned and/or registered vessels
     undertake all repairs, improvement, alteration, reconditioning, conversion or dry docking
     with MARINA-registered ship repair yards67. MARINA exempts vessels from this requirement
     only for exceptional cases. These include primarily the Philippine-owned vessels that are
     engaged in the overseas trade.

     152. MARINA Administrator Emerson M. Lorenzo, in his 11 November 2011 address at the
     Philippine International Maritime Conference at the World Trade Center stated that
     operators preferred to have their ships dry docked and repaired in foreign shipyards due to
     lower expenses and shorter downtime. During the interview program, several operators

confirmed that this was certainly the case for larger vessels, with the cost of dry docking in
the Philippines being up to 50 percent higher than the cost of dry docking overseas. There is
only one facility in the Philippines that is able to handle the largest vessels operating in the
domestic trade. In the absence of effective competition from overseas facilities, shipowners
with large vessels face what is effectively a mandated monopoly for the provision of dry
docking services.

MARINA’s monitoring capacity of domestic market

153. MARINA’s capability to monitor shipping operations in the whole country is limited
and requires significant improvement. It has a limited number of regional offices which is
insufficient to monitor all of the country’s shipping routes. With the expected reforms of the
sector, this, in turn, requires a strong monitoring capability to prevent shipping operators
from charging exorbitant rates or failing to provide the required capacities. It must also
monitor market shares of shipping operators in specific routes.

154. An established and efficient system to monitor the performance of shipping operators
per route would allow MARINA ensuring that, among other responsibilities, monopoly
operators do not abuse and set high rates unilaterally or those with more than one
operator do not collude in setting high rates. This requires the creation of a systemwide
Philippine maritime database to allow marina to constantly monitor the operations of the
domestic shipping fleet.

                                   The way forward

155. The key task in enhancing the competitiveness of domestic shipping is to ensure the
effective operation in the market for shipping services. Many of the recommendations that
follow therefore focus on measures that will serve to ensure that some market participants
do not enjoy an unfair advantage over others; and measures that lower regulatory barriers to
entry.

156. Regulations should focus less on objectives that can be satisfied by market
competition, such as entry decisions and pricing, and more towards objectives that require
government intervention, such as safety and environmental concerns. The government
needs to better deploy its resources to provide oversight over a domestic shipping system
that must be both cost-efficient and extremely safe.

157. As such, improving competitiveness also requires reform of regulations that increase
the costs faced by all shipping operators. The direction forward therefore includes
recommendations to reform regulations on public safety that raise, or may tend to raise, the
costs faced by incumbents and new entrants alike. Finally, since markets work more
effectively when decisions are based on timely and accurate information, the direction
forward includes recommendations designed to improve the quality of information available
to both regulators and market participants.

Creating a level playing field

Remove opportunity for incumbents to object to granting of the CPC

158. In the present process, an application for a CPC to operate a new service can be
challenged by an operator already providing services in the relevant market (MARINA ’s
implementing regulations). The incumbent operators can contest the feasibility study of the
new applicant by arguing that the market is too small to accommodate an additional
participant and that new entry would not be financially viable.

159. This provision creates the possibility that an incumbent will use the process to delay
the entry of a new competitor (as indicated by a small shipping operator); to add to the
cost that the competitor faces in entering the market; and, in the extreme case, to block
entry altogether. Such a system creates an uneven playing field that benefits incumbents.

Focus CPC conditions on quality standards

160. Effective competition in domestic shipping requires that all participants are held to the
same safety and environmental standards. The process of issuing Certificates of Public
Convenience can be a useful regulatory tool in ensuring that this condition is met. The
intention that it should do so is clear in RA 9295, which requires that MARINA, in granting an
application for a CPC, take into consideration, “the financial capacity of the domestic ship


                                                                                           61
                                              Working paper for comments and subject to change.


operator to provide and sustain safe, reliable, adequate, efficient and economic service”.68

Facilitating greater competition between operators

Streamline the CPC process

161. The application process for a CPC is quite expensive for the applicant due to the
application and other MARINA fees, publication requirements and legal fees. Many of these
steps are repetitive and may be further streamlined to minimize the processing time and
costs for the issuance of the CPC.

162. Once the concept of objection by incumbents is eliminated from the process of
awarding a CPC, there is no longer any need for an ex ante quasi-judicial process. This
should facilitate a significant reduction in both the time and the cost involved in granting a
CPC application, and help refocus MARINA’s activities on ensuring that all participants are
held to the same safety and environmental standards.

Use a single form of CPC

163. There seems little to be gained from continuing to formally distinguish between the 2
forms of CPC and the interests of clarity and certainty would be served by eliminating the
distinction between “liner” and “tramper” CPCs. Tramp shipping provides an important
source of potential new entry on liner routes, and allowing them to freely do so enhances the
competitive environment.

Allow greater flexibility within a CPC

164. Seeking approval imposes additional costs on the shipping operator, as, for each
amendment to the CPC, MARINA imposes additional fees. In a market-based system, vessel
deployment should be a management prerogative. This could be avoided, while retaining the
CPC framework, by allowing an operator, once it has been granted a CPC, to vary the routes
and vessels covered by the CPC simply by providing notice to MARINA that it intends to make
these changes, rather than seeking approval to make them.

More efficient and cost effective logistics

Remove requirement to drydock in the Philippines

165. Current regulations require domestic vessels to undertake their dry docking and ship
repair/maintenance requirements in domestic shipyards. This policy actually reduces the
level of competition faced by domestic shipyards and increases the costs faced by domestic
shipping operators.

166. Several private shipping companies consulted during the stakeholder engagement
process indicated that, particularly for larger ships, they would prefer to have their ships
dry docked and repaired in foreign shipyards, indicating that, for the largest vessels, savings
of up to 50 percent of dry docking costs could be saved if this requirement were eliminated.

Remove restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade

167. Current regulations impose restrictions on vessel importation for domestic trade.
These laws require MARINA to evaluate and determine the capability of registered shipyards
to build and construct new vessels for the domestic trade. If MARINA finds there to be
domestic capability to meet domestic demand, all domestic ship operators are discouraged
from importing new or previously owned vessels that are less than 500 GRT for the domestic
trade. This policy reduces the ability of firms to source their vessels from the most efficient
producer.

Facilitate the use of chartered foreign vessels

168. Shipowners’ costs can be reduced by ensuring that they have ready access to the pool
of vessels available on the global market. Bareboat chartering is an allowable mechanism for
firms to lease ships temporarily to test out new routes or new shipping technologies. While
the chartering process is still in existence, the current bottleneck involves the difference in
interpretation of existing tax policies pertaining to these charters between MARINA and the
Department of Finance. This bareboat chartering process should be facilitated to improve the
quality and the level of innovation in the domestic shipping market.

Remove nexus between PPA revenue and cargo handling charges

169. Under current administrative arrangements, PPA regulates the charges that are levied
by cargo handling operators. But it is also a commercial beneficiary of increases in those
rates: the PPA receives a 10 percent and a 20 percent share of the domestic and foreign
cargo handling rates collected, respectively. This creates a conflict of interest for PPA.

170. This is desirable to remove this apparent or real conflict of interest by changing the
structure of the fee paid to PPA by cargo handling operators. Rather than setting this fee as
a percentage of revenue, it could be specified as a fixed annual charge, or a fixed rate per unit
of cargo handled. This would break the nexus between cargo handling charges and PPA
revenue, and remove the perception — and the risk — that PPA’s regulatory decisions on
cargo handling charges are influenced by its commercial interests.

Promoting better decisions

Improve information on cargo flows and current services

171. While both MARINA and PPA collect information on the maritime transport system,
information on cargo volumes and shipping services is not systematically compiled. Much of
the data are captured at the regional level and are not consolidated to provide a system-wide
                                                                                              63

snapshot of maritime operations.

172. Better information would be beneficial for a variety of regulatory and planning
purposes. With the expected reforms of the sector, MARINA will require a strong monitoring
capability in order to detect and remedy market failures as they arise. Better-integrated
information should also help support PPA in the execution of its planning functions and in
monitoring the performance of particular service provides within its ports.

Freely disseminate information to actual and potential market participants

173. For the greatest benefit to be derived from investments in maritime data collection, it
is important that this data is — to the extent consistent with commercial confidentiality —
made widely available. By providing greater access to the database, the information can be
made more useful to the industry in its entirety. Consequently, competition will be more
effective if individual market participants have better access to information and can make
strategic decisions in a more timely manner.

Conclusion

174. The World Bank Group’s Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice Group
Competition Policy team is committed to helping the government of the Philippines remove
barriers to competition in the domestic shipping industry. The study is aimed at creating a
more level playing field for domestic shipping firms by highlighting regulations that minimize
the ability of firms to properly compete in the market and that contribute to the high
operating costs of the industry.

175. The main competition issue identified is that the application process for the license to
operate a shipping service in the Philippines can be contested by incumbent operators by
arguing that competition will be financially ruinous. This licensing process creates the
possibility that an incumbent will use the process to delay the entry of a new competitor; to
add to the cost that the competitor faces in entering the market; and, in the extreme case, to
block entry altogether

176. Other regulatory barriers have been shown to increase the cost of shipping operations
in the country. Philippine regulations require domestic vessels to undertake all drydocking
and ship repair requirements in domestic shipyards, even if foreign shipyards are available to
conduct the same services for up to 50 percent less cost. Current regulations impose
restrictions on vessel importation and assess tax payments for chartered vessels that make
short-term chartering uneconomic in many cases. The structure of government fees imposed
on private cargo handlers creates a conflict of interest, with the government directly
benefiting from fee increases. The industry suffers from a dearth of available data that make
government regulation and private sector investment planning very challenging.

177. Reforming these regulations could improve the functioning of the domestic shipping
sector. The study estimates that amending the domestic shipping regulations can generate an
additional US18 million in annual investment in the domestic shipping sector by 2018.
