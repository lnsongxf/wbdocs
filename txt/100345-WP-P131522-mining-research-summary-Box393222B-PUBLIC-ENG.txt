ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM INDUSTRIAL MINING
    IN MADAGASCAR
      RESEARCH SUMMARY
Acknowledgements


This research on the Economic Contributions from Industrial Mining in Madagascar was commissioned by the
World Bank Energy and Extractive Industry Global Practice from the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining
(CSRM), at the University of Queensland. The World Bank team, comprised of Mylène Faure, Olivia Rakotomalala
and Remi Pelon (Task Team Leader), benefited from the input of several colleagues, including Bryan Land and
Keiko Kubota. The CSRM team was led by Cristian Parra and Daniel Franks successively, and comprised Fitsum
Weldegirogis, Lynda Lawson, Kathryn Sturman, Rupert Cook and Saleem Ali.

The present Research Summary is based on a set of brochures and an economic model prepared by the CSRM
team who conducted the research. A Technical Annex is available separately with the key assumptions and
justifications of the model.

The research would not have been possible without the participation and the contribution of many individuals
from Government, mining companies, civil society organizations whom we would like to thank for their invaluable
contributions at different stages. In particular, we would like to acknowledge key members of the Orientation
Committee: Daniella Rajo Randriafeno, Pamphile Rakotoarimanana and Gerard Rakototafika, from the Mining
Ministry; Ny Fansa Rakotomalala and Willy Ranjatoelina from the Chamber of Mines; Danny Denolf and Stephanie
Ranaivo from GIZ; Martin Nicolls from WWF; and Eddy Rasolomanana from University of Antananarivo.

The project was made possible by the financing support of the South African Trust Fund for Sub-Saharan African
Energy, Transport and Extractive Industries (SAFETE).

                    How do governance issues affect mining development?

  Governance of the mining sector will largely determine whether the sector will either bring about
  sustainable development in Madagascar, or further destabilise an already fragile economy.
  The island’s underground wealth constitutes a non-renewable asset that requires cautious and
  effective management by Government. In some countries, like Chile or Botswana, the skillfull
  management of the mining sector has translated mining into a comparative advantage.
  If the mining sector is riddled with vested interests, opacity, non-compliance with rule of law and un-
  regulated environmental and social impacts, it could lead to the degradation of the country’s political
  and economic conditions. Conversely, complete transparency, effective Government and civil society
  oversight, with a view to use mining wealth to improve the lives of the Malagasy people in the short
  and long term, will ensure the sector can become a real catalyst for development.

                                       a first step. Additional research on environmental and

                                       complement this work to provide for a more complete

Macroeconomic Impact

Large scale mining is projected to have a growing macroeconomic impact in Madagascar, with increased
monetary flows (salaries, domestic expenditure and fiscal income), and a rising contribution to GDP and exports.


Key Findings

Note:
The scenarios include the following mining activities:
Scenario 1: QMM, Ambatovy and Kroama
Scenario 2: S1 + Toliara Sands and Sakoa Region
Scenario 3: S2 + WISCO
Domestic procurement includes the potential expenditure at local or national level during operational phases.
Fiscal contribution includes: royalties, corporate taxes, withholding taxes on dividends, customs duties and import taxes,
professional taxes, non-refundable VAT, foreign transfer taxes, and minimum corporate taxes. This fiscal contribution does not
include indirect effects of taxes and personal taxes

result in a missed development opportunity. EITI, which

is a critical tool to counter such risks, and should
be promoted and streamlined. The central and local
governments should seek support from, and partner
with, development organisations, but also continue to
strengthen national leadership. This would ensure that
development priorities are identified and monetary
benefits from mining are effectively directed into
focused social and economic development programs.

36 | ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INDUSTRIAL MINING IN MADAGASCAR




The mining industry’s demand for goods and services presents an opportunity for the growth of local businesses
in Madagascar. If well planned, the mining sector can create positive links with a range of economic sectors and
suppliers with different operational, administrative and technological capacities. Both Ambatovy and QMM have
supported local procurement and set an encouraging standard to guide future mining development. Partnerships
for the provision of complementary public and private infrastructure can enhance regional development and
should be a key feature of the next generation of mining projects.

           QMM is supporting accessibility and quality of
           education through programs including scholarships,
           literacy (in 2012, 178 young people participated),
           civil education, technical training and leadership.
           In 2012, the company completed 33,518 hours of
           training in technical health, safety, environmental
           language, leadership and other skills.
           QMM implements the Integrated Talent Management
           System (SIGT) to support the management of
           employee performance, as well as development of
           local skills to create a pool of local expertise. The
           company also has a scholarship program, Rio Tinto for
           Education (RISE) in partnership with Pact Madagascar
           which is expected to deliver about 1,300 scholarships
           in primary, secondary, and university levels.
           QMM is also currently supporting entrepreneurship
           training for local suppliers under the CARA program,
           which trained 278 people in 2011 and 335 people in
           2012.

                                     Ambatovy

           Ambatovy has reported training enrolments in 2009-
           2011 in areas such as health and safety, language,
           office and administration software, area and vender
           specific training, operators training, and skilled
           maintenance training in trades including electricians,
           instrument technicians, millwrights, welders and
           pipefitters.
           The company also launched the Ambatovy Leadership
           Development Program (ALDP) and a Mentorship
           Program to support the transfer of knowledge and
           experience as well as career advancement.
           With respect to preparing the local workforce for
           mining employment, Ambatovy has a Technical
           Excellence Program (PEXT) which offers 18 months of
           training and a two-month internship for recent high-
           school graduates in the Atsinanana Region. Under
           this program, the company reported its first wave of
           43 students in 2011 which more than doubled to 98
           students in 2012.
