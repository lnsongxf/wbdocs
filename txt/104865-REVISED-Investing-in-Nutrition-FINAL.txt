         NOTES
    a Assessment of the WHA nutrition targets on childhood overweight and low birthweight were not included in this analysis; additional research is needed to
    determine what interventions would support achievement of these targets.
    b The research team is deeply grateful to the following members of the Technical Advisory Group for their contributions to this work: Victor Aguayo, UNICEF; Hugh
    Bagnall-Oakley, Save the Children UK; Robert Black, Johns Hopkins University; Helen Connolly, American Institutes for Research; Luz Maria De-Regil, Micronutrient
    Initiative; Kaia Engesveen, World Health Organization; Patrizia Fracassi, Scaling Up Nutrition Movement Secretariat; Robert Greener, Oxford Policy Management;
    Saul Guerrero, Action Against Hunger UK; Lawrence Haddad, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Rebecca Heidkamp, Johns Hopkins University;
    Sue Horton, University of Waterloo; David Laborde, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Ferew Lemma, Ethiopia Ministry of Health; Kedar Mankad,
    ONE Campaign; Saul Morris, Children's Investment Fund Foundation; Sandra Mutuma, Action Against Hunger UK; Obey Assery-Nkya, Tanzania Office of the Prime
    Minister; Kelechi Ohiri, Nigeria Ministry of Health; Anne Peniston, USAID; Clara Picanyol, Oxford Policy Management; Ellen Piwoz, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation;
    Amanda Pomeroy-Stevens, JSI/SPRING Project; and William Winfrey, Avenir Health.
    c This priority package of interventions for urgent scale up includes: vitamin A supplementation for children, promotion of good infant and young child nutrition
    and hygiene practices, antenatal micronutrient supplementation, intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for pregnant women, iron and folic acid supplements
    for adolescent girls, staple food fortification, pro-breastfeeding social policies, use of available mass and social media to promote breastfeeding, and treatment of
    severe acute malnutrition.
    d Investing in the treatment of wasting alone is not enough to meet the target and a better understanding of interventions that can be brought to scale to prevent
    wasting is urgently needed. 860,000 child lives saved is a conservative lower bound estimate of the impact.
    e The aggregate cost of $69.9 billion is not the sum of the costs of the four individual targets because some interventions are shared among different targets and
    costs for those interventions overlap.
    f In addition, improvements are needed in resource tracking for ODA spent on nutrition so that it is clearer where both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
    investments are made.
