Reflecting the growing momentum for carbon pricing worldwide, the 2016 edition of the State and Trends of
Carbon Pricing report targets the wide audience of public and private stakeholders engaged in carbon pricing
design and implementation. This report also provides critical input for negotiators involved in implementation
of the Paris Agreement at the meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Marrakesh.

As in the previous editions, the report provides an up-to-date overview of existing and emerging carbon
pricing instruments around the world, including national and subnational initiatives. Furthermore, it gives an
overview of current corporate carbon pricing initiatives.

Another key focus of the report is on the importance of aligning carbon pricing with the broader policy
landscape. The analysis provides lessons for policymakers on how to maximize synergies between climate
mitigation and other related policies, while managing potential tensions and tradeoffs.

This year’s report provides new modelling analysis to demonstrate the crucial benefits that an international
carbon market established under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement could provide in reducing the costs to
countries of achieving their emission reduction targets. An international carbon market could thus enable
greater ambition in taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the 2°C
climate stabilization goal.

The task team responsible for this report intends to select new relevant topics to be explored in future
editions. These topics could include, for example, the interaction of carbon taxes and fiscal policy. As part
of the World Bank’s expanded carbon pricing intelligence program, additional analytical topics such as the
effectiveness of carbon pricing may also be explored.

The report benefited greatly from the valuable written contributions and perspectives of our colleagues in
the climate and carbon finance community, ensuring the quality and clarity of this report: Conor Barry, Carter
Brandon, Karan Capoor, Hannah Cushing, Kurt van Dender, Shari Friedman, Dafei Huang, Ying Liu, Blanca
Moreno-Dodson, Guoqiang Qian, Nigel Topping, and Peter Zapfel. Section 4 strongly benefited from the
contribution of Ajay Gambir and Adam Hawkes of Imperial College London.

1	 While this report covers the period from January 1, 2015 until September 1, 2016, the authors decided to include the entry into force of the Paris Agreement given
   its global significance. The authors recognize that other significant developments have occurred after September 1, 2016 and before the publication of the report.
   These developments include the agreement reached at the 39th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on a global market-based measure
   to control CO2 emissions from international aviation (see footnote 103 in the International aviation section in Section 2.2 for further details), the announcement of
   a minimum federal carbon price in Canada, and the adoption of the carbon pricing legislation in Washington State, which happened after September 1, 2016 and
   before the publication of the report. They will be discussed in the 2017 edition of the Carbon Pricing Watch and the State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report.

    given its global significance. The authors recognize that other significant developments have occurred after September 1, 2016 and before the publication of the
    report. These developments include the agreement reached at the 39th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on a global market-based
    measure to control CO2 emissions from international aviation, the announcement of a minimum federal carbon price in Canada, and the adoption of the carbon
    pricing legislation in Washington State, which happened after September 1, 2016 and before the publication of the report. They will be discussed in the 2017

20	 For the purpose of this report, carbon pricing includes carbon and other market mechanisms. The authors recognize that different interpretations are possible
    since references to market mechanisms in INDCs are not always presented in a clear and consistent manner.
21	 As of September 1, 2016.
22	 The other two Parties, the United States (US) and the EU, did not state the use of carbon pricing in their INDCs, despite carbon pricing initiatives already being
    implemented in those jurisdictions at a regional, national and/or subnational level. The number of Parties planning or considering the use of carbon pricing in their
    INDCs is therefore not comparable with the jurisdictions with carbon pricing initiatives implemented, scheduled or under consideration.
23	 The seven economies are the US (carbon pricing initiatives at a subnational level), China, Japan, Germany, UK, France and Italy. The world’s largest economies
    were determined using the World Bank’s GDP data for 2014.

    initiatives were implemented or scheduled for implementation in 2006, increasing to 42 in 2016.
26	 Chinese President Xi Jinping made this announcement on September 25, 2015 as part of the “US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change”.
27	 The emissions to be covered under the Chinese national ETS are estimated to be about half of China’s national GHG emissions, based on the sector scope, as stated in
    the “US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change”, and public emissions data from the International Energy Agency. This estimate has not been validated
    by Chinese authorities. Informed researchers have judged that the GHG emissions coverage could potentially be about 40 percent of China’s total GHG emissions.

28	 Authors’ calculations, based on publically available information, including auction revenue reports of the different ETSs and the annual budget of governments
    with carbon taxes in place.
29	 The total value of the ETS markets was estimated by multiplying each ETS’s annual allowance volume for 2016, or the most recent yearly volume data, with the
    price of the emission unit on April 1, 2016. The total value for carbon taxes was derived from official government budgets for 2016. Where the allowance volume
    (for an ETS) or budget information (for a carbon tax) was unavailable, the value of the carbon pricing initiative was calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions
    covered with the nominal carbon price on April 1, 2016. No information was available on the amount of emission reduction credits which could be generated by
    facilities under the Australian safeguard mechanism; therefore, this was not included in the value calculation. The values presented in the Carbon Pricing Watch
    2016 were not updated to August 1, 2016, because no other new carbon pricing initiatives were implemented nor have any changes occurred in the existing
    ­
    initiatives since the release of that brief in May 2016. Moreover, daily changes in prices and exchange rates over a 5-month period cannot be used as an indicator

          While carbon pricing has expanded significantly in                 carbon prices at relatively low levels. However,
       recent years, in many instances these initiatives are still at        implementation of a carbon pricing policy framework and
       an early stage in achieving impact. In order to mobilize              institutional structure is nonetheless a first step that can lay
       political support, some policymakers have introduced                  the groundwork for future increases in ambition and impact.

          The circles represent subnational jurisdictions: subnational regions are shown in large circles and cities are shown in small circles. The circles are not representative of the size of the carbon pricing initiative.
          Note: RGGI = Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Carbon pricing initiatives care considered “scheduled for implementation” once they have been formally adopted through legislation and have
          an official, planned start date. Carbon pricing initiatives are considered “under consideration” if the government has announced its intention to work towards the implementation of a carbon pricing
          initiative and this has been formally confirmed by official government sources. Jurisdictions that only mention carbon pricing in their INDCs are not included as different interpretations of the INDC
          text are possible. The carbon pricing initiatives have been classified in ETSs and carbon taxes according to how they operate technically. ETS does not only refer to cap-and-trade systems, but also
          baseline-and-credit systems such as in British Columbia and baseline-and-offset systems such as in Australia. Carbon pricing has evolved over the years and initiatives do not necessarily follow the
          two categories in a strict sense. The authors recognize that other classifications are possible.
          Initiatives implemented or scheduled for implementation: National ETSs: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan,
          Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain. National carbon taxes: Chile, Japan, Mexico, and South Africa. Both
          national ETSs and carbon taxes: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Subnational ETSs:
          Beijing, California, Chongqing, Connecticut, Delaware, Guangdong, Hubei, Kyoto, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ontario, Québec, Rhode Island, Saitama, Shanghai,
          Shenzhen, Tianjin, Tokyo, and Vermont. Both subnational ETSs and carbon taxes: Alberta and British Columbia. Initiatives under consideration: National ETS or carbon tax: Brazil, Canada, Chile
          (ETS), China, Colombia, Japan (ETS), Mexico (ETS), the Republic of Korea (carbon tax), Thailand, Turkey, and Ukraine. Subnational ETS or carbon tax: Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Oregon,
          Rio de Janeiro, São Paolo, Taiwan, and Washington State.

                                       house Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (GGIRCA) does not cover any emissions yet; their coverages are therefore shown as zero. The information on the Chinese
                                       national ETS represents early unofficial estimates based on the Chinese President’s announcement in September 2015.

51	 As of September 1, 2016. The 189 countries submitted 162 INDCs, with the European Union submitting an INDC on behalf of its 28 member states.
52	 Based on the authors’ assessments of INDCs. INDCs that only mention a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and sustainable forest
    management, conservation of forests, and enhancement of carbon sinks (REDD+) mechanism are not included. We recognize that other interpretations on the
    mentioning of carbon pricing in the INDCs are possible, leading to a different count.
53	 This analysis is based on the number of INDCs that make a reference to forms of national or international carbon pricing in their INDCs. However, the authors
    recognize that there are different interpretations possible for the text in INDCs and the mention of carbon pricing in a domestic context may not necessarily mean
    that a domestic carbon pricing initiative is formally under consideration. Also, not all Parties that already have a carbon pricing initiative implemented, scheduled
    or under consideration have reported this in their INDC. The number of Parties planning or considering the use of carbon pricing in their INDC is therefore not
    comparable with the jurisdictions with carbon pricing initiatives implemented, scheduled or under consideration.

              Cost information in INDCs varies widely. Some countries include total cost estimates only, while others
              break these figures out into mitigation or adaptation costs. Some go further to break costs out by individual
              sectors, targets, policies or actions. The basis for INDC cost estimates is not uniform, and may represent
              implementation cost estimates, economic cost estimates, incremental costs (i.e. costs of additional
              investments in direct response to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation that are additional to
              investments which would have been made anyway), or the full costs (i.e. the total costs of investments that
              address low emission, climate resilient and other development goals).

103	 Under this global market-based measure, countries (and/or airlines) will have to purchase carbon offsets to compensate for any increase in carbon emissions
     from international flights starting in 2021. The type of offsets that will be eligible will be defined at a later stage. Aviation currently represents approximately
     2 percent of worldwide emissions—as much as the 7th largest emitting country in the world—a number anticipated to rise exponentially by 2050, and today the
     sector is not regulated under international climate agreements.

              Note: The size of the circles reflects the volume of GHG emissions in each jurisdiction. Symbols show the sectors and/or fuels covered under the r  ­ espective carbon pricing initiatives. The
              largest circle (EU) is equivalent to 4.7 GtCO2e and the smallest circle (Switzerland) to 0.05 GtCO2e. The carbon pricing initiatives have been classified in ETSs and carbon taxes according
              to how they operate technically. ETS does not only refer to cap-and-trade systems, but also baseline-and-credit systems such as British Columbia and baseline-and-offset systems such as
              in Australia. Carbon pricing has evolved over the years and they do not necessarily follow the two categories in a strict sense. The authors recognize that other classifications are possible.
          * Also includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Carbon tax emissions are the emissions covered under various national carbon taxes; the scope varies per tax.
         ** ETS emissions are the emissions covered under the Tokyo CaT and Saitama ETS. No coverage information was available for the Kyoto ETS.

Scope expansion:
2015/2016: California and Québec included transport fuels; Shanghai included the shipping sector; Beijing
included the transport sector and installations from two cities outside Beijing; Guangdong included domestic
aviation; Beijing and Hubei lowered the thresholds for inclusion in their ETS

Price rate changes (carbon tax only):
2015/2016: Finland increased the carbon tax rate on heating fuel by €10/tCO2e (US$11/tCO2e) to
€54/tCO2e
(US$60/tCO2e) from 2016; France’s carbon tax rate increased from €14.5/tCO2e (US$16/tCO2e) in
2015 to €22/tCO2e (US$24/tCO2e) in 2016; Switzerland’s carbon tax increased from (US$62/tCO2e) to
(US$86/tCO2e) in 2016; Slovenia removed the exemption liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas, with a
carbon tax rate of €17/tCO2e (US$19/tCO2e) now applying to all fossil fuels
Future developments: France’s carbon tax rate will increase by €8.5/tCO2e (US$9/tCO2e) per year up
to 2020 to reach €100/tCO2 (US$111/tCO2) in 2030; Switzerland is proposing a further increase of the
carbon tax rate for the period after 2020 that can go up to CHF240/tCO2e (US$246/tCO2e)

Price/market stabilization mechanisms (ETS only):
2015/2016: The Republic of Korea implemented several measures to address the perceived shortage on its
ETS market; New Zealand is phasing out the measure that allows surrendering one allowances for every two
ton of CO2
Future developments: California and RGGI are considering changes to their price stabilization mechanisms

Offsets:
2015/2016: the amount of CCERs issued in China keep growing; New Zealand stopped the international
trade of Kyoto credits at the end of the CP1 true-up period
Future developments: South Africa is developing its regulations on carbon offsets for compliance under the
scheduled carbon tax; China is working on the rules for CCERs use in the national ETS

Linking and/or cooperation:
2015/2016: First trade between the linked Tokyo and Saitama ETSs; the EU is cooperating with China
and the Republic of Korea on technical ETS issues; China and the Republic of Korea are exchanging ETS
knowledge
Future developments: the EU and Switzerland reached an agreement to link their ETSs with implementation
to follow; Ukraine is aiming to join the EU ETS in 2019; Manitoba, Ontario and Québec signed an MoU to
link their ETSs in the future; RGGI is considering broadening its market to other US states

Initiatives under review:
2015/2016: EU ETS review for post-2020 is ongoing; Kazakhstan temporarily suspended its ETS for two
years from 2016 to revise the rules; the New Zealand ETS review is ongoing; California and RGGI are
reviewing their ETS for post-2020 and to align with the CPP
Future developments: Australia intends to review the ERF and safeguard mechanism in 2017; Switzerland
plans to review its carbon tax legislation in the near future

Box 4 Use of internal carbon pricing by governments in decision making



             Governments can incentivize the transition to a low-carbon economy not only by setting up a mandatory carbon
             pricing initiative, but also by incorporating an internal carbon price in their decision making process. Some
             governments already use this as a tool for in their procurement process, project appraisals and policy design.

             Governments generally use three different approaches to set the internal carbon price:231
             1.	 Estimates of the social cost of carbon: the social cost of carbon reflects the value of global damages
                 caused by a ton of GHG emissions. This approach is subject to a high level of uncertainty as it relies on
                 forecasts of the state of the economy, demographic changes and the cost of adaptation measures.
             2.	 Estimates of the marginal abatement cost: the internal carbon price can be derived from the
                 marginal abatement cost of meeting a national emission reduction target. Estimates of this cost are based
                 on expectations of the cost of emission reduction technologies.
             3.	 The current and estimated future market values of emissions allowances: internal carbon prices
                 can also be based on the market prices of emissions allowances.
             In all three cases, costs increase over time as the stock of GHGs is increasing. In the first case, costs
             increase as future emissions are expected to cause greater damages for each ton of GHG emitted. In the
             latter two cases, costs are higher as marginal abatement becomes more expensive over time. Examples of
             how the Dutch and UK government use internal carbon pricing in their decision making are provided below.

             Target-consistent internal carbon pricing by the UK government
             Since 2009, the UK government has been using a “target-consistent approach” for internal carbon pricing.
             The carbon price is based on the estimated cost to meet the UK emission reduction targets.232 In principle,
             this approach has to be applied to all government policy, program and project appraisals that have a potential
             impact on GHG emissions. The price for EU ETS sectors, £6/tCO2e (US$8/tCO2e) in 2015, is directly
             derived from the market value of emission allowances. The price for the non-ETS sectors, £62/tCO2e
             (US$83/tCO2e) in 2015, is based on the marginal abatement costs needed to meet the UK’s emission
             reduction target. These internal carbon prices for ETS and non-ETS sectors converge after 2030, assuming
             a functional global carbon market by 2030 and the price increases to £224/tCO2e233 (US$295/tCO2e) in
             2050. The carbon prices are (among other uses) applied to the carbon footprint of a project and combined
             with other monetized costs and benefits to determine the project’s overall cost-effectiveness.

             Internal carbon pricing in infrastructure procurement by the Dutch government
             The Dutch House of Commons asked for inclusion of sustainability criteria in all public procurement
             processes by 2015. To incentivize companies to monitor and reduce their GHG emissions impact, the GHG
             emission performance of the materials and energy used during the construction works are assessed as part
             of the tender process.234 CO2 emissions and material consumption were monetized as part of a framework to
             determine the environmental performance of infrastructure works, using an internal carbon price of €50/tCO2e
             (US$56/tCO2e).235 This price represents the shadow price for abatement costs and damage costs based on
             the EU target to reduce emissions by 30% of the 1990 baseline level by 2020.

239	 For example, there will also often be complementary policies that support emission reductions in sectors not covered by a carbon price, such as land-clearing
     regulations, separating waste/composting, encouraging low-emissions agriculture. A further area not covered explicitly is the complementarity between carbon
     pricing and R&D/innovation policy. This is discussed extensively in Source: P. Aghion et al., “Path-Dependency, Innovation and the Economics of Climate Change,”

Box 5 Air quality benefits of fuel switching



              Fuel switching encouraged by carbon pricing not only reduces GHG emissions, but often other emissions
              that impact air quality and human health, such as dust or nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Indeed, pollution from
              energy use, including power generation, may account for as much as 5 percent of the global burden of
              disease.242

              While the most cost effective way to improve air quality is to tax or regulate local air pollutants directly,
              carbon pricing can complement these policies by inducing fuel switching and more energy efficiency in
              supply, distribution networks and final use. Many of the sources of low-cost carbon abatement unlocked by
              carbon pricing will also tend to be low-cost ways of reducing local air pollution.

              However, there are limits to the synergy between carbon pricing and local air pollution reductions. Benefits
              from local air pollution reduction alone will not justify emission reductions needed for global average
              temperature increases of well below 2°C. Moreover, some end-of pipe technologies approaches to dealing
              with air pollution—for example, sulfur dioxide scrubbers, nitrogen oxides removal systems, or electrostatic
              precipitators to remove dust particles from flue gasses—may be cost-effective in local circumstances, but
              can reduce power plant efficiency, increasing internal fuel consumption, and hence CO2 intensity.

             The solution adopted was to make covered firms responsible for both their direct and indirect emissions.
             Industrial entities have to surrender allowances equal to the sum of their direct emissions plus their electricity
             consumption multiplied by the emissions intensity of electricity production.

         There are a range of policies to target these barriers,                          technologies for two key reasons. First, renewables

            The 2015 Energy Transition Law for Green Growth sets out France’s energy strategy for the coming
            decades. Article 173 of the Act aims to better integrate climate change considerations into corporate
            decision-making by changing rules on financial reporting. There are two main provisions:270

            1.	 Article 173-IV strengthened the reporting obligations of company-level GHG emissions. Companies are
                required to report emissions directly related to their activities as well as the emissions associated with the
                inputs necessary to their activities and the usage of goods and services produced.

            2.	 Article 173-VI requires investors to publish information regarding their contribution to climate targets and
                their financial risk exposure to the energy and environmental transition. This law also provides new extra-
                financial reporting obligations for institutional investors, requiring disclosure of the means implemented to
                contribute to the energy and environmental transition.

            By aiming to reduce the information barriers faced by investors about climate-related risks, the Article intends
            to ease the provision of private finance for low-carbon options when it becomes clear to investors that such
            projects can reduce these risks.

             Climate Change, the CCA has published reviews on the country’s renewable energy and emissions targets.

             When Australia’s Carbon Pricing Mechanism was in operation, the CCA was responsible for reviewing
             overlapping policies, such as the Renewable Energy Target. Most recently, it has provided recommendations
             on Australia’s future climate policy suite, assessing potential policies against the policy principles in its
             legislation, including cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness, and the distributional impacts of climate
             policies.

             Mexico substantially reduced fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 in conjunction with a two-pillar reform:315
             1.	 Energy reform, which allows and encourages private sector participation in the fossil fuel sector,
                 particularly in relation to the import, transport and extraction of fossil fuels.
             2.	 Fiscal reform, which established a carbon tax (approximately US$3/tCO2 for most fossil fuels except
                 natural gas, and US$1/tCO2 for cokes and coal) and eliminated gasoline and diesel subsidies.

             The fiscal reform may provide a significant source of government revenue. Fossil fuel consumption subsidies
             are expected to fall from MXN244 billion (US$13 billion) in 2012 to MXN34 billion (US$2 billion) in 2014.316
             In addition, the carbon tax raised almost US$1 billion in 2014 and is expected to continue to raise similar
             amounts in the future.317




            Carbon prices do not have to wait until fossil fuel                          requirements aimed at encouraging local industry that
        subsidies are phased out. Indeed, carbon pricing can be                          nevertheless may distort trade and increase the local cost
        one element of a broader energy reform process that helps                        of low-carbon abatement options and hence reduce the
        to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and place the energy sector                      effectiveness of the carbon price signal.320
        on a financially sustainable footing. Carbon pricing
        might be particularly attractive in this process as it can                          There are a wider range of policies that might either
        foster constituencies with a political interest in continued                     be complementary, overlapping or countervailing to the
        energy sector reform and generate government revenues                            carbon price, depending on their design. The discussion
        that can help fund transfer payments that dampen any                             earlier in this section illustrated how transport policy

        carbon pricing can be integrated into broader energy                             carbon price signal, depending on its calibration. In
        sector reform, as discussed in Box 9.                                            some cases, previous infrastructure investments can
                                                                                         be modified to become complementary instead of
            Countervailing subsidies also exist in other sectors,                        countervailing. For example, part of Bogotá’s original
        notably agricultural subsidies that encourage energy-                            car-focused infrastructure was converted into a bus
        intensive flood irrigation, production of fertilizers                            rapid transit system, the TransMilenio, serving over
        and the overuse of nitrogen-based fertilizers, as well as                        2 million passengers per day, reducing congestion
        subsidies that encourage emissions-intensive livestock                           and operating at a profit.321 This gives commuters an
        farming, especially cattle.318 Reducing such subsidies can                       opportunity to maintain mobility at low cost should
        follow a process similar to that of fossil fuels.319 Other                       transport fuel prices increase to reflect the cost of
        subsidies might be more implicit, such as local content                          pollution.

          There are also some countervailing policies with                               Policymakers can also combine a qualitative
      legitimate policy objectives, where important trade-                           understanding of existing policies with quantitative
      offs may need to be made. One example relates to the                           analysis. General equilibrium models are often used to
      rules for banks (Basel III) and insurers (Solvency II)                         provide a comprehensive macroeconomic assessment
      surrounding investments in low-carbon assets such                              of how carbon reduction policies might influence an

      greater financial stability, but may hold back financing                       the direct impacts and the final incidence of the policy,
      of low-carbon investments that would otherwise be                              including the cost, output and employment impacts
      supported by a carbon price. Nonetheless, marginal or                          after the direct impacts have propagated through the
      incremental changes could be made that preserve the                            economy. Therefore, they are useful to determine the
      intent of the original policy while improving alignment                        targets or the level of ambition of climate policy that is
      with carbon pricing. For example, the IFC’s Sustainable                        best for society as a whole. However, the challenge with
      Banking Network is developing regulatory guidance                              these models is that comprehensive economic coverage
      on environmentally and socially sustainable banking                            is achieved only by sacrificing details on how policies
      practices to address some of these challenges.322 Carbon                       might be designed and expected to influence firms
      pricing initiatives, on the other hand, could better respect                   and individuals. In particular, they tend to collapse all
      the rules of fiscal and financial prudency if their design                     carbon mitigation policies into a single “shadow” carbon
      refrained from strict earmarking of revenues to enhance                        price. This makes assessment of multiple climate policies

      of the discipline of a consolidated budget.                                    policies may also be relatively coarse.

    329	 The estimates on cost savings achieved through an international carbon market are based on the modeling assumption that domestic mitigation is already
         optimized, i.e. done in a least cost way. In reality, this is not the case and providing an international carbon price signal will most likely improve the cost efficiency
         ­
         of domestic mitigation and therefore add further—indirectly—to the overall cost savings achieved.

         ­
         accounting without the flow of units. This is where, e.g., just inventories would be jointly adjusted. Historically, inventory adjustment has not been done by itself.

     reduces, both because providers of that service will produce less, and consumers demand less.

            the same amount of emission reductions without trade.                                  US$15 billion. The mitigation cost savings realized

Box 10 Burden sharing assumptions



              Three burden sharing assumptions are commonly found in the literature. They are:
              –– Equal cost share of GDP: this method equalizes the mitigation cost as a share of GDP across all
                 regions. This means that, proportionally, countries with a higher GDP face a higher absolute emission
                 reduction cost.
              –– Equal per capita CO2 emissions: this is a commonly used approach in energy modeling and assigns
                 each region a carbon budget based on its population. Often convergence scenarios to an equal per
                 capita outcome are assumed.
              –– Equal marginal cost of abatement: all regions face the same carbon price. This means that the
                 mitigation cost may be higher or lower as a share of GDP across countries, depending on the
                 availability and cost of abatement options.                                                           

               The burden sharing assumptions influence the benefits of international trading, with gains from trade being
               greater the larger the difference in the marginal cost of abatement between regions. Typically, gains from
               trade are found to be greatest using an equal per capita burden sharing rule, as this rule does not take
               into account differences in mitigation cost between different regions. By definition, there are no gains from
               international trading under the equal marginal cost of abatement burden sharing approach.

         All options for an international carbon market involve                          while ensuring a desired level of domestic abatement.
      some jurisdictions making fewer domestic emission                                  Setting a minimum level of domestic abatement is

      where abatement is cheaper, it can also lead to the loss of                        However, while this approach of restricted cooperation can

          There are numerous domestic co-benefits of mitigation
      that are unrelated to climate change, including health                                                          4.2.5

      such as China, these co-benefits are a major driver of

          As noted above, substantial gains from using an                                under the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only example of
      international carbon market can be realized when there                             an IET, was premised on an agreement on comparable,

      effort can be transferred from locations where marginal                            that were perceived to lack ambition in their efforts.
      costs are high to locations where they are low, with                               Similarly, the California Air Resources Board, has cited
      financial transfers flowing in the opposite direction,                             EU carbon market prices as one factor inhibiting linkage
      creating gains from trade.                                                         with the California ETS.367

         However, (marginal) abatement costs can differ for two                             Comparability of effort can also create technical
      reasons. Firstly, the underlying technical characteristics of                      challenges, especially when considering linking between
      abatement opportunities may be more expensive in one                               ETSs that have different types of target. In particular, it

      ambition will influence the (marginal) cost of abatement.                          with emissions intensity targets to those with absolute
      A jurisdiction with low ambition will only need to use                             targets. This can be due to concerns about liquidity
      low-cost abatement opportunities domestically and                                  shocks, competitiveness and environmental integrity.368
      hence will have a low marginal abatement cost/domestic
      carbon price, and plentiful opportunities to sell into an                                                      4.2.6

          Broadly speaking, differences in marginal abatement                               A significant political concern in cooperation through
      costs arising from differences in the underlying technical                         market linking is the potential for loss of control over
      characteristics of abatement opportunities are unlikely to                         domestic market design and regulation. In particular,
      represent a significant barrier to using an international                          policymakers often express concern about the reduced
      carbon market.365 In contrast, the dynamics that arise from                        ability to affect the domestic carbon price given the
      differences in ambition may be more problematic. On the                            wider economic implications that fluctuations in the
      one hand, gains from trade will still be significant. On the                       price may have on, for example, energy poverty or
      other hand, higher-ambition jurisdictions may be wary of                           industrial competitiveness. This barrier is less important
      being seen to endorse or benefit from the lower ambition                           for coordination through IET and the use of offsets. In

      seen as a reward or an incentive for keeping ambition low.                         case of offsets, countries can set and modify rules over
                                                                                         the quantity of offsets that can be used and the sources of

Box 11 Heterogeneous linkage



              The growing heterogeneity in scheme design, size and maturity of mitigation efforts has made full linking,
              which requires a degree of regulatory harmonization, increasingly complex, costly and time-consuming.
              Given these issues, heterogeneous linkage is being explored as an alternative concept. The objective of a
              heterogeneous linkage is not to harmonize climate actions so that they could be traded on a 1:1 basis, but
              rather to develop trading rules for international cooperation, such as quotas or discount rates, that may be
              informed by a shared understanding of the relative mitigation impacts or “mitigation value” of different actions.
              By doing so, heterogeneous linkages could enable more jurisdictions to participate in a liquid, inclusive and
              scalable international carbon market, while still preserving the environmental integrity of trading.




             While these approaches allow for international                                  Sectoral approaches can generate a number of
         comparisons, they do not address political reluctance                           potential benefits including increased participation,
         to link in cases where this reveals significant differences                     alleviation of competitiveness concerns and greater
         in effort. One option to address this would translate                           targeting of key areas.388 They allow for countries without
         differences in mitigation ambition into a specific ratio or                     economy-wide climate policies to focus on sectors where

         provide a politically acceptable cooperative measure                            more countries, including those without economy-wide

            possible transition to an international carbon market.                             ambition and targets including risks of free-riding
            One such possible transition is outlined in Figure 16.                             may still pose a barrier to international cooperation.
            It reflects that international climate policy can build                            Accordingly, systems for comparing mitigation outcomes

               This follows the current international trajectory,
            with emerging international structures coupled with                                    The Article 6.4 mechanism and existing sectoral
            increasing cooperative practice between selected                                   agreements could both inform the emergent market design
            markets. This could be reinforced through sectoral                                 and complement voluntary cooperatives approaches
            approaches and scaled up RBCF, providing a practical                               under Articles 6.2 and 6.3 and eventually be integrated

            lead to emission reductions, helping to overcome                                   is overcome, the world can begin the final movements to
            barriers around market uncertainty. This leads to                                  an integrated carbon market. This could include a more
            emerging points of public and private consensus on                                 bottom-up process of linking domestic ETS or a more

      Agent-based models are increasingly recognized                                standard bottom-up technoeconomic models, that
      as emerging tools to help design policies in a way                            advise policy-makers on what is best for society,
      that increases their effectiveness. Representing                              to financial models, that advise policy-makers
      the perspective of economic agents in the formal                              on how investors and consumers see the policy
      model is important, because they are the ones                                 instruments. They are based on relatively simple
      who build wind farms instead of coal plants or ride                           cost-minimizing decision rules, but simulate decision
      trains instead of private cars. The government role                           making consistently from the point of view of
      is to create the policy and incentive framework that                          economic agents rather than from the point of view
      influences the choices of firms, people, organizations                        of welfare-maximizing central planners. POL-MAC
      and communities and align them with the government                            approaches put explicit financial values on decision

      complementary, overlapping and countervailing                                 agents face in reality. Other drivers of behavior,
      policies will “nudge” billions of individual firms and                        such as improvement of convenience or social
      households to choose either low carbon options, or                            status are often also quantified. This is why they

           Note: * 	Global total financial flows have been rounded. Full international trading results in an average global CO2 cost of US$74/tCO2 in 2030. Although there
                    are no comparable scenarios to this in the current literature, the Ampere project (included as part of the IPCC’s WGIII fifth assessment report)410 has
                    scenarios for 8 integrated assessment models in which a similar level of 2030 CO2 emissions to that presented here is achieved, as part of a 2°C
                    ­
                    consistent p­ athway. The models have an international 2030 carbon price between US$25-87/tCO2. The models do not explicitly specify inter-regional
                    trade, but allow for mitigation to occur wherever least costly, so in effect recreate the same mitigation pattern (and carbon price) as in a traded scenario.

           	           Full international trading results in an average global CO2 cost of US$428/tCO2 in 2050. Although there are no comparable scenarios to this in the
                       current literature, the Ampere project (included as part of the IPCC’s WGIII fifth assessment report)411 has scenarios for 8 integrated assessment models
                       in which a 2°C consistent pathway is achieved following relatively limited mitigation action to 2030, resulting in a similar level of global 2030 CO2
                       emissions as in this analysis. By 2050 the models have an international carbon price between US$58-5,800/tCO2—a very broad range—with the higher
                       ­
                       prices indicative of a shortage of mitigation options to achieve the 2°C target. The models do not explicitly specify inter-regional trade, but allow for
                       mitigation to occur wherever least costly, so in effect recreate the same mitigation pattern and carbon price as in a traded scenario.

      would be possible in 2030 (over and above the                                        emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial

Additionality       A project activity is additional if anthropogenic GHG emissions are lower than
                    those that would have occurred in the absence of the project activity.

Annex B (Parties)   Countries listed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment period
                    that had emission reduction targets for 2012. They include Australia, Austria,
                    Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
                    Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia,

                    United States, as well as the European Union.

Annex I (Parties)   The industrialized countries listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC committed to return
                    their GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. They currently include Australia,
                    Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,
                    Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,

Assigned Amount     Annex I Parties were issued AAUs up to the level of their assigned amount,
Unit (AAU)          corresponding to the quantity of GHG they could release in accordance with the
                    Kyoto Protocol (Article 3), during the first commitment period of that protocol
                    (2008–2012). One AAU represents the right to emit one metric ton of carbon
                    dioxide equivalent.

Banking or Carry-over   The carry-over of compliance units under the various schemes to manage GHG
                        emissions from one commitment or compliance period to the next. Banking may
                        encourage early action by mandated entities depending on their current situation
                        and their anticipations of future carbon constraints. In addition, banking brings
                        market continuity.

Baseline                The emission of GHG that would occur without the policy intervention or project
                        activity under consideration.

Baseline-and-credit     A mechanism where emission reductions achieved relative to a baseline can be
                        credited and used for compliance purpose.

Baseline-and-offset     A system where targets or baseline emission levels are defined for individual
                        emitters or groups of emitters and in which emitters that exceed their baseline
                        emissions could purchase offsets to meet their compliance obligations.

Benchmarking            Benchmarking is used to compare operations of a company with those of
                        others, to industry average, or to best practice, to determine whether they have
                        opportunities to improve energy efficiency or reduce GHG emissions. In the
                        EU ETS, for example, free allocation is carried out on the basis of ambitious
                        benchmarks of GHG emissions performance. These benchmarks reward best
                        practice in low-emission production.

Cap-and-trade           Cap-and-trade schemes set a desired maximum ceiling for emissions (or cap)
                        and let the market determine the price for keeping emissions within that cap. To
                        comply with their emission targets at least cost, regulated entities can either opt
                        for internal abatement measures or acquire allowances or emission reductions in
                        the carbon market, depending on the relative costs of these options.

Carbon Dioxide          The universal unit of measurement used to indicate the global warming potential
Equivalent (CO2e)
­                       of each of the six GHG regulated under the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon dioxide—a
                        naturally occurring gas that is a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass,
                        land-use changes, and other industrial processes—is the reference gas against
                        which the other GHG are measured, using their global warming potential.

Carbon Leakage          Shift in CO2 emissions due to GHG mitigation policies from countries taking
                        stringent actions to countries taking less stringent mitigation actions.

Carbon Offset and       The global offsetting scheme for the aviation sector which is set to start in
Reduction Scheme        2021 with a voluntary period, becoming mandatory in 2027 as per negotiations
for International       as of September 2016.

Carbon Pricing          An initiative that explicitly puts a price on a unit of CO2e, including ETSs—both
Initiative              cap-and-trade and baseline-and-credit systems, carbon taxes, offset mechanisms
                        and RBCF.

Carbon Pricing           The revenue governments raise from carbon pricing initiatives, through the
Revenue                  auctioning of allowances and taxation. The carbon pricing revenues are
                         determined from auction revenue reports of the different ETSs and the annual
                         budget of governments with carbon taxes in place.

Carbon Pricing Value     The value of emission units in an ETS and emissions that are subject to a carbon
                         tax. The total carbon pricing value of ETS markets is estimated by multiplying
                         each ETS’s annual allowance volume for 2016, or the most recent yearly volume
                         data, with the allowance price. The total value for carbon taxes is derived from
                         official government budgets. Where the emission unit volume (for an ETS) or
                         budget information (for a carbon tax) was unavailable, the value of the carbon
                         pricing initiative was calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions covered with
                         the nominal carbon price.

Carbon Tax               A tax that explicitly states a price on carbon or that uses a metric directly based
                         on carbon (that is, price per tCO2e).

Certified Emission       A unit of GHG emission reductions issued pursuant to the Clean Development
Reduction (CER)          Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol and measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide
                         equivalent. One CER represents a reduction in GHG emissions of one metric ton
                         of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Chinese Certified        Voluntary emission reduction credits from projects based in China. The NDRC
Emission Reduction       issued rules to regulate the CCER market in China in June 2012. CCER are
(CCER)                   issued in unit of tCO2e, and include CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6.

Clean Development        The mechanism provided by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, designed to assist
Mechanism (CDM)          developing countries in achieving sustainable development by allowing entities
                         from Annex I Parties to participate in low-carbon projects and obtain CERs in return.

Kyoto Mechanisms        The three flexibility mechanisms that may be used by Annex I Parties to the
                        Kyoto Protocol to fulfil their commitments. These are the Joint Implementation (JI,
                        Article 6), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM, Article 12), and International
                        Emissions Trading (Article 17).

Kyoto Protocol          Adopted at the third Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC held in Kyoto, Japan,
                        in December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol commits industrialized country signatories
                        to collectively reduce their GHG emissions by at least 5.2% below 1990 levels on
                        average over 2008–2012 while developing countries can take no-regret actions
                        and participate voluntarily in emission reductions and removal activities through the

                        and when it enters into force. They will be governed by Article 4 of the Agreement.
                        Each Party to the UNFCCC that wishes to become a Party to the Agreement will
                        have an obligation to communicate an NDC. The level of prescription attached
                        to these will be determined by the negotiations on the operative elements of
                        Article 4, which mainly take place under the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris
                        Agreement (APA).

Offset                  An offset designates the emission reductions from project-based activities that
                        can be used to meet compliance or corporate citizenship objectives vis-à-vis
                        GHG mitigation.

Paris Agreement         The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the
                        UNFCCC held in Paris, France, in December 2015. The Paris Agreement brings,
                        for the first time, all nations together to undertake ambitious efforts to combat
                        climate change and adapt to its effects. Its central aim is to “strengthen the global
                        response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this
                        century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue
                        efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
                        Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal
                        with the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to
                        put forward their best efforts through NDCs and to strengthen these efforts in
                        the years ahead. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on
                        their emissions and on their implementation efforts.”

Producer surplus        An economic measure of the difference between the price a producer of goods
                        and services receives and the minimum amount they would be willing to accept
                        for that good or service (i.e. the cost of producing goods and services).

Real-time market        A market that lets participants buy and sell wholesale electricity during the course
(electricity)           of the operating day.

REDD Plus (REDD+)       All activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and
                        contribute to conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement
                        of forest carbon stocks.

Registration            The formal acceptance by the CDM Executive Board of a validated project as a
                        CDM project activity.

Results-Based           Funding approach where payments are made after pre-defined outputs or
Climate Finance         outcomes related to managing climate change, such as emission reductions, are
(RBCF)                  delivered and verified.

Second Commitment       The eight-year period, from 2013 to 2020, in which Annex I Parties to the Kyoto
Period under the        Protocol committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18% percent below
Kyoto Protocol (CP2)    1990 levels. The composition of Parties in the second commitment period is
                        different from that in the first.

Secondary Market        A market where the seller of the asset is not the original owner (or issuer).

True-up period          The true-up period refers to the additional period given for fulfilling commitments
                        under the Kyoto Protocol. During this period, Parties can continue to acquire and
                        transfer ERUs, CERs, AAUs and RMUs from the preceding commitment period.
                        The true-up period for CP1 finished on November 18, 2015.

United Nations          The international legal framework adopted in June 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit
Framework               to address climate change. It commits the Parties to the UNFCCC to stabilize
Convention on Climate   human-induced GHG emissions at levels that would prevent dangerous manmade
Change (UNFCCC)         interference with the climate system, following “common but differentiated
                        responsibilities” based on “respective capabilities”.

Validation              The process of independent evaluation of a project activity by a Designated
                        Operational Entity (DOE) against the requirements of the CDM. The CDM
                        requirements include the CDM modalities and procedures, subsequent decisions
                        by the CMP and documents released by the CDM Executive Board.

Verification            Verification is the review and ex-post determination by an independent third party
                        of the monitored results, typically referring to reductions in emissions generated
                        by a registered CDM project or a determined JI project (or a project approved
                        under another standard) during the verification period in this report.

Verified Emission     A unit of GHG emission reductions that has been verified by an independent
Reduction (VER)       auditor. Most often, this designates emission reduction units that are traded on
                      the voluntary market.

Vertical separation   The process by which different activities within a value chain previously
(electricity)         undertaken by the same company are disaggregated so that different firms are
                      responsible for different activities. In the electricity sector, this typically refers
                      to the separation of generation and/or retail activities from transmission and/or
                      distribution.

Voluntary Carbon      The voluntary carbon market caters to the needs of those entities that voluntarily
Market                decide to reduce their carbon footprint using offsets.
