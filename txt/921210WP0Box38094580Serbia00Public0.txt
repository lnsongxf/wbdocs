THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      company's initial capital that needs to be paid-in until the company's
      registration with the SBRA.

      However, in case the Foundation Act prescribes that the relevant
      amount of the capital contribution is going to be paid until the
      company's registration, the temporary bank account should be opened
      with the commercial bank.

      Otherwise, once the company is registered with the SBRA, the capital
      contribution will be paid-in directly to the company's permanent bank
      account.                                                                              RSD 5,900 (RSD

      Request and obtain building permit

      Since December 31, 2008, by the Statute of City of Belgrade,
      municipalities only handle building permits for projects below 800 sq.
      m. This particular reform made the different districts of Belgrade more
      equal and defined the types of activities that are handled by the City
      versus the municipal offices. Every building above 800 sq. m. is now
      handled by the City of Belgrade Secretariat for Urbanism and
      Construction Affairs (Sekretarijat za urbanizam i građevinske poslove).

      A request for a building permit should be submitted to the Secretariat
      for Urbanism and Construction Affairs of Belgrade City Municipality in
      charge of the territory on which the building plot is situated, along with
      the following documentation:
7     • Extracts from the urban plan issued within 6 months before the filing      90 days       RSD 450
      of the request for a building permit
      • Preliminary design project plan that conforms to the urban plan
      mentioned above
      • Evidence of the ownership status or rental status of the building plot

      Although, the law stipulates the time limit of 15 days, the Construction
      Department of Municipality of Belgrade takes on average anywhere
      between 2 -- 6 months, and sometimes even more.

      After all construction work has been completed, a Municipal
      Commission examines whether the constructed building complies with
      the issued building permit, all applicable laws and regulations, and
      technical standards. The municipality issues the use permit within 7
      days after the commission responsible for the technical examination
      reports that the building is suitable for use.

      The Municipal Commission does not issue the usage permit if the
      building is not in compliance with technical standards and technical
14    documentation. Instead, it orders BuildCo to correct all irregularities      1 day        RSD 120
      and, after re-examining the building, it issues the usage permit. If the
      irregularities cannot be fixed and use of the building is deemed to be
      dangerous, the Commission orders the demolition of the building.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Serbia (table 10.1)?
