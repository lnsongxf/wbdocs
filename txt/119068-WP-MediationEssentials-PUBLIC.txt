FOREWORD

The Mediation Series is a celebration of the long-term work of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
member of the World Bank Group, in helping client countries adopt and integrate mediation to increase the
effectiveness of their conflict resolution systems. Since 2004, IFC has extended technical assistance to both
governments and the private sector to ensure that mediation is established effectively. IFC’s projects cover
the Balkans, East and South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa and have led
to a considerable increase in the use of commercial mediation.

The success and the expansion of our mediation projects globally and the scarcity of material in Arabic
have inspired the Mediation Series. The series offers a unique and comprehensive set of Alternative Dispute
Resolution (ADR) learning resources for users, policy makers, lawyers, judges, and ADR professionals.
The resources aim to support the growth and sustainability of mediation and ADR in the region and beyond.

The Mediation Series consists of a three-book-package (Mediation Essentials, Making Mediation Law,
and Integrated Conflict Management Design Workbook) that explores mediation-related topics in-depth.  
The Mediation Essentials deskbook serves as an orientation guide to ADR generally and to mediation
specifically for users, advisers, and mediators. Making Mediation Law offers a robust perspective on how to
design successful mediation policy and legislation. The Integrated Conflict Management Design Workbook
offers a hands-on focus for designing efficient and effective dispute management systems with companies
and organizations. The publications appear in both English and Arabic, except for the Integrated Conflict
Management Design Workbook, which is in Arabic only.


ABOUT MEDIATION ESSENTIALS
As the title suggests, Mediation Essentials is the definitive deskbook on mediation. It brings together in
one compact publication the essential knowledge and know-how on mediation. Mediation Essentials is the
must-have book for mediators, lawyers, and other advisers, disputants, and anyone involved in conflict. It
has been structured to appeal to a wide range of readers.

PREFACE

Mediation is one of the most frequently used alternative dispute resolution processes worldwide. Mediation
provides faster, cheaper, and better solutions than a traditional court decision can. Benefits are important
for individuals as well as for disputing businesses from the private sector and for public sector institutions.
Understanding the principles, process, and skills of mediation is essential for anyone whose professional
role involves managing disputes of any kind.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW
Mediation Essentials comprises five chapters and appears in both English and Arabic:

Chapter 1: How to Manage and Control Disputes: Alternative Dispute Resolution
Chapter 2: How to Make the Most of Mediation
Chapter 3: How Professional Advisors Can Add Value to Mediation
Chapter 4: How to Use Guiding Principles and Ethics to Ensure the Integrity of Mediation
Chapter 5: How to Draft Contractual Documents for Mediation

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
Mediation Essentials can be read from start to finish in a linear fashion; alternatively, it can be read out
of order. The chapters are sequenced so that each chapter builds on the previous one, but they are also
written as standalone publications. So if, for example, you already have some basic knowledge about
mediation but wish to understand better the role of professional advisers in mediation, you may go straight
to chapter 3. Alternatively, if your organization has already committed to engaging in mediation, you might
go immediately to chapter 2. If you are a lawyer and wish to draft a mediation clause for your client’s
business transaction, you might begin with chapter 5. As a result, there is inevitably some overlap among
the individual chapters of Mediation Essentials. These overlapping sections serve two functions:

■■ They enable the chapters to function on a standalone basis.
■■ They reinforce important themes from a variety of perspectives.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter will introduce you to different ways of managing conflict when you are
involved in general and specific disputes. It also offers a framework for understanding
dispute resolution. Disputes are part of life, and we all experience them sometimes. They
give us an opportunity to solve problems and to improve relationships, but they carry a risk
of being destructive if not managed well.

When we think of disputes, we often think of going to court to obtain a court decision.
Lawyers are often involved in this process, assisting each side of the dispute.
Courts have demonstrated—and continue to demonstrate—their value by
promoting the rule of law, administering people’s rights and obligations, and
maintaining the relevance of social norms through law reform.                            Disputes are part

disputants certain benefits that may not be available in a court. These benefits
include informality, low cost, privacy, and a greater say in the outcome of the
dispute. These processes are known as alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
because they offer an alternative to the court process of dealing with disputes.

ADR processes involve a broad spectrum of dispute resolution mechanisms with different
characteristics to suit every kind of dispute. These processes range from facilitative ADR,
which focuses on managing and guiding negotiations between you and the other side, to
advisory ADR, which involves greater input into the substance and merits of your dispute,

    Box 1.1: The importance of peeling away to the
    heart of the dispute

    A parent walked into the kitchen and found two siblings fighting over an orange. Both children
    insisted that they needed the whole orange, but there was just one left. Not having the time to deal
    with their arguing, the parent just decided to split the orange in two and gave one half to each child,
    which seemed to be a fair resolution of the argument.

    Later that day, the parent realized that both children were still unhappy and understood why. The
    younger child had wanted the entire orange’s peel for a cake and the older child wanted the entire
    orange’s pulp to make juice. With just half an orange, there could be no cake and there could be no
    juice. Everyone was disappointed.

    This story illustrates that it is sometimes not productive to focus only on what people want in a
    dispute, without understanding their underlying needs. And it is important to be patient, to avoid
    making too many assumptions based on first impressions, and to dig deeper to find out what outcome
    will really satisfy everyone and resolve the dispute. Good mediators do all of these things!

a. If a factor applies only to one disputant and not the other, it could still mean that your dispute is suitable for mediation. However,
   you should explore why it does not apply to everyone and if this would be a problem during mediation.

                                some information about the dispute and the people involved in it. The mediator
                                will explain the process and his or her approach and style as well as give an outline
                                of the day and respond to any concerns.
  2. Opening statement          The mediator will begin with an opening statement to introduce the process and
                                the roles of each person. The mediator will confirm your (and the other side’s)
                                commitment to attempting to mediate. The mediator will also confirm that
                                everyone is willing to engage in the process in “good faith” and to follow a few
                                guiding principles or rules.

  3. Facts and interests        You and the other side will then be invited by the mediator to share your concerns.
                                You will both be given an opportunity to hear and understand each other’s
                                perspective of the facts as well as interests, needs, values, priorities, and emotions.

  4. Options and negotiation    You and the other side (possibly with their advisers) will be invited to develop
                                options/solutions/ideas that could be acceptable to resolve the dispute so that
                                both sides are satisfied. The mediator will encourage creativity to overcome
                                difficult situations and may help you in finding solutions that work for both sides.

     5. Agreement and           If you and the other side reach an agreement in the mediation, the terms of the
        closing                 agreement will usually be put in writing and be signed by everyone present.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter will explain how you can make the most of mediation. Making the most of
mediation requires an open mind, good listening skills, and a problem-solving attitude
throughout the process. This chapter walks you through what you need to do before you go
to mediation, at mediation, and after mediation.

Preparation is key to a successful mediation. Knowing yourself and being able to identify
your own priorities and to see the dispute from the other’s perspective are an effective starting
point. Listening to the other and engaging in a problem-solving conversation
are vital to help you move toward a mutually satisfactory solution. After
mediation, follow-up procedures may be needed to secure implementation
of the agreement and to prevent potential future disputes.                              Preparation is key to
                                                                                   a successful mediation.

something to happen or don’t want something to happen. Mediation teaches
us to explore positions and to discover underlying needs. Our needs are the
reasons we want something. Identifying needs can help us discover a variety
of options for achieving what is really important to us. Naturally, a good way to
determine our needs is to ask, why do I want this? Table 2.1 contains some examples of
positions you might have in a conflict and possible needs underlying them.

     When filling out this questionnaire, please consider the other side’s point of view as well as your
             own perspective. Please answer the questions by Yes, No, or Feeling uncertain.
                                                                                           Yes          No         Feeling uncertain

  Improving trust between us may be the beginning of new
  opportunities.
  Improving communication and clarifying misunderstandings can
  help solve the problem and prevent new conflicts.
  A quick solution would be good for me and the other side.

  We have a common network, and conflict has a negative impact
  on both of us.
  We have frequent dealings with each other, and conflict has a
  negative impact on both of us.

  We are concerned about saving money on legal fees.
  We want “peace of mind” and to “move on.”
  We believe a judge’s decision will not solve our problem efficiently.
  We are concerned about the psychological and emotional stress of
  a court process.

  Yes answers might be useful to persuade the other side to participate in mediation.
  No or Uncertain answers might be useful questions to explore with the other side to better know their interests and priorities and convince

INTRODUCTION
Professional advisers wanting to act in the best interests of their clients need to know
how to make the most out of mediation. Generally, professional advisers such as lawyers
have skills that can be very useful for a client in mediation. However, in countries where
mediation has yet to be established, professional advisers may have limited experience
with mediation and may be reluctant to encourage clients to engage in mediation. They
may be worried that mediation advising is less lucrative than court advocacy or that going
to mediation may be a sign of weakness.
Actually, experience shows that mediation is effective and makes good sense
for clients. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that using mediation
instead of litigation to help clients resolve disputes is likely to result in less

     Box 3.1: Case illustrationa


     In her capacity as chief executive officer of a financial product development company, Ms. Fastcash
     is preparing to attend mediation concerning allegations of misrepresentation of one of the company’s
     financial products. She consults a lawyer, Mr. Law. Considering the different mediation advocacy
     roles outlined in figure 3.1, Mr. Law thinks about the different ways he could approach the mediation
     with his client. Mr. Law could choose from among these actions:
     ■■ Coaching Ms. Fastcash on how to represent herself in mediation and having no further involvement
        himself
     ■■ Attending the preliminary conference with his client, Ms. Fastcash, and then leaving Ms. Fastcash
        to participate in mediation meetings on her own
     ■■ Being physically absent from mediation but being accessible by phone or e-mail
     ■■ Being present at the mediation but having restricted participation (for example, observing for the
        first two hours and offering only legal advice to Ms. Fastcash; from the option generation stage
        onward, engaging directly with all participants in relation to legal points only)
     ■■ Being present during the mediation and participating fully and collaboratively with Ms. Fastcash
        throughout the process
     ■■ Being the “voice” of Ms. Fastcash for the entire mediation
     ■■ Joining the mediation only after his client, Ms. Fastcash, and the other side have reached
        agreement in principle, to give Ms. Fastcash legal advice on what she proposes to do and to draft
        the mediated settlement agreement

     Professional advisers are most helpful to their clients when they are able to discuss the various
     mediation advocacy roles together with their clients and the mediator and to identify the appropriate
     approach to suit the needs, circumstances, dynamics, and resources of the particular dispute.

  INTRODUCTION
  Mediation is used throughout the world by people who are involved in disputes to reach
  mutually satisfying solutions outside the traditional process found in courts. As explained
  elsewhere in this deskbook, the advantage of flexibility makes mediation suitable to solve
  various types of disputes, including in family, community, commercial, construction,
  insurance, banking, and workplace contexts.

  The integrity of the mediation process is guaranteed by several guiding principles and
  ethics. Regardless of their approach and work style, all mediators must guarantee
  the quality of the process as well as acquire and maintain professional
  qualifications required to perform effective mediation sessions. This chapter
  explores the fundamental guiding principles at the core of mediation ethics          Regardless of their
  and illustrates them with practical situations. It also includes “Did you            approach and work
  know?” items, such as box 4.1.                                                    style, all mediators must

  Mediators must conduct a mediation process that meets certain professional
  standards. Your mediator is bound by ethical duties. Every mediator has the duty
  to acquire and maintain professional skills and abilities. The core professional qualities of
  a mediator are integrity, competence, impartiality, and contribution to the advancement of
  mediation practice and professionalization.

     Box 4.1: Did you know?

     Mediators are bound by a professional code of conduct when certified
     by a mediation center or association.
     Remember, mediators cannot impose a decision on you: this is your ultimate safeguard. Generally,
     mediators are bound by ethical rules, just like lawyers or doctors.

     If accountability to ethical principles is crucial to you, you should consider choosing a certified
     mediator. Mediators usually are members of a mediation organization and are bound by a professional
     code of conduct. Look for mediation associations in your country that promote the quality of mediation
     using a professional code of conduct and a complaint process to enforce it. Many alternative dispute
     resolution (ADR) centers in the Middle East and North Africa region keep a roster of trained and
     certified mediators.

toward clarity and resolution.


   Box 4.2: Autonomy of participants in practice

   Imagine you have a dispute with a landlord or a tenant. If you choose mediation to solve your
   dispute, you and the other side will have input into the mediation process from beginning to end. You
   can influence how your dispute is managed in mediation and the content (terms and conditions) of its
   resolution. Your mediator will help both you and the other side clarify your goals for the mediation.
   You and the other side will be encouraged to talk directly with each other as much as possible.
   This effort also includes making sure that representatives or advisers (for example, lawyers) do not
   dominate the process. Try to speak for yourself and rely on a spokesperson only if you are not feeling
   confident or cannot express what you want clearly. This principle is called “direct participation.”

   Generally, mediators do not advise on disputed issues. Rather they will help you and the other
   side identify issues (for example, repairs, rent arrears, terminating a lease agreement, and so on),
   consider alternatives to settlement (for example, doing nothing or going to court), and develop
   options about future actions and outcomes (for example, respectfully communicating, performing
   tasks in compensation for rent arrears, or sharing contacts to get repair materials at better prices).
   The decision to settle the dispute or not is in your hands and those of the other side. You may put an
   end to the mediation at any time. In summary, the purpose of a mediation process is to maximize the
   decision making of participants.

   Box 4.3: Did you know?

   The duty of confidentiality applicable to mediation makes certain
   documents or testimony inadmissible in courts.
   If you testify in any arbitral, judicial, or administrative proceedings, the duty of confidentiality
   prevents you from disclosing as evidence any information learned in mediation, including statements
   made by any of the participants during mediation and meetings held to prepare for the mediation,
   opinions or suggestions made by participants on a possible settlement of the dispute, or the fact that
   one of the participants has expressed a willingness to accept a settlement proposal.  

   There are limited exceptions to confidentiality. These exceptions are important to protect the integrity
   of the process. For example, mediation information may be disclosed for the purpose of enforcing or
   challenging a mediated settlement agreement or for the purpose of proving the validity of a formal
   complaint of professional misconduct made against a mediator or any other person who participated
   in the mediation in a professional capacity (such as an accountant acting as an expert). This is, of

60               HOW TO USE GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF MEDIATION
   Box 4.4: Did you know?

   There are recourses against mediators who behave unethically.
   Every mediator has to perform in accordance with the qualities outlined in this chapter (impartiality,
   competence, respecting the autonomy of participants, confidentiality, and so on). However, in the
   unfortunate and rare event that mediators do not comply with their duties, what can you do?

   Your options depend on the professional status of the mediator. When choosing mediators, it is
   important to know if they are affiliated with a center or association.

   A mediator may be certified by a mediation association or listed on a center’s roster. Every certified
   mediator must comply with a code of conduct. Every association has its own code of conduct and its
   own complaint procedure through which you can initiate disciplinary proceedings. Some countries
   even have a national registry of mediators that guarantees the same standards of conduct for every
   mediator and is enforced by a complaint process. You are encouraged to check with your local
   mediation centers to learn about how they monitor the ethical practices of mediators and deal with
   misconduct.

   Even though every mediator is bound by the ethical principles, enforcement will likely be more
   difficult with a mediator who is not certified because there is no mediation association or public
   organization to assist you. In this situation you may try to make a complaint to another professional
   association to which the mediator belongs (such as an engineering association or medical association).
   Alternatively, you may attempt to bring a lawsuit for damages before a court of law.

INTRODUCTION
Three main contractual documents relate to mediation: mediation clauses, agreements to
mediate, and mediated settlement agreements (MSAs). This chapter explains each in detail
and provides guidelines for drafting each type of document.

A mediation clause is part of a contract (such as a business contract) that describes the
process that the people who sign the contract agree to follow if a dispute related to the
contract arises between them in the future.

An agreement to mediate is a contract that is created after a dispute has arisen
and signed by the people who agree to participate in mediation. These
people are called mediation participants, and they generally include you             The agreement to

A mediated settlement agreement, called an MSA, is a contract signed by
you and the other side should you reach an agreement through mediation.
An MSA contains the contents of your agreement. You and the other side
may specify that the terms of the MSA are confidential if both sides desire
confidentiality.
