SUMMARY OF THE KEY FINDINGS
1.       This report presents the findings of two surveys1 and provides information about
stakeholders’ experiences, perceptions, reform expectations and impacts of the previous judicial
reforms of the justice system in Serbia. The objective of the baseline survey conducted in 2010 was
to: (i) provide a baseline against which future reform results could be assessed; and (ii) help identify
areas for further judiciary reform2. The objective of the follow-up survey, conducted in 2013, was to
assess the initial impact of the first four years of reforms and expectations with respect to the new
National Reform Strategy for the period of 2014 - 2018.

2.       The survey polled members of the general population, representatives of the business
sector, members of the legal profession (lawyers) working in private practice, and employees in the
judiciary. In brief, this report presents a multi-dimensional, multi-stakeholder snapshot of experiences
with, and views on, Serbia’s judiciary in two time periods, before and after implementation of the
judicial reform of 2010.

3.           The top findings of these surveys can be summarized as follows:
        Only one in four citizens trusts the justice system in Serbia. The vast majority of citizens feels
         that trust in the judiciary is primarily undermined by long-lasting court proceedings, corruption,
         political influence on the judiciary, and by bad and non-transparent personnel policy.
        According to all stakeholders, the efficiency – reflected in the length of court proceedings – was,
         and has remained, the biggest problem of the justice system. The efficiency of adminihstrative
         services provided by courts had a considerably more positive assessment than the efficiency of
         court proceedings, however almost one half of the court users still think that administrative tasks
         in courts should be completed in less time.
        According to court users, another big problem of the justice system is the integrity of the
         judiciary. The majority of the citizens believes that the judiciary is not independent and that
         corruption is still widespread in the justice system.
        In comparison to 2009, the general perception and experiences of court users have become
         somewhat more positive, while the opinions of service providers have become more negative.
        The majority of providers of court services are disappointed with the effect of the reforms of
         2010. Expectations that the reforms will improve the situation in various aspects of the court
         system were very high. However, when asked about the actual results of the reforms, providers
         of court services were very negative.
        Expectations with respect to the new National Reform Strategy for the period 2014 – 2018 are
         very high, and exceed, considerably, the expectations with respect to the 2010 reforms.

Efficiency

4.      The findings in this survey point to a lack of efficiency as a key factor that was, and still is,
one of the main problems and challenges in the Serbian judiciary. The findings of the survey
conducted in 2010 pointed to problems related to efficiency, and the findings of the survey conducted
in 2013 also show that, when it comes to efficiency of the Serbian judiciary, no major breakthrough or
improvement has been recorded after the implementation of the 2010 reforms.

5.      Negative opinions about the efficiency of the judicial system considerably prevail over
positive opinions, both among users and providers of court services and lawyers. Personal


1 The first survey was conducted in 2010 and looked at the situation in the Serbian judiciary until December 31, 2009. The
follow-up survey was conducted in 2013 and early 2014 and looked at the Serbian judiciary until December 31, 2013.
2 In this survey “the judiciary” refers to the courts and prosecutors’ offices. It does not include the police, penal system and

Ministry of Justice.
                                                               7
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

experiences with the efficiency of judicial services are even more negative than general impressions
of those citizens who did not have any experience with the court system. The majority of citizens who
had experience with court proceedings think that their case took too long. The excessive duration of
the case proceedings was aggravated by a considerable number of canceled and unproductive
hearings (which did not contribute to the resolution of the case), as well as by long time intervals
between the hearings, which ranged from three to four months on average.

6.      In comparison with the period before implementation of the January 2010 reforms, the
general perception of the efficiency of the judiciary among court users has become somewhat more
positive, but court users who have experience with a court system remained equally dissatisfied with
the duration of their case, while there has been an increase in the percentage of representatives of
the business sector who are dissatisfied.

7.      In 2013 judges and prosecutors expressed considerably more negative opinions about the
efficiency of the judiciary than in 2010, so their opinions came closer to opinions of court users.
Efficiency is the measurement dimension with the biggest recorded concurrence of opinions between
users and providers of court services.

8.      Judges and prosecutors consider the obstructive attitude of parties to be the most important
reason for the prolonged duration of the cases, while the court-related issues are seen to have less
of an impact. In addition, a substantial percentage of judges and prosecutors see the reasons for long
duration of court cases in gaps in legislation and inefficient procedural provisions, but also in the lack
of court capacities.

9.      The efficiency of administrative services in courts was evaluated more positively than the
efficiency of court proceedings, and the percentage of court users who are satisfied with the
efficiency of the administrative services increased from 2009. According to court users, the ability to
complete all tasks at one place has improved (instead of going “from door-to-door“), as has the time
needed to complete the task. The number of visits to the court needed to complete the task has also
somewhat decreased. Although the assessment of the efficiency of court services is more positive,
around half of court users still believe that these tasks could have been completed in less time. Court
staff working on these administrative services think that the efficiency could be improved through an
increase in the number of staff, stimulation of unmotivated staff with higher salaries, simplified
procedures, and better technical equipment.

Quality of Court Services

10.     The perception of the general quality of work of the judicial system by court users and
lawyers on the one hand, and providers of court services on the other hand, is remarkably different.
While the general population and lawyers evaluate the quality of the work of the judiciary as rather
low (or average in the best case), providers of court services found the quality of services to be high
(or average in the worst of case).

11.      In comparison to 2009, the general impressions about the quality of work of the judiciary
among court users have become somewhat more positive, but assessments of the quality of the
services provided in the concrete cases in which the citizens participated did not change. Also, the
opinions of lawyers in the concrete cases are more negative. However, assessments by court service
providers have become somewhat more negative, so the opinions between users and providers are
slightly closer, but the difference is still significant and the gap is very wide.

12.    According to court users, the main cause of quality deficiencies in their court cases was poor
work of judges, poor organization in the courts and poor legal solutions. Judges, however, most
frequently identify unclear laws and understaffing to be the main reasons for poor quality. The

                                                      8
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

prosecutors found that the principal cause for poor quality is lack of staff, while lawyers believe that
the poor quality of the judiciary is linked to the poor organization within judicial institutions.

13.    In comparison to 2009, the frequency that lack of staff was mentioned as the reason for
reduced quality of court services has increased in all three groups of legal professionals, particularly
among judges.

14.     Court users are more satisfied with the quality of administrative services than with the
quality of court proceedings. Court users mainly evaluate the quality of administrative services as
average, but a higher percentage of them evaluate this quality as high rather than low. The majority
of court users are satisfied with the various aspects of the work of administrative services in courts
(working hours, accessibility of information and staff, behavior and competence of staff, and time
spent waiting in line), and the percentage of satisfied users has increased in comparison to 2009.
However, the perception of quality of administrative services is considerably more positive among the
service providers than among users, and this difference has remained significant despite the increase
of favorable opinions of court users.

Accessibility

15.     The majority of court users and legal professionals found that the judicial system is generally
accessible to citizens. Nevertheless, a considerably smaller percentage of court users than service
providers share this opinion. In comparison to 2009, the opinions of the service providers have
become somewhat more negative, so they came closer to the opinions of court users, but the
difference is still considerable.

16.      Court users and legal professionals found that the judicial system is most accessible to
citizens when it comes to the accessibility of information, the geographical proximity of courts, and
ease of use of the court buildings. They also found that the judicial system is least accessible in terms
of cost of court proceedings (both those related to lawyers’ fees and court fees).

17.     The majority of court users thought that, in their case, it was easy to access information.
Court users drew on both formal and informal sources to seek information about their case, but mainly
turned to their lawyers for help. In comparison to 2009, a change was noted only in case of citizens
who have a misdemeanor case where they expressed slightly more dissatisfaction with the
accessibility of information.

18.      The cost of court proceedings was actually the only aspect of accessibility that the majority
of court users and legal professionals perceive as a problem for citizens. Most court users who had
experience with a court case believe that the costs of their court case were too high and a considerable
burden to their budget. Citizens who stated that they had a dispute for which they thought it should
be resolved in court but decided not to start a court case also specified that the cost of court
proceedings is the main reason for that decision.
19.      In comparison to the population averages, citizens with lower education and older citizens
perceive the judicial system as less accessible to them in all aspects , while citizens who live outside
of urban areas perceive access to information as the main problem, followed by the challenges when
finding their way in the court house and problems related to the distance to the court.

20.     The accessibility of administrative court services was assessed as satisfactory by both court
services users and providers. In comparison to 2009, the opinions of court users about the
accessibility of administrative services have become more positive, and opinions of providers of
administrative court services have become more negative, so that the opinions have mainly become
concurrent. The percentage of court users who believe that accessibility of information and navigating
around the courthouse is not a problem was even higher than the percentage of providers of court

                                                      9
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

services who shared that opinion. The majority of the court users believe that the total cost of the
court administrative services which they used was reasonable and was not a burden on their budget.

Fairness

21.     A majority of court users found that the judicial system was fair, at least to some extent, if
not completely fair (circa one half of the general population and 60% of business sector
representatives). The majority of court users with experience with a court case perceived their trial as
fair (mainly or completely), but considerably less than half of them thought that it was completely fair
(37% of the general population and 44% of business sector representatives).

22.      The assessment of fairness was strongly affected by the outcome of the case. A considerably
higher percentage of court users evaluated their trial as being completely fair when the judgment was
in their favor. However, even in the case of a favorable outcome, the percentage of court users who
evaluated their trial as completely fair barely exceeds one half (53%).

23.     The general impressions of court users about the fairness of the judicial system, as well as
assessments of fairness in a concrete case where they were a party in the case, have become more
positive since 2009. While in 2009 the percentage of citizens who had negative impressions about the
judiciary exceeded the percentage of those who had positive impressions, in the year 2013 this ratio
has changed in favor of positive impressions. The percentage of court users who evaluated their trial
as completely fair has increased as well. While almost one half of court users gave a moderate rating
in 2009 for fairness, in 2013 the percentage of citizens who evaluated their trial as completely fair
almost equaled the percentage of citizens who gave a moderate rating (37% and 39% respectively).

24.    Positive changes in evaluations of fairness were noted in criminal and civil cases, while in
misdemeanor cases the percentage of court users who rated their trial as fair has somewhat
decreased. Representatives of the business sector are more satisfied with the fairness of their trial
than members of the general population, but their ratings have not changed in comparison to 2009.

25.     Providers of court services evaluated fairness considerably more positively than court users,
while the ratings of lawyers were closer to those of court users. In comparison to 2009 the ratings
have become closer to each other, as the opinions of court users and lawyers became somewhat more
positive while the opinions of service providers somewhat more negative, but the difference still
remains significant.

26.      Legal professionals think that fairness was affected by an overburdened judiciary, poor
organization and poor legal solutions. However, while almost half of the lawyers see the politicization
of the judiciary as a reason for lack of fairness, and one in five point to corruption as the main issue, a
considerably smaller percentage of judges and prosecutors associate a lack of fairness with these
issues. Compared to 2009, the biggest changes were recorded in assessments by prosecutors. In 2013,
more than 25% of prosecutors specified an overburdened judiciary and poor organization as the
reason for inadequate fairness of the judiciary. The percentage of lawyers who mention corruption as
the main reason has somewhat decreased.

27.      At the same time, a majority of professionals believe that the judicial system treats all
citizens equally regardless of their gender, age, nationality, place of residence, education, or
disabilities. The socio-economic status of citizens is perceived as the dominant factor for unequal
treatment: 42% of lawyers, 25% of prosecutors and 17% of judges (similar to 2009) think that citizens
are not treated equally in terms of socio-economic status. At the same time, more than 60% of citizens
think that socio-economic status is the source of unequal treatment, and more than 40% think that
treatment varies depending on education levels and ethnicity. A considerable percentage of business
sector representatives also believe that enterprises are treated unequally based on several factors.

                                                      10
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

More than a half of them believe that the treatment varies depending on ownership structure of the
enterprise, and almost half of them believe that the treatment depends on the company’s size.

Integrity

28.     The results of both studies suggest that integrity was and still is one of the major problems
of the judicial system in Serbia. Users of court services and lawyers believe that integrity is an issue,
compared to the providers of court services. However, a considerable portion of judges and
prosecutors also share negative views of the integrity of the judicial system, both in terms of
corruption and independence of the judiciary.

29.       Most court users and lawyers (almost 60%) believe that the judiciary is not independent,
while one in four judges and one in three prosecutors agrees with this opinion. Compared to 2009,
opinions of court users and lawyers have become somewhat more positive, while the opinions of
prosecutors and judges have become more negative, so the views get closer, but the discrepancy is
still significant.

30.      A majority of judges and prosecutors listed politicians, political parties and the media as the
main entities which threaten the independence of the judiciary. However, in their opinion, other
institutions are also responsible: more than a third of judges and prosecutors believe that some
ministries and the government have impaired the independence of the judicial system, one in five
reports that independence is endangered by businessmen (some companies), and a somewhat higher
percentage reports that NGOs have been the threatening factor.

31.     The great majority of citizens and lawyers (almost 90%) perceive the presence of corruption
in the judicial system, at least to some extent, and this view is shared by more than half of
prosecutors and 42% of judges. Compared to 2009, the portion of those who believe that corruption
is present in the judiciary is reduced in all groups, considerably more so among judges and prosecutors
than among court users and lawyers. While one in four judges and prosecutors believed that the
judiciary was free of corruption in 2009, in 2013 this view was shared by over half of judges and 44%
of prosecutors.

32.     Most judges and prosecutors believe that integrity is impaired by sensationalist media
reports (78% of judges and 80% of prosecutors) and by the duration of court proceedings (73% of
judges and 77% of prosecutors). A majority also believes that integrity was endangered by an
inadequate and insufficiently transparent human resources policy, political influences on the judiciary
and inadequate sanction policies for cases of corruption.

33.     From the citizens’ point of view, the confidence in the judicial system was reduced by a
number of factors. The largest portion of citizens (more than 80%) believes that trust was impaired
by the duration of court proceedings, corruption, political influence on the judiciary and an inadequate
and not sufficiently transparent human resources policy.

34.      About a third of court users consider there to be corruption in administrative court services.
This is a considerable and positive progress compared to 2009, when the portion of citizens who
shared this opinion was substantially larger.

Costs

35.      About a half of court users found trial costs to be too high. However, perceptions of whether
costs were reasonable were strongly influenced by the respondents’ assessment of the quality of court
performance. The citizens who are satisfied with the quality perceive costs as more affordable and
less of a burden on their budget. Compared to 2009, the portion of users who assess costs as extremely
high has changed only among the citizens who have experience with misdemeanor cases - in the
negative direction; the portion of citizens who assessed total costs as too extensive has risen to 18%.

36.     Most of the users of administrative services assess the total cost of administrative services
as reasonable and not as a particular burden on their budget. Compared to 2009, percentage of the
general population who assesses the costs of administrative services as not a considerable burden on
their budget has increased.

Perception of Results of the Reforms Introduced in January 2010 and Expectations with respect to
the New National Judicial Reform Strategy for the Period 2014 to 2018.

37.      General support to the judicial reforms introduced in 2010 has decreased considerably
among court users as well as providers of court services and lawyers. The reduced support among
judges and prosecutors for the reforms is certainly a result of disappointment in the effects of these
reforms. Expectations that the reforms will improve the situation in various aspects of the functioning
of the judicial system were far higher than the actual positive effect of the reforms.

38.     Judges and prosecutors had the greatest expectations in relation to fairness and integrity.
More than half of them expected improvements in these areas, but the portion of those who said that
improvements had already occurred is by far lower; less than 30% perceive that fairness has improved,
while one in four consider that the integrity of the judicial system has improved. More than half of the
prosecutors also expected improvements in efficiency, but only 27% estimated that they had actually
materialized. Judges and prosecutors had low expectations regarding the improvement of working
conditions (41% of judges and 37% of prosecutors) and more rational budget spending (34% of judges
and 40% of prosecutors), but not many perceived positive effects of the reforms in any of the two
areas. One in five judges and 15% of prosecutors believe that the reforms have improved their working
conditions; 15% of judges and 13% of prosecutors think that the reforms have contributed to more
rational budget spending.

39.     Lawyers, compared to judges and prosecutors, had considerably lower expectations, so the
extent of their disappointment is considerably smaller. While discrepancies between the lawyers
and judges and prosecutors in terms of expectations towards the effects of reform were substantial,
the perceptions of the actual effects of reform are similar.

40.     Similarly to lawyers, providers of administrative services had considerably lower
expectations towards the reforms in their sector, so their disappointment was less. The perception
of the actual effects of the reforms is considerably closer to perceptions of judges and prosecutors.
The employees in administrative services expected negative consequences primarily in terms of
increased workload, or reduced number of employees. Only 19% expected positive results of the
reforms, and a similar share assessed the reform effects as positive.

41.     Knowledge of the reforms has decreased substantially among citizens, as well as support to
the reforms. Those who have heard of the reforms mainly associate them with the reappointment of
judges and prosecutors, which was the case with the reforms introduced in 2010.

42.     At the end of 2013, providers of court services and lawyers were not well informed about
the new National Judicial Reform Strategy for the period 2014 to 2018. Little more than a third of
judges and prosecutors considered themselves as well informed, while more than half of lawyers and
                                                12
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

providers of administrative services estimated that they had no or almost no information about the
new judicial reform strategy.

43.     In spite of insufficient knowledge, the great majority of judges and prosecutors generally
support the new strategy, in the same way as they supported the introduction of the reforms in
2010. The portion of providers of administrative services and lawyers who support the new strategy
is considerably higher than the share of those who supported the reforms in 2010. Concrete
expectations in different aspects of the functioning of the judicial system are considerably higher than
with the reforms introduced in 2010, and greater expectations are particularly tangible in the case of
providers of administrative services and lawyers.

44.      Most judges and prosecutors expect the new reforms to have positive effects on all aspects
of the performance of the judiciary. The optimism is most extensive in terms of the efficiency of the
judicial system: 62% of judges and 67% of prosecutors expect that the new reforms will improve
efficiency. More than 60% of prosecutors expect improvements with regard to accessibility of the
judicial system. Judges have the lowest expectations regarding the contribution of the new reforms
to more rational budget spending (51%), and the prosecutors have the lowest expectations regarding
quality of working conditions (56%).

45.    Lawyers are less optimistic than judges and prosecutors. The biggest portion of lawyers
expects improvement of efficiency (56%) and accessibility of judiciary (53%), and a smaller portion
expects improvements in fairness and integrity of the judiciary (43%).

46.     The employees in administrative services, similarly to lawyers, have considerably lower
expectations towards the new reforms than they had with respect to the 2010 reforms. About a half
expects improvements in accessibility and efficiency, and a similar portion expects improvements in
the quality of working conditions and a general increase of performance. Expectations are very low
when it comes to improvements of the normative framework that regulates activities of
administrative services; less than half (45%) expects positive changes here.
47.     Not many citizens were informed about the new National Judicial Reform Strategy at the
end of 2013 (11% of general population and 26% of business sector representatives), but the great
majority of those who were supported the proposed reforms.

Gender-related differences

48.    No gender-related differences were identified by these two surveys in experiences of men
and women with the judicial system that would imply different treatment before the court. Both
men and women were equally satisfied or dissatisfied with the average length of their proceedings,
the quality of work of the judiciary and the fairness of the judicial system.

49.     With regard to a broad perception of the performance of judiciary, evaluation does vary,
but these discrepancies are not systemic and they do not point to general differences in perception
of the judiciary. Women have generally more positive impressions of fairness of the judiciary than
men do, and similar portions of men and women agree that citizens of both genders are treated
equally before the court (72% of men and 69% of women).

Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013


Effects of Personal Experiences with the Justice System

50.     Those court users who had experience with court cases gave somewhat more negative
ratings about the functioning of the judiciary as compared to those who had no experience with
court cases. Court users with experience with court cases evaluated the efficiency and accessibility of
the judicial system more negatively; in addition, business sector representatives who had experience
with the court system also evaluated the quality of services more negatively than business
representatives without this experience. There were no differences regarding the assessment of
fairness between court users with and without experience with court cases.

51.     The court users who had experience with court cases evaluated the quality and fairness in
their concrete case more positively than they evaluated the quality of services and fairness of the
judicial system in general. However, as would be expected, the evaluations of fairness were
dependent on the outcome of the trial, so that respondents whose cases were resolved in their favor
reported more positive views than those whose cases were not.

52.     Compared to 2009, among the members of the general public who had experience with
court cases, positive impressions of efficiency, quality of services, and fairness of the judicial system
have grown to a greater extent than among users without this experience, so views have come
closer to each other. As for accessibility, the views of users who had experience with court cases have
not changed, and the views of users without this experience have become more positive, so the
discrepancy has increased.

53.     Business sector representatives who had experience with the court system have a more
positive impression about efficiency, but it is still less positive than the impression of business sector
representatives without this experience. Views on quality and accessibility among the business sector
representatives who had experience with the court system have not changed, while views have
become more positive among those business sector representatives without this experience.

54.      The overall confidence in the judicial system has grown somewhat more among the citizens
who had experience with court cases compared to citizens without this experience. So, while in 2009
citizens who had no experience with court cases had considerably more confidence in the judicial
system than citizens who had experience with court cases, the level of confidence of these two groups
have come closer to each other.

INTRODUCTION

Survey background and objectives

55.     With the purpose of providing assistance to Government efforts in justice sector reform and
modernization, the World Bank conducted two surveys. The first survey was conducted in 2010 in
order to collect baseline information on perceptions of the court and prosecutorial performance and
expectations from the reform implemented in January 2010. The second, follow-up, survey was
conducted in 2013 in order to identify the impact of the first four years (2010 - 2013) of reforms and
the expectations from the new National strategy of reform for the period 2014-2018.

56.      The surveys aimed to measure perceptions of judicial performance against five core values
(efficiency, quality, fairness, accessibility, and integrity - independence and presence of corruption),
and to compare the views of multiple stakeholders (court services users - general public and business
sector, court services providers -judges, prosecutors and providers of court administrative services,
and lawyers as intermediaries between users and providers of court services). In addition to the issue
of integrity the problem of partiality of judges was included in the follow up survey.

57.     The surveys also aimed to measure judicial performance from the point of view of users with
personal experiences with court proceedings, as well as the influence of these personal experiences
to general perceptions of the judiciary in relation to the five values. In order to achieve this goal, users
of court services with experience with court cases and users without such experience were surveyed.

58.     The survey also focused on costs of judicial services, with respect to perceptions of
accessibility of court services, and views of cost, with respect to quality of the delivered services, from
the point of view of users with experience with court cases. Finally, one of the aims of the surveys
was to gain insights in the role of media in shaping the public opinion of judiciary.

Strengths and Limitations of Judiciary Surveys

59.     Surveys can map experiences, perceptions, and expectations from the point of view of
various stakeholders, thus providing an indication of the judiciary’s popular legitimacy that cannot
be measured in other ways. It is important to address the perceptions of the general public and of
the users of the justice system, as perception data can point to areas where there may be a need to
follow up with administrative data.

60.      It is often argued, however, that there are limitations to using perception data to measure
performance. First, the perceptions of members of the general public who have not had personal
contact with the justice system could be influenced by media coverage of cases at the time of the
survey, such that survey results could fluctuate randomly over time and measure a general mood
rather than system performance. Both factors could render surveys less useful as baselines for
measuring reform progress over time and as tools for identifying reform priorities. Another argument
is that perceptions and reform expectations could be influenced by whether or not the respondent
has received an advantageous verdict, for example. Thus, the argument goes, responses would not
measure the quality of the process and the system but the respondent’s opinion of the outcome of
the case.

Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

61.     In this sense, the current survey aims to measure the experiences and perceptions of
changes in the past 3 years, as well as expectations for future reforms of the judicial system in
Serbia. In addition, this study observes experiences, perceptions and expectations, by examining
various dimensions of performance of the judicial system, comparing the perceptions of various
stakeholders and recognizing the limitations of research instruments. By comparing the perceptions
and expectations, it is possible to recognize similar and different trends among stakeholders and thus
recognize the influence of the fact that, for example, the respondent had experience with the services
of a court or didn’t have such experience, whether the verdict was delivered or not in his / her favor,
how time and costs influence the perception, whether certain segments of population have different
experiences with justice system - and whether and how it affects their opinions.

Structure of the report

62.     The review of the survey results is organized as follows: The introductory section contains an
overview of perceptions of the five dimensions of judiciary performance across survey groups and
across time. More detailed data on perceptions of the five basic dimensions are presented in the next
three sections. The section on quality, besides perceptions of overall quality of judiciary services,
encompasses the perceptions of fairness, integrity (presence of corruption and independence) and
impartiality, and public trust in judiciary, while the cost issue is presented in the section on
accessibility. Perceptions of performance of court administrative services alongside the five
dimensions by users and providers of the services are presented in a separate section (Section 4). The
penultimate section deals with expectations and perceived effects of the reform implemented in
January 2010 and expectations from the new National strategy of reform. The final section deals with
the perceived role of media in shaping the public opinion on judiciary system in Serbia.

METHODOLOGY

1 Introduction

63.      The survey on the judicial system encompassed 4 separate surveys on different target
populations, that is: (i) Survey on General Population (citizens of Serbia 18+) (users and non-users);
(ii) Survey on Representatives of Business Sector (users and non-users); (iii) Survey on legal
professionals who have private practice (private lawyers); and (iv) Survey on Public Officials Employed
in Justice Sector.

2 Sample and method of selecting respondents

64.     In order to ensure methodological consistency, that is, valid comparability of results, sample
drafts and drafts of data collection methods for all target groups in the follow-up survey were based
on sample drafts and drafts of data collection methods in the baseline survey.

General population

65.     Both the baseline and follow-up surveys on general population were based on a national
representative sample. The type of sample was a three-stage random sample. Besides a
representative sample for the general population, the survey was also done on a booster sample of
users of court services.

66.     In the follow-up survey, the users of court services are defined as members of the general
population of the citizens of Serbia (18+) who participated themselves in a court case which was
FINISHED (the first instance verdict was passed) in the period from the beginning of 2011 till the end
of 20133. The proceedings could have started earlier, but the first instance verdict had to be passed in
that period. The court proceedings could have dealt with criminal, civil or misdemeanor matters. The
respondent could have participated in it ONLY as a party in proceedings (not as a witness). In both
surveys the plan is to interview 1000 representatives of general population and an additional 600
users of court services. In the follow-up survey, a total of 1048 interviews were conducted on a random
sample of general population and an additional 650 interviews with users of court services (Table A1
in Annex)4.

Representatives of business sector

67.      In the case of business sector representatives, one stage stratified sample was used both in
the baseline and follow-up survey. Stratification was done by geographical regions, economic activity
and size of enterprise. The sampling frame were private enterprises evidenced in Serbian Business
Registers Agency. In the majority of cases the questionnaire was filled out by two persons in the
enterprise: the highest positioned manager available and the person who is the best informed about
judicial proceedings and administrative services. Namely, questions on perception could be answered
by a manager or lawyer within or outside of the enterprise who is included in a court case.

68.     Both in the baseline and follow-up survey, it was planned to cover 800 randomly selected
registered enterprises and a booster sample of 200 enterprises – users of court services. In the
follow-up survey, a total of 810 interviews were conducted on a representative random sample of

till the end of 2009
4 Total of 1035 interviews was conducted in the baseline survey on a random sample of general population and additional

555 interviews with users of court services.
                                                            17
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

private enterprises population and 210 interviews with users of court services5 (Table A.2.2a in Annex).
The method of selecting respondents for the booster sample of users of court services was the same
as in case of random sample of enterprises; that is, the enterprises were randomly selected from the
register of Serbian Business Registers Agency, whereas the interviews were applied only to the
enterprises which the screening telephone interview identified as users of court services.

Lawyers

69.     The sample frame for the survey on lawyers was the list of private lawyers registered in the
Bar Association of Serbia. Respondents were chosen randomly from 8 regional associations:
Belgrade, Čačak, Kragujevac, Niš, Požarevac, Zaječar, Šabac and Vojvodina. 800 lawyers were
interviewed.

The employed in judiciary

Judges and prosecutors

70.      The questionnaire was distributed to all judges, prosecutors and deputy prosecutors
employed in the judicial and prosecutor’s institutions during the survey. Given that the universe, by
definition, encompassed judges and prosecutors who were active in these positions during the survey
fieldwork, the main survey conducted in 2010 encompassed only judges and prosecutors who were
reappointed in 2009, while the 2013 survey encompassed also judges and prosecutors who were not
reappointed during the main survey, but who were returned to work by the decision of the
Constitutional Court, as well as judges and prosecutors hired in between the two surveys (Table
A.2.2c,d and e in the Appendix). In order to provide full privacy and confidentiality of the collected
data, the questionnaires were self-administered. Given the method, huge differences between
questionnaires in regard to response rate can be observed. This report includes results for the judges
and prosecutors who answered the given question.

The employed in administration

71.      The questionnaires were distributed to administrative staff in 43 courts chosen for the main
survey. The sample was created in such a way that the number of the chosen administrative staff in
each of these three regions is proportional to the number of judges in the given region. In
collaboration with the head of the government sector in each town, questionnaires were distributed
to all departments. The number of questionnaires was proportional to the number of those employed
in each department, so most of the questionnaires were distributed to the employed in the registry
office in each court. The data collection method was a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 900
questionnaires each were distributed in both the basic survey and follow-up survey; in the main
survey, 571 administrative employees completed the questionnaire (response rate 63%), and 579 in
the follow-up survey (response rate 64%).




5In the baseline survey, 853 interviews were conducted on a representative random sample in the population of private
enterprises and 212 with users.
                                                         18

3 Data collection method

72.      The applied data collection method is F2F for all interviewed groups, except for those
employed in the judiciary who filled out a self-administered questionnaire in order to be provided
with stronger guarantees in regard to anonymity of interviews. Members of the general population
were interviewed in their households. Business sector representatives and lawyers were interviewed
at work, after answering a screening questionnaire over the phone. Those employed in the judiciary
filled out self-administered questionnaire, since it was identified in the 2010 survey that they felt
uneasy being interviewed by interviewers, while self-administering suited them better as it added a
new layer of confidentiality.

4 Fieldwork timeline

73.     The survey was conducted during the second half of 2013. Respondents were asked about
their perceptions and experiences with the judiciary system, with the focus on the period prior to
2013, in order to obtain information about the situation after implementation of the reform of the
judiciary system. The survey on the general population, the business sector and lawyers was
conducted in November and December 2013. Interviews in prosecutor’s offices and courts were
conducted from November 2013 till February 2014.

74.     Detailed methodology is described in this report’s Appendix.

OVERVIEW OF PERCEPTION OF FIVE DIMENSIONS OF JUDICIARY
PERFORMANCE

Summary

75.       As an illustrative summary of the general perceptions of judicial performance among court
users and justice service providers, a brief summary of perceptions of the court system in 2013 and
changes in perception compared with the 2009 survey is presented through five dimensions of court
services (efficiency, quality, fairness, accessibility and integrity). For a clearer layout, presented first
are net scores (obtained by subtracting the percentage of negative scores from the percentage of
positive scores) (Tables i.1 and i.2). A more detailed overview of the comparison of evaluations of the
five dimensions between target groups obtained in the survey conducted in 2013 is shown in Figures
I.1.1 to I.1.66, and changes in perception compared with the survey conducted in 2009 for each
individual target group is shown in Figures I.2.1 to I.2.7.7
The obtained results show the following:
    Efficiency, quality and integrity (independence and presence of corruption) are the main issues of
     the court system in the opinion of users of court services, but from the point of view of the overall
     results obtained with all target groups, efficiency is the main problem.
    Users of court services are more likely to evaluate efficiency, quality and integrity of the court
     system with negative than with positive grades, while fairness and accessibility are aspects which
     users are more likely to evaluate positively than negatively.
    There are substantial differences between users and providers of court services with regard to
     perceptions of performance of the court system. Providers of court services, particularly judges,
     are considerably more likely to evaluate all dimensions more positively, so, with the exception of
     efficiency and prosecutors’ opinion on presence of corruption, positive evaluation prevails over
     negative.
    As for perceptions of efficiency, this is where the opinions of users and of providers of court
     services match most, and this is also the only dimension with evenly distributed positive and
     negative judges’ evaluation, while prosecutors are a lot more likely to give negative than positive
     grades (even more negative than those of general population with experience with court cases).
    Differences between users and providers of court services are greatest in perceptions of quality,
     followed by perceptions of independence of judiciary.
    Perceptions of judges are at least somewhat more positive than perceptions of prosecutors on all
     dimensions, so differences compared to users of court services are greater in the case of judges
     than prosecutors.
    Perceptions of lawyers are much closer to perceptions of users than to providers of court services,
     but lawyers’ evaluations of efficiency and quality of court services are a lot more negative than
     users’ evaluations, and somewhat more negative in regard to presence of corruption.
    Users with experience with court cases, as compared to users without this experience, evaluate
     most dimensions more negatively, with just a few exceptions of dimensions which were similarly



6All dimensions were evaluated on 4-point scales, except the presence of corruption which was evaluated with 5 point scale
with users of the services and 3 point scale with providers of the services and lawyers. Due to this discrepancy in
measurement scale, the evaluations of the presence of corruption can be only roughly compared to the evaluations of other
dimensions, and between users and providers of the services
7 In the survey in 2009, the 5-point scales were used for evaluations of efficiency and quality and due to this variation in

measurement scales used for different dimensions, the comparisons between dimensions were less precise. In order to
make the comparisons between dimensions more precise, and at the same time comparable with the results obtained in the
2009 survey, in the survey 2013, the respondents were first asked to evaluate efficiency and quality on 5 point scale (same
as in 2009), and then, the respondents who selected the middle ratings were asked to opt for either positive or negative
grades (But if expressing your opinion you should opt only between negative and positive, which side your opinion would be
closer to?). In this way the evaluations were obtained on both, the 5-point scale (used for comparisons with evaluations for
year 2009) and the 4 point scale (used for comparisons with evaluations on other dimensions for year 2013)
                                                            20
Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

    evaluated (quality and presence of corruption in general population and fairness both in general
    population and among business sector representatives)
   Compared to 2009, perceptions of users and providers of court services became closer, since
    perceptions of users of services have become more positive (with some exceptions of accessibility
    and quality where there were no changes), and perceptions of providers of court services have
    become more negative (with the exception of perceptions of presence of corruption, which
    become more positive). However, with the exception of efficiency, perceptions of providers of
    court services are still significantly more positive than perceptions of users of court services
   The major positive change among users of court services is in perceptions of independence of the
    judiciary, and the major negative change among providers of court services is in perceptions of
    accessibility of the judiciary
   Lawyers’ opinions have become more negative in regard to efficiency, quality and accessibility,
    and more positive in regard to fairness, independence and presence of corruption

I.1 Perceptions of five dimensions of judiciary performance across survey groups

76.    Efficiency is the only dimension where negative opinions prevail over positive opinions in all
groups, with the exception of judges whose positive and negative opinions are evenly distributed.
Users of court services with experience with court cases share more negative opinions than users
without this experience, while negative opinions are most present among lawyers. (Figure I.1.1)

8Differenceswere calculated by simple subtraction of net scores obtained in 2013 from the net score obtained in 2009. As
already noted above, in order to make the evaluations obtained in the 2013 survey comparable with those obtained in the
2009 survey, for all comparisons the five point scales for the evaluations of efficiency and quality were used

77.     As for evaluation of quality, differences are the greatest between users of court services and
lawyers on one side, and providers of court services on the other. While most providers of court
services give positive scores, most users, and particularly lawyers, evaluate the quality negatively. The
impressions of quality of services in the general population are equally negative among users with
experience with court cases and those without this experience, while business sector representatives
with experience with court cases evaluate quality of services more negatively than representatives
without this experience. (Figure I.1.2)

78.     Accessibility and fairness are the only dimensions with prevailing positive over negative
scores in all groups. However, providers of court services are a lot more likely than users and lawyers
to give positive scores, and differences are particularly striking when compared to users with
experience with court cases. (Figure I.1.3)

80.     When evaluating the independence of the judiciary, as in the case of quality, a striking
imbalance between the opinion of users and lawyers on one side, and providers of court services
on the other is present. While most users of court services and lawyers do not consider the judiciary
independent, most judges and prosecutors do consider it independent (Figure I.1.5)

81.      Imbalance between users of court services and lawyers on one side, and providers of court
services on the other, is also great in the case of opinions on the presence of corruption in the
judiciary. As it was said already, the evaluation scales were different, so this comparison is relatively
rough. However, there is considerable difference between users of court services and lawyers on one
side and providers of services on the other in regard to the evaluation that corruption is not present
in the judiciary at all. While a relatively low percentage of users of court services and lawyers believe
that corruption is not present in the judiciary, more than half of judges, and somewhat less than half
of prosecutors, share this opinion. Differences are particularly striking between evaluations of the
general population and judges.

1. EFFICIENCY OF JUDICIARY SERVICE DELIVERY

1.1.Perceptions of efficiency of court service delivery

1.1.a General perceptions of the functioning of judicial system

88.      Efficiency of the justice system is the biggest problem of the judiciary, both according to court
users and providers of court services. Negative opinions about the efficiency of the functioning of the
justice system prevail considerably over positive opinions of both court users, providers of court
services, and lawyers. Perceptions of efficiency of the justice system’s functioning by court services
providers have become close to the perception of the court services users, since the opinions of court
users have become somewhat more positive, while the opinions of providers of court services have
become considerably more negative. Personal experiences with court efficiency are even more
negative than the general impressions of citizens without such experience, but the general assessment
of efficiency has somewhat improved in both cases.

89.      General opinions about the functioning of the judicial system are considerably more
negative than positive, both among the court users, providers of court services and lawyers. More
than 40% of the general population and representatives of the business sector have a negative opinion
about overall functioning of judicial system, and less than 20% have a positive opinion; more than one
third of the judges and almost a half of the prosecutors express negative opinions, while only 16% of
the judges and 10% prosecutors express positive opinions. The most negative opinion was expressed
by the lawyers, among whom even 69% have a negative opinion and only 6% have a positive opinion.
(Figure 1.1.a1)

90.     Opinions of the citizens who have experience with a court case are even more negative than
opinions of those without such experience, and this difference is particularly striking in business
sector (a negative opinion was expressed by 51% of the members of business sector who have
experience with a court case, and 41% of those without such experience). (Figure 1.1.a1)

91.     In comparison with 2009, opinions of both the general population and representatives of
the business sector have become more positive, and opinions of the judges are considerably more
negative, which resulted in much a bigger concurrence of the attitudes of court users and providers
of court services. (Figures 1.1.a2 and 1.1.a3)

1.1.b Perceptions of efficiency of case proceedings

Summary

93.      Court users with experience with court cases and providers of court services do not agree in
their assessment of the length of court processes: while a majority of court users think that their cases
lasted too long, according to judges just circa one fourth of the cases on which they worked, on
average, lasted more than they should have lasted, and according to prosecutors circa one third of the
cases lasted longer than they should have. According to information obtained from the court users,
duration of misdemeanor and civil cases has not changed since 2009, and in criminal cases it has even
been prolonged. The number of canceled and unproductive hearings, as well as too big time span
between two hearings (which, on average, ranged from three to four months) substantially
contributed to too long duration of cases.

94.      Total efficiency of hearings (percentage of hearings contributing to resolution out of the total
number of scheduled hearings) calculated based on data obtained from court users, court services
providers and lawyers is relatively matching, range between 55% and 65%, with some exception of
the efficiency based on prosecutors’ estimates which is somewhat lower than 50%, and court users in
misdemeanor cases, which is somewhat above 70%. The percentage of productive hearings has
increased somewhat in civil and business sector cases, while it remained at the same level in criminal
and misdemeanor cases. The percentage of productive hearings was shown to decrease with extended
duration of court proceedings, indicating that lengthy duration is very likely not a consequence of
specificities of the cases, requiring a larger number of hearings in order to reach quality solution, but
on the contrary, just leading to an increased number of canceled and unproductive hearings.

95.     According to court service providers the reasons for extended duration of cases are more
often obstructions from the parties in the proceedings, gaps in legislation and inefficient procedural
provisions, than errors of the court.

1.1.b.1 Duration of proceedings

96.      Most court users are not satisfied with duration of their court proceeding. More than 70%
of citizens with experience in criminal, civil, and business sector cases, and almost 60% of citizens with
experience in misdemeanor cases consider their court proceeding longer than necessary. The
percentage of dissatisfied citizens hasn’t changed since 2009, while business sector representatives
are now even more likely to be dissatisfied with duration of their court proceeding. (Figure 1.1.b.1.1)

necessary, and in prosecutors’ estimation about one third. Lawyers’ estimations matches citizens’
estimations a lot more, since they estimated that about 55% of their typical cases lasted longer than
necessary. Judges’, prosecutors’ and lawyers’ perception of duration of their cases hasn’t changed
since 2009. (Figure 1.1.b.1.2)

98.     Dissatisfaction with the efficiency of court proceedings is not surprising given their duration.
As reported by the citizens10 in 2013, the average duration of court proceeding from case filing to first-
instance judgment in criminal and civil cases was about 15 months, in misdemeanor cases 8 months,
and in business sector cases 13 months. Compared with the data reported in 2009, the only change
occurred in criminal cases, and this change is negative: on average, cases lasted 3 months longer.

99.     Striking are, however, great variations in duration of cases. According to data reported in
2013, the duration of criminal cases ranged from less than one to 70 months; in misdemeanor cases
it ranged from less than one to 46 months, in civil and business cases from less than one to more than
100 months.

10Information  obtained from citizens and business sector representatives about duration of their court case is based on
recollections and may somewhat differ from reality. However, consistency of the information obtained in surveys conducted
in 2009 and 2013indicates that the results are reliable, so it may be assumed that the average values are in the range of
actual with reasonable size of deviations.

100. As well, several months usually passed from the case filing to the first appearing before
court. In criminal cases, citizens usually waited about 4 months, in civil and misdemeanor cases about
3 months, while business sector representatives waited somewhat more than 2 months. Compared
to 2009, the interval from case filing to the first appearing before the court decreased only with
business sector cases, while with other types of cases it remained the same. (Figure 1.1.b.1.4)

1.1.b.2 Efficiency of hearings

    i) Number of scheduled hearings

101. According to information obtained from citizens who have experience with a court case in
2013, the number of scheduled hearings in first-instance proceedings is not big. Based on
information obtained from citizens-court users in 2013, on average, five hearings were scheduled in
criminal and civil cases, two hearings in misdemeanor cases, and four hearings in business cases.
Average number of scheduled hearings hasn’t changed since 2009. (Figure 1.1.b.2.1)

                                    GENERAL PUBLIC
Note: Question: How many total hearings were scheduled in the first-instance court, including those that were scheduled
but not held? Base: General public and members of business sector with experience with court cases who reported data
(Criminal cases: 2009 90%, 2013 96%; Misdemeanor 2009 88%, 2013 92%; Civil 2009 89%, 2013 93%; Business 2009 83%,

Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013


102. However, there are great variations within all types of cases present. The number of
scheduled hearings in criminal cases range from 1 to 32 hearings, in misdemeanor cases from
1 to 10 hearings, in civil cases from 1 to 50 hearings, and in business cases from 1 to 30
hearings.

103. Hearings are usually scheduled with big time intervals in between them, on average from
three to four months. This wide distribution of hearings in time hasn’t changed since 2009.

     ii) Percentage of canceled hearings

104. According to 2013 estimates of both court users, court service providers, and lawyers, a
significant percentage of scheduled hearings in their cases was canceled. According to citizens’
estimates, in criminal and civil cases, as well as in business cases, on average, somewhat more than
one fifth of scheduled hearings were canceled, while the percentage of canceled hearings in
misdemeanor cases was lower, 12%. Judges’ and lawyers’ estimates of the percentage of canceled
hearings in cases they worked on match citizens’ estimates, while prosecutors think that a somewhat
higher percentage of hearings was canceled in cases they worked on - one third of scheduled hearings
on average. In comparison to 2009, the only change took place in civil cases, where the average
percentage of canceled hearings was reduced for 5% (from 26% to 21%). (Figure 1.1.b.2.3)

     iii) Percentage of inefficient hearings (hearings that did not contribute to resolution of the
          case)

105. A substantial percentage of hearings was also evaluated as inefficient by the citizens in their
court cases, and also by judges, prosecutors and lawyers in cases they worked on. According to court
users, in 2013, about one fifth of the hearings, on average, were inefficient, i.e. didn’t contribute to
resolution of their case11. According to judges, the percentage of inefficient hearings was somewhat
lower, 16% on average, and according to prosecutors and lawyers, somewhat higher, 28% on average.
In comparison to the year 2009, the percentage of inefficient hearings has changed only in


11Although the average number of inefficient hearings varies somewhat by type of case (from 17% in misdemeanor cases
to 22% in criminal cases), probability of error that there is a difference between types of cases is bigger than 5%, so such
conclusion would be unreliable according to accepted standards of statistical concluding
                                                             33

misdemeanor cases, and in the negative direction: the average percentage of inefficient hearings has
risen for 11% (from 6% to 17%). (Figure 1.1.b2.4)

     iv)       Efficiency index

106. Based on the information on the number of canceled and inefficient hearings, an efficiency
index was calculated, showing the share of efficient hearings (hearings contributing to the resolution
of a case) in the total number of scheduled hearings.12

107. Efficiency indexes show that, on average, 55% of hearings were productive in criminal cases,
and 58% in civil cases; the efficiency index is somewhat higher in business cases, 63%, while it is over
70% in misdemeanor cases. Efficiency indexes are based on information obtained from judges,
prosecutors and lawyers belong to the same range as indexes calculated based on information
obtained from court users. However, the efficiency index based on data provided by judges is higher
than the one based on data provided by prosecutors (63% and 47% respectively), while the index
based on data reported by lawyers is in between (55%). Compared to 2009, the efficiency index
increased in civil cases for 8% and in business cases for 7%, while it stayed at the same level in criminal
and misdemeanor cases. (Figure 1.1.b.2.5)




12Efficiencyindexes were calculated on the basis of court user data as follows: (total number of scheduled hearings –
number of canceled hearings – number of hearings failing to contribute to the resolution of a case) / total number of
scheduled hearings * 100. Efficiency indexes were calculated on the basis of data reported by judges, prosecutors and
lawyers as follows: 100% - % of canceled hearings in the course of 2009/2013 - (% unproductive hearings*% held/100) in
the course of 2009/2013. Indexes are presented as average values (arithmetic means).

108. Correlations between the efficiency index and the number of scheduled hearings, (i.e.
duration of court case)13, show that as the number of hearings increases, (i.e. as the case lasts longer)
the number of productive hearings decrease. 14 This indicates that extended duration of court
proceedings is very likely not to be a consequence of specificities of given cases requiring a larger
number of hearings in order to reach quality solution, but on the contrary, that the number of
canceled and unproductive hearings is only rising with extended duration of proceeding.

1.1.b.3 Perceptions of reasons for extended duration of the cases and inefficiency of hearings

109. Judges and prosecutors primarily see the reasons for extended duration of cases and
canceled hearings in the obstruction by the parties to the proceedings, and gaps in legislation or
procedural provisions, and to a considerable less extent in court or court staff errors. The lawyers,
however, think that the reasons should equally be sought in the court as well as among parties to the
proceedings. Circa one half of the judges, prosecutors and lawyers think also that the objective lack of
court capacity (lack of staff and equipment - courtrooms, computers, cameras, etc.) was at least
occasional, if not frequent reason for longer duration of the cases. This reason was also the only one
which all three groups mentioned in higher percentage than in 2009 (8% more judges, 5%, more
lawyers, and as much as 15% more prosecutors). (Figures 1.1.b.3.1 and 1.1.b3.2)

1.2. Effective enforcement

Summary

110. More than one third of judges and prosecutors reported not having enough information on
the enforcement process in cases they worked on, and this percentage has even increased compared
to 2009. Among the judges and prosecutors who stated their opinion on the issue of enforcement, a
higher percentage was satisfied than dissatisfied with enforcement process, while among the lawyers
the percentage of dissatisfied was considerably higher. Compared to 2009, from the point of view of
prosecutors and lawyers the situation was somewhat improved, while from the point of view of judges
there were no changes. Judges and prosecutors had far greater expectations in terms of the effects of
The Law on Enforcement and Security of Court Judgments before it was launched in 2011, than in their
opinion, this law actually contributed to increased efficiency of enforcing judgments.

111. A substantial percentage of judges and prosecutors reported having no information on the
enforcement process in cases they worked on. This percentage has increased by 6% compared to
2009 (from 32% to 38%). (Figure 1.2.1)

112. Judges and prosecutors who did evaluate the situation with regard the enforcement were
more likely to be satisfied than dissatisfied: about one third of judges and prosecutors were satisfied
with judgment enforcement, while one in five judges and 14% of prosecutors were dissatisfied. In
contrast to providers of judicial services, a higher percentage of lawyers tend to be dissatisfied with
judgment enforcement (55%) than satisfied (41%) (Figure 1.2.1)

113. Compared to 2009, according to prosecutors and lawyers, the situation is improved at least
somewhat: 5% more prosecutors were satisfied with judgment enforcement, while the percentage of
satisfied lawyers has increased by 11%. (Figure 1.2.1)

114. According to data reported by court users whose cases at the time of the survey had a final
judgment that was rendered and enforced, the situation regarding judgment enforcement has
improved somewhat only in business cases. The percentage of enforcing judgments within legal
deadline, as compared to 2009, has increased in business sector by 8% (from 80% to 88%). (Figure
1.2.2)

Law on Enforcement and Security of Court Judgments launched in 2011, than, in their opinion, this

of enforcing judgments, in 2013 only 27% of judges and 16% of prosecutors estimated that efficiency
was really increased owing to this law. (Figure 1.2.3)

1.3. Perceptions of caseload and comfort with working conditions of judiciary
service providers

Summary

116. Problems of judicial system efficiency are surely connected with working conditions of
providers of court services. According to judges and prosecutors their working conditions are far from
optimal:

        A majority of judges and prosecutors feel overburdened with their caseload, which in 2013
         sometimes numbered more than 1.000 cases, and even more than 10.000 cases with some of
         the judges.
        According to judges and prosecutors, the difference between actual caseload and optimal
         caseload has increased in comparison with 2009, so that actual caseload in 2013 was assessed,
         on average, as more than twofold in comparison with the optimal one.
        Judges and prosecutors were quite divided in their opinions about the effects of the system
         of assignment of the cases on the efficiency of judges’ work, but the share of those who think
         that it improved the efficiency is just somewhat more than one of ten.
     Besides the excessive caseload, a considerable percentage of judges and prosecutors are
         dissatisfied with the general organization of work, premises and equipment, and a salary, and
         satisfaction with working conditions has, in general, considerably decreased.

1.3.a Perceptions of caseload of judiciary service providers

117. A majority of the judges and prosecutors evaluated their caseload to considerably exceed
the optimal one, and the perceptions of being overburdened with caseload have increased in
comparison with 2009 by 11% with prosecutors, and 3% with judges (Figure 1.3.a1)

118. The difference between the actual caseload and the caseload which judges and prosecutors
perceive as optimal is considerable, and it even increased in comparison with 2009: according to
prosecutors the actual caseload in 2009 exceeded the optimal by 34% on average, and in 2013 by 52%;
according to the judges, the actual caseload in 2009 exceeded the optimal one by 44% on average,
and in 2013 by 60%. (Figure 1.3.a2)

119. According to data obtained in the survey, the number of cases that the judges worked on in
2013 was on average somewhat less than 600, and an average caseload of prosecutors was somewhat
below 300. In comparison with 2009 the caseload on average increased by 25% with judges and by
38% with prosecutors (Figure 1.3.a2)

120. The range of caseload, however, is extremely big among both judges and prosecutors. More
than half of judges and prosecutors reported to have been working on 600 cases at most in 2013, but
some, especially among judges, were extremely overloaded: 17% of judges and 7% of prosecutors
reported to have worked on between 1.000 and 5.000 cases, and 4% of judges mentioned to be
working on more than 5.000 cases (out of whose 2% reported to be working on even more than 10.000
cases). None of the prosecutors reported in 2009 to have worked on more than 1000 cases, while in
2013 7% reported to have worked on more than 1000 cases. (Figure 1.3.a3)

121. Judges and prosecutors were quite divided in their opinions about the effects of the system
of assignment of the cases on the efficiency of judges’ work, but the share of those who think that
it improved the efficiency is just somewhat more than one of ten. 30% of judges reported that the
system did not affect efficiency, yet an equal number (30%) reported that it reduced efficiency. A
substantially smaller percent think that it boosted the efficiency (15%). In comparison to 2009, the
share of judges who think that the system reduced the efficiency has increased by 8%. Among the
prosecutors, 28% were of the opinion that the system of assignment of the cases did not affect the
efficiency, 19% that it reduced efficiency, and only 12% that it boosted the efficiency. Interesting

1.3.b Perceptions of working conditions of judiciary service providers

122. A substantial share of judges and prosecutors perceive their working conditions to be far
from optimal. Most judges and prosecutors were satisfied with cooperation with other sectors and
with organization of work in their own sector, but the percentage of the satisfied decreases
considerably with regard to organization of work in general, premises and equipment, as well as
amount of salary. More than 40% of judges and prosecutors were dissatisfied with organization of
work in general, with premises and equipment, and with amount of salary. While judges are least
satisfied with amount of salary (48% are dissatisfied), prosecutors are extremely dissatisfied with
premises and equipment (74%are dissatisfied). (Figures 1.3.b1 and 1.3.b2)

123. Compared to 2009, satisfaction with working conditions has decreased on all aspects, with
the exception of judges’ satisfaction with cooperation with administrative sectors that stayed at the
same level. Increase of dissatisfaction is especially striking among prosecutors. The percentage of
those satisfied with premises and equipment has decreased by 30%, and percentage of the satisfied
with amount of salary and organization of work in general has decreased by more than 20% (Figure

124. As for satisfaction with working conditions gender-wise, the only difference between men
and women was shown regarding amount of salary. Women are a lot less likely to be satisfied with
their salary than men, and this difference is greater among prosecutors than among judges: 13% of
women judges less than men judges are satisfied with their salary, while 19% of women prosecutors
less than men prosecutors are satisfied with their salary. (Figure 1.3.b5)

125. On the other hand, however, a great majority of men and somewhat less women, both
among judges and prosecutors, believe that men and women in their profession have equal income.
This opinion share 89% of men judges and 81% women judges, and 88% of men prosecutors and 80%
of women prosecutors. As for the percentage that considers income unequal, almost all women
believe that this difference is at the expense of women, while men are divided in this opinion. (Figure

126. With regard the chances for professional promotion, however, differences between men
and women are a lot more visible, especially among prosecutors. Although, similar to the case of
income, most women and men believe that they have equally chance of being promoted, the
percentage of those who share this attitude is much lower and differences between perceptions of
men and women are more visible: 18% of men judges and prosecutors believe that women have better
chances to be promoted, while 19% of women judges and 31% of women prosecutors believe that
men have better chances to be promoted. (Figure 1.3.b7)

2. QUALITY OF JUDICIARY SERVICES DELIVERED

2.1 Legal quality of court decisions

2.1.a Estimated percentage of the cases appealed to a higher court after the first instance
judgment was rendered

127. According to users of court services, circa one third of first-instance proceedings end up with
appeal. According to data reported by users of the court services, around one third of court
proceedings with the general public, where first instance judgment was rendered between January
2011 and November 2013, were appealed, and 38% in the case of the business sector. In comparison
with cases, where first instance judgment was rendered in the period starting January 2007 up to the
end of 2009, the percentage of appeals decreased by 3% with the general public, while it increased
by 5% with the business sector. (Figure 2.1.a1)

128. Decision to file an appeal was found to be related to a party’s perception of the fairness of
the trial: citizens who evaluated the trial to be fully fair filed an appeal substantially less frequently in
spite of the fact that the judgment was not in their favor. (For more detail see section 2.3.a)

129. The appeals were most frequent in the civil cases (37%), then in criminal cases (29%), and
the least frequent in misdemeanor cases (19%). But while the percentages of appeals reported in the
survey in 2013 have decreased with criminal and civil cases, it has increased with misdemeanor cases

130. The estimated percentage of appealed judgments reported by court providers are, on
average, quite close to those reported by court users: 39% according to judges estimates of the cases
they worked on in the last 12 months, and 36% according to prosecutors estimates. In comparison to
2009, on average, the percentage of appealed cases reported by judges did not change, while the
percentage reported by prosecutors decreased by 7%. (Figure 2.1.a3)

131. On the other hand, substantially higher percentages of appealed cases were found, on
average, with judges who worked in Criminal and Civil departments, than with the general public who
had a criminal or civil case in the court. According to judges’ estimates, around half of the criminal
cases as well as civil cases were appealed, while, as shown above, 29% of court users with criminal
cases reported the case to have been appealed, and 37% with civil cases. On the other hand, based
on information obtained from the judges who worked on misdemeanor cases, average percentage of
appealed cases was somewhat lower than the percentage obtained from members of the general
population who were a party in misdemeanor proceedings – according to judges’ estimates, an appeal
was lodged in 12% of misdemeanor cases, while 19% of users stated that the their case was appealed.

132. Finally, in comparison to users of the court services, as well as providers, lawyers reported
a much higher percentage of cases they worked on in 2009 and 2013 to have been appealed.
According to lawyers, out of the cases they worked on, on average, as high as 70% of cases were
appealed (in 2009 as well as in 2013). But the lawyers’ estimate is in accordance with the finding that
people more frequently decide to file an appeal if they hired a private lawyer, than if they represent
themselves. Among the appealed cases, 74% were cases in which a private lawyer was hired, and 24%
the cases in which people represented themselves; among the cases which were not appealed, 52%
were cases in which a private lawyer was hired, and 45% were cases in which people represented
themselves. (Figure 2.1a5)

133. According to data reported by court users, the higher court most frequently upheld the
judgment (in around 40% of cases), but in 28% of cases with the general public, and 23% with the
business sector the judgment was overturned and a retrial was ordered. (Figure 2.1.b1)

134. In comparison to court users, judges reported substantially smaller percentage of cases in
which retrial was ordered, while the estimates of prosecutors were in accordance with court users.
According to judges, on average, in 2013 the retrial was ordered in 14% of cases (similar in 2009), and
according to prosecutors, in 29% of cases (similar in 2009). (Figure 2.1.b2)

135. According to estimates of lawyers, the percentage of cases they appealed and in which
retrial was ordered was again higher than those reported by users and providers of the court
services. On average, lawyers estimated that 36% of cases they have appealed in 2013 were referred
back and the retrial was ordered (similar n 2009).

136. Finally, the court users with experience with court cases are divided in their trust of the
appellate system. The trust is higher with members of the business sector (57% have trust) than with
the general public (48% have trust). In comparison to 2009, trust in the appellate system has
somewhat increased. (Figure 2.1.b3)

2.2 General quality of court services

2.2.a Perception of the quality of justice sector services

Summary

137. Perceptions of users and providers of the overall quality of the court services are noticeably
different. Users - the general public and business sector, as well as lawyers, evaluate quality as rather
low (or average at best), while providers (judges and prosecutors) evaluate it as quite high (or average
at worse). The views became somewhat closer in 2013 in comparison with 2009, as positive
perceptions among users somewhat increased, and perceptions of providers became more negative -
but the gap is still huge. Personal experiences with court services are more positive than the overall
impressions of the quality of the justice sector, and in the case of the general public, the overall
impressions of the quality are more positive with people with experience with court cases as well. But
while overall impressions of the quality of the justice sector become more positive, the evaluations of
the quality of court service in the specific case one participated in did not change over time.

138. Users and providers of court services have drastically different perceptions of quality of
work of the judicial system. The users – general population and business sector, as well as lawyers,
evaluate the quality of the judicial system as rather low (or average in the best case), while providers
of court services (judges and prosecutors) evaluate the quality of the same services as rather high (or
average in the worst case). The most striking difference in evaluations of the quality of the court
services was found between service providers and lawyers. Half of the judges and prosecutors
evaluated the quality of court services as high, and less than 10% as low, while in the case of lawyers
it is completely the opposite. General public and business sector evaluations are closer to lawyers, but
more positive. (Figure 2.2.a1)

139. Overall impressions of the quality of the general public with experience with court
proceedings are more positive than the impressions of the general public without such experience.
But, interestingly enough, it is vice versa in the case of the business sector. Almost half of the
members of business sector with experience with court cases evaluated the general quality of court
services as low, and only 15% as high, while one third of those without such experience perceived the
quality as low, and 23% as high. (Figure 2.2.a1)

140. On the other hand, members of the business sector with experience with court cases, similar
to the general public with such experience, evaluated much better the quality of court service in the
proceedings they participated in than the quality of justice sector services in general. Quite
substantial differences were found in evaluations of the overall quality of the justice sector and the
quality delivered in the specific court case one participated in. While around one third of the general
public as well as members of the business sector evaluated the quality of court service in their specific
case as high, and approximately the same number as low, only 18% of the general public and 15% of
the members of the business sector evaluated the overall quality of the justice sector as high, and
over 40% as low. (Figure 2.2.a2)

141. Not surprisingly, the evaluations of the quality of judicial work in a court case one
participated in are related to the outcome of the trial: citizens whose judgment was in their favor
were more satisfied with the quality of judicial work. But judgment was not the closing criterion:
around one third of those whose judgment was in their favor evaluated delivered quality as low, and
about a fourth of those whose judgment was not in their favor evaluated the quality as high (Figure

142. General impressions of the quality have somewhat improved with court users in the last
four years, and again, more positive gains were found with members of the general public with
experience with court proceedings than with those without such experience, and vice versa in the case
of the business sector. (Figure 2.2.a4)

144. From the point of view of different types of cases, the least satisfied with the quality of
judicial work are people with experience in criminal cases (each fifth evaluated the quality as high),
while the most satisfied are people who participated in the civil cases (37% evaluated the quality as
high). No changes in evaluations of the quality were found before and after the implementation of the
reforms in 2010 with people who participated in criminal or civil cases, while the percentage of

145. Finally, evaluations of the quality became more negative with service providers, as well as
with lawyers. In 2013, in comparison with 2009, the percentage of court service providers who
evaluated the quality of court services as high has decreased by 11% with judges and by 15% with
prosecutors. The positive evaluations among lawyers in 2013 stayed as low as in 2009, while the
percentage of lawyers who evaluated the quality as low, increased by 11%. (Figure 2.2.a7)

2.2.b Perceived reasons why quality of work in justice sector was not higher

146. Court users most frequently named three reasons why the quality of court service in the
specific case one participated in was not higher: poor job done by the judge, poor organization, and
bad laws. Other listed reasons (poor job done by prosecutor, lack of staff, contempt of court, improper
conduct and non-fulfillment of obligations to the court by the parties in the proceedings, poor working
conditions, poor infrastructure) were chosen by less than 5% of court service users (with the exception
of lack of staff which was selected by 7% of members of the business sector). In comparison to 2009,
the percentage of the general public who named the bad laws as the main reason increased by 10%
(from 15% in 2009 to 25% in 2013), while the percent of those who selected the poor job done by
judge slightly decreased (from 31% to 28%). (Figure 2.2.b1)

Note: Question: Which of the following would you identify as the main reason explaining why you did not rate the quality of
judicial work more highly? Base: general public and business sector with experience with court cases who evaluated quality
of court service in that specific case less than high (68% of general population and 67% of business sector in 2009, and 68%
of general public and 66% of business sector in 2013)

147. The reasons lying behind the assessments of the quality of judicial services as less than high
varied across judges, prosecutors and lawyers, and more agreement among the three groups of legal
professionals was found across time (similarity in trends) than in the frequency of selection of each
particular reason as an obstacle to the higher quality of court services. Unclear laws, along with the
lack of staff, were the reasons most frequently named by judges: 21% of judges selected lack of staff
and the unclear laws as the main reasons why the quality of judicial work was not higher. For
prosecutors, lack of staff is the predominant reason: 37% of prosecutors selected this reason as the
main one, while only 9% opted for unclear laws. On the other hand, lawyers most frequently selected
poor organization (29%), followed by unclear laws (19%), while the lack of staff was named by only
11%. Other reasons (lack of opportunity for additional education and training, poor coordination of
judicial bodies, poor professionalism and preparedness of legal representatives, lack of regulations
pre-empting contempt of court, improper conduct and non-fulfillment of obligations to the court)
were mentioned by a smaller percentage of the court service providers (between 4% and 8%). (Figure

Note: Question: Which of the following reasons that explain why the quality of work was not higher would you select as the

148. In comparison with 2009, importance of some reasons decreased in 2013 (unclear laws, lack
of regulations), while the importance of other reasons increased (lack of staff, poor infrastructure).
In comparison to 2009, the frequency of naming the lack of staff as the reason for reduced quality
increased with all three groups. The increase is especially noticeable in the cases of judges: 13% of
judges selected lack of staff before the implementation of reforms in 2010, and 21% in 2013, while in
the case of prosecutors it was 32% and 37% (respectively), and in the case of lawyers 6% and 11%
(respectively). Some decrease in frequency of naming the unclear laws was also found with all three
groups; 25% of judges, 16% of prosecutors, and 25% of lawyers named unclear laws in 2009, while it
was 21%, 9%, and 19% in 2013 (respectively). Frequency of naming poor organization increased with
judges and prosecutors (from 7% to 12% among judges, and from 5% to 9% among prosecutors), and
lack of regulations pre-empting contempt of court decreased (from 12% to 9%among judges and from
8% to less than 1% among prosecutors). The frequency of selecting poor working conditions and poor
infrastructure increased among prosecutors (from 10% to 15% and from 8% to 14%, respectively),
while the percent of judges who selected these reasons stayed the same.

2.2.c Perception of the quality of the administrative services of the court related to court
proceedings

149. Perception of quality of administrative services of the court pertaining to the given court
case has improved in comparison with 2009. Members of the general population and business sector
who had to complete some administrative task related to their court case were more satisfied with
the quality of court administrative services, than with quality of court work related to the court
proceedings. A majority of the users of court administrative services were satisfied the quality of
administrative services, and satisfaction increased after the reforms in 2010. (Figure 2.2.c1)

Note: Question: How satisfied were you with the efficiency of the court administrative service? Efficiency entails no waste of
time and the fast and quality completion of the task? Scale from 1 to 4: dissatisfied=1,2 Satisfied=3,4 Base: General public
and business sector who had to complete some administrative tasks relevant to their case in the court. General public, those
who complete the administrative tasks themselves (General public: 27% of population with court experience 2009, and 25%
2013; Business sector: 52% with court experience 2009 and 48% 2013)

150. However, the increased satisfaction reported in 2013 was hardly due to increased efficiency.
The number of visits to the courthouse needed to accomplish the task did not change before and after
the reforms launched in 2010. Members of the general public reported that, on average, they had to
go to the courthouse 4 to 5 times to complete the task, and members of business sector, 3 times. The
average time spent in the courthouse (every time one came to complete the task) was somewhat
reduced based on data reported by the general public (from 45 minutes to 39 minutes, on average),
but it stayed the same based on data reported by members of the business sector (between 40 and
44 minutes on the average).

2.3 Fairness, impartiality and integrity

2.3.a Perception of the fairness of justice sector

Summary

151. General perceptions of the fairness of justice sector are mainly positive with all surveyed
groups, but a substantially higher percentage of court service providers than court services users and
lawyers evaluated justice sector as fair. Perceptions between users and lawyers on one side, and
providers on the other, became somewhat closer in 2013 compared to 2009 as positive perceptions
among users and lawyers somewhat increased, while perceptions of judges became somewhat more
negative, and perceptions of prosecutors have not changed - but the gap is still quite high. Users with
experiences with court services have more positive opinions about the fairness in that specific case
than about the fairness of the justice sector in general, and in these general perceptions of the fairness
there is no difference between users with and without experience with court cases. But while overall
impressions of the fairness of justice sector become systematically more positive among the users
(either with or without experience with court cases), the evaluations of the fairness of court service
in the specific trial one participated in somewhat improved with general public, but did not change
with business sector. Attitudes towards the fairness of the trial are influencing the decision to file an
appeal. Out of those whose judgment was not in favor, an appeal was filed by 8% of general public
and 6% of business sector among those who felt their trial was fully fair, while it was filed by 63% of
general public and 63% of business sector among those who felt that their trial was not fair.

152. The majority of members of all target groups shared the opinion that the judicial system
was fair, although providers of court services evaluated the fairness with considerably more positive
grades than users of court services and lawyers. The most striking difference in evaluations of the
overall fairness was found between members of the general public and court services providers: While
the members of the general public are closely divided into those who evaluate the justice sector as
fair (52%), and those who view it as unfair (somewhat less than 50%), 80% of service providers
evaluate the judiciary sector as fair, and only 14% of judges and 17% of prosecutors see it as unfair.
Interesting enough, but lawyers' perceptions of the fairness of justice sector are more positive than
the views of general public, and quite similar to those of business sector. (Figure 2.3.a1)

153. In the general impressions about fairness, no differences were found between people with
and without experience with court cases. However, people with experience with court cases
evaluate the fairness of their own trial more positively that the fairness of the justice sector in
general (Figure 2.3.a2)

154. Not surprisingly, the evaluations of the fairness of one’s own trial are related to the
judgment. A substantially higher percentage of the members of the general public evaluates that they
had a fair trial if the judgment was in their favor (87%), and more than half evaluate the trial as fully
fair. But still, a majority of those for whom the judgment was not in favor (66%) evaluates the trial as
fair, and each fifth as fully fair. (Figure 2.3.a3)

158. Perceptions of the fairness of the trial also have an influence on the decision to file an
appeal. An appeal was filed by substantially higher percentage of those whose judgment was not in
favor and who alongside felt that their trial was not fair (63%), than by those whose judgment was not
in favor but who felt that the trial was fully fair (8% of general public and 6% of business sector) .

to 2009, the percentage of appeals decreased by 4%. On the other hand, each fourth member of
business sector reported that they filed an appeal, and the percentage of appeals increased by 5%.

160. According to court users’ statements, appeals were most frequent in criminal cases , where
the users themselves lodged the appeal, and least frequent in misdemeanor cases. But in
comparison with 2009, the percentage of appeals in criminal and civil cases has somewhat decreased,
while it has increased in misdemeanor cases. (Figure 2.3.a9) These trends are in accordance with the

161. On the other hand, trends in perceptions of fairness of the justice sector varied among
professionals. In comparison with 2009, evaluations of fairness became more negative with judges,
did not change with prosecutors, and became more positive with lawyers. The percentage of judges
who feel that the justice sector is fair has decreased by 8%, but nevertheless, over 80% of judges and
prosecutors still evaluate justice sector as fair. On the other hand, the percentage of lawyers who
evaluated the justice sector as fair increased by 5%, but still lags substantially behind the one of judges
and prosecutors. (Figure 2.3.a10)

Summary

162. Legal professionals - court service providers, as well as lawyers, agreed that reasons for
incomplete fairness of the justice sector lie primarily in the overload and poor organization of the
justice system and poor legal provision. But while almost half of lawyers view politicization of the
justice sector as the reason for inadequate fairness, and one fifth name corruption as the reason. A
substantially smaller percentage of judges and prosecutors connects these matters with the problem
of fairness.

163. Legal professionals – providers of court services and lawyers, agree that reasons for lack of
fairness of judicial system is primarily the result of overburdened providers of services and poor
organization of judiciary, as well as poor legal regulations. Over 50% of judges and prosecutors, and
60% of lawyers named the overload and poor organization as the reason for inadequate fairness; more
than one third of judges and prosecutors, and 45% of lawyers named the poor legal provision. The
agreement was also found with regards to access of the judiciary to citizens: approximately one fifth
member of all three groups of legal professionals named it as the reason. (Figure 2.3.b1)

164. However, substantial differences were found between justice service providers and lawyers
with regards to politicization and corruption of the judicial system as the reasons why fairness of
justice sector was not complete. While 45% of lawyers see politicization of justice system as the
reason for inadequate fairness, only one fifth of the service providers share this opinion. While 43%
of lawyers think that corruption of the judicial system is the reason, only 4% of judges and 6% of
prosecutors share this opinion. (Figure 2.3.b1)

(26% in 2009 and 34% in 2013). On the other hand, the frequency of naming corruption somewhat
decreased with all three groups: by 2% with judges (from 6% to 4%), by 5% with prosecutors (form
11% to 6%), and by 6% with lawyers (from 25% to 19%). Access to the judiciary was the reason also
named by somewhat fewer judges (23% in 2009, and 17% in 2013), but by an increased percent of
lawyers (9% in 2009, and 18% in 2013).

2.3.c Equality of treatment of all citizens by judicial system

Summary

166. Quite a substantial percentage of the general public feel that the judicial system does not treat
all citizens equally and a considerable number of the members of the business sector shares the same
feelings with regards to the equality of treatment of the legal entities. In comparison with general
public, the number of judges and prosecutors who feel that all citizens are not treated equally is
considerably smaller, especially in the case of prosecutors. The amount of lawyers who think that all
citizens are not treated equally is between that of general public on one side and judges on the other,
but closer to the latter one.

167. A considerable percentage of the general population thinks that the judicial system does
not treat all citizens equally. According to citizens’ opinions, the unequal treatment is predominant
with regards to socio-economic status. As high as 61% of the citizens believe that people with different
socio-economic status are not equally treated. More than 40% think that different treatment is
provided to people dependent on their education and ethnicity; around one third believe that disabled
people are treated unequally, and that treatment differs dependent on age and place of residence;
29% feels that males and females are treated unequally. (Figure 2.3.c1)

168. Similar to the general public, judges and prosecutors see socio-economic status and
education as predominant areas of unequal treatment, but in a substantially smaller percentage;
25% of judges and 17% of prosecutors think that people are treated unequally dependent on their
socio-economic status, and 20% of judges and 12% of prosecutors believe that people are treated
differently in dependence of their education. Lawyers’ attitudes are between those of the users and
providers, but closer to the latter one. (Figure 2.3.c2)

169.      The most striking difference between lawyers on one side, and judges and prosecutors on
the other, is in perception of political affiliation as a factor of the unequal treatment of the citizens.
Almost all lawyers, 98%, think that citizens are treated differently dependent on their political
affiliation, while only 1% of judges and 1% of prosecutors share this opinion.

170. In 2013, in comparison with 2009, judges and prosecutors somewhat more frequently selected
the place of residence and gender as the characteristics based on which citizens were unequally
treated (5% more judges and 11% more prosecutors named place of residence, and 2% more judges
and 4% more prosecutors named gender). Judges also selected socio-economic status and education
somewhat more frequently, while prosecutors named disability, age, and ethnicity somewhat more
frequently.

171. When the inequality of the treatment of legal entities is in question, the views are similar
to those related to the inequality of the citizens. A considerable percentage of the members of the
business sector think that companies are unequally treated on several bases. More than half feel that
treatment varies dependent on the ownership structure of the company, and almost half think that
company size makes a difference. Almost one third believe that treatment varies dependent on the
company’s activity and its geographical location. (Figure 2.3.c3)

2.3.d Perception of corruption within the judiciary

Summary

172. A majority of the citizens (51%) think that corruption is present in the judiciary to a
considerable extent, and with regard to the presence of corruption, the judiciary is positioned as the
second highest among the state institutions (following the health system). Quite a substantial
percentage of the judges (41%), and majority of prosecutors (52%) agree that corruption is present in
judiciary, but, contrary to the citizens, only 3% of judges and 2% of prosecutors think that it is present
to a considerable extent. Lawyers’ views are somewhat closer to the views of court service providers
than to those of users. In 2013, in comparison with 2009, percentage of those who believe that
corruption is present in the judicial system decreased with all groups, but substantially more with
judges and prosecutors than with court users and lawyers, so the gap in opinions became even bigger

173. Contrary to the widely stated opinions that corruption is present in judiciary, (not surprisingly)
a relatively small percentage of court users reported that they personally resorted to informal means
in the course of proceedings, but according to lawyers, as high as 40% of their clients asked them to
use some informal means to influence the work of judge.

174. Opinions about the contribution of internal control to strengthening the integrity of the
judiciary were divided. A substantial part of court services providers think that internal control did not
exist at all, and out of those who think that it existed, just somewhat over half believe that it improved
the integrity. With regard the support to integrity coming from professional associations (Bar
Association, Association of Judges, and Association of Prosecutors), opinions are divided again, but in
general, the views are hardly very enthusiastic.

2.3.d.1 General perceptions of corruption within judiciary

175. According to citizens’ views, by the presence of corruption, the judicial system is positioned
as the second highest among the six state institutions. With the presence of corruption, the judicial
system follows the health system, and these are the only two institutions for which majority of the
citizens believe that corruption is present to a considerable degree (51% and 59% respectively). In
2013, as compared to 2009, the share of citizens who think that corruption is present in the judicial
system decreased (from 58% to 51%), while the percentage of those who think that corruption is
present in the health system increased (from 53% to 59%); so in 2013, the judicial system handed over
its leading position to the health system. (Figure 2.3.d1)

176. Similar to views of the general public, quite a substantial percentage of judges (42%), and
as high as 52% of the prosecutors agreed that corruption is present in judiciary. But great
discrepancy was found with regards to degree of its presence: while a majority of the citizens think
that corruption is present to a considerable degree, just 2% to 3% of court service providers share this
opinion. Opinions of lawyers are somewhat closer to that of court service users than to judges and
prosecutors. (Figure 2.3.d2)18 Finally, quite a substantial percentage of judges (51%) and a somewhat
less percentage of prosecutors (44%) think that corruption in the judiciary is not present at all, while
this opinion is shared by a substantially smaller percentage of court service users and lawyers. (Figures

180. According to lawyers, as high as 40% of their clients asked them to use some informal means,
and this percentage did not change in comparison to 2009. But 3% of lawyers also claimed that a judge
or a prosecutor offered them an agreement which implied some pecuniary advantage to make a
judgment in favor of their client (Figure 2.3.d6)




20For example, in the SOSAC (Social assessment survey Serbia) survey commissioned by the World Bank and conducted by
Ipsos Strategic Marketing in 2004, only 11 percent of citizens responded that they had to pay informally for health services,
while 88 percent stated that informal payments are occasionally, often, or very often present in the health system. For
more on socially desirable answering in surveys, see for example Roger Tourangeau, Lance J. Rips, and Kenneth Rasinski.

2.3.d.3 Perceptions of the roles of the internal control and professional association in strengthening
the integrity of judiciary

181. Providers of court services were quite divided in their opinions about the contribution of the
internal control to integrity of judiciary, but the share of those who think that it helped strengthen
the integrity is not encouraging.

182. Interesting enough, among providers of court services there was no agreement if the
internal control within judiciary existed at all. A majority of the judges and prosecutors think that
an internal control existed in the judicial system, but quite a substantial part thinks that it was not
present at all. Out of those who thought that internal control existed, just slightly more than half
believe that it contributed to the integrity of the judiciary. As for the lawyers, more than one third of
them are not aware if there was an internal control at all, and half believe that it was not. Out of those
who think that there was an internal control, less than half believe that it improved the integrity of
judiciary. But the percentage with this opinion has increased in comparison to 2009 by as high as23%.
(Figures 2.3.d7. and 2.3.d8).

Note: Question: To what degree did the internal control that existed contribute to the integrity of the judiciary? Base: Judges,
prosecutors and lawyers who believe that an internal control existed (Judges 2009 46%, 2013 56%; prosecutors 2009 61%,
2013 60%; lawyers 2009 14%, 2913 16%)

183. But a great majority judges, prosecutors and lawyers agreed that internal control is important
for strengthening the integrity of the judicial system (86%, 89% and 95% respectively).

184. With regard to the support to strengthen the integrity coming from professional
associations (Bar Association, Association of Judges, and Association of Prosecutors), opinions are
divided again, but in general, the opinions are hardly very enthusiastic. Slightly more than half of the
prosecutors believe that Associations of judges and Associations of prosecutors did help strengthen
the integrity of their professions, but only 17% share this opinion with regards to Bar association.
Judges perceive their association to be most helpful (51%), but only 36% think that Association of
prosecutors was helpful. Similar to prosecutors, the smallest percentage of judges thinks that the Bar
association was helpful (20%). On the other hand a majority of lawyers believe that none of the tree
association helped strengthening the integrity, but while in the case of Bar Association and Association
of judges this opinion is shared by slightly more than half of lawyers, over 60% think that the
Association of prosecutors was not helpful. In comparison with 2009, the Association of judges and
Association of prosecutors were perceived by judges and prosecutors as more supportive with regards
to the strengthening of the integrity, while lawyers expressed more positive opinions with this regard
about all three associations. (Figure 2.3.d9)

2.3.e Perception of court users with experience with court cases about courtesy and integrity of the
judge

Summary
185. A majority of the court users agreed that during court proceedings judges showed courtesy
and integrity. But still, a substantial part of the general public, and somewhat fewer members of the
business sector were not satisfied with judge’s attitude. It is noticeable that over 20% of court users
stated that they do not know if the judge was corrupt.

186. The general public as well as the members of business sector were most satisfied with
politeness of the judge (74% and 83% respectively). A somewhat smaller percentage reported that
the judge was impartial (67% of genera public and 69% of business sector) and that he/she generated
trust (66% and 70% respectively), as well as that the judge was efficient (64% of general public and
62% of business sector) and not corrupt ( 61% of general public and 65% of business sector). (Figures
2.3.e1 and 2.3.e2)

187. It is noticeable that respondents were most indecisive (or least ready to state their opinions)
with regards to corruption; as high as 22% of general public, and 24% of the members of the business
sector answered that they do not know if the judge was corrupted or not. (Figures 2.3.e1 and 2.3.e2)

2.3.f Perceived factors which undermine the integrity of the judicial system

189. According to court service providers, as well as lawyers, several factors undermined the
integrity of the judicial system. Judges and prosecutors think that integrity was primarily undermined
by sensationalist media reports (78% of judges and 80% of prosecutors), and by length of proceedings
(73% of judges and 77% of prosecutors). But a majority of judges and prosecutors also think that poor,
non-transparent personnel policy, political influence and inadequate penalties for corruption
undermine the integrity of the judicial system. More than half of judges think that selective initiation
of cases by prosecution weaken the integrity, while more than half of prosecutors think that these are
court decisions. While prosecutors agreed the least that integrity is harmed by selective initiations of
cases, the judges agreed the least that partiality of judges undermine the integrity. It is noticeable that
just somewhat more than one third of the court service providers agreed that corruption and lack of
fairness undermine the integrity of judicial system, and just somewhat more than one third of
prosecutors, and 28% of judges thought that the integrity was harmed by partiality of judges. (Figure
2.3.f1)

190. In comparison to judges and prosecutors, a considerably higher percentage of lawyers thinks
that all the listed factors undermine the integrity of judiciary. Similar to judges and prosecutors, 78%
of lawyers think that the media undermines the integrity of judicial system. However, lawyers think
that length of proceedings, poor, non-transparent personnel policy, and political influence are factors
which harm the integrity more than media. (Figure 2.3.f1)

191. In comparison to 2009, the percentage of opinions that corruption is undermining the
integrity decreased with all three groups (by 14% with prosecutors, by 9% with judges, and by 7%
with lawyers), while the opinions that political influence is harming factor decreased with lawyers (by
6%).

court services users and lawyers think that the partiality of judges did undermine the integrity of

2.4 Independence of the judicial system

Summary

192. Perceptions of the independence of the judicial system are quite different between providers
of the court services on one side, and users of the services and lawyers on the other. While court
users and lawyers mostly think that the judicial system is not independent, a majority of providers
think that it is independent. Still, one forth of the judges and each third of the prosecutors think that
the judicial system is not independent. The views became somewhat closer in 2013, as a portion of
those who think that the judicial system is independent somewhat increased among lawyers and users
of court services and decreased among judges and prosecutors - but disparity is still quite substantial.
Judges and prosecutors believe that media, followed by politicians and political parties jeopardize the
most the independence of judicial system.

193. Users of court services and lawyers on one side, and providers of court services on the other,
have considerably different perceptions of independence of the judiciary. Half of the members of the
general public and business sector and somewhat more lawyers (56%) think that the judicial system is
not independent, while just one third of the general public and somewhat more than 40% of the
business sector and lawyers believe that it is independent. On the other side, over 70% of judges and
over 60% of prosecutors believe that the judicial system is independent, while one forth of the judges
and each third of the prosecutors think that judicial system is not independent (Figure 2.4.a1)

194. Opinions came closer in 2013, because the percentage of users of court services and lawyers
who think that the judicial system is independent has increased, while the percentage of providers of
court services with such opinion has decreased, although the differences in opinion are still
considerable. In comparison with 2009, the opinions of the general public and business sector with
regards to the independence of the judiciary have noticeably improved, but the views that the judicial
system is not independent are still predominant. Interesting enough, in comparison with 2009, the
share of judges and prosecutors who think that the judicial system is independent decreased by 5%
and 10% (respectively). Nevertheless, the opinions that the judicial system is independent are still
predominant. On the other hand, similar to citizens, the portion of lawyers who think that the judicial
system is independent has increased, but a majority still share the opinion that the judiciary is not
independent. (Figure 2.4.a2 and 2.4.a3)

share of the responsibility as well: More than one third of judges and prosecutors think that specific
ministries and the government jeopardize the independence of the judiciary, one fifth think that
independence is jeopardized by big business, and slightly more that it is endangered by NGOs (Figure
2.4.a4)

196. In comparison with judges and prosecutors, lawyers assign more responsibility for
distressed independence to all listed institutions. Similar to judges and prosecutors, lawyers find the
media, political parties and politicians as the most responsible, but they allocate more responsibility
to politicians (77%) and political parties (75%), than to the media (65%). In comparison with judges
and prosecutors, lawyers also allocate more responsibility to specific ministries (63%), the government
(56%) and big businesses (50%). (Figure 2.4.a4)

197. Judges and prosecutors, as well as lawyers believe that politicians and political parties
jeopardize the independence of the judiciary to a much greater extent than the government
and specific ministries. However, as already noted above, still one third of judges and
prosecutors think that the government did jeopardize the judicial system’s independence,
and somewhat more than one third think that specific ministries jeopardized the
independence. Actually, just slightly more than one third of judges and 29% of prosecutors
think that the government did not jeopardize the independence of the judiciary at all, and
somewhat less than one third of judges and each forth prosecutor think that ministries did
not jeopardize the independence at all. On the other hand, around 10% of both judges and
prosecutors think that the government and ministries did jeopardize the integrity to a great
extent. (Figure 2.4.a5)

198. As opposed to court services providers, a majority of lawyers think that government
and ministries did jeopardize the integrity, and almost one fifth believe that they jeopardize
the independence to a great extent. Only 16% of lawyers think that government did not
jeopardize the independence of the judiciary at all, and 11% that ministries did not jeopardize
it at all. (Figure 2.4.a5)

In comparison to 2009, the changes of opinions about the government, ministries, politicians and
political parties influence on independence of the judicial system were shown only in the case of
lawyers. The percentage of lawyers who thought that these institutions have jeopardized the
independence of the judicial system has somewhat decreased. The opinions of judges and prosecutors
have not changed in comparison to 2009. (Figure 2.4.a6)

2.5 Relevant laws and their application

Summary

199. A majority of legal professionals agree that laws are often imprecise and ambiguous, and not
consistently fair and objective. Inconsistent interpretation of laws and inconsistent jurisprudence are
perceived as frequent problems in enforcement of laws

200. The Majority of legal professionals who participated in the survey agree that the laws are
often imprecise and unclear. Legal professionals are divided in their opinions about the precisions
and ambiguity of the laws, but an extremely small number think that laws are generally precise, clear
and unambiguous (4% of judges, 3% of prosecutors, and 5% of lawyers), and an even higher
percentage think that laws were imprecise and ambiguous to high extent (14% of judges, 17% of
prosecutors, and 17% of lawyers). The most frequent opinion is that laws were mostly (but not
completely) precise, clear and unambiguous. In comparison with 2009, this attitude has somewhat
decreased with prosecutors, but increased with lawyers. (Figure 2.5.1)

201. A somewhat higher percentage of judges and prosecutors think that laws are generally fair
and objective (13% of judges and prosecutors), and these percentages have increased in comparison
to 2009 (by 7% with judges, and 6% with prosecutors). But a majority opted for the option that laws
were mostly fair and objective (62% of judges, 66% of prosecutors, and 61% of lawyers). In comparison
to 2009, the percentage of lawyers with this opinion increased by 11%. (Figure 2.5.2)

202. Most of the judges, prosecutors and lawyers (over 80%) agree that inconsistent
interpretation of laws and inconsistent jurisprudence happen at least from time to time, if not often,
in the enforcement of laws. On the other hand, while a majority of lawyers think that selective
enforcement of the laws and non-enforcement of the laws also were the frequent problems, less than
one third of judges and prosecutors share this attitude. (Figure 2.5.3)

203. From the point of views of lawyers things are improving in comparison to 2009, while from
the point of view of judges and prosecutors the changes are sporadic, and rather in the negative
direction. While lawyers estimate that all four problems happen somewhat less often in 2013 than in
2009 (Figure 2.5.4), somewhat more judges (3%) think that selective enforcement of law is the
frequent problem, and somewhat more prosecutors think that inconsistent jurisprudence (6%) and
non-enforcement of the laws (8%) are the problems.

reasons for low quality of the court service delivered in the proceeding they participated in.

2.6 Public trust and confidence

Summary

205. The judicial system is one of the least trusted institutions. Only 26% of the citizens really trust
the judicial system. (Figure 2.6.1)

206. The judicial system is one of the institutions which the public trusts the least. Only 26% of
citizens report that they trust the judicial system. In comparison to 2009, trust in the judicial system
has increased by 7% (from 19% to 26%), but the increased trust was shown with regards to other state
institutions too (with exception of health system). (Figure 2.6.1)

207. The trust in the judicial system has increased among citizens with and without experience
with court cases, but somewhat more with those with experience (10% and 6% respectively). So,
while in 2009 somewhat more people without experience showed trust in the judiciary, the two
groups became closer in 2013 (Figure 2.6.2)

208. According to citizens’ views, the whole variety of factors undermines the trust in the judicial
system. Over 80% selected length of proceedings, corruption, political influence, inadequate penalties
for corruption, and poor, non-transparent personnel policy. Over 70% named content of court
decisions, lack of fairness, and selective initiations of the cases. Finally, 70% named the sensationalist
media reports. In comparison to court service providers’ estimates of the factors undermining
integrity of judicial system (as shown above, Section 2.3.f), citizens allocate more responsibility for
reduced trust to all of the factors, with the exception of the media. While sensationalist media reports
were the most frequently named factor by judges and prosecutors (78% and 80%), it was the least
frequently selected by the citizens (70%)

2.7 Perceptions about the role of media in creating the image of judiciary

Summary

209. Legal professionals view media as highly responsible for the negative image of the judicial
system. A substantial percentage of judges and prosecutors as well as of lawyers share the attitude
that the media, as a mechanism of external control, has negative influence on integrity of the judicial
system, and that, in general, the media generates a negative image of the judiciary. This attitude is
the least shared among the citizens. Citizens are divided in their opinions about the role of media in
creating the image of the judicial system, but most frequently (36%) they think that the image created
by the media is objective.

210. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers consider the media highly responsible for the negative
public perception of the judicial system. As already shown above (sections 2.3.f and 2.4.a), according
to legal professionals (judges, prosecutors and lawyers), the media are one of the main factors (if not
the main one) that jeopardize the integrity as well as the independence of the judicial system. A great
majority of judges (75%) and prosecutors (75%), and more than half of lawyers (55%) also believe that
the media, as a mechanism of external control, had negative influence on the integrity of judicial
system. In comparison with 2009, these attitudes did not change with judges, and even somewhat
increased with prosecutors and lawyers (Figure 2.7.1)

3. ACCESS TO JUDICIAL SERVICES

3.1 General perception of accessibility of judicial system

Summary

213. A majority of the users of court services, with the exception of the general public with
experience with court cases, think that the judicial system was in general accessible to citizens, but
users as well as lawyers, still evaluate court services as less accessible than providers. The difference
in perceptions of accessibility of the judicial system between users and providers of court services is
especially noticeable in the case of users the general public with experience with court cases - while
less than half of them view the judicial system as accessible to all citizens, over 70% of court service
providers share this opinion. The views between the users and providers of court services became
somewhat closer in 2013 in comparison with 2009, as perceptions of providers became more negative,
but the gap is still quite large. The gap is bigger with users with experience with court cases since their
opinions are more negative and have not changed over time, while the opinions of users without
experience have somewhat improved. Users and providers of court services agree that the judicial
system is hardly accessible to citizens in terms of costs (primarily in terms of lawyer costs, and then
court costs), but mostly accessible in terms of information, geographical distance of the courthouse
and courthouse layout.

214. Most users of court services consider the judicial system generally accessible to citizens, but
this opinion is shared by a significantly lower percentage of users than of providers of court services.
A majority of the users, with the exception of the general public with experience with court cases,
think that the judicial system was in general accessible to citizens. However, positive impressions are
somewhat less present with users with experience with court cases, than with users without such
experience. The most negative perceptions are found with members of the general public with court
experience, among which somewhat less than half have positive views (48%), and almost the same
percentage have negative impressions (46%). Perceptions of members of the business sector are
somewhat more positive than perceptions of the general public, but similar to the general public,
perceptions of members of the business sector with experience with court cases are less positive than
perceptions of those who did not have this experience (55% and 61% respectively). Perceptions of
lawyers are similar to perceptions of users, while substantially higher percentage of judges (78%) and
prosecutors (71%) think that the judicial system was accessible to all citizens. (Figure 3.1.1)

215. In comparison with 2009, the impressions of users without court experience have somewhat
improved, but the impressions of users with experience with court cases did not change. On the
other hand, perceptions of court services provides became substantially less positive, and so
somewhat closer to perceptions of users. The percentage of court services providers who think that
the judicial system was accessible to all citizens decreased by 10 points with judges (from 88% to 78%),
and by 15 points with prosecutors (from 86% to 71%). The percentage of lawyers who think that the
judicial system is accessible to all citizens substantially decreased as well, but their views are closer to
perceptions of the users without experience with court cases, than to users with this experience.

216. Users of judicial services among general population view costs of proceedings as the biggest
problem of accessibility of the judicial system to citizens. This opinion is substantially more present
with users with experience with court cases, than with users without this experience: 71% of users
with court experience think that the judicial system is not accessible to citizens in terms of lawyers’
expenses and 61% in terms of court-related costs. This opinion is shared by a substantially smaller
percentage of users without experience (58% and 51% respectively). On the other hand, a majority
of users finds the judicial system accessible in terms of information, geographical distance of
courthouse and courthouse layout. (Figure 3.1.4)

217. Costs are perceived as the biggest barrier to accessibility of the judicial system to companies
as well. However, in comparison to the general population, a smaller percentage of members of the
business sector think that the judicial system is inaccessible to their company due to expenses either
related to lawyer or to court (somewhat over 40%). A minor share of members of the business sector
views access to information, geographical distance of courthouse and courthouse layout as a problem.

218. Providers of judicial system services agree with the users that costs of court proceedings are
the biggest obstacle to accessibility of the court system to the citizens. In comparison with the
citizens who have experience with a court case, an even higher percentage of the judges (75%) and
prosecutors (85%) think that attorney-related costs are a barrier to accessibility of the judicial system.
On the other hand, a smaller percentage of the judges than the citizens who have experience with a
court case evaluate that court expenses are a barrier to accessibility of judicial system (50%). As
regards the prosecutors, they agree more with the citizens in that respect (65%). Finally, not
surprisingly, higher percentage of attorney see the court-related costs as problem with court
accessibility (76%), than attorney-related costs (70%). (Figure 3.1.6)

219. Interesting enough, court services providers estimate the services of the institution they
work for as more accessible to all citizens than the same institution in general: 78% of judges
estimated courts in Serbia as accessible to all citizens, but 89% estimated the court they work for as
accessible; 80% of prosecutors estimated prosecution offices in Serbia as accessible, but 87%
estimated the prosecution office they work for as accessible. In the same way, higher percentage of
judges estimated courts in Serbia as accessible than prosecution offices (78% and 66% respectfully),
and vice versa in the case of prosecutors (80% estimated prosecution offices in Serbia as accessible,
and 71% courts in Serbia as accessible). Lawyer’s views are closer to judges - 10% more lawyers
perceive courts as accessible to citizens than prosecution offices. (Figures 3.1.7)

3.2.a Perceptions of general public about the accessibility of judicial system with regards to costs

221. Costs associated with court cases are evaluated by the general population as the biggest
barrier to accessibility of the judicial system. As shown above (Figure 3.4), the biggest burdens for
the citizens are attorney-related expenses, followed by court-related costs. Let’s now consider
changes in perception of these costs between the citizens with experience and the citizens without
experience with court cases in 2009 and in 2013.

222. A higher percentage of the citizens with and without experience consider court case-related
costs unaffordable in 2013. In comparison with 2009, the percentage of the citizens with experience
with a court case who think that lawyer-related expenses make the judicial system inaccessible to
them has increased by 7%, while the percentage of the citizens who consider court-related costs as a
barrier to accessibility of the judicial system has not changed. On the other hand, the percentage of
the citizens without experience with a court case who think that court-related costs make the judicial
system inaccessible to them has slightly increased (by 4%), while the percentage of those who think
that lawyer-related costs are a barrier has not changed in 2013 as compared to 2009. (Figure 3.2.a1)

223. High costs of the litigations are the most frequently mentioned reason why the high
percentage of the citizens think that, if they had a dispute which they think could be settled in court,
they most probably would decide against taking this dispute to the court. In a survey conducted in
January 201423, as much as 63% of the citizens stated that, if they had a dispute which they think
should be settled in the court, they would decide against such action (or would at least have a great
dilemma). A majority of these citizens, 65%, mention the high costs as one of the top three reasons
for not taking the dispute to the court. For the sake of comparison, the second most frequently
mentioned reason is the excessive duration of court proceedings, which is mentioned by a
considerably smaller percentage of the citizens, 49%. (Figure 3.2.a2)

pursuing the case in the court. It is followed by distrust in the court system in general and long duration
of proceedings, which was named as the main reasons by substantially less people (18% and 14%
respectively). In comparison to 2009, the number of people who named costs as the main reason has
increased for 12%. (Figure 3.2.a3)

3.2.b Perceptions of members of the business sector about the accessibility of the judicial system
with regards to costs

225. Similar to the general population, as already shown above (Figure 3.1.5), representatives of
the business sector also consider high costs of litigations as the biggest barrier to accessibility of the
judicial system to businesses.

226. In comparison with the year 2009, the percentage of representatives of the business sector
who state that the judicial system is not accessible to them because of attorney-related and court-
related costs has increased considerably, particularly in the case of representatives of the business
sector who do not have experience with court cases. The percentage of business sector
representatives without experience with court cases who stated that the judicial system is inaccessible
to their company because of costs has increased by as much as 20% (with regard to both lawyer-
related costs and court-related costs), while the increase is smaller in the case of representatives of
the business sector with court experience: 12% in case of attorney-related expenses, and 7% in case
of court-related costs. (Figure 3.2.b1)

dispute they thought should be settled in the court but decided against such action (30% in 2009
and 24% in 2013), only 10% in 2013 and 7% in 2009 name costs as the main reason for not pursuing
the case in the court. Duration of proceedings was named most often as the main reason for such

3.2.c Perceptions of the general public and business sector about the affordability of courts in the
specific case the court users participated in

Summary

228. A majority of users of judicial services who have experience with a court case state that costs
of their specific case was too high. In criminal cases the biggest share in costs were attorney-related
expenses, in civil cases the costs are equally distributed between attorneys and court-related costs,
while in misdemeanor cases, and in the business sector the share of court-related costs is dominant.
A majority of the citizens, and more than one third of company representatives state that the cost of
court cases were an excessive burden for their budget, but the burden is perceived as considerably
smaller and costs as more reasonable if satisfaction with quality of proceedings is bigger.

229. Circa one half of the users of court services state that overall cost of their court case was too
high. It is interesting that, in comparison with 2009, the percentage of the users of judicial services
who evaluate these costs as excessive changed only in the case of citizens who had a misdemeanor
case: the percentage of the citizens who had a misdemeanor case who evaluate their costs as
excessive has increased by as much as 18% (from 36% to 54%). (Figure 3.2.c1).

230. According to the citizens, average total costs were circa 750 Euros in criminal and civil cases,
and around 140 Euros in misdemeanor cases (Figure 3.2.c2)24. In comparison with the costs reported
in 2009, the costs, on average, have been reduced in criminal and civil cases, with no change in
misdemeanor cases. On average, in criminal cases the costs have been reduced by 28%, and in civil
cases by 32%.

231. According to the data reported by representatives of the business sector, the costs of the
litigations of their companies were, on average, circa 1800 Euros. Although the costs reported in
2009 were, on average, somewhat higher in comparison to 2013, variation of reported data in 2009 is
high, so the conclusion that the costs have also been reduced in cases of business sector would not be
sufficiently reliable. (Figure 3.2.c2)

232. The range of reported costs in all types of court cases is rather big, as shown in Table 3.2.c1.
In criminal cases in 2013, 27% of the users of court services reported costs exceeding 500 Euros (15%
up to 1000 Euros, 8% up to 2000 Euros, 4% up to 4000 Euros, and 1% more than 4000 Euros). In civil
cases, 25% reported costs exceeding 500 Euros (15% up to 1000 Euros, 7% up to 2000 Euros, 2% up to
4000 Euros and 1% more than 4000 Euros). In misdemeanor cases 23% of the citizens reported costs
exceeding 100 Euros (14% up to 300 Euros, 3% up to 500 Euros, 3% up to 1000 Euros and 3% up to
2000 Euros). (Figure 3.2.c3)

obvious comparisons in spite that due to skewness of the distribution, means are somewhat unrealistic. For distribution of

233.     According to users of court services distribution of costs varies depending on the type of
case:
         -    In criminal cases about one half of total costs are the share of attorney-related expenses,
              and about one third of total costs are the share of court-related costs.
         -    In misdemeanor cases the biggest share in total costs are court-related costs, 62% (but in
              comparison with 2009 this share was reduced from 74% to 62%), while the share of
              attorney-related costs is just 12%;
         -    In civil cases attorney-related and court-related costs are evenly distributed (45% are
              attorney-related costs and 43% are court related costs, and this percentage was very
              similar to one reported in 2009);
         -    In court cases of the business sector somewhat more than a half of overall costs are the
              share of court-related costs, 53%, and 39% the share of attorney-related costs (in
              comparison with 2009 the share of attorney-related costs has somewhat increased).

234. A majority of the citizens state that costs of their court case were too big for their budget:
60% in criminal cases, 57% in civil cases and 53% in misdemeanor cases. In comparison with 2009, the
change has been recorded only in the case of the citizens who had a misdemeanor case, since a higher
percentage of them state that costs of their court case were a big burden for their budget. Compared
with the citizens, a smaller percentage of business sector representatives evaluate that costs of their
court case were a big burden for their company, but this percentage is still considerable, 38%. (Figure

235. It is striking, however, that the burden of these costs is perceived to be smaller, and the
costs themselves more favorable proportionally to satisfaction with quality of court case. Among
the citizens who claim that quality of their court case was low, 81% perceive the costs of their court
case as a big burden, and 75% claim that the costs were excessive, while among the citizens who
evaluated the quality of their court case as high, 38% claim that their costs were a big burden and 29%
claim that their costs were excessive. (Figures 3.2.c6 and 3.2.c7)

3.2.d Perceptions of court service providers and lawyers about the accessibility of the judicial
system to the citizens with regards to costs

236. Providers of court services agree with users that costs of court proceedings are the biggest
obstacle to accessibility of the court system t citizens (as already shown above, Figure 3.1.6).

237. In comparison with the year 2009, the percentage of respondents who think that the judicial
system is hardly accessible to the citizens because of costs has increased also among judges,
prosecutors and attorneys, and even considerably more than with the general population. In 2009
less than one third of the judges and prosecutors were of the opinion that court expenses were a
barrier to accessibility of the judicial system for the citizens, while in 2013 50% of the judges and 65%
of prosecutors share that opinion. In comparison to 2009, in 2013 as much as 24% more of judges and
prosecutors perceive attorney-related expenses as a problem in accessibility of judicial system; in case
of judges this percentage has increased from 51% to 75%, and in case of the prosecutors from 57% to
81%. Percentage of those who think that costs are a problem in accessibility of the judicial system to
the citizens has also increased considerably among the attorneys. It is interesting that the percentage
of the attorneys who consider attorney-related expenses as a problem has increased more (from 46%
to 70%) than the percentage of those who see court-related costs as a problem (from 61% to 76%).

3.3 Access to lawyers / representation

3.3.a Share of court users represented by a lawyer and by themselves

238. Despite the fact that the majority of citizens think that costs of court cases are a big burden
for them, according to the data reported in 2013, a majority of the citizens engaged a private
attorney in criminal and civil cases. According to the citizens, in criminal cases 53% hired the private
lawyer, the state assigned an attorney in 17% of cases, and in 30% of cases the citizens represented
themselves; in civil cases 65% hired a private lawyer, the state appointed an attorney in 2% of cases
and 33% of the citizens represented themselves. Misdemeanor cases are an exception, where 17% of
the citizens engaged a private lawyer and in 1% of the cases the state appointed the attorney, while
in more than 80% of cases citizens represented themselves. (Figure 3.3.a1)

239. In comparison with the year 2009, the number of users of private lawyers’ services was
increased or reduced, depending on type of case: a somewhat higher percentage of the citizens who
had a criminal case stated that the state assigned an attorney to them (17% against 5% in 2009), while
the percentage of the citizens who engaged a private lawyer has decreased (from 63% to 53%); in
misdemeanor cases percentage of the citizens who engaged a private attorney instead of representing
themselves has somewhat increased (from 9% to 17%), while in civil cases the contrary has taken
place, the percentage of the citizens who decided to represent themselves has increased (from 25%
to 33%). (Figure 3.3.a1)

Note: Question: Did a lawyer represent you in the proceedings? Base: General public with experience with court proceedings

240. A majority of the citizens decided to engage a private attorney because they realized that
they were not able to cope themselves with the process, but a considerable percentage of the
citizens did it out of conviction that the process will be finished faster and more easily with the help
of an attorney (31% in criminal cases, 42% in misdemeanor cases and 37% in civil cases). (Figure 3.3.a2)

3.3.b Citizens’ awareness of the organizations providing legal assistance free of charge

243. A great majority of citizens of Serbia, 83%, are not aware of any organization or institution
that provides legal assistance free of charge. Only 8% of citizens say that legal assistance is available
in municipalities, and 4% mention the ombudsman; a total of 1% mention NGOs, or civil associations,
or consumer associations. It is interesting that 1% mention even the Bar Association as an organization
providing legal assistance free of charge. Others (about 2%) mention unions, the Faculty of Law,
media, insurance companies and court. (Figure 3.3.b1)25

244. Finally, 3% of citizens say they have used free legal assistance and a great majority of these
3% (93%) were satisfied with it.

3.4 Access to information

3.4.a General perceptions of accessibility of the judicial system in terms of access to information

245. Most citizens (64%) and business sector representatives (76%) believe that information
about the court system is at least mainly available to them. Compared to 2009, there is even a
somewhat bigger proportion of business sector representatives who think that information is easily
available (Figure 3.4.a1)

246. An even bigger proportion of judges, prosecutors and lawyers than citizens think that
information about the court system is at least somewhat available to citizens. This opinion is shared
by the biggest proportion of judges, 87%, somewhat smaller proportion of prosecutors, 78%, and the
smallest proportion of lawyers, 70%. Compared to 2009, the proportion of prosecutors who think that
information is mainly available to citizens is reduced for 8%, the proportion of lawyers who share this
opinion is increased by 6%, while there is no change in case of judges. (Figure 3.4.a2)

3.4.b Perceptions of accessibility of information in the specific case the court users participated in

247. Similar to the general perception of availability of information, most citizens evaluated that
it was easy to obtain information about their particular court case. A substantial proportion of
citizens (with exception of misdemeanor cases), let their lawyer collect information, but most of those
who took part in collecting information were satisfied with how easily available it was. (Figure 3.4.b1)

248. Compared to 2009, however, there is a striking negative change in terms of perception of
availability of information in misdemeanor cases (for which citizens themselves usually collect
necessary information). The proportion of citizens with experience in misdemeanor cases who think
that it is hard to obtain information is increased for 17%, while the percentage of those who consider
it easy is reduced for 23%. (Figure 3.4.b1)

249. The proportion of those who say that it was easy to obtain information is reduced also in civil
cases (from 61% to 48%), but there is an increased proportion of those who let their lawyer collect
information (for 8%), so they couldn’t make this evaluation (from 25% to 33%). (Figure 3.4.b1)

3.4.c Sources of information citizens used to find out what they needed in their specific case

251. When searching for information about their case, citizens use several sources of
information, and the most frequently used sources of information vary depending on the type of
case. In criminal cases, the source of information is usually lawyer (44%), while official court sources
of information are used almost equally as unofficial (friends and media). As for misdemeanor cases,
unofficial sources of information prevail (50%), followed by official court sources (39%), while in civil
cases the lawyer and official court sources of information are used most frequently (34%). As for the
business sector, the lawyer is the prevailing source of information (63%), and somewhat less than half
of companies (47%) use official court sources. (Figure 3.4.c1)

3.5 Geographical / Physical access and comfort of the court building

3.5.a Perceptions of geographical access to courts

252. Most citizens (73%) and business sector representatives (85%) do not consider distance of
court building a problem. Compared to 2009, however, the proportion of those who think that the
court building is geographically accessible in 2013 is reduced in the case of citizens for 11%, and in the
case of business sector representatives for 5%. (Figure 3.5.a1)

253. The percentage of judges, prosecutors and lawyers who do not consider distance of the
court building a problem is also reduced compared to 2009, and even substantially more than in the
case of citizens and business sector representatives (for 24% in case of judges, for 38% in case of
prosecutors and for 27% in case of lawyers). So, while in 2009 a somewhat bigger portion of judges,
prosecutors and lawyers than citizens, assumed that distance of the court building was not a problem,
in 2013, compared with citizens, a lot smaller of a percentage of judges (65%) and lawyers (61%), and
especially prosecutors (46%) thought that it was not a problem for the citizens. (Figure 3.5.a2)

255. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers mainly agree that citizens do not have a problem with

3.6.a Perceptions of general public, business sector and legal professionals about the equality of all
citizens with regard to accessibility

256. More than 1/3 of citizens believe that the court system is not equally accessible to all. Most
citizens, 56%, consider the judiciary equally accessible to all citizens, regardless of their age, socio-
economic status, ethnicity, disability and language they speak. However, a significant percentage,
38%, believes that it is not equally accessible to all. (Figure 3.6.a1)

257. Business sector representatives have a similar opinion regarding equal accessibility of the
judicial system to all companies, regardless of their size, origin of capital and their ‘political
connections’. Most business sector representatives, 59%, consider the judicial system equally
accessible to all companies, regardless of these features, but a significant proportion, 35%, still does
not share this opinion. (Figure 3.6.a2)

258. Most judges, prosecutors and lawyers consider courts accessible to all citizens equally in
terms of finding their way in the courthouse, as well as in terms of availability of information.26 Even
80% of judges consider finding one’s way in the courthouse equally easy for all citizens, while this
opinion is shared by a somewhat smaller proportion of prosecutors (68%) and lawyers (69%). Only
18% of judges, but still more lawyers, 31%, and prosecutors, 29%, do not agree with this opinion.
Compared with 2009, however, the proportion of those who consider finding one’s way in the
courthouse equally easy for all is reduced somewhat in case of judges (for 9%) and lawyers (for 3%),
and substantially reduced in case of prosecutors (for 17%). (Figure 3.6.a3)




26Judges, prosecutors and attorneys were asked only the questions of equality regarding these two particular aspects of
accessibility of judicial system.

259. Most providers of court services and lawyers believe that information was equally available
to all citizens, but a considerable portion still does not share this opinion. As high as 75% of judges,
but a significantly smaller percentage of prosecutors, 63%, and lawyers, 57%, think that it was equally
easy for all citizens to obtain the information they needed in 2013. On the other hand, however, a
substantial part does not share this opinion: one in four judges, 30% of prosecutors, and 43% of
lawyers do not think that it was equally easy for all citizens to access information. Compared to 2009,
judges and prosecutors have a somewhat less positive opinion about availability of information to all
citizens (Figure 3.6.a4).

3.6.b Perceptions of older citizens, low educated citizens and citizens living in non-urban areas
about the accessibility of judicial services

260. Compared to the population average, citizens with low education (elementary school and
less) and citizens over 60 years of age perceive the judicial system as less accessible to them in all
aspects: in terms of costs, availability of information, distance of court building and finding one’s
way in the courthouse. If they were in a situation to decide whether to take a dispute to court or not,
90% of poorly educated citizens and 82% of the elderly would consider trial costs a problem (which is
24%, and 6%, respectively, more than population average regarding lawyer-related costs, and 26%,
and 5%, respectively, more in terms of court costs); 63% of the poorly educated and 58% of the elderly
stated that they would have a problem with finding necessary information (18% and 13%, respectively,
more than population average); 44% of the poorly educated and 40% of the elderly believe they would
have problems finding their way in the courthouse (17% and 13%, respectively, more than population
average), while 42% of the poorly educated and 36% of the elderly believe they would have problems

with distance of courthouse from their place of residence (15% and 9%, respectively, more than
population average). (Figure 3.6.b1)27

261. Citizens who live out of urban areas, compared to the population average, see more
problems in obtaining necessary information, finding their way in the courthouse and distance of
the courthouse. Most citizens who live out of urban areas, 53%, think that they would have problems
with accessing information (8% more than population average); 40% think they would have problems
finding their way in the courthouse (13% more than average), while 43% consider distance of a
courthouse a problem (16% more than population average). (Figure 3.6.b1)

262. As for gender differences regarding accessibility of court system, the only significant
difference between women and men was found in terms of lawyer-related costs. Considerably more
women 81%, than men, 71%, stated that lawyer-related costs would be a relevant issue for them when
making decision whether to take a dispute in court or not. This is also the only problem women
mentioned in higher percentage comparing to population average. Women mentioned in a somewhat
higher percentage than men the problem of finding their way in the court building, as well as the court
distance, but differences are relatively small (5% and 4%, respectively). (Figure 3.6.c.1)28

3.7 Perceptions about mediation

3.7.a Perceptions of general public and business sector about mediation procedure

263. Awareness of the mediation process, as an option for settling disputes, is rather low among
the court users with experience with court cases. Only 17% of citizens with experience in court cases
and somewhat more than a half of business sector representatives, 53%, know what mediation is.
Compared to 2009, awareness of the mediation process hasn’t changed in general population, while
it has somewhat increased among business sector representatives (from 46% in 2009, to 53% in 2013).

264. Most citizens and business sector representatives who have heard of mediation consider it
useful, but they are much more likely to think that it is just partly useful, than very useful. While
43% of citizens consider mediation partly useful, only somewhat more than a third, 36%, consider it
very useful. Business sector members also have different stands: 44% consider mediation only partly
useful, and 40% consider it very useful. (Figure 3.7.a2)

265. It is striking that, compared to 2009, the percentage of the general public who consider
mediation very useful has decreased by 15% (from 51% to 36%), while the percentage of those who
consider mediation not useful at all has increased by 7%. As for business sector members, changes

in attitudes towards mediations are less considerable as compared to 2009: the percentage of those
who consider mediation very useful has decreased by 6% (from 46% to 40%), while the percentage of
those who consider mediation not useful has not changed. (Figure 3.7.a2)

266. Finally, people who claimed to have had a dispute they thought should be settled in the
court but decided against such action rarely choose to settle the dispute by mediation procedure.
Only 1% of general population (out of those who had a dispute but decide not to settle it in the court
for any reason) opted to settle the dispute by mediation process, while in the business sector
mediation was chosen by only 2% in 2009, and by no one in 2013. A somewhat higher percentage
named other informal ways, and a considerably higher percentage opted for negotiating with the
other party. But a majority stated that their dispute was not settled at all. (Figure 3.7.a3)

Summary

267.      Judges and prosecutors are mainly ambivalent about the mediation process:
          About a half of judges and prosecutors consider mediation partly useful, and only about a
          third considers it very useful
         A substantial number of judges and prosecutors claimed that they are not well informed
          about the mediation process
          One in five judges and only one in twelve prosecutors have undergone mediation training
          Judges and prosecutors who had no training are much more likely to report that training
          would be just partly useful for them rather than very useful
         Only about one third of judges and prosecutors expect the new mediation system to increase
          efficiency of the judiciary, and even 43% of judges and 59% of prosecutors believe they do not
          have sufficient information to rate the influence of this new mediation system on efficiency
          of the judiciary

268. Attitudes of judges and prosecutors regarding usefulness of the mediation process are
similar to citizens’ attitudes: a great majority considers mediation useful, but those who share this
opinion are much more likely to think that it is just partly useful (47% judges and 50% prosecutors),
than very useful (33% judges and 32% prosecutors). On the other hand, however, unlike the citizens,
the percentage of prosecutors who consider mediation very useful is increased somewhat compared
with the year 2009 (from 25% to 32%); this percentage has slightly increase in case of judges as well
(from 31% to 33%), but the proportion of judges who consider mediation not useful has slightly
increase too (from 10% to 14%). (Figure 3.7.b1)

269. It is interesting, however, that only about a half of judges (53%) and less than a third of
prosecutors (28%) claimed to be well informed about mediation, and that this percentage has even
decreased in 2013, comparing to 2009 (for 10% in case of judges and for 13% in case of prosecutors).

270. One in five judges and only 8% of prosecutors reported in 2013 to have undergone
mediation training. Compared to 2009, the percentage of judges who did undergo training is reduced
for 9%. (Figure 3.7.b3)

Note: Question: Did you undergo training in mediation? Scale: 1.Yes 2. No. Base: total target population

271. Both judges who underwent training and those who didn’t, consider training useful (or
sufficient in the case of judges and prosecutors who underwent training). Somewhat more than a
half of judges (58%) and prosecutors (55%) who have undergone training say that this training was
sufficient, while others thought that they need better training. Most judges and prosecutors who did
not undergo the training also stated that training would have been useful to them, but they were more
likely to say that it would have been only partly useful (46% and 42% respectively), rather than very
useful (31% and 22% respectively). (Figure 3.7.b4)

272. Finally, judges and prosecutors are divided in their opinions about the new law that
stipulates the establishment of a completely new system of mediation. Only about one third of
                                                               105

judges (35%) and prosecutors (30%) expect the new system to increase efficiency of the judiciary, one
in five judges and one in ten prosecutors think that efficiency will be decreased, and even 43% of
judges and 59% of prosecutors stated that they still do not have enough information to be able to
estimate influence of this new system on efficiency of the judiciary (Figure 3.7.b5)

4. COURT ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

Summary

4.1. Overall perceptions of court administrative services

273. A great majority of users of the court administrative services are satisfied with the efficiency
and accessibility of court administrative service, and with regards to these two aspects the perceptions
of users and providers of the services are quite in agreement. With regards to quality and integrity
(absence of corruption) differences in perceptions between users and providers of administrative
services are large: substantially higher percentage of providers than users perceive the quality of the
services as high, and believe that corruption is not present in court administrative services.
Perceptions of users with regards to all four aspects have improved in comparison with 2009 (with
exception of perceptions of integrity among general public), while among providers of the services
positive perceptions of efficiency and accessibility have somewhat decreased, and positive
perceptions of quality and integrity have somewhat increased.

274. More than 70% of users of court administrative services were satisfied with the efficiency
of the service delivered and over 80% evaluated the accessibility of the service as high 29. The
agreements between users and providers in perceptions of these two dimensions are quite high, and
just somewhat higher percentage of providers was satisfied with efficiency provided by their sector
(82%). (Figure 4.1.1)

275. On the other hand, users are less satisfied with the quality30 of services - approximately four
in ten evaluate the quality of the service delivered as high. Differences in perceptions of the quality
between users and providers are huge, and almost 80% of providers of the services evaluated the
quality of the services as high. (Figure 4.1.1)

276. Huge incompatibility between users and providers of administrative services was found
with regards to perceptions of the presence of corruption as well. While a great majority of providers,
80%, stated that there is no corruption in administrative services, this opinion is shared by less than
one third of the general public, and 43% of members of the business sector. (Figure 4.1.1)




29All evaluations of the users of administrative services refer to the last administrative task which they performed. Somewhat

more than one half of users of administrative services from general population of the citizens stated that their last
administrative task referred to verification of documents and contracts. Since the number of users of other administrative
services (access to archive, registry desk, receptions and expedition of documents, giving evidence…) from the general
population was small, all of them were classified in the category “other”. All representatives of the business sector are sho wn
in one category since 80% of them stated that their last administrative task was verification of documents and contracts.

30However, evaluations of efficiency and accessibility on one side and quality and integrity on the other are not completely
comparable since the efficiency and accessibility were evaluated on 4 point scale, quality on 5 point scale, and presence of
corruption on 3 points scale. Substantial percentage of users evaluated quality as average. More in detail is presented
below in related sections

277. In comparison to 2009, users’ views of court administrative services are somewhat
improved with regards to all four dimensions. The only exception is perception of users among the
general public of the presence of corruption which did not change. (Figures 4.1.2 and 4.1.3).

278. On the other hand, among members of business sector, the positive change in perceptions
of corruption was the biggest improvement of all: the percentage of the users among the members
of the business sector who believe that there is no corruption in administrative services has increased
by 15 points (from 28% to 43%). (Figure 4.1.3)

efficiency and accessibility of services has somewhat decreased and so become quite close to
perceptions of the users, positive perceptions of quality and integrity have increased and huge
discrepancy with perceptions of users has not changed in spite the improved views of users. (Figure

4.2. Efficiency of court administrative services

Summary

280. A majority of users of court administrative services were satisfied with the efficiency of the
service in their administrative task, and the percentage of satisfied users has increased in comparison
with 2009. With an increase in the percentage of satisfied court users, opinions of service users and
service providers have become closer, but the percentage of service providers who are satisfied with
the efficiency of their work is still higher than the percentage of the court users who are satisfied with
the efficiency of the service. According to court users the situation has also improved in terms of the
possibility to finish the administrative task in one place, instead of going from door to door, and in
terms of the time needed for completion of an administrative task. Although the assessment of the
efficiency of services has become more positive, a considerable percentage of the users of
administrative services still think that their administrative task could have been finished in shorter
time, while just one out of five providers of administrative services agrees with this opinion. According
to providers of administrative services, better efficiency in their work could be primarily achieved by
stimulating the staff by higher salaries and increasing the number of staff, to a somewhat lesser extent
by simplification of procedure and better equipment, to an even lesser extent through better
allocation of work and informing the clients better, and the least of all through greater staff
commitment and better training of the staff.

281. A majority of users of court administrative services (more than 70%), who performed some
administrative task during 2013 were satisfied with the efficiency with the service provided. In
comparison with 2009, the percentage of satisfied users has considerably increased among members
of the general population who had some task connected with verifications (of documents, contracts),
as well as among the members of business sector. (Figure 4.2.1)

282. In comparison with users of administrative services, a somewhat higher percentage of

the sector in which they worked. In comparison with 2009, the only change was recorded in the work
of registry office, where the percentage of the employees who are satisfied with the efficiency of work
in this sector has somewhat decreased (Figure 4.2.2).

284. The number of courthouse visits varies considerably depending on the type of
administrative service, but more than one half of members of the general population of citizens, 56%,
reported to have finished their verification job in the court during one visit in 2013 (14% more than in
2009), while the percentage of the citizens who stated that they had to come to the court between 3
and 7 times has decreased by 15%. Within other administrative tasks, and administrative tasks of the
business sector more than three fourths of the users had to visit the courthouse between 3 and 7
times. In the business sector 7% of users of administrative services claimed to have visited the
courthouse more than 8 times (some representatives mentioned to have visited the court even 20
times). Nevertheless, in comparison with 2009, the percentage of business sector members who
stated to have gone to the courthouse more than 2 times has decreased. (Figure 4.2.4)

courthouse required to complete an administrative task mainly coincide with the assessment of
users of administrative services. (Figure 4.2.5)

286. The situation has also improved in terms of the possibility to finish the administrative task
at one location instead of going from door to door. In comparison with 2009, the percentage of users
of administrative services who reported to have completed their verification task at one location has
increased by 25% (from 49% to 74%), and among representatives of business sector by 12% (from 53%
to 65%). (Figure 4.2.6)

287. According to representatives of the general population, time needed to complete one
administrative task has decreased as well. Time needed to perform verification of documents has
been reduced from 118 minutes in 2009 to 78 minutes in 2013; as regards other administrative tasks
the time has been reduced on average from 164 minutes to 91 minutes (Figure 4.2.7)

288. In comparison with 2009, a considerably higher percentage of the users of administrative
services from the general population reported to have completed the task in maximum 30 minutes.
Almost one half of the users of verification services (48%) and more than 40% of users of other
administrative services finished their administrative task in maximum 30 minutes in 2013, while in
2009 only one out of four users of administrative services did the same (Figure 4.2.8)

administrative services reported to have spent between 90 and 180 minutes, even more than 3
hours to complete their administrative task, while some of them reported even more than 10 hours.
In regards to the business sector, more than one half of representatives reported to have spent
between 30 and 90 minutes to complete their administrative task, one out of four reported to have
spent between 90 and 180 minutes, while 14% reported to have spent more than 3 hours in the

task, the number of users of administrative services who think that their administrative task could
have been completed in lesser time has considerably decreased as well. Nevertheless, a substantial
percentage of the users still think that their task could be finished in shorter time, particularly among

292. According to staff in the administrative sector of the court, better efficiency in performing
the tasks could primarily be achieved by stimulating the employees through higher income and
increased staffing, to a somewhat lesser extent through simplification of procedures and better
equipment, to an even lesser extent through better informing of the clients, and finally through
greater staff commitment and better training. According to a majority of the employees (53%) the
main factors which could contribute to better efficiency in administrative services provisions would
be increased salaries and increased staffing. Besides bigger salary, 41% mention additional financial
incentives. All in all, 60% of providers of administrative services mentioned one or both of these
financial moments. A considerably lower percentage, 41%, stated that simplification of procedures
would reduce the time of completing the administrative tasks, while 38% stated that better technical
equipment would contribute to that outcome; 29% mentioned better allocation of work and better
informing of the clients, and the smallest percentage mentioned better staff commitment 18%, and
better staff training, 15%. (Figure 4.2.11)

4.3. Perceptions of court administrative services providers about caseload and
comfort with working conditions

Summary

293. Providers of administrative services in the court feel overburdened with work, while at the
same time not being paid enough for their effort. According to providers of administrative services, the
number of daily cases they work on and the number of clients that they serve on a daily basis
considerably exceeds the optimal number, both in terms of caseload and number of clients. A majority
of the providers of administrative services are satisfied with cooperation with other sectors and
superiors, and to a somewhat lesser extent with working climate and organization of work, but they
are very dissatisfied with premises and equipment, and most of all they are dissatisfied with their
salaries.

294. Judging by the reported number of cases on which they worked and their assessment of the
optimal caseload under the conditions in which they worked, the providers of administrative
                                                           115

services in the court feel overburdened. (Figure 4.3.1) According to the data they reported, the daily
caseload in 2013 in the case of registry desk and reception, verification and expedition of letters was
somewhat above 100 cases on average, while in case of other administrative services it was somewhat
below 50. This caseload exceeds the caseload that the staff in registry desk and office for reception,
verification and expedition evaluated as optimal by 38%. In case of other administrative services the
actual caseload is considered to exceed the optimal one by 17%. In comparison 2009, the caseload of
providers of administrative services has not changed. (Figure 4.3.1)

involves contacts with the clients, the number of clients with whom they daily interacted was 20 on
average in case of registry desk, 55 in case of reception, verification and expedition, and 16 clients
in case of other administrative services. The estimated number of clients with whom they interacted
exceeded on average the optimal one by 38% in the case of the registry office, by 27% in reception,
verification and expedition, while in the case of other administrative services there was no difference
on average between actual and optimal number of clients.

296. The majority of providers of administrative services are satisfied with the cooperation of the
judges, superiors and other sectors (circa 80%), and to a somewhat lesser extent with the general
working climate (nearly 70%). Satisfaction with organization of work is somewhat lesser,
nevertheless, considerably more than a half of providers of administrative services are satisfied: 66%
are satisfied with organization of work in their sector, while 58% are satisfied with organization of
work in general. However, the employees are dissatisfied with premises and equipment, and most
dissatisfied with their salary. Only 38% of providers of administrative services are satisfied with
premises and equipment, and only 14% are satisfied with their salary (Figure 4.3.3). In comparison
with 2009, satisfaction with organization of work, both in their own sector and in general, has
somewhat decreased, while the percentage of those who are satisfied with their salary has even
increased to some extent (from 5% to 14%). (Figure 4.3.3)

Summary

297. The general situation regarding the quality of administrative court services is improved, in
users’ opinion. Users are likely to have a more positive opinion about the quality of services, so
opinions of users and providers of services are now closer to each other, but service providers are still
a lot more likely than users to assess services as of very high quality. The reasons that prevent higher
quality of services mainly named by service providers are those already assessed as the main barriers
for greater efficiency of the performance: poor working conditions, including low salaries, and
insufficient staff. Thhe great majority of users of administrative services are satisfied with different
aspects of court performance regarding administrative services (working hours, accessibility of
information and staff, conduct of staff and time spent waiting for one’s turn), and the percentage of
those satisfied has increased on most aspects as compared to 2009. The image of conduct and
competence of service providers has also become more positive comparing to 2009. Most users
evaluate service providers positively regarding efficiency, pleasantness and knowledge, and a
significantly lower percentage considers them prone to corruption, indolent and negligent.

298. Users of administrative court services usually assess quality as average, but still a higher
percentage evaluates quality as high than as low. Somewhat less than 40% of users from the general
population of citizens, and somewhat more than 40% of the business sector representatives, evaluate
the quality of administrative services in 2013 as high, and between 15% and 25% of members of the

299. Providers of administrative services, however, are a lot more likely than the citizens to
evaluate the quality of services they provide as high: 77% at registry desk, 71% in reception,
verification, expedition department and 84% in other departments. While the quality of services has
increased, compared to 2009, in the opinion of those employed at the registry desk and in other
services, those employed in reception, verification and expedition service think that quality has
decreased. (Figure 4.4.2)

300. In the opinion of providers of administrative services, the obstacles to higher quality of
services derive from a series of circumstances. The highest percentage, however, indicates the same
circumstances assessed as main barriers to greater efficiency of their performance: poor working
conditions, including salaries, and insufficient staff. These reasons are named by 77% of the employed.
Most employees also mention the problem of work space and equipment (66%), poor organization
(57%) and the problem of work allocation (56%), and somewhat less than a half singles out poor inter-
sectorial cooperation (49%) and insufficient staff training (45%). Compared to 2009, four reasons
listed as the first are named to a somewhat lower percent. (Figure 4.4.3)

301. A great majority of users of administrative services were satisfied with different aspects of
court performance regarding administrative services (court working hours, accessibility of
information and staff, conduct of staff and time spent waiting for one’s turn), and the percentage of
those satisfied has increased on most aspects compared with the 2009 survey. (Figures 4.4.4 and 4.4.5)

situation is somewhat better than 2009. (Figures 4.4.4 and 4.4.5)

knowledge of service providers, and a significantly higher percentage of them assess these
characteristics as being at high or very high level than as being at low level 31. (Figure 4.4.6)

304. A considerably lower percentage believes that service providers were prone to corruption,
sloppy and negligent. As for the presence of negative characteristics among providers of
administrative services users had contact with, approximately one in six members of the general
population believes that proneness to corruption was present to a great extent, and approximately
one in five that indolence and negligence were present to a great extent. An even lower percentage
of business sector representatives share the opinion that these negative characteristics were present
to a great extent: 5% believe that corruption is present to a great extent, 12% indolence was present
to a great extent, and 11% that negligence was present to a great extent. On the other hand, it should
be underlined that almost a half of general population of citizens, 48%, believe that there was no
proneness to corruption among providers of administrative services, or that it was just slightly present,

31There were no significant differences between verification and other services regarding assessment of general

and this opinion is shared by 64% of business sector representatives. (Figure 4.4.7) Compared to 2009,
perceptions regarding presence of negative characteristics of staff in administrative services are
improved. The percentage of general population members who believe that proneness to corruption
was present to a great extent in administrative services reduced from 33% to 17%, and among
business sector representatives from 17% to 5%. The percentage of users who believe that verification
services, as a part of administrative services, were accompanied by indolence and negligence is also
reduced significantly.

Summary

305. Compared with widespread citizens’ belief that corruption is present in the judiciary in
general, a significantly lower percentage of users of administrative court services believe that
corruption is present in this sector. About a third of members of the general population of users of
administrative services, and a somewhat smaller number of business sector representatives, believe
that corruption was present in this sector, and this percentage is reduced significantly compared to
2009. On the other hand, however, a great majority of providers of administrative services believe
that there was no corruption in their sector at all, and this difference in perceptions of the presence
of corruption between service users and providers remained big in spite of increase of users’ positive
evaluation. Compared with the percentage of users who believe that corruption was present in
administrative court services, substantially lower percentage reports resorting to informal means in
order to speed up an administrative court task. Those employed in administrative court services do
not agree on whether there was any form of internal control present in their sector. More than half
believe that there was internal control, but a significant percentage believes there was no control

306. Compared with the perception of presence of corruption in the judiciary system in general,
a significantly lower percentage of citizens believes that corruption is present in court
administrative services. While more than half of the general population members32 believe that
corruption is present in the judiciary, about a third of general population users believe that corruption
was present in administrative court services in 2013, and approximately the same percentage that it
was not. As for business sector representatives, a somewhat lower percentage considers corruption
present, 26%, and somewhat higher - not present, 43%. A substantial percentage of users, however,
could not estimate the potential presence of corruption. Compared to 2009, the percentage of the

307. Unlike users of administrative services, the great majority of providers of these services
believe that corruption is not present in administrative services. However, 14% of the employed at
registry desk, 21% in verification, reception and expedition department, and 15% of the employed in
other administrative departments believe that corruption is present. Compared to 2009, the
percentage of those employed at the registry desk who believe that corruption is not present is
increased, while the opinion of those employed in verification, reception and expedition department
is more negative now, so the percentage of those who think that corruption is present is at least
somewhat closer to citizens’ opinion. (Figure 4.5.2)

308. A considerably lower percentage of citizens, though, report personally resorting to informal
means. As it was mentioned already, this difference is not surprising since it is well known that citizens
are not prone to revealing information about their own corruptive behavior33. However, almost 10%
of users of administrative services, members of general population, and 6% of business sector
representatives, report resorting to informal means. Compared to 2009, this percentage is reduced.

309. A somewhat higher percentage of users says that they know someone who resorted to
informal means to speed up administrative task in court (on average about 15%). But this percentage
is also reduced compared to 2009, especially among those who needed verification (from 38% to 16%).

4.6. Accessibility of court administrative services

Summary

313. Most court services users and providers consider administrative court services easily
accessible to citizens. The percentage of citizens who consider administrative services easily accessible
has increased, and the percentage of service providers who share this opinion has reduced, so
opinions of users and providers of the services are mainly matching. As for accessibility of information
and court building layout, service users are even somewhat more likely than service providers to think
that administrative services were easily accessible to citizens in those aspects. Perceptions of service
users and service providers agree regarding financial accessibility as well: the percentage of service
providers who consider administrative services hardly accessible financially to citizens is
approximately equal to the percentage of the general population members who assess costs of
administrative services as a great burden for their budget (about 25%). Most users assess the total
costs of administrative services they used as reasonable, if not small (more than 70% of general
population and more than 80% of business sector representatives). About a half of users among the
members of the general population, and more than 70% of business sector members believe that the
costs of administrative services they used was a small burden for their budget. The range of reported
costs of administrative services is very extensive, starting from less than 5 Euros and all the way up to
more than 1.000 Euros, but most members of the general population reported costs of up to 15 Euros,
and most business sector representatives up to 50 Euros.

314. Users of administrative court services and providers of these services agree that
administrative services were easily accessible to citizens. More than 80% of users among the general
population, and almost 90% of business sector members and services providers share this opinion.
Administrative court services are estimated as considerably more available to citizens as court services
associated with court proceedings34. Compared with the 2009 survey results, the percentage of
providers of administrative services who believe that these services are easily accessible to citizens is
somewhat reduced, and percentage of users who share this opinion is somewhat increased, so their
assessments became quite close to each other. (Figure 4.6.1)

315. Administrative court services are assessed as a lot more accessible to citizens than court
services related to court proceedings.35 A great majority of users of administrative services conducted
their administrative tasks on their own, without a lawyer. Only 10% of members of the general
population, and 7% of members of the business sector engaged a lawyer in 2013 to help them with
their administrative tasks.

316. Most service providers believe that administrative services are accessible in all aspects, but
the highest percentage shares this opinion regarding accessibility of information (80%), somewhat
lower regarding finding one’s way in the court building (75%) and the distance of court building (71%),
and the lowest regarding costs of services (58%). It is striking that the percentage of providers of court
services who consider administrative services accessible to citizens is reduced on all aspects compared
to 2009. (Figure 4.6.2)

317. It is interesting that users of administrative services are even more likely than providers of
court services to assess information as easily accessible and that it was not difficult for them to find
their way in the court building. It is also noticeable that the percentage of users who share this opinion,
unlike service providers, has increased compared to 2009. (Figures 4.6.3 and 4.6.4)

318. Obvious is also substantial agreement between users and providers of court services in
terms of financial availability of administrative services; 25% of providers of administrative services
perceive administrative services as financially difficult to access by the citizens, and approximately the
same percentage of users from the general population say that costs of the administrative services
they used were a great burden for their budget (23% verification and 24% of users of other
administrative services). As for business sector members, however, only 8% say that these costs were
a great burden for their company budget. Compared to the 2009 results, the percentage of general
population members who say that the costs of administrative services they used was a small burden
for their budget has even increased. (Figure 4.6.5)

319. Most users consider total costs of administrative services they used as reasonable, if not
even small. Approximately one in four users, members of the general population of citizens, and 16%
of business sector members, assess costs of administrative services as excessive. Compared to 2009,
the evaluation of general population hasn’t changed, and the percentage of business sector
representatives who assess costs of administrative services as excessive has reduced by 9%. (Figure

321. The range of reported costs of administrative services is very extensive, starting from less
than 5 Euros and all the way up to more than 1.000 Euros. Some business sector representatives
report even more than 10.000 Euros. However, most members of general population with a
verification task report costs of up to 15 Euros (more than 60%), and half of them spent 5 Euros most.
Also regarding other general population tasks, about a third spent up to 5 Euros, but significantly
higher percentage reported extensive costs. As for the business sector, costs were usually (in 43% of
cases) between 15 and 50 Euros, 36% indicated smaller costs, and 19% higher costs. (Figure 4.6.8)

5. PERCEPTIONS OF THE REFORM LAUNCHED IN JANUARY 2010 AND NEW
NATIONAL JUDICIAL REFORM STRATEGY FOR THE PERIOD 2014-2018

5.1. Perceptions of reform launched in 2010 - awareness, expectations and
perceived effects

Summary

323. General support to reform of the judicial system launched in 2010 has considerably decreased,
both among court users, providers of court services and lawyers. Nevertheless, somewhat more than
half of the judges and public prosecutors still support this reform. Knowledge about the reform has
also decreased considerably among the citizens, while those who have heard about the reform mainly
associate it with reassignment of judges and prosecutors, the same as in 2010. Decrease of support of
the reform among judges and prosecutors is certainly the result of disappointment in the effects of
the reform. Expectations that the reform will improve the situation exceeded considerably the
appraisal of the actual positive effects of the reforms. In contrast to judges and prosecutors, the
lawyers had much lower expectations, so the percentage of disappointed lawyers is considerably
lower. While the differences in expectations from reform effects between lawyers on one side and
judges and prosecutors on the other were considerable, the evaluations of actual effects of the reform
become much closer. Similar to lawyers, the providers of court administrative services had
considerably smaller expectations, so their disappointment was also smaller, and the assessments of
effects are considerably closer to assessments of judges and prosecutors than were their expectations.

324. Judges and prosecutors also had substantially higher expectations that mandatory seminars
and new organization of courts will improve the quality and efficiency of court services, and that
attendance of Court Academy would help the judges and prosecutors to be more prepared what really
happened. Nevertheless, mandatory seminars are the most positively evaluated aspects of the
reforms. Although the expectations of effects were considerably higher, a majority of judges and
prosecutors still think that these seminars had a positive effect.

325. The majority of the judges also expected that the reform from 2010 would result in a more
adequate penal policy and that it would equip the judges with more legal mechanisms to keep order
in court, but less than a half of them think that this has actually been achieved.

5.1.a Users of judicial system services awareness of and support to the reform launched in January
2010

326. The percentage of court users who have heard about the reform of the judiciary in 2010 has
considerably decreased both in the general population and among representatives of the business
sector. While in 2010 more than 70% of the general population and nearly 90% of members of the
business sector were aware of these reforms, three years later less than one half of the general
population and somewhat less than 70% of representatives of the business sector claimed to have
heard about these reforms. (Figure 5.1.a1)

that they are at least somewhat, if not well, informed about these reforms has decreased. (Figure

328. Since the citizens’ main source of information about judicial reforms was the media,
decrease of information about the reforms among the citizens is most probably the result of reduced
media coverage of the reforms from 2010. (Figure 5.1.a3) The citizens primarily associate the reforms
of the judicial system from 2010 with reelection of judges and prosecutors, which is also most probably
related to the way in which the media reported about the reforms. Reassignment of the judges and
prosecutors has remained the best-known aspect of these reforms for the citizens in 2013 as well.

329. Support to reforms has also decreased since 2010. Among members of the general
population who have heard about the reforms, the support to reforms has decreased by only 5% (from
68% to 63%), but, since the percentage of the citizens who have heard about the reforms has
decreased by 29%, the decrease of support within the general population is substantially larger.38
Support among representatives of the business sector has decreased even more. Among
representatives of the business sector who have heard about the reforms the support to reforms has
decreased from 77% to 47%, but, once again, due to a considerable decrease of awareness of reforms,
within the total population of members of business sector, the decrease is actually considerably
larger.39 (Figure 51.a5)

330. Support of the judicial reforms from 2010 has decreased considerably among providers of
judicial services as well. Among the judges the support of these reforms has decreased by 24%, and
among public prosecutors by 37%. However, since in 2010 great majority of judges and prosecutors
supported the reforms (79% of judges and 88% of prosecutors), despite the decrease, more than a
half of judges and prosecutors still support the reforms. (Figure 5.1.b)

38 From the aspect of total population support to judicial reforms has decreased in the general population by 23% (from 49%
in 2010 to 26% in 2013).
39Within the total population of business sector representatives support to judicial reforms actually decreased from 68% in

331. Decrease of support to judicial reforms is definitely the result of disappointment in the
effects of these reforms.40 Judges and public prosecutors had, by far, bigger expectations of the
reforms than what assessed were the actual realized positive effects. (Figures 5.1.b3 and 51.b4) It is
noticeable, however, that a considerably higher percentage of the judges and prosecutors supported
the reforms in general, than they expected concrete positive changes in various aspect of functioning
of the judicial system. Both judges and public prosecutors had the biggest expectations regarding
fairness and integrity, while the prosecutors had the biggest expectations regarding efficiency, but
these expectations were also shared by no more than about one half of the judges and prosecutors
(with just somewhat higher expectations of prosecutors with regards to fairness). However, less than
30%, think that the reforms really had positive effects on these dimensions of the functioning of the
judicial system (Figures 5.1.b3 and 5.1.b4). More rational sending of the budget was the least expected
to be improved among judges. Only one third of the judges had positive expectations, and only 7%
estimated that the reform had positive effect. (Figures 5.1.b3)

40Decrease of support to reforms can partially be explained by the fact that in 2010 wave judges and prosecutors who were
not reappointed were not covered by the survey, but they were returned to work and included in 2013 wave. The reform
support somewhat higher percentage of the reappointed judges and prosecutors than those who were not reappointed in
2009, but the differences were not big, while the decrease of support among reappointed judges is still considerable (58%
of reappointed judges support the reforms, which is by 21% below the result recorded in 2010). Regarding the evaluation of
reform effects on various aspects of judicial system, judges and prosecutors who were not reappointed were somewhat
more negative, but the differences are small and they do not change the overall picture of perception of effects of reforms
by judges and prosecutors.

332. In contrast to judges and prosecutors, lawyers had much smaller expectations, so the
percentage of those disappointed among the lawyers is considerably smaller. While the differences

of the reforms. (Figure 5.1.b5)

333. Judges and prosecutors had rather great expectations from mandatory seminars introduced
with the 2010 reforms. Even 90% of judges and 84% of prosecutors expected these seminars to
contribute to increased efficiency and quality of court services. Although a significantly lower
percentage estimated that these seminars really did have this effect, still more than 60% of judges
and 59% of prosecutors think that these seminars contributed to increased efficiency and quality.
(Figure 5.1.b6) A considerably lower percentage of judges and prosecutors (51% and 55%) expected

the new organization of courts to contribute to an increase of efficiency and quality of court services,
and less than a third of judges and 23% of prosecutors believed that this effect really was achieved.
(Figure 5.1.b6) Finally, most judges and prosecutors (more than 60%) expected that attending the
Judicial Academy would contribute to better preparedness of future judges and prosecutors for their
job, but expectations were failed here as well. Only 36% of judges and 39% of prosecutors agreed that

334. Lastly, most of the judges and prosecutors believed that the 2010 reforms would result in
more adequate penal policy (more than 70%), as well as that they would enable judges to have more
of legal mechanisms to maintain order in court (more than 60%). However, significantly lower
percentage of judges and prosecutors estimated that it was achieved (about 40%). (Figure 5.1.b7)

5.1.c Providers’ of court administrative services expectations and perceived effects of the reform
launched in January 2010 in their sector

335. Those employed in court administrative services, compared with judges and prosecutors,
support the reforms from 2010 to a much lesser extent. While, as already mentioned above, almost
80% of judges and almost 90% of prosecutors supported the reforms in 2010, somewhat less than 60%
of the employed in administrative sector supported the reforms at the time, and support decreased
to 40% in 2013. (Figure 5.1.c1)

336. This decreased support is not surprising, given that about 40% of those employed in
administrative services expected negative consequences for their sector at the very beginning of
the implementation of the reforms, primarily in terms of increased workload, or reduced number
of employees. Just 19% expected positive consequences, and it did not change in 2013. It is noticeable
though that a substantial percentage of those employed in administrative services said to have no
opinion on the reforms (or at least didn’t want to express it). (Figure 5.1.c2)

Note: Question: How do you assess these changes of the work of your sector? Base: Court administrative services providers

337. Those employed in court administrative services did not expect much from the reforms on
any aspect in their sector. Expectations were the greatest regarding the accessibility of services to
citizens, but even on this aspect less than one third of employees expected improvement.
Expectations were the smallest in terms of quality of working conditions - only 23% of the employed
expected improvement. The percentage of the employed who assessed, in 2013, that the situation
really was improved didn’t change much compared with the percentage of those who expected
improvement. This percentage decreased only with regards to working conditions, and for only 5%.

5.2. Perceptions of the new National Judicial Reform Strategy for the period
2014-2018

Summary

338. Not many citizens were informed about the new National Judicial Reform Strategy at the end
of 2013, but a large majority of those who were informed, supported the reform. Neither providers
of court services nor lawyers were well informed about the new strategy of reform. Just somewhat
more than a third of judges and prosecutors claimed to be well informed, while more than a half of
lawyers and court administrative service providers stated that they knew nothing or almost nothing
about it. The role of the media in informing about the new national strategy was shown to be
important not only in the case of the citizens, but also in the case of court services providers and
lawyers: the media was the main source of information for the majority of court administrative
services providers and lawyers, while judges and prosecutors used the media as a source of
information almost equally as they used official sources of information.

339. In spite of limited information, a large majority of judges and prosecutors support the new
strategy of reform, just as they supported the reform in 2010, while court administrative services
providers and lawyers are a lot more likely to support the new strategy of reform than they supported
the reform in 2010. Expectations that the new strategy of reform will improve specific aspects of
functioning of the judicial system are considerably higher than were the expectations with regards to
reform in 2010, and these higher expectations are especially visible in case of court administrative
services providers and lawyers.

340. Providers of court services and lawyers are even less informed about the new National
strategy for fight against corruption than about the new reform strategy, and most of those who are
at least somewhat informed expect it to have a positive effect, but not to a sufficient extent.

end of 2013 (during the survey). Just somewhat more than one third of judges and prosecutors
claimed to be well informed, while the same share claimed not to know anything or almost anything
about it. Lawyers were even less informed: more than a half said that they knew nothing or almost
nothing about the reform strategy. (Figure 5.2.b1)

345. Noticeable is the role of media as a source of information about the new reform strategy.
Judges and prosecutors indicated media as the source of information in about the same percent as

while just a third used official sources of information. (Figure 5.2.b2)

346. An extensive majority of judges, prosecutors and lawyers, however, support the new
National strategy of the judicial system reform. Support is, in the case of judges and prosecutors,
similar to the initial support for the 2010 reforms. A somewhat higher percentage of judges support
the new reform strategy (5% more), and a somewhat lower percentage of prosecutors (4% less). In
the case of lawyers, however, support is considerably higher than support for the 2010 reform. (Figure

support, 2. Support to an extent, 3. Do not support. Base: Judges, prosecutors and lawyers who are informed (more than
‘not at all’) about new National strategy of judicial system reform (Judges 84%, Prosecutors, 84%, Lawyers 63%)

347. Although general support for the new reform strategy among judges and prosecutors is
similar to support at the beginning of the 2010 reform, expectations of the new reform strategy to
improve the situation in the judicial system are greater than expectations of the reform
implemented in 2010. A substantially higher percentage of both judges and prosecutors expect the
new strategy to improve the situation on all dimensions of functioning of the judicial system, with the
exception of fairness and integrity, where expectations are similar to those in 2010. (Figure 5.2.b4
and Table 5.2.b1)

348. Lawyers’ expectations that the new strategy will improve the situation in the judiciary are
considerably greater than expectations from the 2010 reform, and this growth of expectations is
considerably bigger than in the case of judges and prosecutors. While in the 2010 reforms, at best,
25% of lawyers expected the reforms to improve the situation on some dimensions, in the case of the
new strategy more than half of lawyers expect a better situation on most dimensions. Expectations
are the lowest on fairness and integrity, but even with regards to these aspects more than 40% of
lawyers have positive expectations (which is 24% and 27%, respectively, more than in case of the 2010
reforms). (Figure 5.2.b4 and Table 5.2.b1)

353. In spite of low awareness, a substantially higher percentage of those employed in the
administrative services support the new reform strategy than reform in 2010: 78% support the new
reform strategy, while 58% supported the reform in 2010. In accordance with higher support for the
new strategy of reform, expectations that it will bring improvements in a variety of aspects of
administrative services’ operations are considerably greater than the 2010 reform. It is interesting
that expectations are the lowest in regards to the effect of the new strategy on integrity (corruption
and independence of court administrative services), but anyway, the expectations are still greater
than in 2010. (Figure 5.2.c3)

6. PERCEPTIONS OF THE INFLUENCE OF MEDIA IN SHAPING PUBLIC OPINION
OF THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM

Summary

355. Opinions of court users and providers of court services about the judiciary image that the
media generates differ considerably, the same as the perceptions of judiciary differ. Court users have
a predominantly negative perception of the judiciary, and a majority of them think that the image of
the judiciary that media creates is either objective or even more positive than reality; providers of
court services have a considerably more positive perception about judiciary, and majority of them
think that the image of judiciary that media create is more negative than reality.

356. As shown before43 providers of court services and lawyers think that the media are highly
responsible, if not even the most responsible for the negative image of the judiciary in the public,
particularly when it comes to the integrity and independence of judiciary. A great majority of providers
of court services think that the image of the judiciary generated by the media is more negative than
in reality, and that sensationalist media reports are the main source of threat to the integrity and
independence of the judiciary.

357. On the other hand, however, at least some of the findings of the survey with the general
population oppose the opinion of court services providers about predominant responsibility of the
media for a negative public image of the judiciary:
   - General impressions about the judicial system expressed by the citizens who had experience
        with a court case comparing to impressions of the citizens without such experience are rather
        more negative, so indicating that personal experiences have enforced rather than corrected
        the general negative image of the judiciary existing in public.44
   - Opinions of the citizens who had experience with a court case about the way in which the
        media reported on the judiciary do not differ substantially from opinions of the citizens
        without such experience: in both cases the highly prevalent opinion is that images generated
        by media are either objective or better than reality, while the minority opinion is that this
        image is more negative than reality.
   - Finally, although the citizens agree that sensationalist media reports downgraded the trust of
        the citizens in judiciary, they still consider other factors as more important to creating distrust
        those factors associated with the work of the courts (inefficient functioning, political
        pressures, corruption…)45.

358. About one third of the citizens who have experience with a court case, as well as the citizens
without such experience think that the image of the judiciary generated by media is better than
reality, while 29% of the citizens with court experience and 36% of the citizens without such
experience think that this image is objective. On the other hand, only 29% of the citizens with
experience with a court case and 26% of the citizens without such experience think that this image is
worse than reality. (Figure 6.1)

Note: Question: What image of the judicial system do media in Serbia generate in general? Base: General public total target
population

359. As for corruption in the judiciary, citizens who believe that corruption is present almost
equally mention the media and personal experience, either their own or someone else’s, as the
main source of information. Citizens without experience with court cases are somewhat more likely
to single out the media as the main source of information (56%), while the citizens with experience
with court cases are somewhat more likely to specify personal experience, either their own or
someone else’s (52%). And as it was mentioned already46, an almost equal percentage of both groups
of citizens (51%) believe that corruption is present in judiciary. (Figure 6.2)

360. Similarly, business sector representatives without experience with court cases are more
likely than representatives with experience to specify the media as the main source of information
about corruption in the judiciary (78% without experience and 61% with experience), but less likely
than those with experience with court cases to believe that corruption is present in the judiciary (38%
without experience and 43% with experience with court cases47). (Figure 6.3)

361. The conclusion is the same when comparing business sector representatives and the general
public: business sector representatives are a lot more likely than representatives of the general public
to indicate the media as a source of information about corruption in the judiciary, but less likely to
believe that corruption is present in the judiciary.

corruption is present in judiciary (Business sector with court experience 2009 51%, 2013 43%; Business sector without court
experience 2009 49%, 2013 38%)

362. The media are also specified as the main source of information about the judiciary reforms
implemented since January 2010, as well as about the National Judicial Reform Strategy for the Period
2013-2018.

363. A great majority of citizens specify the media as the main source of information about the
judiciary reforms implemented since January 2010, as well as about the National Judicial Reform
Strategy for the Period 2013-2018. As for the reforms implemented in 2010, citizens mainly associate
them with the reappointment of judges and prosecutors, the topic that the media probably covered
the most at the time. In the survey conducted in 2010, when asked to specify what was accomplished
within the judicial reform, almost half of citizens singled out reappointment of judges and prosecutors
and another 15% mentioned reduction of the number of judges, prosecutors and other employees.
Not nearly as many citizens mentioned any other aspect of the reform (for example, 11% mentioned
shortening of court proceedings), which was most probably a consequence of the way the media
covered the reforms. Reappointment of judges and prosecutors is the predominantly memorized
element of the 2010 reforms, but the percentage of citizens mentioning it is reduced, since it was not
talked about that much (in 2013, 39% of citizens mention reappointment).

364. It is striking that the media was one of the sources of information about the reforms for
judges, prosecutors and lawyers as well: 46% of prosecutors, 48% of judges and 57% of lawyers
mentioned the media as a source of information about the new strategy.

365. Finally, as it was mentioned already48, citizens with experience with court cases found the
media useful also as the source of information relevant for their case (about 10% mention using
information from TV, about 3% from the press, and 2% the radio).

366. All these results merely confirm the undisputable importance of the media in shaping the
public opinion. In addition to studies of perception, systemic analysis of the media reporting about
the judicial system would enable better understanding of the perception of the judiciary by the public
and facilitate the creation of a more efficient strategy for communication between the citizens and
the judiciary through the media.

ANNEX 1 METHODOLOGY

In order to assure methodological consistency, i.e. to secure valid comparability of the results, sample
designs and methods of data collection for all target groups in the follow-up study were based on the
designs and methods used in the baseline surveys

A.1 Target groups

a. General public
a.1. The general public without experience with court proceedings. Definition: Members of the general
public who were not involved in the court proceedings in the period between the beginning of 2007
till the end of 2009 (Baseline survey), and from the beginning of 2011 till the participation in the survey
in November 2013 (Follow up survey).
a.2 The general public with experience with court administrative services. Definition: Members of the
general public who completed an administrative task in court in the last 12 months in front of the
survey (members of this target group did not have experience with court proceedings, so the

up survey). Respondent: The highest available manager (Owner, Director, General Director, Executive
Director, or any other person who is involved in core decisions).
b.2 Enterprises with experience with court administrative service. Definition: Enterprises who
completed an administrative task in court in the last 12 months in front of the survey (enterprises in
this target group were not involved in court proceedings, so the administrative task completed was
not related to court case). Respondent: The person most knowledgeable about the last completed
administrative task.
b.3 Enterprises with experience with court proceedings. Definition: Private enterprises which were a
party in a court proceedings in which the first-instance judgment was rendered in the period from the

prosecutors’ deputies, and court administrative staff who were at this position at the time of the
survey.

A.2. Sample design and method of data collection


49
   January 2011 (one year after the beginning of the implementation of the reforms) was taken as the earliest date of the
first instance case closure in order to allow for all respondents in the sample to have had experience with the functioning of
judiciary system after the implementation of the reforms. The beginning of the case was not limited, and data about the
beginning of the case were recorded in the questionnaire.


                                                            147

a. General public
Sample universe: Citizens of Serbia 18+ based on 2011 Census figures
Type of sample: Three-stage random representative stratified sample; boosted sample of the citizens
with experience with court cases – a combined sample based on criteria of geographical spread, and
quota based on case type.
Stages: Primary sampling units (PSU) - polling station territories; Secondary sampling units (SHU) -
household; Tertiary sampling unit (TUS) - member of the household (respondent)

the universe
Strata: First level strata geographical regions - Belgrade, Vojvodina, East Serbia, West Serbia, Central
Serbia, South Serbia, and second level strata urban and rural settlements.
Method of data collection: Face to face in respondent’s household. The interview was conducted by a
trained interviewer with a structured questionnaire.

d. Public officials and civil servants working in the justice sector

d.1 Judges and prosecutors
Universe: Surveys with judges and prosecutors were conducted with entire populations of these two
target groups. So no sampling procedure was applied. All courts and prosecution offices, as well as all
judges and prosecutors employed at the time of the survey were targeted. Since by definition the
population included judges and prosecutors who were at this position in the time of the survey, the
population of the baseline survey included only the reappointed judges and prosecutors, while the
population of the follow-up survey included also the judges and prosecutors who were not reappointed
at the time of the baseline study but were returned to work, as well as new employed.
Method of data collection: The self-administration method was used in order to guarantee the privacy
and confidentiality. The respondents were provided with questionnaire and envelope with stamp and
ISM address. After filling out the questionnaire the respondent put the questionnaire in the envelope
and seals the envelope. The respondents had two options to return the questionnaires: to send it by
post, or to give it to the ISM representative who visited the court in agreed days and collect the
questionnaires.

d.2 Court administrative staff
Sample universe: Employees in administrative services in Serbian courts at the time of the survey
Type of sample: 43 courts were selected from the sampling frame of courts of General Jurisdiction,
Misdemeanor and Commercial courts. The sampling frame was stratified by regions (Vojvodina,
Belgrade, and Central Serbia) and type of court. The number of administrative staff in each stratum
was allocated according to the size of court (where size was defined as the number of judges
employed) and the need to achieve enough number of respondents in each sampling strata cell (at
least 30 questionnaires in each strata cell, and at least 150 in Commercial Courts). Within each
stratum, courts were selected according to the court size, so that the courts of bigger size were
selected. This approach was used, because no reliable data on number of administrative stuff in each
court were available. The number of administrative staff per court is allocated proportional to the
courts’ sizes within each stratum.
Method of data collection: The self-administration method was used in order to guarantee the privacy
and confidentiality. The respondents were provided with the questionnaire and envelope with a stamp
and ISM address. After filling out the questionnaire the respondent put the questionnaire in the
envelope and seals the envelope. The respondents had two options to return the questionnaires: to
send it by post, or to give it to the ISM representative who visited the court in agreed days and collect
the questionnaires.
Time of data collection: December 21, 2010 to January 25, 2011 (Baseline survey) and November 02
to December 21, 2013 (Follow - up survey)
Sample size and response rate: 900 questionnaires were allocated in 2010 and 2013; 571 were
fulfilled in baseline survey (response rate 63%), and 579 in follow-up (response rate 64%)

A.3 Weighting procedure

Weights were used in order for the sample to reflect structure of the universe, which might be
disturbed due to non-response.

Weighting procedures for general public
Two weights were used. Rim-weighting (ranking ratio) procedure was applied to representative
samples of the general public, using age, gender, education, region, and type of settlement as
weighting classes. The incidence of court case experience recorded in the weighted sample was then
used as a margin for weighting of the total sample for the general public (including the representative
sample and the booster sample of those with court case experience), together with the already listed
variables.
Weighting procedures for business sector
Rim-weighting (ranking ratio) procedure was applied, using geographical strata, main activity, and
number of employees as weighting classes

Perception of judiciary performance in Serbia, 2009-2013

Weighting procedures for lawyers
The sample of lawyers was weighted by the number of lawyers in each of the strata and in lawyers’
chambers
Weighting procedures for judges and prosecutors / prosecutors’ deputies
Since the surveys with judges and prosecutors were conducted with entire populations, the correction
of the bias of the structure of these two populations due to incomplete response was corrected by post-
stratification, in both baseline and follow-up surveys. The variables used for post-stratification were:
geographical region, authority / prosecution offices the judges and prosecutors and prosecutors’
deputies worked in 2009 (for baseline survey) and 2013 (for follow-up survey), and gender figures.
Weighting procedures for court administrative staff
Post-stratification was applied in the follow-up survey based on allocation of surveyed population in
the baseline survey.

A.4 Questionnaire

Data were collected with structured questionnaires. Questions for each of the measured values
(efficiency, quality, fairness, integrity and accessibility) and services were selected based on
experience with similar surveys in other countries, and adapted to reflect the needs of the Serbian
judiciary.
Questionnaires were constructed in a way to allow as much as it is possible the comparability of
perceptions of users of court services, providers of court services, and lawyers.
Questionnaires for users of court services consisted three modules: 1. General perception of the
judiciary system and reforms (applied with all users of judiciary services); 2. Perceptions based on
personal experience with court case (applied with users with experience with court proceedings); 3.
Perceptions based on experience with court administrative services (applied with users with
experience with court administrative services).

The follow-up questionnaires were based on the baseline survey questionnaires, and further
developed in a way to allow comparable tracking of the changes in perceptions of the justice sector
performance, and gather additional relevant information.
Note: The questions in the baseline questionnaire were all related to perceptions of the judicial system
up to the end of year 2009. So, no matter that surveys were conducted in year 2010, the questions
was formulated in a way to focus the respondents to the period before the implementation of the
reform in January 2010.

A.6 Data analyses

Data from the follow-up survey and baseline survey were analyzed and compared by using the
appropriate statistical tests depending on the type of data. Means were compared by using
appropriate models of analyses of variance (One Way analyses of variance was used for comparisons
of means between two waves, and factorial models when means were compared by wave and type of
cases). Parameters of relative proportions were estimated by 95% confidence intervals. For reader’s
convenience, statistically significant differences on graphs are marked with an arrow.

Note: An additional survey with a random representative sample of 1003 citizens 18+ (Omnibus
survey) was conducted in January 2014. The objective of this survey was to collect more data on
citizens’ perceptions of accessibility of judicial services to the general public. Results from this survey
are presented in section “3. Access to judicial services”, and source of data is noted in the footnote.
