                       The hydropower projects currently under             the Department of Energy (predecessor to
                       development and the pipeline of new projects        DHPS and DRE), NEC, and BPC.
                       are the result of an evolving planning process by
                       the RGoB. An important basis for this process       Environmental studies were conducted
                       was the Update of the Power System Master Plan      independently of the technical studies, both
                       (PSMP) of 2004, which in turn was an update of      for the potential hydropower projects and the
                       the 1993 master plan. The PSMP (2004) updated       development of the transmission line system
                       information on all potential projects identified    in Bhutan. The potential hydropower projects
                       in the 1993 study, ranked these, and proposed       were subjected to an Initial Environmental

                       construction today—Punatsangchhu I and II,          projects. In the final ranking, however, the
                       and Mangdechhu—were on this list, as well as        stakeholders emphasized that “selection of the
                       three of the projects included in the 10,000 MW     Projects for further development will be governed

                       A fundamental presumption for the master
                       plan was to develop hydropower in Bhutan            Subsequent to the 2004 master plan, the RGoB
                       for export to India, since India’s power market     adopted the approach of the MCA as the main

                       Bhutan face competition from Indian and             for the MCA were taken from the 2004 study’s
                       Nepalese hydropower projects, as the latter         approach, the methodology was further

                       export-oriented projects to be implemented          The adoption of this criterion has resulted in
                       more easily than in India and Nepal.                prioritization of hydropower development in the

                     •	 Season 4 (Average Flow): 15%
                     State Discharge relationships are used to calculate minimum flows for estimating depth of flows.

                     however.
                     For sustenance of riverine fisheries, a minimum flow of 2.5 m3/s was estimated:

Analysis of Key Issues for Management of Environmental and Social Impacts



                                  Box 4-1  Upstream Hydropower Planning in the Coatzacoalcos Basin in Mexico

                           The biologically and socially diverse Coatzacoalcos river basin of Mexico is part of the government of Mexico’s
                           hydropower expansion plan. The basin is rich in biodiversity—having a wide variety of species and ecosystems of
                           ecological interest, including threatened, endangered, and endemic species such as the jaguar (Panthera onca).
                           The Chimalpas forest is of great genetic value in Mexico and Mesoamerica, and it is estimated that one hectare
                           of undisturbed tropical vegetation in the Chimalpas has about 900 flora species and over 200 fauna species. To
                           minimize impacts on the environment and protect the cultural interests, a pilot Hydropower by Design (HbD) strategy
                           in the basin was applied through a partnership between the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE) and The Nature
                           Conservancy. This entailed evaluating each project based on its technical, environmental, and social feasibility.
                           Early strategic planning process to identify projects that are environmentally, socially, and economically sound was
                           based on the concept of Hydropower by Design (HbD). The analysis involved eight steps:
                           XX Identifying the hydroelectric potential of the basin;            XX Geographical analysis of the watershed;
                              Establishing a working group;                                    XX Multi-criteria analysis to determine the viability
                           XX Establishing a geographic information system;                       of the projects;
                           XX Selecting criteria and metrics that facilitate                   XX Fragmentation or connectivity analysis;
                              evaluation of projects, scenario creation, and                   XX Developing the sustainability portfolio.
                              decision making
                           A total of 28 projects were identified in the basin and different scenarios were generated. These projects all have
                           (i) a capacity greater than 1 MW and (ii) up to more than 100 MW for (iii) a total maximum potential of 511 MW.
                           Through the application of the HbD methodology, only 5 projects (172 MW) were identified that met all three
                           criteria—environmentally, socially, and economically sound—inverting the impact on the basin from 70 percent
                           of river flows fragmented to 70 percent of river flows unfragmented, thereby greatly reducing the threat to the
                           surrounding Chimalpas rainforest and other areas.
                           Experience from this approach demonstrates that comprehensive watershed planning at an early stage can offer
                           sustainable options for potential investment in hydropower projects. Comprehensive watershed planning can
                           facilitate complying with international commitments on climate change and biodiversity, and meeting targets
                           for power generation. Interagency collaboration is necessary for developing environmentally sound and viable
                           proposals. Through smart planning at the river basin scale, a country or region can have both major hydroelectric

               Box 4-2  More Strategic Approach to Maintaining Fish Biodiversity

 The impact of hydropower on fish habitats and migration of fish has proven to be an elusive issue in many
 countries, despite considerable investments in hatcheries and fish-stocking programs on a project-by-project
 basis. In many cases, however, this method has failed to achieve the desired outcomes of maintaining healthy fish
 populations and fish biodiversity in the watersheds. While fish stocking resolves issues related to fish numbers,
 it does not resolve the more significant problem of maintaining fish biodiversity in a given river ecosystem. In
 addition, fish hatcheries, while maintaining the presence of a number of “individuals” in a segment of the
 river, often focus on a single species, mainly one with some human consumption or recreational potential. This
 selective stocking does not provide for a balanced ecosystem.
 Offsets, in particular aquatic offsets for hydropower projects, are gaining traction worldwide. These are measures
 taken to compensate for any residual significant, adverse impacts that cannot be avoided, minimized and/or
 restored, in order to avoid a net loss or net gain of biodiversity. These can be positive management interventions
 such as restoration of degraded habitat or protecting areas with imminent or projected loss of biodiversity.
 Compensatory measures are primarily meant to provide value equivalent to that which has been damaged at the
 same location and, secondarily, provide other environmental value to another place. Any compensatory measure
 should be connected with the negative impact that has been identified and the affected party ought to benefit
 from the measure. Dams on the Reventazón River in Costa Rica and the Chaglla Hydroelectric Project in Peru have
 implemented measures to protect an entire river as an offset.
 The Reventazón Hydropower Project in Costa Rica plans to implement a protected river corridor with no barriers
 to connectivity in a river system that is ecologically similar to that of the Reventazón. This is to compensate for the
 residual impacts of the project on the river, compounded by the cumulative impacts of upstream projects and other
 river uses. Nine major rivers flowing into the Caribbean were evaluated for their characteristics, and the Parismina
 River, which is currently undammed, was chosen. By sacrificing only 5 MW of 10,000 MW, Costa Rica was able to
 allow for a free-flowing river and thereby meet both hydropower development and biodiversity conservation goals.

                         affected geogs. However, the information is not consistent (e.g., Gasetsho Gom geog, only about 3.35 acres of chuzhing (paddy field)
                         and about 0.75 acres of kamzhing (dry land) are likely to be affected; in Daga geog, temporary acquisition of kamzhing (dry land),

                                        because of fuelwood use in camps.
                                        Positive impacts: possibilities for cash-generating activities; sale of farm products;
                                        improved flow of money, which boosts the local economy; improved roads;

Analysis of Key Issues for Management of Environmental and Social Impacts



                               Box 4-3  Leveraging the Benefits from Hydropower Development: Experience from Peru

                               The 456 MW Chaglla HEP on the Huallaga River in Peru is financed by equity contributions from Odebrecht and
                               loans from a number of development and commercial banks, including the Inter-American Development Bank
                               (IDB), the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES), and COFIDE (a Development Finance
                               Corporation).
                               The local population in the Huánuco region of northern Peru, between the Andes and the Amazon where the
                               project is located, had high levels of illiteracy and poverty, and maintained traditional forms of livelihoods. To
                               support local communities, Odebrecht Peru first conducted a study to understand the socioeconomic profile
                               of the project area and subsequently carried out an awareness campaign to convey the basics of construction
                               work in hydropower projects, targeted at the general public. Fliers, radio broadcasts, theater groups, illustrated
                               booklets, and the like, were used to encourage local communities to apply for the Creer (“Believe”) Peru
                               program, an innovative professional training program aimed at improving the skills and employability of local
                               communities in civil construction. The program included a basic module to prepare community members for
                               construction work at the jobsite, and a technical module in areas related to civil construction, including carpentry,
                               electrical work, masonry, welding, etc. Once certified, many of the participants were hired for Odebrecht
                               construction projects, and the skills they acquired were universal, thus opening up employment opportunities for
                               them long after the construction phase of the Chaglla project had been completed.

                               Additionally, to support the local supply chain development, Odebrecht also introduced a Business Network
                               Program. The objective of the program was to bring together farmers from the region and local merchants to
                               allow local communities to benefit from the project’s preferred procurement of goods, services, and agricultural
                               products from inside the project ‘s influence zone. A review of local supplier capacities for supplying vegetables,

                           Traditional landholders have been producing wine in the Alto Douro region for some 2,000 years. Since the
                           18th century, the region’s main product, port wine, has been world-famous for its quality. This long tradition
                           of viticulture has produced a cultural landscape of outstanding beauty that reflects its technological, social,
                           and economic evolution. The Alto Douro region was placed on the World Heritage List in 2001, as a Cultural
                           Landscape, encompassing 24,600 hectares and a buffer zone of 225,400 hectares.




                                                                                    

                           In 2008, a National Plan for the concession of 10 hydroelectric projects (HEPs) with high potential was approved.
                           The first project, the Foz Tua Hydroelectric Project, was approved in 2009. Even though the dam and reservoir
                           themselves are sited outside the boundaries of the heritage site, the transmission lines would traverse the
                           site; other lines have already been built. The EIA had a short reference to the transmission lines (stating that
                           they would not affect important bird areas). Opponents of the Foz Tua project (wine growers, NGOs, tourism
                           associations) lodged a complaint against this project with the International Council of Monuments (ICOMOS).
                           In 2012, the World Heritage Committee approved a decision urging the government of Portugal to stop the
                           works. The Committee’s main argument was that the direct impact on the World Heritage site would primarily
                           be a consequence of the proposed transmission lines—the resulting physical loss of part of the landscape would
                           change the way people would experience the landscape, as those lines would affect the pattern, context, and
                           setting of this World Heritage site.

                          Box 4-5  Different Approaches to Benefit Sharing

 Project design and operations: Benefits through flexible infrastructure and integrated resources management,
 for example, multipurpose hydropower projects with different features such as flood control, irrigation, water
 supply, and water quality improvements can help provide a range of benefits to local populations, beyond access
 to electricity.
 Ancillary investments: Physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and other project-related facilities; by
 investing in social infrastructure (e.g., schools, health facilities; community programs aimed at job creation,
 livestock production, income-generating activities, capacity building and training; and watershed protection
 investments, such as catchment treatment, erosion management, afforestation), among others, hydropower
 projects can provide support to local development, beyond providing compensation for the losses.
 Direct payments/transfers: Legally binding transfers (e.g., royalties, taxes, development funds, preferential
 rates, and revenue sharing) are also increasingly being used to share project benefits with local communities. For
 instance, in the case of Nepal, the Chilime Hydropower Project allocated 10 percent equity to residents of the
 Rasuwa District. Two commercial banks provided on-the-spot loans (80% required capital). While the project was
 expecting to sell 960,000 shares to the project-affected population, it was oversubscribed 1.6 times.
 Policies, institutions, and regulatory framework: Legally binding mechanisms (laws, acts, concessions,
 treaties) for distributing benefits can take various forms. For example, in Colombia, the legal framework requires
 financing of development initiatives with contributions from hydropower companies. In particular, Law 56 (1981)
 and Law 99 (1993) requires taxes, fees, and transfers from power generation companies be spent on local and
 regional administrations.
