Conclusions
Salient factors behind the success of this initiative:
   �	   inter-departmental convergence and the political will and framework as prerequisites
   �	   access to information and demystifying science and technology to make these user friendly for the villagers
   �	   a comprehensive and integrated approach to planning water demand and management at relevant scales
   �	   community engagement and strong institutions and systems at local level to ensure equity and sustainability

   With necessary customization the approach and methodology can be potentially applied and upscaled across rain-fed areas of the country.
