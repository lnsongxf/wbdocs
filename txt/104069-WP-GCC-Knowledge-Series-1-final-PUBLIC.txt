    Key Messages

    ■■ Air pollution is a significant cause of death and disease, and associated productivity
       losses.

    ■■ Air pollution load assessments were carried out with the environmental agencies in
       Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar, as part of the Gulf Environmental Partnership and Action
       Program to identify key challenges and solutions.

    ■■ Detailed technical models showed that vehicles and power generation are the major
       sources for the fine PM emissions while re-suspended dust dominates for the coarse
       particulate matter emissions.

    ■■ Common challenges identified include: natural dust as a key pollutant, followed by
       refineries, power plants, desalination units, transport (road and shipping); limited
       monitoring activities; lack of a common air quality index methodology in the Gulf
       Cooperation Council (GCC) region; and lack of a common data assimilation platform.

    ■■ Strengthening of the national air quality management systems should allow countries
       to approach the issue through collaboration and regional programs.

    ■■ The recently submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) by all
       GCC countries provides a golden opportunity to further explore both at the sectoral
       and cross sectoral level opportunities to strengthen our current engagement.
