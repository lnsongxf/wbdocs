This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at th e bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        The application for an electricity connection can be submitted to EDL by
        the construction company or by the building owner (it is more common
        that the construction company submits the application).

        Usually the application is submitted in person with attached documents
        in hard copies. The following documents have to be attached (1)

      The electrical contractor/construction company in charge of the external
      connection works prepares a detailed technical design of the external
      connection and an installation plan.

      When the electrical contractor/construction company submits the
      technical design to EDL for approval, registration documents for the chief
      engineer have to be submitted as well. The construction company must

      company has to register a chief electrical engineer for every project it
      carries out.

      The approval of the technical design is granted together with the
      proposal of the consumption fees so arrangements for the supply of
      electricity are completed at this stage as well.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses —such as by         have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in Lao PDR (table 8.1)?

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if
        such agreements cover more than 50% of the

Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
