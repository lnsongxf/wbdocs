Motivated by the significant decline in citizen’s trust in governments over the past decades,
this paper explores how policy decision makers and researchers can use social media
analytics to investigate “trust”, specifically the relationship among trust in government, trust
in state institutions and citizens’ collective behavior. Analysis of these complex socio -political
issues using online social data requires a human in the inference loop while also benefiting
from computational methods to handle large amounts of unstructured data and the inference
of relevant data features. This project implemented an exploratory framework from data
collection to data analysis using, among other methods, a set of tools developed by project
team members that integrate visualization, interactivity and machine learning. Visual
analytics provided the team with knowledge of interactive methods and investigative
methodological approaches while predictive modeling provided methods to operationalize
difficult concepts such as “trust” through a proxy of sentiment classification of opinion in social
media data. To highlight the power of a mixed-initiative visual analytics-data science
approach, this technical note describes the exploratory analysis work undertaken for analysis
of collections of Tweets from Brazil, and describes further work that conceives data science
methods to assist the analysis process by supporting definition of constructs of concepts of
interest using social media data, and assisting the evaluation of evidence for hypotheses
evaluation in an interactive-machine learning fashion. The outcomes of this project aim to
support social sciences inquiry using observational social media data and World Bank
operations.
