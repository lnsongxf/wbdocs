            The International Bill of Human Rights and IFC Sustainability Framework

IFC’s Sustainability Framework – consisting of the Policy on Environmental and Social
Sustainability, Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, and Access
to Information Policy 1 – were released publicly on August 1, 2011, with an effective date of
January 1, 2012. This revised and updated Framework, which replaced the 2006 version, was
the result of an extensive global consultation and engagement process, extending from
September 2009 until May 2011. 2

The external context has evolved rapidly in certain thematic areas, including increased attention
to climate change, ecosystem services, financial intermediaries, and human rights. With regard
to the latter, the consultation process confirmed that human rights are now a major sustainability
issue for business and their stakeholders. Much work has been carried out in the recent years to
articulate the responsibility of businesses in relation to human rights, including the work of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and
Transnational Corporations and other Business Enterprises (“SRSG”), Professor John Ruggie.

The 2006 version of the Sustainability Framework supported many important rights in the
business context, such as labor rights, rights of Indigenous Peoples, and right to health (through
clean environment). It also supported due diligence, as underscored by the SRSG, by
recognizing that project risk management includes management of environmental, social, labor,
and other related risks. The revised and updated Framework builds on this foundation, seeking
to support and give further concrete meaning to human rights in a manner consistent with IFC’s
overall approach to environmental and social sustainability issues.

The following paragraphs describe the approach taken by IFC, as reflected in the revised and
updated Sustainability Framework.

     •    IFC’s commitment to respect human rights in its business activities is captured in the
          Sustainability Policy, while IFC clients’ responsibility to respect human rights is captured
          in Performance Standard 1. Other provisions in the Performance Standards also
          support various human rights relevant to business.

     •    Many human rights risks for business can be effectively addressed through social and
          environmental considerations. As a result, the focus of the Performance Standards
          continues to be on social and environmental issues. IFC decided not to create a
          separate standard on human rights, but instead chose to strengthen the environmental
          and social requirements in the Standards within their existing structure.

     •    To understand whether the Standards had relevant human rights gaps, IFC reviewed
          various reference documents, 3 and performed an analysis against applicable criteria in

1
  The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability (“Sustainability Policy”) defines IFC’s responsibility in supporting project
performance in partnership with clients. The Access to Information Policy defines IFC’s obligations to disclose information about
itself as an institution and its activities. The Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (“Performance
Standards”) define clients' roles and responsibilities for managing their projects and the requirements for receiving and retaining IFC
support. In addition, a series of Guidance Notes have been prepared as companion documents to IFC's Performance Standards
and provide additional guidance to clients (and IFC staff) in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities under the standards. The
Guidance Notes focus mainly on implementation issues.

                                                                                                                                     1
          such documents. In addition, IFC analyzed high-level policy issues, such as climate
          change, ecosystem services, water, gender, and human trafficking, which also provided
          opportunities to strengthen human rights. Overall, IFC confirmed that the multiple
          dimensions of rights in economic, social, and cultural areas have already been well
          addressed in the Standards (e.g., labor rights, health/pollution prevention, involuntary
          resettlement, cultural heritage). IFC also confirmed that the Standards cover aspects of
          rights in civil and political areas that are relevant for IFC’s business (e.g., community
          engagement, security personnel, grievance mechanisms, Indigenous Peoples). The
          concept of vulnerable groups, relevant to both types of rights, is also incorporated in the
          Standards. The depth of coverage varies from right to right.

     •    Some gaps identified in the gap analysis process were addressed as new requirements
          in the Standards due to their relevance for business activities in all sectors and regions.
          Other gaps are more relevant to implementation issues and have been addressed in the
          accompanying Guidance Notes. Other sector-specific issues fall more directly within the
          applicable industry guidelines (in the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines) and
          could be addressed in their next update process.

     •    Gaps in the following areas were identified but not specifically addressed:

               o     Rights indicated by Human Rights Translated: A Business Reference Guide 4 as
                     unlikely to be relevant in the business context, which include:
                          Right not to be subjected to imprisonment for inability to fulfill a contract
                          Right to be free from retroactive criminal law
                          Right to recognition as a person before the law

               o     Other rights indicated by Human Rights Translated that are only likely to be
                     relevant to a specific sector, but not all, or to a very specific situation, including:
                          Right to freedom from war propaganda and freedom from incitement to
                            racial, religious, or national hatred (relevant to media companies)
                          Right to participate in public life (relevant to media companies)
                          Rights of aliens to due process when facing expulsion (may be relevant to
                            employees and other stakeholders)

               o     In IFC’s experience, although not addressed in the above document (because it
                     covers the Covenants and not the Universal Declaration), the right to seek
                     asylum from persecution in other countries is also unlikely to be relevant in the
                     business context. 5

               o     By setting a performance standard regarding a company’s conduct in relation to
                     certain stakeholders (e.g., communities, vulnerable people, Indigenous Peoples),
                     the Performance Standards address their rights. However, a company’s conduct
                     in relation to other stakeholders groups (e.g., national or municipal governments,
                     the judiciary, political parties, and interest groups) are not addressed, since these
                     issues tend not to be understood as environmental or social sustainability issues;
                     as a result, rights that are relevant in such company conduct are not addressed.

  In many cases, the right to have a nationality is also unlikely to be relevant in the business context, with the exception of workers’
passports being withheld [See GN 2].

    Right to life       UDHR 3                   The different components of this right are addressed in a number of Standards.
                                                 Adequate consideration of human health issues, as well as preparation and
                        ICCPR 6                  response to emergency situations that could harm people and the environment,
                                                 are required in PS1. PS2 protects workers’ rights and promotes safe and healthy
                                                 working conditions, including in a client’s supply chain when there is an eminent
                                                 danger of death or serious life-threatening harm to its workers. PS2 also
                                                 prohibits child labor and requires the client to consider the adverse impacts
                                                 associated with supply chains where there is a high risk of child labor or
                                                 significant occupational, health, or safety issues (see also PS1). PS3 addresses
                                                 adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or reducing
                                                 pollution from project activities. PS4 requires the client to avoid adverse impacts
                                                 to communities resulting from a project’s use of natural resources or from
                                                 alteration of natural resources, diminishing communities’ enjoyment of
                                                 ecosystem services such as water (see also PS6). PS4 also addresses
                                                 communities’ exposure to health and safety risks and impacts arising from
                                                 project activities, community aspects of emergency preparedness and response,
                                                 and risks relating to the use of security personnel, based on national laws as well
                                                 as international human rights principles and humanitarian law.

 The International Bill of Rights consists of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civic and
Political Rights (ICCPR) the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the optional protocols to the
ICCPR. The numbers in this column refer to the articles of these texts. Since overarching principles (UDHR 1 and 2, ICCPR 2-5, and ICESCR
2-5) cannot be applied individually but only in conjunction with specific rights (Human Rights Translated: A Business Reference Guide, 2008,
Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, International Business Leaders Forum, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and
UN Global Compact Office, p.7 and 89), they are not explicitly addressed in this paper.

(including          ICCPR 9        with a special attention to women and children. PS2 also requires the client to

Right not to be   UDHR 5    This right is addressed within and outside the workplace. PS2 recognizes the
subjected to                benefits of a constructive worker-management relationship (fair treatment and
torture, cruel,   ICCPR 7   safe and healthy working conditions). PS2 also requires the client to prevent and
inhuman and/or              address harassment, intimidation, and/or exploitation of workers, with a special
degrading                   attention to women and children. In addition, PS2 requires the client to not
treatment or                employ child labor, forced labor, or trafficked persons, and requires the client to
punishment                  consider the adverse impacts associated with supply chains where there is a
                            high risk of child labor or forced labor (see also PS1). It also includes protections
                            for migrant workers. PS4 addresses risks and impacts relating to the use of
                            security personnel, based on national law as well as international human rights
                            principles and humanitarian law.

                                                   are addressed as a general requirement in PS2 and in specific situations relating

Right to a fair   UDHR 10    According to Human Rights Translated: “It is rare that the activities of a company
trial                        would have any direct impact upon this right. Companies could negatively impact
                  ICCPR 14   on this right if they attempt to corrupt the judicial process, for example, by bribing
                             judges or jurors, or destroying relevant evidence” (p.53). PS1 and PS2 require
                             that the grievance mechanisms do not impede access to judicial or
                             administrative remedies. In addition, PS7 supports customary, cultural,

  According to Human Rights Translated: “Companies’ activities may impact on the right [to freedom of movement] if, for example, a
community has to be relocated because of company operations, which restricts the freedom of those people to choose where they live.
Development-related relocation is permissible only if absolutely necessary and so long as it is not conducted arbitrarily or in an unreasonable
manner. To this end, freedom of movement must be recognised and considered as part of any discussions concerning relocation.
Resettlement should be lawfully achieved after consultation with, notice and compensation for, and ideally consent from, those affected”

                                       which requires the client to identify groups and communities that may be directly
                                       and differentially or disproportionately affected by the project because of their
                                       disadvantaged or vulnerable status. PS1 and PS2 extend the client’s
                                       responsibility to considering the impacts associated with the supply chain where
                                       there is a high risk of child labor and/or forced labor. PS4 requires the client to

                                       employ child labor, forced labor, or trafficked persons, and requires the client to
                                       consider the adverse impacts associated with supply chains where there is a
                                       high risk of child labor or forced labor, or significant occupational, health and

Right to own   UDHR 17   This right is addressed from different angles: access to natural resources, land
property                 acquisition and resettlement, and cultural heritage. Adequate consideration of
                         relevant risks and impacts is addressed in PS1. PS4 requires the client to avoid
                         adverse impacts to communities resulting from a project’s use of natural
                         resources or from alteration of natural resources, diminishing communities’
                         enjoyment of ecosystem services such as water (see also PS6). PS5 aims to
                         mitigate adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition or
                         restrictions on land use, and to avoid or at least reduce displacement, wherever
                         feasible, by exploring alternative project designs. In addition, it requires specific
                         measures to improve, or restore, the livelihoods and standards of living of
                         displaced persons. PS7 recognizes the close ties that Indigenous Peoples have
                         with their lands and natural resources and provides specific requirements in case
                         of relocation from lands subject to traditional ownership or under customary use.
                         PS8 protects cultural heritage from the adverse impacts of projects activities and
                         supports its preservation. PS7 and PS8 also support the equitable sharing of
                         benefits from the use of cultural heritage in business activities.

 Right to                   UDHR 18    This right is addressed within and outside the workplace. PS1 requires the client
 freedom of                            to identify groups and communities that may be directly and differentially or
 thought,                   ICCPR 18   disproportionately affected by the project because of their disadvantaged or

 conscience, and                       vulnerable status stemming from, among other factors, religion. PS2 sets
 religion                              specific requirements on non-discrimination and equal opportunity in the
                                       workplace. PS7 addresses adverse impacts resulting from project activities on
                                       the livelihoods, or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual use of land that define the
                                       identity and community of the Indigenous Peoples. PS8 refers cultural heritage

Right to         UDHR 19    The different components of this right are addressed at the Policy level and in a
freedom of                  number of Standards. IFC’s and clients’ responsibilities regarding access to
opinion,         ICCPR 19   information are addressed in the Policy on Environmental and Social
information,                Sustainability and the Access to Information Policy. Clients’ responsibilities on
and expression              this issue are further elaborated in a number of Standards. PS1 ensures that the
                            Affected Stakeholders are identified, consulted, and informed, and can freely
                            convene and express their views on project risks, impacts, and proposed
                            management system, including objections to the project (during the consultation
                            process or through the project grievance mechanism). Specific requirements for
                            Affected Stakeholders are provided in the following situations: Emergency
                            preparedness and response, and security arrangements and acts of security
                            personnel (PS4); Land Acquisition and Resettlement (PS5); Legally protected
                            and designated areas (PS6); Indigenous Peoples (PS7) and Cultural Heritage
                            (PS8). PS2 ensures that workers are provided with documented information
                            regarding their rights under national labor and employment law and any
                            applicable collective agreements. PS2 also requires the client to not restrict
                            workers from developing alternative means to express their grievances and
                            protect their rights where national law substantially restrict workers’
                            organizations, including through a grievance mechanism. Specific requirements
                            regarding consultations with and provision of information to public authorities,
                            workers and their organizations in case of retrenchment are provided in PS2.

Right to     UDHR 20   According to Human Rights Translated: “Governments are in the most obvious
freedom of             position to violate the freedom of assembly. However, there have been cases
assembly     ICCPR21   where companies have been accused of complicity in government actions to
                       quell demonstrations against company operations” (p.61). This right is also
                       addressed in PS1, which seeks to ensure that the Affected Stakeholders can
                       freely convene and express their views, including objections to the project. In
                       addition, PS4 addresses the risks and impacts relating to the use of security
                       personnel, based on national law as well as international human rights principles
                       and humanitarian law. In particular, PS4 requires that the use of force will not be
                       sanctioned except when used for preventive and defensive purposes in
                       proportion to the nature of the treat.

                               addresses adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or
                               reducing pollution from project activities. PS4 requires the client to avoid adverse
                               impacts to communities resulting from a project’s use of natural resources or
                               from alteration of natural resources (including landslides and floods), diminishing

                               displacement, wherever feasible, by exploring alternative project designs. In
                               addition, it requires specific measures to improve, or restore, the livelihoods and
                               standards of living of displaced persons. PS7 requires the client avoid adverse
                               impacts on the livelihood of project on communities of Indigenous Peoples or
                               when avoidance is not possible, to reduce, restore, and/or compensate for such

Right to health   UDHR 25     This right is addressed within and outside the workplace. Adequate preparation
                              for and response to emergency situations that could harm people and the
                  ICESCR 12   environment is required in PS1. PS1 also addresses adequate consideration of
                              relevant risks and impacts, including those relating to human health. PS2
                              requires that the client provide workers with a safe and healthy work
                              environment, taking into account inherent risks in its particular sector and
                              specific classes of hazards in the client’s work areas, including physical,
                              chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. PS2 also requires the client to
                              consider the adverse impacts associated with supply chains where there are
                              significant occupational, health, and safety issues. In addition, PS2 ensures that,
                              when the client or other third parties working directly or indirectly on the project
                              provide accommodation to workers, the client put in place and implement
                              policies on the quality and management of the accommodation and provision of
                              basic services including water, sanitation, and, in certain cases, availability of
                              medical care, based on the principles of non-discrimination and equal
                              opportunity. PS3 addresses adverse impacts on human health and the
                              environment by avoiding or reducing pollution from project activities. PS4
                              requirements address communities’ exposure to health and safety risks and
                              impacts arising from project activities.

Right to    UDHR 26            This right is addressed principally in the workplace through PS2, which requires
education                      the client to base the employment relationship on the principles of equal
            ICESCR 13 and 14   opportunity and fair treatment, and to not discriminate with respect to any
                               aspects of the employment relationship including, among other things, access to
                               training. PS 2 also promotes training of workers as a way to prevent accidents,
                               injury, and disease arising from, associated with, or occurring in the course of
                               work. In addition, PS2 requires the client to not employ child labor, forced labor,
                               or trafficked persons, and requires the client to consider the adverse impacts
                               associated with supply chains where there is a high risk of child labor or forced
                               labor (see also PS1). Additional guidance to companies delivering educational
                               services is provided at the Guidance Notes level (GN2 and GN4).

determination               Adequate consideration of relevant risks and impacts, including those relating to
                 ICESCR 1   ecosystem functions and access to water resources, are addressed in PS1. PS4
                            requires the client to avoid adverse impacts to communities resulting from a
                            project’s use of natural resources or from alteration of natural resources,
                            diminishing communities’ enjoyment of ecosystem services such as water (see
                            also PS6). PS5 aims to mitigate adverse social and economic impacts from land
                            acquisition or restrictions on land use, and to avoid or at least reduce
                            displacement, wherever feasible, by exploring alternative project designs. In
                            addition, it requires specific measures to improve, or restore, the livelihoods and
                            standards of living of displaced persons (see also PS7 for requirements related
                            to relocation of Indigenous Peoples). PS6 requires that, where there is a loss or
                            diminution of an ecosystem service upon which the project depends, or where
                            the company’s project-related impacts are likely to negatively impact the
                            availability of an ecosystem service to Affected Stakeholders, the client identify
                            and prioritize those services as part of the risks and impacts identification
                            process. PS7 requires the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of Indigenous
                            Peoples, under certain circumstances. PS7 and PS8 set specific requirements
                            where a project proposes to use the cultural resources, knowledge, innovations,
                            or practices of Indigenous Peoples and local communities embodying traditional
                            lifestyles, respectively, for commercials purposes. PS8 requires the client protect
                            cultural heritage from adverse impacts of projects activities and support its
                            preservation.

 Right of                  ICCPR 10                  According to Human Rights Translated: “The activities of companies that operate
 detained                                            detention facilities or provide prison management services are those most likely
 persons to                                          to impact on these rights” (p.25). Sector-specific issues are addressed in the
 humane                                              applicable industry guidelines of the Environmental Health and Safety
 treatment                                           Guidelines, as appropriate. At a general level, PS4 ensures that the
                                                     safeguarding of personnel and property is carried out in a legitimate manner that

 Right not to be           ICCPR 11                  According to Human Rights Translated: “The activities of companies are unlikely
 subjected to                                        to impact directly on this right, but they may need to respond in cases where
 imprisonment                                        employees or other stakeholders are affected” (p.29).

 Right of aliens           ICCPR 13                  According to Human Rights Translated: “It is unlikely that the activities of a
 to due process                                      company would have any direct impact upon this right. However, where
 when facing                                         employees or other stakeholders are adversely affected, they may have a
 expulsion                                           positive role to play in assisting those persons” (p.35).


 Rights of                 ICCPR 27                  This right is addressed within and outside the workplace. PS1 requires the client
 minorities                                          to identify groups and communities that may be directly and differentially or
                                                     disproportionately affected by the project because of their disadvantaged or
                                                                       11
                                                     vulnerable status . PS2 provides general requirements about non-discrimination
                                                     and equal opportunity at work, which is also applicable to migrant workers. PS7
                                                     ensures that the development process fosters full respect for the human rights
                                                     and the dignity, aspirations, cultures, and natural resource-based livelihoods of
                                                     Indigenous Peoples. PS7 also requires the client to mitigate adverse impacts of
                                                     project on communities of Indigenous Peoples, or when avoidance is not

                                                     PS7 and PS8 set specific requirements where a project proposes to use the

                                                     and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles, respectively, for
