PREFACE


In the 14 years since the Republic of Myanmar committed to the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), access to and enrollment in primary school has increased significantly. This
is a notable achievement. The next important steps for the Government of the Union of
Myanmar are to establish learning achievement baselines for its primary school students and
to build an internal capacity in the Ministry of Education to monitor and report on learning
improvements over time. This snapshot (from schools within the Department of Basic
Education, DBE 3) of students’ current levels of reading ability in early grades—and factors
associated with reading acquisition—is part of this effort to establish measurable learning
standards and build institutional capacity to continuously monitor learning achievement.

This document briefly summarizes the state of education in Myanmar, the information needed
by stakeholders, and the way the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), administered
in Yangon, Myanmar (DEB 3) addresses these needs. It reviews the most relevant education
theories on reading acquisition in the early grades of primary education and how they inform
the development of the Myanmar EGRA tool.

This document describes the results of this study and the insights they offer about the
characteristics of schools and teachers that can affect students’ success in learning to read.
The final section proposes recommendations to the Ministry of Education on how to link
EGRA results to current policy discussions on language and literacy in the early grades of
primary education.

The Myanmar EGRA study is the result of the government’s commitment to broaden its
knowledge base on the state of reading in early grades. It also identifies the characteristics
of students, teachers, and schools that can affect how well young students in Myanmar learn
to read, which can serve as a guide in identifying the most effective interventions to help
students acquire reading skills. This study was possible thanks to the support of officials and
staff in the Ministry of Education, as well as the school principals, teachers, and the 1,681
students who enthusiastically participated in the survey.

This report was written by a team led by Marie-Helene Cloutier (Economist, World Bank)
and Souhila Messaoud-Galusi (Language and Literacy Specialist, World Bank), and included
Fernando Cartwright (psychometrician, consultant), Stephanie de Silva (econometrician,
consultant) and Myrna Machuca-Sierra (Education Specialist, World Bank). They were deftly
guided by Luis Benveniste (Education Practice Manager, World Bank), James A. Stevens
(Task Team Leader, World Bank), and Lars M. Sondergaard (Program Leader, World Bank).

Save the Children (Myanmar) organized and managed the field work for the study under the
guidance of Mar Mar Thwin (Education Program Manager, Save the Children). The authors
thank Mar Mar and her dedicated team, the members of the EGRA Steering Committee and
Technical Group, and—last, but not least—Dr. Thein Lwin and Daw Ohnmar Tin, the two
dedicated local consultants without whom none of this would have been possible. The team
would also like to extend its appreciation to the peer reviewers at the World Bank for their
thoughtful guidance and comments: Cornelia Jesse (Senior Education Specialist), Nathalie
Lahire (Senior Economist), and Marguerite Clarke (Senior Education Specialist). Finally,
the authors are grateful to Prateek Tandon (Senior Economist), Abdoulaye Seck (Country
Manager for Myanmar), and Xiaoyan Liang (Senior Education Specialist) at the World Bank for
the additional benefits their comments provided.

This first Early Grade Reading Assessment in Myanmar and the production of this report
would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian Government.

     	 There are only hypotheses, but no convincing evidence as to why subtasks 2 and 3 appear inappropriate. These subtasks may be particularly 	
	      difficult for students in Myanmar because of 1) the structure of the Myanmar language, which makes sounding the letter particularly difficult;
	      2) the pedagogical approaches used in surveyed schools (i.e., very little focus on phoneme awareness and letter sounds); and 3) the

   	 Transparent orthographies have more direct, regular correspondences between their sounds and letters. With deep or opaque orthographies, 	
	 the correspondence between sounds and letters is less consistent, and letters or certain groups of letters often have different sounds in 		
	 different words. See P.H.K. Seymour, L. Aro, and J.M. Erskine, 2003, “Foundation Literacy Acquisition in European Orthographies,” British

To assess the relationships of lower level skills                          and grade (for Grades 2-3). For all three higher level skills,

regressions (one for each of the three higher level                        correlated, except for letter naming (negatively correlated
skills) were run separately for Grade 1 and Grades 2                       with oral reading fluency).

   	 The letter sound and initial sound subtasks were not used for the composite score, given the reliability issues identified in Section 5.2. The letter
