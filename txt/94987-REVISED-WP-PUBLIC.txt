     commitments related to the financial protection component,
     including the formulation of guidelines for a financial risk

8  Strategic Framework for the Financial Management of Disaster Risk




Strategic Pillars of the Strategic Framework

T
    he MEF defined five strategic pillars in its Strategic Framework for managing fiscal risk due to disasters asso-
    ciated with the impact of natural hazards. The intent was to present approaches for reducing fiscal risk when
    disasters occur. The strategic pillars recognize financial management of disaster risk as a component of both fiscal
management policy and policies on integrated disaster risk management. They are as follows:
1.	    Identification, quantification, and understanding of fiscal risk due to disasters
2.	    Incorporation of disaster risk analysis in the planning of public investment
3.	    Formulation of components for developing and implementing risk retention and transfer instruments
4.	    Development of the domestic insurance market
5.	    Strengthening of the DICRE so it can fulfill its role in designing and implementing financial protection strategies
As activities are developed along these five pillars, the government’s capacity to respond to disasters will improve, and
the long-term fiscal and social impacts of these events will be mitigated.
