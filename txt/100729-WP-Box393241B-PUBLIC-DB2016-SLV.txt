THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 6,383,752

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

Salvador is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Sociedades Anónimas de Capital
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through           Variable
collaboration with relevant local professionals and
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available          Paid-in minimum capital requirement: USD 100
information on business entry in that economy.                 City: San Salvador
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                 Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       obtain deposit evidence or certified check.

       At least 5% of the initial start-up capital has to be shown and evidenced
       to a Salvadoran public notary. This capital has to be shown through a
       certified check payable to the name of the company, for the amount for
       which the company will initiate its operations. The check will be
       deposited in the company’s new account once the deed is duly                      1 day             no charge

       and documents of the company’s legal representative.

      Register with the Registry of Commerce and publication and
      legalization of books

      The Registry of Commerce Act establishes fees for the registration of
      companies. The entrepreneur can also register at the Commercial
      registry with the Ministry of Labor and the Salvadorian Institute of
      Social Security (“trámite integral”). Article 63 establishes different fees
      for the company's business license according to the company's initial
      capital, from USD 2,000 to USD 57,150 the fee is USD 91.43; from USD
      57,151 to USD 114,286 the fee is USD 137.14; from USD 114,287 to USD
      228,572 the fee is USD 228.57; and, if the company's initial capital
      exceeds USD 228,572, the company has to pay USD 11.43 for every USD
      100,000 or fraction of it, but cannot exceed USD 11,428.57.

      The registration fees are the following: USD 0.57 for every USD 114.28 +

      In addition, every founder partner must filled form F-210 (USD 1.25) to
      obtain a Salvadoran Tax Card (Numero de Identificacion

      registration or after registration before the Ministry of Treasury
      (Decreto Legislativo 227 del 12 de Diciembre de 2009 Ley del NIT).

      The pre-registration can be done online (http://miempresa.gob.sv).

      and it is required to visit the registry to obtain the final documents.

        Obtain construction line and site qualification

        To request a construction line, BuildCo must present the deed of
        ownership and a topographical plan with geodesic coordinates.
        This is required to ensure that public works (street or highway)
        will not affect the land. The construction line is the document
        that defines the alignment of new construction with the
        Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (AMSS) road network. It
        describes the right of way, retract area, and transversal section of
        the road projects to be developed, or widening to be undertaken
        in the San Salvador metropolitan area. The document is valid for          11 days             no charge
   2
        5 years. For San Salvador, this document should be requested at
        the Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San Salvador
        (OPAMSS).

        The site or land qualification defines whether the proposed
        construction is allowed on that land for the use projected. The
        compatibility of land use is based on reference to the soil matrix,
        as defined in the General Plan of Zoning in force for AMSS,
        which indicates the requirements for project development. This
        document is valid for 12 months and should be requested from
        OPAMSS, the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of

      Time and cost have been calculated on the assumption that a
      special service was used so that documents can be obtained in
      half the time if a premium (double the cost) is paid. The silence-
      is-consent rule applies to this procedure. Approvals are granted
      automatically if the applicant does not hear from OPAMSS in 30
      days.

      Agency: OPAMSS (Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San
      Salvador)



      Obtain approval of environmental form (formulario
      ambiental)

      According to Acuerdo Ejecutive No. 23 (Environmental Law on
      the Classification of Activities, Works and Projects) published in
      the Diario Oficial No 162, Tomo No 380 from September 1st
      2008, the warehouse in the Doing Business case study would fall
      under Category 'A' which is exempt from an Environmental
      Impact Study. In this case, all that is required is for the architect
      or engineer to fill out an Environmental Form and submit it to          21 days       no charge
3
      MARN (Ministry of Environment). The Form outlines the project
      and its potential environmental impact. MARN will then decide if
      the work can be considered exempt from the full impact study. In
      the Doing Business case study, the project would most likely be
      exempt from the full impact study.



      Agency: Ministry of Environment



      * Obtain zoning or road construction revision

      The zoning or road construction revision should be requested
      from (Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San Salvador,
      OPAMSS), the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of
      Housing. The document verifies the compliance of the planned
      construction with the requirements established for the use of
      soil, as established under the General Plan of Zoning for the
      Metropolitan Area of San Salvador and its standing bylaws.              21 days       no charge

      Compliance with this procedure includes verification of the
      internal road network, dwelling spaces, circulation of pedestrians,
      recreational areas, and the provision of equipment.

      utility (ANDA). The utility defines the place of sewage discharge
      and where the requested amount of water is served. In order to
      obtain the feasibility study, BuildCo should receive an on-site
      inspection by the national water and sewage utility (ANDA).



      Agency: ANDA



      * Request and obtain an analysis of the feasibility of
      connecting to electricity

      At this point, BuildCo applies for the point of delivery of electric
      power and indicates the amount requested. This request should
      be placed with the local private power company (in this case, AES
      El Salvador). In order to obtain the feasibility study, BuildCo         7 days        USD 73

      should receive an on-site inspection by a local private power
      company (AES El Salvador).


      Agency: AES El Salvador



      * Request and obtain an analysis of the feasibility of having
      rainwater drainage

      BuildCo must submit a request for the feasibility of rainwater
      drainage study, which is performed by the OPAMSS. This
      municipal entity defines the place where the rainwater will be
      discharged. The request is submitted to the OPAMSS, the
      Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of Housing. In order to
      obtain the feasibility study, BuildCo should receive an on-site
      inspection by the Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San
      Salvador.                                                              14 days       USD 372
7

      As of 2010, the feasibility analysis fee is USD 0.20 per sq. m of
      land.
      If the fast-track option is chosen the procedure cost is doubled.




      Agency: OPAMSS (Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San

      documentation indicated in this Regulation. Inspectors from
      OPAMSS must visit at least once a month, unless the OPAMSS
      suggests having more frequent inspections. Inspectors must
      periodically submit reports of their visits and will be jointly
      responsible with the Director of the construction works, if they
      do not report the corresponding anomalies.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      The public deed is filed at the Register of Property to be recorded under

      legal requirements, in 2 - 4 weeks. The registry has to check with the
      Ministry of Finance ("Hacienda") if the parties are Tax solvent. In addition
      to reforms at the registry set out by the Law on Standard Procedures of
      August 2004, an electronic system is currently being introduced and,
      once fully functional, is expected to reduce the registration time. In
      addition, a special service is available (mainly used by banks, law firms or
      companies). Upon signing a special agreement with the registry, certain 14-28 days (10-

      in exchange for a premium payment. The payment is a fixed amount
      determined according to a cost table. The amount is usually
      automatically withdrawn from a special running account at the registry.
      At the time of signing the agreement, the user sets up this account,
      depositing a certain amount (not more than US$ 100). The agreement
      has to be renewed on an annual basis. This service is not taken into
      account here, since it is only one transaction.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                               After Mirage’s default, the most likely scenario for BizBank would be to start a
                                foreclosure proceeding in order sale the estate used as a collateral. Mirage
                              would not be able to request any suspension of the enforcement action to avoid
                                      foreclosure because the law does not provide for this possibility.

                             In a foreclosure procedure based on the Civil Procedure Code, the creditor would

                              an auctioneer to sell the debtor's assets pledged as collateral in a public auction.
                                The Court would subsequently validate the distrib ution of the debtor’s assets

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
