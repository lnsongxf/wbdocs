     21	 According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) standards, an improved drinking-water source is defined as one that, by nature of its construction
         or through active intervention, is protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter. Access to improved
         water supply services is thus defined as the number of people with access to an improved source of drinking water with a minimum level of quality
         and quantity. Similarly, an improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact. Access to
         improved sanitation is thus defined as the number of people with access to an improved sanitation facility.
     22	 According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) 2015 data, LAC presents over 90% access of improved water and 83% access to improved
         sanitation solutions.

         cases, except for Peru where indigenous people (IPs) are defined by mother language of the household head. In Bolivia only individuals older than
         15 were asked if they self-identified as indigenous; thus the reported value extrapolates the percentage of indigenous population in the segment 15

     applicability of the Toolkit (for more information,                             questions WSS practitioners should consider

                       Respect for Indigenous Peoples’ Unique World View
        02
                       Each indigenous group has a specific “cosmovision” or world view, i.e., “the structured view of nature
                       and the universe in relation to man”34 that is rooted in a shared ancestral experience. This world vision
                       has emerged over time from Indigenous peoples’ interactions with their land, environment and the
                       associated stories they have passed down over generations.

                       This world view guides Indigenous peoples’ relationships to each other, their community, their
                       environment, their governance systems, concept of time, and resilience in often very challenging
                       natural environments. Their millennial knowledge transferred from one generation to the next is what
                       has equipped them to survive and thrive within these environments with little or no external intervention,
                       so this knowledge is in many cases specifically adapted to the local environment and deeply held.
                       For successful engagement with Indigenous peoples and a joint development process to improve
                       their quality of life, it is essential to understand how this world view will influence a community’s
                       organization, decision making, engagement with internal and external actors, timeframes, behaviors
                       and belief system around water, sanitation and hygiene, among other basic services.35

                       At the moment of intervention identification, the important aspects to consider are the Indigenous
                       group’s organization at the national, regional and communal level and any protocols to engage
                       these actors. During intervention preparation, preliminary consultations and desk research can help
                       incorporate relevant decision-making rules and participation norms in the engagement strategy. The
                       more detailed design of a specific project’s management and technological characteristics should take
                       into account results from the consultation process about a community’s preferences and traditional
                       knowledge. Specific guidance on how to incorporate a specific Indigenous community’s cosmovision
                       into an intervention is outlined throughout this Toolkit.

           	 Does the Government include within its administrative structure a Ministry, Vice Ministry or
             agency that is mandated to promote Indigenous peoples rights and policies in the Country?
           	 Does this agency have any specific policy, strategy or dialogue with Indigenous peoples that
             would be relevant or could serve as a platform for WSS policy-setting, service provision or
             engagement with Indigenous authorities?
           	 Does the Government have a specialized approach or sector strategy regarding basic services,

           	 Who is the rural WSS sector institution? Is it well-structured and does it have a decentralized
             presence close to Indigenous territories? Does the institution have experience working in
             Indigenous communities? If not, can the project strengthen the rural WSS institutionally towards

                    representing Indigenous peoples’ interests emphasized their desire to be involved in decision-
                    making regarding the screening and selection of targeted Indigenous territories.
                  	 The scope of discussions that should take place early on with national organizations include:
                    consultation on sector policies and strategies, national intervention design, safeguard approaches,
                    identification of sub-regions or territorial beneficiary areas, operational strategies, and roles in

                    Indigenous areas.

                  	 At this level, organizations or territorial level governments can also play a critical role in supporting
                    the prioritization of beneficiary communities because they have closer and more regular interactions

                          Key questions:


            	 Who is responsible for intervention targeting mechanisms, project cycle definition and
              implementation, and, finally, provision of technical assistance and institutional support once the
              system is in operation? Can their responsibilities be strengthened through the intervention?
            	 If Indigenous organizations and/or beneficiaries are not participating in the WSS service

              above?
            	 Are there other national Indigenous organizations or NGOs that are active in the sector but do
              not officially represent Indigenous peoples? If so, do they have a bias, experience, or affiliation
              with certain Indigenous groups or regions or do they demonstrate a capacity and understanding
              of Indigenous peoples at a national level? What are their potential roles in supporting strategic
              engagement on overall policy and strategy issues and/or investment prioritization and service
              delivery?
            	 Are there other actors, such as local farmers, non-indigenous communities, or concessionaires
              that could threaten the project design, in particular the water source, and implementation?
            	 Are there local dynamics that could undermine participatory processes and project success and

Institutions can strengthen their implementation
teams by: hiring specialized consultants, collaborating
with an organization that has this expertise, or
implementing a special training program for the
existing engineering and social teams. For example,
in Paraguay, Asunción-based Servício Nacional de
Saneamiento Ambiental (SENASA) successfully
hired a consultant specifically to manage Indigenous
topics in El Chaco (this person identified as
Indigenous and had particular knowledge on the area
of intervention), and in Argentina, the project team
hired the NGO Fundación Gran Chaco to support
the application and monitoring of social processes.
Alternatively, the project team can establish
agreements directly with Indigenous organizations
to support cultural mediation and engagement with
communities. This can help increase ownership at
many levels and serve to build longer-term capacity
for Indigenous organizations as active partners in
WSS projects. Regardless of the approach, the
consultants, organization, or newly specialized
staff should oversee the consultation process
and ensure that the beneficiaries’ (and traditional
authorities’) inputs are the basis of the decision-

              A Good Practice from Nicaragua - the MEPAS
  03
              The Nicaragua rural WSS agency FISE has institutionalized a policy to implement rural WSS
              projects irrespective of the source of financing, the Manual for WSS Projects (MEPAS, Manual de
              Ejecución de Proyectos de Agua, Saneamiento). FISE has elaborated an annex for this manual
              dictating the specific provisions to be applied in the Northern and Southern Caribbean Coastal
              Regions (RACCN and RACCS).

              To reflect the local reality and engage with Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities in a
              culturally appropriate manner throughout the project cycle, this annex includes regional adaptations
              related to:

                 •	   The methodology to carry out consultations,
                 •	   Technical specifications,
                 •	   Costs,
                 •	   Counterpart funding,
                 •	   Project timelines and
                 •	   Procurement rules.

              The customized strategy also includes a monitoring system to ensure that traditional authorities
              participate in the project cycle, that communities approve the project design, that training is
              provided to the beneficiaries in the local language, and that the beneficiaries are organized to
              protect the water source and operate and maintain the system once it is built.

                Key questions:

     	 What relevant Indigenous institutions, organizations and/or authorities does the project team
       need to communicate with regularly?
     	 What is the capacity of the project team in terms of social specialists and engineers trained to
       work with Indigenous peoples both at a centralized and decentralized level?
     	 What are the language needs of the target indigenous communities?
     	 Does the project team have staff who speak the local Indigenous language(s)?
     	 What specialized methodology, tools and training curricula can be developed, adapting existing
       documents where possible, for working with Indigenous peoples?

     	 Have indicators been developed to help assess community WSS needs more objectively?
     	 Is there a leading Indigenous organization widely recognized and respected among Indigenous
       peoples that could centralize their demands and carry out a first round of prioritization? Have
       the customary governance structures at all appropriate levels been involved in this process?

                    The Demand-Responsive Approach
        04
                    The Demand-Responsive Approach (DRA) became prominent in development literature in the
                    late 1990s in response to the Dublin Principles, wherein water was defined as an economic and
                    social good to be managed at the lowest appropriate level.47 DRA refocuses development on the
                    involvement of the beneficiaries themselves throughout the project cycle. Though this approach
                    is fundamental to the rural WSS sector, it is particularly important when working with Indigenous
                    beneficiaries, whose demands are rarely assessed systematically, respecting traditional authorities,
                    prior to an intervention.

                    The guiding principle of DRA is that WSS services provision must be driven by demand from the users,
                    who therefore become central actors in the initiation, planning, implementation and management of
                    the services. This model provides an alternative to supply-driven interventions, where WSS systems
                    were built according to assumed needs without consulting the beneficiaries on their actual demands.

                    In the case of Indigenous peoples, DRA promotes

                        •	 Carrying out consultations throughout the engagement process and according to a culturally

                        •	 Using the information gathered in project design, implementation and O&M.

                    DRA can be challenging to apply in Indigenous communities given the particularities of indigenous
                    social organization, belief systems, and lack of trust in outsiders, and sometimes project teams
                    struggle to gather concrete input on project design from DRA processes with indigenous communities,
                    unsure how to translate information on cultural beliefs and cosmovision into tangible and sector-
                    relevant project guidance.

                    DRA involves users from a very early stage to foster ownership over their WSS services by enabling
                    beneficiaries to choose the level of service they want and are willing to pay for. To apply DRA
                    successfully with Indigenous communities, the approach should be carried out with respect for:

                   community),
                •	 The definition and validation of demands (by coordinating with Indigenous organizations and
                   consulting with beneficiaries to corroborate needs identified by higher-level representatives),
                   and
                •	 Community participation overall (through consultations on specific preferences and traditional
                   knowledge to include in technological solution design and seeking community approval in an
                   assembly on the technological choice).

             The recommendations in this Toolkit align with DRA principles and provide specific guidance for
             conducting DRA and interpreting DRA results in Indigenous contexts. In particular, the section on
             Designing an Effective Intercultural Engagement Strategy (in this chapter) highlights mechanisms
             for communication with Indigenous communities and points out when to use consultations to gather
             specific project-related information from Indigenous beneficiaries throughout the project cycle. The
             Ownership chapter guides project teams through the application of the knowledge gathered through
             consultations in the choice of a management model and technological solution that respond to the
             community’s demands while balancing Indigenous-specificity with technical expertise. The section
             on Systems Construction also specifically addresses Indigenous beneficiaries’ contribution to the
             construction of their system and the importance of a handover ceremony in officially transferring the
             system to the Indigenous community. Finally, the Sustainability chapter builds on rural WSS sector
             best practices regarding behavior change, payment for services and technical assistance provision
             and explains how these important components should be addressed in an Indigenous context.




An important element of demand-response for                  actors. These issues may have occurred at the level
Indigenous peoples lies in understanding past conflicts      of a specific community or a whole area or territory,
relating to WSS in a given group or community. The           and may touch on water resources, lack of previous
historical context and past issues may influence a           consultations before an infrastructure intervention, or
group’s willingness to engage with or trust outside          disregard for traditional rules and norms.




                Key questions:

     	 Has the project team carried out a diagnosis of local needs to corroborate that the intervention
       meets the demands of the target Indigenous community?
     	 Can these priorities be verified through consultations in a sample group of communities or
       through focus groups with Indigenous organizations?
     	 Has the project team put in place provisions for Indigenous women to participate in these
       processes? (see gender section in the Ownership section)
     	 Does the target Indigenous areas present any past issues or stories of trauma linked to
       resource management, WSS or development in general?

                      Key questions:


          	 Which modality and platform is best suited to share information and consult with the
            beneficiaries at project onset?
          	 Are there subgroups (such as women) that may feel uncomfortable expressing themselves
            in a public setting like an assembly? If so, how can they be encouraged to participate without
            jeopardizing local traditions?
          	 Are there particular traditional communication rules that influence information sharing in the
            community or neighborhood?
          	 Would it facilitate the process to have an Indigenous or local intermediary provide initial
            explanations and allow for internal deliberations prior to having external actors participate?
          	 Have the traditional authorities and/or the beneficiaries indicated certain preferences related to
            the timeline or sequencing of information-sharing and consultations?
          	 Does the timeline of the proposed intervention respect and account for local communication
            rules and processes?

                      Key questions:


          	 How are decisions currently made in the community? Who has input and who has the final say?
            What are current modalities in which women participate in community decision-making?
          	 What is the perception of women in the community regarding their ability to express their
            opinions and influence community decisions? Do certain women have more influence in the
            community and, if so, how well do they represent other women?
          	 Are there existing women’s groups or forums for women to discuss their needs with one
            another and voice their opinions?
          	 What are norms surrounding outsiders’ ability to hold discussions with women, and what are
            ways to make this more culturally acceptable? For example, would female facilitators make
            sex-disaggregated focus group discussions acceptable?
          	 Do consultations, trainings and workshops include specific provisions to ensure meaningful
            consultation of women and capitalize on their position as behavior change agents in their
            families and communities?
          	 Are there any social or cultural rituals that could be affected by the installation of a WSS
            system? If so, have these been frankly discussed and assessed with beneficiary women?
          	 Where are there opportunities for the project to incorporate women’s views, preferences, and
            local traditional knowledge into the project?
          	 What are the language requirements of the women in the target Indigenous community? Does
            the team have staff speaking that language and a methodology for non-written languages, if
            applicable?

                 Key recommendations for RESPECT


Understanding the Country Context and Relevant Actors for Indigenous peoples and WSS

  	1   Understand the legal and institutional frameworks of the country that pertain to Indigenous
       peoples and become cognizant of engagement rules and protocols for Indigenous
       organizations, i.e. who to contact and how.

  	2   Identify key actors from both: (i) Indigenous representation; and (ii) Government - both
       WSS sector and Indigenous interlocutor. Carry out a stakeholder mapping exercise,
       mapping the different roles and responsibilities at the intersection of the WSS sector and
       Indigenous organizations and authorities, with particular attention to intervention targeting
       mechanisms and responsibilities along the project cycle.

  	3   Identify the existence of any country (or sub-national) WSS strategy targeting Indigenous
       peoples; if inexistent, try to build one for the project context. Such a strategy should aim
       at aligning the local Indigenous peoples’ framework with the WSS sector and have a
       systems wide or transformational impact beyond a specific project.

  	4   Assess the previous experience and existing capacity of the project team (and
       collaborating organizations) in working with Indigenous peoples on WSS-specific projects
       and topics. Based on the results of this assessment, define a tailored training program to
       strengthen relevant areas in Indigenous peoples-specific aspects and/or complement the
       teams with social experts and trained engineers.


            Prioritization of Investments and Understanding Local Contexts

  	1   Understand the intervention prioritization mechanism in place and use this knowledge
       to assess and verify that the projects being proposed are representative of Indigenous
       territorial priorities and local demands.

  	2   Carry out a diagnosis before an intervention to ensure the project responds to each
       community’s needs in a way that respects their customs and traditions.

  	3   Wherever possible, follow a demand-responsive approach that respects the cultural
       norms of the target Indigenous group and use resulting insights to tailor implementation.

  	4   Study the local historical context and how the particular Indigenous community may have
       interacted with WSS or broader water/development projects in the past to inform the
       engagement strategy.

  	5   When assessing the viability of interventions in Indigenous areas, account for social and
       economic benefits beyond a traditional ERR analysis through qualitative work. Consider
       using a social discount rate.

                                                                                                 Continue




                                                                                                            51

       Designing an Effective Intercultural Engagement Strategy

            	1    Identify the best mechanism to engage relevant stakeholders, ensuring that those
                  subgroups that may not speak up in front of others have a platform in which they can
                  comfortably participate.

            	2    Assess the local social fabric and incorporate existing ties and rules in consultations and
                  implementation arrangements.

            	3    For all participatory processes, follow the principles of free, prior and informed
                  consultation and ensure well documented broad community support for critical design
                  elements.

            	4    Establish and agree early on systems to ensure ongoing participation, two-way
                  information flows, and grievance redress during all stages of the project cycle.

            	5    Invest time upfront in designing appropriate approaches and align project timelines with
                  traditional decision-making processes.

            	6    Actively engage women from the project’s onset and throughout its development,
                  implementation and post-construction social work to ensure that their views and traditional
                  ecological knowledge are taken into account.

            	7    Design and carry out tailored training for women so they can best fulfill their role as
                  behavior change agents.

                  Water and Cosmovision for the Indigenous peoples in Argentina
   05
                  In the World Bank’s Norte Grande Project in Argentina, a lot of work was done with the Madres
                  Cuidadoras de la Cultura Q’OM (the caring mothers of the Q’OM culture) during project
                  preparation. They directed the implementation agency (SAMEEP51) team to key locations to find
                  water. As part of a roads intervention, which was implemented before the WSS one, support was
                  given to the women’s organization to rescue the Q’OM culture by recording stories from their oral
                  tradition through the production of bilingual materials. Some of the recorded stories were about
                  water and its importance to life.

                  Water bodies are sacred places for many Indigenous groups in Argentina’s Gran Chaco. For
                  example, the Mocoví Indigenous peoples believe that gods used to live in lakes with feminine
                  spiritual caregiver, the “cuidadoras de lagunas.” In the rivers, little black creatures watch the
                  rivers for any resource abuse. The Guaraní (Indigenous group present throughout the Chaco
                  across Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil), on the other hand, revere waterfalls as the home
                  of the goddess Imaraguí, who ascended into heaven. For the Mocoví and Wichí (Indigenous
                  groups present in Northern Argentina), water is an element of the cosmos and a natural resource
                  that forms part of the indigenous vision of the territory, as it lies on top, inside and below the land.

                  Local informants expressed their concern that water today is contaminated, whereas before it
                  could be drunk straight from the sky, a sacred life-giving resource harvested from the aljibes.52
                  However, this concern also highlights an understanding of water quality problems and the fact
                  that “Nowadays to have clean water it must be filtered through rocks” (as explained by a local).

    Box           Urine diverting dry toilets – the success story of Bolivia
   06
                  In Bolivia, surprising levels of ownership among Indigenous communities53 for urine diverting
                  dry toilets and associated compost systems could be found. In particular, each family could
                  clearly explain the composting process and had been safely treating and using the toilet
                  outputs with impressive results. For example, potatoes treated with the humus and pesticide
                  made from processed urine showed no sign of worm infestation, whereas the potatoes planted
                  nearby with chemical fertilizers were full of worm holes (see picture below).

                  Each family had been separating urine and storing it in bottles or buckets for planned use
                  as an organic pesticide. The use of urine was highly accepted by the beneficiaries as it built
                  on traditional practices where urine is used for medicinal purposes, as detergent for washing
                  clothes, and as an occasional shampoo treatment for hair. The compost feature for feces was
                  also highly valued by the community as it provided additional autonomy for their lifestyles, which
                  are based on self-sustaining farming practices. All families visited were able – and excited – to
                  give a detailed explanation of both the urine and the feces treatment processes.

     	 Are there locally available materials or parts that could be used in technology design?

  Box        A financing policy to foster sustainability
  07
             In Nicaragua, community participation is institutionalized in all of FISE’s projects through the
             rural WSS agency’s manual for project implementation, which includes an annex with particular
             specificities for the Caribbean Coast of the country, where the majority of Nicaragua’s Indigenous
             population resides. Participatory schemes are included in the manuals’ bidding documents for
             design consultants and contractors.

             Based on the manuals, Indigenous and non-indigenous beneficiaries pay a contribution to the total
             cost of the project in installments, which are collected by the water committee. The amount of this
             contribution was formerly 10 percent, however, the revised manual currently allows for flexibility
             based on the type of intervention in order to incentivize beneficiaries to take care of their WSS
             systems.

                •	 If a community’s water system is relatively new but has fallen into disrepair due to lack of
                   maintenance, the community and the municipality are expected to provide a higher financial
                   contribution for the system replacement or reconstruction.

                •	 If, on the other hand, the intervention consists of building a new system for a community
                   that has not had a new system for 10 years, then the national government will pay for the
                   majority of the system’s construction. As such, the government’s contribution is linked to the
                   community’s level of care for its own system, incentivizing maintenance over the long-term.

             In parallel, the policy also points the government’s funds allocation towards unserved communities
             rather than communities that already have a system and request expansion, rehabilitation or a more
             sophisticated level of service (moving from shared wells to piped connections, for example). In the
             case of piped systems, each family is also responsible for buying their meter before the system is
             constructed. This requirement ensures that users are aware of the cost of water and that, despite
             the ready availability that a household tap brings, they will be conscious of their water use, and pay
             accordingly. In all cases, contributions should be discussed thoroughly at project onset and agreed
             in community consultations.

               Key recommendations for OWNERSHIP


Building on Existing Institutional Structures for Service Provision and Management

	1   Carry out an assessment of the local social fabric and how it may affect service
     provision and management arrangements.

	2   Conduct consultations on Indigenous beneficiaries’ preferences on the most
     appropriate WSS service provision and management model.

	3   Establish management arrangements over the WSS service early in the project
     implementation process, ensuring they have clear communication mechanisms with the
     WSS services users and take traditional authorities into account.

	4   Provide ample training on administration, tariff setting, and technical O&M throughout
     the project to the entity responsible for service provision and management. Emphasize
     the need to have clear statutes, regulations, definition of roles, and transparency
     mechanisms. Assess the need for these trainings as part of an early-stage local
     diagnosis.



                          Culturally Appropriate Solution Design


	1   Conduct consultations on Indigenous beneficiaries’ preferences for system scale and the
     different technologies or solutions (including the corresponding costs associated with each
     solution).

	2   Consult with Indigenous beneficiaries on their local traditional ecological knowledge and
     cultural norms regarding water source, climate change and resilience and traditional
     practices for water use and treatment. Incorporate these technological insights in the
     elaboration of a tailored menu of options.

	3   Account for traditional understandings of sanitation, waste disposal and hygiene behaviors
     in the selection of sanitation solutions to promote adequate use and adoption.

	4   Elaborate a specific menu of technological options based on community-expressed
     preferences around functionality and use. Present this menu to the beneficiaries for
     selection through an iterative consultation process, ensuring that traditional protocols are
     respected.

	5   Study the supply chain for both system repair materials and products necessary for the
     maintenance of hygiene behaviors (soap, sanitary pads). Where the supply chain is not
     established, work with the beneficiaries to develop supply mechanisms.


                                                                                                    Continue

             	1    Select the most appropriate construction model to balance sector policy, Indigenous-
                   specific mechanisms, local preferences identified through consultations, and technical
                   requirements.

             	2    Integrate the social work with the technical aspects of construction to ensure results from
                   the consultations are respected throughout the project cycle.

             	3    System construction is a key moment to materialize community commitment. Establish a
                   uniform strategy for community members’ contribution to system construction, be it in cash,
                   labor, meter, materials, or other.

             	4    Assess the accessibility of the community (distance, terrain), the proximity of construction
                   firms, materials and equipment availability, and cultural particularities of Indigenous
                   territories to inform the planning of procurement processes.

             	5    Contractually require any contractor working with an Indigenous community to have
                   specialized social specialists on their team or to coordinate closely with the social
                   specialists from the project team.

             	6    Agree on and organize a system handover ceremony to officially transfer the system to the
                   community after construction.

      Hygiene plays a key role in realizing the full benefits of access to improved WSS services. Evidence
      from fieldwork showed that Indigenous women were more likely than other community-members to
      be aware of the health consequences of poor hygiene. Women play a key role in promoting hygiene
      in their communities and are key partners in shifting behaviors long-term.

      The NGO Rainforest Flow worked with Matsigenka, Huachipaeri and Quecha families in the
      southeastern Amazon region of Peru, focusing on experiential training that would help integrate
      hygiene-related knowledge into everyday life. For example, using a mobile laboratory, they carried
      out water analyses with mothers and showed them bacteria grown on the petri dish from water that
      looked clean to the eye. A microscope available at the health post provided a similarly eye-opening
      experience by revealing bacteria floating in clean-looking water. By working so closely with families,
      the NGO helped mothers better understand how important good sanitation practices are to their
      health.

      The sink was built at the school along with the bathrooms in Tayakome. The kids conduct bi-weekly
      maintenance of the sink as part of their hygiene education with the village health promoter.

      As part of the project, children are taught about environmental stewardship and good hygiene
      practices at school and are given responsibility for daily maintenance of the school latrines and
      surrounding areas. With this practical and technical knowledge, young WSS committee members
      were able to teach visiting government engineers and health personnel about the eco-friendly way
      their systems worked. In order to maintain accountability despite the high rotation of teachers, health
      promoters and WSS committee members are appointed in each community and responsible for
      house to house visits as well as training each new teacher, thus maintaining the knowledge within
      the community. The WSS committees established and trained through this project take full care of
      tariff collection and O&M. The committees contact Rainforest Flow to procure certain system parts
      when replacement is needed.

                      The World Bank-supported Handwashing Initiative in Peru is another successful example of
                      community mobilization around hygiene promotion. Radio shows translated to the local Quechua
                      dialects motivated village-wide games in the central plaza in which children would learn to ‘kill’
                      bacteria with soap through fun and interactive role-playing. In Peru, the education and health sectors
                      generally have the necessary structure to reach dispersed populations, in particular through municipal
                      units. By coordinating closely with Municipalities, the project ensured that measures for behavior
                      change were maintained over time. After a pilot in 5,000 schools, the handwashing methodology
                      designed as part of the project was integrated into the national environmental education guidelines
                      for teachers in 2011.

     hygiene promotion and sustainable behavior                                 Assemblies and community-level training can
     change. In La Guajira, an installation called “tip-                        play on these cultural norms to foster behavior

     hung onto a tree branch and filled with water. When                        Figure 11
                                                                                Woman demonstrating the use of a Tip-tap in La Guajira

     water flows through the bottle mouth enabling
     handwashing without contamination. See Specific
     Provisions for Procurement section in this chapter
     for more information.

     Though field work did not reveal particular pre-
     existing practices around handwashing specifically
     (before interventions), cultural norms around
     cleanliness and care for children provided important
     entry points for the promotion of improved hygiene
     behaviors, as shown in the examples of Box 7. In
     Bolivia, protection of the local environment and
     associated health impacts encouraged community
     members to gather their trash and make sure waste
     products from their dry toilets was properly handled
     through the use of personal safety equipment
     (full-body suite, goggles, hair net and mask).
     WSP highlights that in LAC in general, the sense
     of a “collective identity” is particularly strong and
     provides an entry point for behavior change through
     cultural norms, or ‘what everyone else is doing.’64

Although the hygiene solution should always be tailored to the community’s needs, good practices65 include:



                           Constructing a handwashing facility close to the sanitation solution in order to facilitate
                           handwashing after using the latrine or toilet and before handling foods.



                           Ensuring soap is readily available or easy to procure to promote long-term use (in
          Soap             some communities the water committee would purchase it for the whole community
                           and sell it or distribute it).


                           Including hygiene promotion (personal, in household and surroundings) in the training
                           carried out for any WSS project.




                           Positioning a trashcan next to the latrine/toilet to promote proper disposal of paper
                           and other trash.



                           Positioning laminated graphic instructions, which are adapted to the local context, on
                           handwashing, proper use of latrine/toilets, water filtering, and trash disposal, next to

                          Key questions:

           	 Have consultations revealed local and/or traditional hygiene practices or preferences? How are
             they being incorporated into the project hygiene training?
           	 Will appropriate training be carried out to accompany the infrastructure component to promote
             hygiene practices?
           	 Is there a supply chain in place for soap provision, especially if the project targets an isolated
             area? If not, how can the beneficiaries be involved in establishing one?
           	 Have culturally adapted hygiene promotion materials been developed and rolled out to hang
             near handwashing facilities after their construction?

       Technical assistance providers who work in Indigenous communities must:

         	 Understand the region and its context.
         	 Be located relatively close to the target communities in order to allow for frequent contact with
           beneficiaries.
         	 Understand the local social fabric and be able to identify and recognize the appropriate
           organizational structures.
         	 Respect the indigenous community’s cosmovision and promote its inclusion in technical
           solutions.
         	 Speak the local language and/or learn pertinent communication mechanisms.
         	 Plan according to a timeline that takes into account the local customs and does not jeopardize
           achieving the technical assistance goals.
         	 Understand the local way of life and promote its respect in design processes.
         	 Take cultural uses of the land (sacred spaces, for example) into account in solutions identification.

        Box       Local Technical Assistance Providers – the Case of Peru
        09
                  The Amazon region in Peru provides a good example of culturally appropriate technical assistance.
                  Although the National Rural Sanitation Program (PNSR) is a government program that provides
                  technical assistance in the implementation of WSS works in rural areas throughout Peru, the
                  PNSR’s personnel in the Peruvian Amazon – a region with a high concentration of Indigenous
                  communities – presented the characteristics listed above and truly connected with the beneficiaries
                  they worked with.

                  “I have worked with them for a long time, now I coordinate with indigenous and rural communities
                  within the area of responsibility of our PNSR office. I can speak the awajun language and I know
                  the Apu [highest traditional authority] of each community with whom the implementing boards, the
                  JASS, work closely. I visit them regularly, I know the beneficiary families, I hear about the projects
                  carried out by other organizations, and I am informed of the regional meetings that bring together
                  over 180 communities, as well as the results of their discussions. I feel truly blessed.”

                                                             Technical Coordinator of the Bagua Grande office, PNSR.

                  The contribution above shows a technical assistance provider who fulfills many of the requirements
                  to work successfully in Indigenous areas: he has earned the local Indigenous communities’ trust by
                  working with them for a long time, speaks the local language, coordinates directly with the traditional
                  authorities (Apu) who work closely with the water boards, and is regularly informed of local traditional
                  meetings, their development, and their issues of interest.




                      Key questions:

          	 Is there an established sectoral mechanism for technical assistance provision? If so, how is it
            adapted in Indigenous areas?
          	 Which entities have the knowledge and capacity to carry out that role? Are they trained to work
            with Indigenous peoples?
          	 How can the intervention help develop a curriculum specific to Indigenous peoples and/or foster
            its application?

     services, M&E serves to assess how systems                     systematize feedback and streamline possible
     function over time and any future need of the                  responses on behalf of the technical assistance
     beneficiary community (for example, missing parts              provider.

      	 Do the indicators measure progress on the inclusion and participation process?

             Key recommendations for SUSTAINABILITY


                              Sustainable Behavior Change

	1   Incorporate hygiene promotion in all sanitation projects through the development of
     culturally and locally appropriate trainings, with particular attention to existing behaviors
     based on traditional beliefs and the requirements for the maintenance of new ones
     (materials, technological design, appointed and/or trained community members).

	2   Ensure cultural norms around sanitation are incorporated in technological options and
     tailored training is designed accordingly where necessary.

	3   Carefully study the service chain for the possibility of reuse, especially in resource-
     scarce environments, where local agricultural activity permits or where local Indigenous
     practices have involved reuse in the past.




                                  Financial Arrangements

	1   Highlight the distinction between payment for the water resource (often rejected) and
     payment for the water service (usually more palatable).

	2   Discuss payment for water services by promoting a transparent tariff-setting
     mechanism during beneficiary consultations. Also discuss rules regarding missed
     payments, tariffs increases, and other administrative elements at this time.

	3   In some communities, alternative payment mechanisms may be more acceptable than
     cash contributions. However, they should always be meaningful.

	4   When the sanitation solution requires regular O&M from the beneficiary or involves
     additional service, the tariff-setting should undergo the same process as the water

             	1    Ensure that the entities responsible for technical assistance provision are known to
                   the Indigenous authorities and respect protocols for entering and communicating with
                   Indigenous beneficiaries. Share with Indigenous authorities the role of the relevant
                   sector entities and any rules for technical assistance provision, and agree with them on
                   arrangements and procedures for regular support. The entity responsible for technical
                   assistance provision must have decentralized capacity to regularly visit Indigenous
                   areas.

             	2    Assess the capacity of the sector entities for technical assistance provision
                   and experience working with Indigenous communities, and if needed, propose
                   strengthening measures so they can effectively provide regular assistance and training

                   and explore the possibility of expanding it beyond the project. Include indicators
                   disaggregated by ethnicity (whether a beneficiary ascribes to an Indigenous identity or
                   not) and measure process-based progress, and long-term sustainability in partnership
                   with beneficiaries.

             	5    Evaluate whether the Indigenous community feels comfortable with conventional
                   communication channels for grievance, redress, and feedback provision. When
                   relevant, work with Indigenous beneficiaries to establish culturally appropriate
                   grievance and redress mechanisms to facilitate user feedback and promote
                   transparency.

contradict some usual perceptions about working               included here. Finally, the next steps of this work
with Indigenous peoples. This final section also              are outlined.

1.	      Main “takeaways” from the development of this Toolkit


      As opposed to other low-income groups, Indigenous peoples often: (i) subscribe to organizational
      and governance structures that are different from the rest of society; (ii) maintain extensive
      traditional knowledge around their land, natural resource base, and environment; (iii) utilize
      unique practices and cultural norms around water collection, storage, distribution, sanitation and
      hygiene; and (iv) hold strong beliefs and practices around the well-being of the collective versus
      the individual, leading to a higher degree of social cohesion, unique traditions and structures of
      community organization, and different norms around communal contributions.




This section outlines the main takeaways to address these characteristics in developing sustainable WSS
services with Indigenous peoples.




      RESPECT


       	 Delivering high quality, well-accepted, and sustainable WSS services to
      	 Indigenous peoples depends on coordination among the key actors from the WSS and
         Indigenous peoples/social sectors. Collaboration among key actors from these sectors should ideally
         start at the highest governmental level as early as possible in the project cycle. The joint articulation of
         intervention priorities and regular meetings on implementation progress can provide stepping stones for
         this collaboration. Due to the institutional complexities of each country, however, this may not always be
         possible. Nevertheless, this coordination between sectors (or between approaches) should at the very
         least take place at the community level.

       	 The “soft side” (social mobilization, community capacity building, and Indigenous leadership
         engagement) is as important as the hardware (infrastructure) aspects in delivering WSS services.
         For Indigenous communities, applying the demand-responsive approach, which includes active dialogue
         with the beneficiaries and Indigenous leaders, is fundamental in defining the infrastructure that will be
         delivered and how it will be managed afterwards.




                                                                                                                        91
     Water and Sanitation Services: Achieving sustainable outcomes with Indigenous Peoples In Latin America and the Caribbean




           OWNERSHIP


               	 In order to build trust with Indigenous peoples, it is important to engage with
           	     their leadership and traditional institutions early in the project process. When Indigenous authorities
                 and beneficiaries participate in project planning and design, develop ownership over the project, and
                 make a commitment (for example, to make payments or contribute labor) to be part of the project, it is
                 more likely they will follow through on agreements and be active partners throughout the development,
                 implementation, and operation of the WSS services.




           SUSTAINABILITY


            	 It is important to provide continued “post-construction” support to
           	 Indigenous communities in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of WSS services.
              Continued engagement with the community after the official close of the project is critical to the long-
              term sustainability of the WSS services. Even when community management models are operating
              successfully, long-term sustainability requires an institutionalized structure for technical support to the
              communities. Professionals trained in specific aspects related to Indigenous peoples and anchored
              in well-capacitated WSS sector institutions with sound technical expertise will be able to provide this
              support.




     2. Structural Barriers                                                world view on Indigenous peoples based on
                                                                           an assumption of superiority in vision around

  efforts in the WSS Sector still go to urban         several commonly held misconceptions on Indigenous
  areas, which are more easily reached and            peoples’ WSS preferences and habits. For example:



 	   Reluctance to use and adopt sanitation solutions by Indigenous peoples. It is common
     to hear that Indigenous peoples will resist using toilets because of their centuries-old open
     defecation practices. In fact, field experience reveled that when social and engineering work
     is done well, with thorough iterative consultations, tailored sanitation solutions, and community
     capacity building (in particular involving women), Indigenous peoples demand, adopt and use
     sanitation solutions.

 	   Rejection of piped water and water treatment. It is often said that Indigenous peoples reject
     piped water systems and water treatment because piping or treating the water would change
     its natural composition. In fact, if the community receives appropriate training, preferably in their
     local language, on the health benefits and comfort associated with a piped water supply and
     water treatment, Indigenous peoples demand, appreciate, and are willing to contribute (either
     financially or through other means) to an improved water system.

 	   Unwillingness to pay for water services. Many people believe that Indigenous peoples
     are not willing to pay for water services. Contrary to popular belief, Indigenous peoples are
     ready to contribute to WSS services projects and their operation, either in monetary or in-kind
     contributions. In fact, in many cases, Indigenous peoples are keen on having water meters to
     promote rational water use and equitable water sharing among the families.




                                                                                                                   93

     And finally,


               	    Working with Indigenous peoples is too complex and difficult to achieve desired
                    outcomes. Initially, engaging with Indigenous peoples may appear overly complex due
                    to the additional layers of coordination required and the need for a customized approach.
                    When treated as development partners, Indigenous communities actively pave the way for
                    successful project delivery. So long as the Indigenous traditions and organizational structure
                    are respected, the projects are defined with Indigenous peoples’ active participation, and
                    ownership for the WSS system is established, project development and implementation
                    tends to be smooth and the results tend to be sustainable. Project teams need to allocate
                    time and resources for a demand-responsive approach to project design, implementation,
                    and evaluation that respect the specificities of Indigenous practices and organization.
                    It is true that WSS services in Indigenous communities require unique and flexible
                    approaches with specialized knowledge of the community, but it is not significantly more
                    complex or time-consuming than a demand-driven approach to providing WSS services
                    to other communities. The elaboration of a country-specific strategy and implementation
                    methodology agreed between WSS sector institutions and Indigenous organizations will
                    also streamline these processes. Furthermore, success is possible, sustainable, and
                    extremely impactful when the project respects Indigenous actors and creates ownership
                    over the intervention.




     Author’s Note

     This report has been circulated internally in the World Bank for quality assurance. The findings and
     recommendations are all based on analysis and reflection on the interviews carried out through the field
     work. However, this final document will be validated through a consultation process with the various entities
     that took part in the fieldwork, namely government organizations, Indigenous organizations, NGOs and
     beneficiary representatives. A list of these organizations is available in Annex 9.

     This material will be transferred to an interactive web platform format to facilitate access by all stakeholders.
     The web platform will include video material gathered throughout the field visits.

     Further studies on this topic could include specific analysis on Afro-descendants. Additionally, similar
     assessments and Toolkit development could be targeted for other sectors (such as education and health)
     in order to contribute to a comprehensive development agenda for Indigenous peoples in LAC. Finally,
     more resources should be spent on adapting existing successful methodologies and tools mentioned in this
     Toolkit for application in Indigenous contexts.

      Water and Sanitation Services: Achieving sustainable outcomes with Indigenous Peoples In Latin America and the Caribbean




                                         Annex 5. Payment Mechanisms for Water Services




                                 Type of Contribution

                                 Fixed Tariff: Every household pays a fixed rate per month. The tariff can vary depending on costs, for
                                 example, in the Peruvian Andes where water systems are low cost and rely on gravity tariffs are 0.50
                                 soles, but in the Amazon where due to the geography and distance water supply systems are more
                                 expensive the tariff can go up to 10 or 12 soles. In Nicaragua, small fees (10 cordobas) are symbolic to
                                 promote ownership and responsible use of water.


                                 Consumption-based Tariff: Each household pays based for its own consumption which is measured
                                 by a meter. In Bolivia, this system is preferred because it prevents people from wasting water or using
                                 potable water for animals and irrigation.
        Monetary Contributions




                                 Maintenance and Repair Fund: The community does not pay for water on a regular basis, but when
                                 the system requires maintenance and repair each person contributes to the fund. Similarly, if the
                                 community is unable to contribute to the construction of the system, it can compensate by taking charge
                                 of its maintenance and repair. This system is successful in the Paraguayan Chaco that is a very poor
                                 and dry area.


                                 * Paying for the Service: In Indigenous cosmovision, water is seen as a gift from nature which
                                 is why some beneficiaries are hesitant to pay for it. Establishing a tariff for the service of bringing
                                 potable water to the community rather than for water itself is a way to ensure system ownership and
                                 sustainability while respecting indigenous cosmovision. The service can be paid for through Fixed Tariffs,
                                 Consumption-based Tariffs or Maintenance and Repair Funds.


                                 Incorporating Payment of Water Tariffs in Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: In addition
                                 to vaccinating children, sending them to school and other requirements, paying water tariffs could
                                 be incorporated as a pre-requisite to receiving conditional cash transfers. The government of Peru
                                 is considering incorporating this into their conditional cash transfer program, JUNTOS, in order to
                                 incentivize people to pay.


                                                                                                                                       Continue

                             Type of Contribution


                             Land Donation: Families that own land where the water source is located or in surrounding areas
                             can contribute by donating the land closest to the water source to the community. This practices has
                             allowed Peruvian highlanders to ensure protect water sources from pollution and over-use.


                             Faena/Minga: A tradition where the community works together and volunteers its labor for the
                             construction, maintenance and repair of the service. This is common in Quechua and Aymara
                             communities in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.


                             Labor: Households that cannot afford to pay tariffs can volunteer their labor for construction,
                             maintenance and repair of the system. Similarly, in communities or neighborhoods where the
Non-Monetary Contributions




                             government or other institutions have agreed to cover all costs, the community can contribute through
                             labor which will promote ownership and sustainability of the system.


                             Commitment to attend workshops, trainings and Water Committee meetings: Households
                             can contribute their time by committing themselves to attend every training, workshop and Water
                             Committee meeting to ensure that they understand the benefits of the system and how to give
                             maintenance and repair, thus encouraging ownership and sustainability.


                             Trading Natural Resources for Water Systems: Amazon communities in Peru trade their natural
                             resources such as wood in exchange for the construction, maintenance and repair of water systems.


                             Materials: Communities or neighborhoods and even individual households can contribute locally
                             available materials for the construction, maintenance and repair of the system.


                             Environmental Services: The community can contribute by providing environmental services,
                             primarily caring for and protecting the water source. This can be achieved by reforesting surrounding
                             areas and closing the water source off to prevent contamination from animals or people. This approach
                             has been very successful in the Pacific region of Nicaragua

                  Annex 7. Different Management Models Witnessed




Location          Management Model

Colombia          Structure: The existing water committees have been formed by outside institutions (such as
(La Guajira)      NGOs) and therefore each is structured differently.

                  Leadership: In order to get community recognition, water committees must be led by traditional
                  authorities.

                  Tariffs: Tariffs were witnessed in most of the committees visited. A common amount was a
                  monthly fee of P/3,000 per household.

                  Functions: Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Committee (ASH) is in charge of ensuring that the
                  system is functional and the community is educated on hygiene, including on how to use latrines
                  and other WSS systems.

Paraguay          Structure: Though most systems are household or community-level rainwater harvesting, the
(El Gran Chaco)   majority of communities do not have Water Committees. There is no assigned responsibility for
                  system operation and maintenance, though sometimes they expect the Municipality to perform
                  repairs. However, SENASA is in the process of implementing a strategy for the formation and
                  strengthening of WSS committees in the communities where they build systems to promote
                  sustainability.

                  Leadership: Many of the communities visited had appointed a Spanish-speaking community
                  member to lead exchanges with the Municipality and outsiders. As part of their strategy,
                  SENASA would help the community appoint a board and train them.

                  Tariffs: The few communities that do have Water Committees do not charge tariffs since in El
                  Chaco, indigenous peoples do not have the practice of paying for water.

                  Functions: Maintenance is done by outside actors (usually the Municipality). SENASA has
                  signed agreements with the different Municipalities of the Chaco region in order to strengthen
                  collaboration. SENASA is also in the process of building and staffing decentralized offices to
                  attend to these communities and help the Municipalities.

Chaco)
                  Leadership: The water utility of the Chaco Province (SAMEEP) has appointed representatives
                  to interact with the community and has contracted the NGO Fundación Gran Chaco to facilitate
                  exchanges.

                  Tariffs: Communities receive highly discounted service from the water utility.

                  Functions: The water utility will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
                  system. Though there are Community Associations responsible for all sectors such as education
                  and health, none specifically work on water.

      Water and Sanitation Services: Achieving sustainable outcomes with Indigenous Peoples In Latin America and the Caribbean




      Location             Management Model

      Nicaragua            Structure: The Nicaragua rural WSS sector is characterized by decentralized community
                           management through Water Committees called CAPS (Comité de Agua Potable y
                           Saneamiento). They receive technical assistance from municipal WSS units. There is a law (Law
                           722) that dictates the specifics of CAPS formation and legalization. If they are legalized, they
                           receive economic incentives such as preferential electricity tariffs.

                           Leadership: Members change every 2 years through community elections.

                           Tariffs: When the national rural WSS entity, FISE, supports the creation of CAPS, it is a
                           requirement for the CAPS to set a user fee that covers operation and maintenance costs. It is
                           common for households to pay a monthly fee of about 20 cordobas, though this may be higher
                           in communities with piped systems due to mandatory household meters. The service is cut when
                           households fail to pay.

                           Functions: The CAPS is in charge of maintenance, hiring people for small repairs and
                           requesting money from government authorities for larger repairs. They are also in charge of
                           training and of supervising hygiene behaviors in the community, usually with local municipal
                           government support. The CAPS are trained by the municipal WSS units to administer the water
                           system and carry out O&M tasks such as purifying water by the government. CAPS must submit
                           monthly financial reports for review to the Communal Board and Communal Assembly.

      Peru                 Structure: In Peru, rural WSS services are managed through JASS (Junta Administradora de
                           Servicios de Saneamiento). They are organized in networks, with a central JASS coordinating
                           community-level JASS. In some projects implemented in the Selva, the Ministry of Housing,
                           Construction and Sanitation has hired a private company to support communities in the
                           operation of WSS schemes when those are complicated due to poor water quality (reverse
                           osmosis systems, for example).

                           Leadership: The committee is elected to be in charge of all water and sanitation issues.

                           Tariffs: Some JASS charge a set service fee of 1 sol while others use meters. Some
                           communities have provisions for non-payment, such as cutting the service after 3 months of not
                           paying. Household must cover installation costs if they want water in their homes. 20% of the
                           collected money is kept by the local JASS and 80% is sent to the central regional JASS.

                           Functions: The JASS are in charge of operation and maintenance and may receive support
                           from outside entity (central JASS or municipality). Municipal authorities train JASS members
                           during project construction. JASS are supposed to present reports every 3 months.

      Panama (rural)       Structure: In Panama, rural WSS services are managed through community-level WSS
                           committees called JAAR (Junta Administradora de Acueductos Rurales). Piped systems are
                           mandated by law.

                           Leadership: Most JAAR leaders are elected.

                           Tariffs: The JAAR charges tariffs and is in charge of paying the water service bill to the Ministry
                           of Health. Some communities pay fixed rates while others that have meters evenly split the cost.
                           The service is cut for those who don’t pay. People who cannot afford to pay can pay through
                           labor when maintenance and repair is needed.

                           Functions: The JAAR charges tariffs and is responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair
                           of the system at the community level JAAR has a set of rules that determines how to adopt new
                           projects following traditional leadership structures.

                                                                                                                      Continue

Location         Management Model

Panama (urban)   Structure: In the case of peri-urban areas, service was provided by IDAAN, the water utility.

                 Leadership: IDAAN has a trained team with social specialists tasked with coordination with the
                 community and trainings on WSS-related topics.

                 Tariffs: Indigenous beneficiaries pay IDAAN’s social tariffs. IDAAN representatives indicated that
                 due to their traditional organization and valuation of the service, Indigenous peoples were more
                 likely to pay tariffs on time.

                 Functions: IDAAN provides piped water into users’ homes and operates and maintains the
                 system.

Bolivia          Structure: Water Committees (CAPyS – Comité de Agya Potable y Saneamiento) are
                 established in the early stages of the project and use statues and regulations that guide their
                 activities.

                 Leadership: Committee members are usually elected. In some instances, the Committee trains
                 the entire community on water and sanitation topics so that everyone is capable of serving in
                 the Water Committee, facilitating rotation. The entire community must attend monthly Water
                 Committee meetings and are charged a fee if they fail to do so.

                 Tariffs: A tariff is charged and if people don’t pay the service is cut. In some communities, tariffs
                 are collected by a group of several Water Committee members to avoid accusations of misuse of
                 funds.

                 Functions: The CAPyS is in charge of integral management water and sanitation services,
                 including maintenance and repair, with a strong hygiene component. The Committee manages
                 different funds earmarked for protection, expansion, etc. of the WSS systems. In some cases,
                 these are invested in sanitation solutions that avoid contamination of nearby groundwater and/or
                 surface water.
