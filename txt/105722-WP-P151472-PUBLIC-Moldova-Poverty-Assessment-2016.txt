        Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects




Executive Summary
Moldova has experienced rapid economic growth in the past decade,
which has been accompanied by reductions in poverty and good
performance in shared prosperity. Nonetheless, Moldova remains one of
the poorest countries in Europe and faces challenges in sustaining the
progress.

Analysis of the Household Budget Surveys from 2007 to 2014 shows that
economic growth was volatile, revealed once more in developments during
2015, but, overall, positive and pro-poor. Economic growth was driven
generally by private consumption, fueled by remittances, and household
consumption expanded accordingly. Public and private transfers, namely,
pensions and remittances, had an important role in reducing poverty.
Moldovan labor markets contributed to the progress, mostly through
productivity increases rather than job creation, given that employment fell
driven by increasingly high inactivity rates. On average, the declines in
employment were partly offset by the higher wages in the nonfarm sectors.

The challenges for progress include spatial and cross-group inequalities,
particularly because of unequal access to assets, services and economic
opportunities. Moreover, strengthening the persistently weak labor
markets to boost employment, especially in the nonfarm sectors, is
critical for sustaining progress toward the twin goals of reducing poverty
and expanding shared prosperity and for addressing the problems
associated with an aging population in a fiscally responsible manner.
Accordingly, ensuring the viability of the pension system and improving
social assistance are necessary areas of reform, particularly in a context
of fiscal pressures, the aging population, and the great vulnerability of
the poor to shocks.

The Moldova Poverty Assessment 2016 includes three prongs of analysis:
this report, which explores trends and the drivers of poverty and shared
prosperity, and the accompanying analyses, “A Jobs Diagnostic for
Moldova” and “Structural Transformation of Moldovan Small-Holder
Agriculture and Its Poverty and Shared Prosperity Impacts.” The jobs
diagnostic explores the main labor demand and supply challenges in
Moldova in more detail, while the analysis of structural transformation
focuses on the agricultural sector and whether it can become a driver of
progress.

The past progress has been driven mainly by pensions and remittances. Economic
growth in Moldova has been mostly driven by private consumption, which was in
turn fueled by remittances. Private consumption contributed as much as 5.7
percentage points to GDP growth in 1999–2014. Remittances account for 26 percent
of GDP in 2014, making Moldova one of the countries most dependent on
remittances. More than 25 percent of Moldovan households received remittances,
which make up around 18 percent of their income. Remittances helped lift many
households, particularly rural ones, out of poverty, and contributed to 21.6 percent
of the income growth of the bottom 40 in 2010–14. Similarly, as the government
raised pensions to support vulnerable categories, especially during the global crisis,
pensions has become the main driver of poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
accounting for more than 30 percent of the consumption growth of the bottom 40
in 2007–14.

Labor markets contributed to the progress, but mostly through nonagricultural
wage increases rather than employment creation. Employment has been declining
(from 55 percent in 2000 to below 40 percent in 2014), especially in rural areas. This
trend is associated with rising inactivity driven by increasing migration and early
retirement among the aging population. With the exceptions of agriculture after
2012 and a few trade-related sectors such as sales, tourism, and transport,
employment in most sectors have been on the decline. In contrast, the share of
people working in low-intensity agriculture (less than 20 hours a week) has been
rising steadily, from 13 percent to 24 percent. Wage growth has been positive, but
mainly in the nonagricultural sectors and less in agriculture where the majority of
the poor and the bottom 40 work. As a result of this differential wage growth,
combined with the shift toward subsistence farming (especially among the poor and
bottom 40), the gap in labor income (including wages and self-employment earnings)
between the bottom 40 and the top 60 has shown limited signs of narrowing.

There are concerns about the sustainability of past achievements as the poor and
bottom 40 continue to lack the necessary capital to advance. The slow growth of
the agriculture sector and the limited access to markets, non-farm jobs, and modern
services mean that people in rural areas are persistently poorer. Coverage of heating,
piped water, sewage is limited among the rural population (and the poor and bottom
40). The poor and bottom 40 also have much less educational attainment and own
smaller plots of land, which limit their opportunities to gain (better) jobs and
improve productivity. And even though they have similar health profiles as the
nonpoor, they are less likely to have medical insurance, hence suffer from low quality
healthcare or high out-of-pocket spending, which drives them further into poverty
in the long term. The same constraints apply to the ethnic minorities, who, because
of language barrier or disparities in access to services, end up in worse welfare
situation. These dimensions of wellbeing, including educational, health, employment,
and housing status, determine a person’s capacity to enjoy decent social and
economic living standards. This report measures the deprivations of individuals
along these dimensions and finds that 24 percent of the population are considered
multidimensionally poor in 2014, more than twice the number of those who are
monetary poor, and there has been limited improvement since 2007.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects



Continued progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity face tremendous
risks due to long-term fiscal pressures and high volatility in the economy. Driven
by declining fertility and accelerating emigration among the young population, the
population of Moldova is shrinking and aging rapidly. Combined with low labor
force participation, the contribution base of the pension system will contract, hence
undermining the system sustainability and reducing pension coverage of the
retirees. Even though pensions have not been generous and often insufficient to lift
many of the elderly out of poverty – the poverty rate among the elderly is higher
than the population average, their potential contraction may jeopardize the
economic security of the elderly. At the same time, the economic slowdown in the
European Union and Russia is hampering the remittance inflows and growth rates
of remittances is expected to be slower than in the past, making it less likely for
households to rely on this income source to sustain their consumption. Finally, the
agriculture sector is subject to high volatility due to climate and external demand
shocks. Since the poor rely on agriculture as a major part of their income and
consumption, any fluctuations in the sector will affect their wellbeing directly.
Meanwhile, social assistance has limited potential to serve as a safety net for the
poor and vulnerable. The main targeted programs are Ajutor Social (social aid) and
a heating allowance program, both of which are relatively well targeted, but the
coverage is not wide and the benefits low, which constrains the ability of the
programs to respond to widespread downturns in household income.

These challenges point to the need to promote a more vibrant domestic labor
market to lead future progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. This
involves creating more (and better) jobs and enhancing access to education, health,
and services to allow individuals to access those jobs. Some of these policies need to
pay additional attention to the abovementioned structural issues, in particular: (i)
aging – efforts to promote active and healthy aging can help people work longer and
reduce the looming economic dependency ratio growth; (ii) regional and group
disparities – policies to ensure equitable opportunities for rural populations and
ethnic minorities can allow people to better contribute to the economy; and (iii)
economic and climatic shocks – policies to increase adaptation and mitigation of
climatic shocks, including through social assistance programs to protect the
vulnerable in times of needs. Measures to help households manage and adapt to
risks need to be complemented with labor market policies aimed at diversifying
household income sources – particularly for the poor who rely disproportionately
more on agricultural income.

The report is structured as follows. The first section lays out the overall
macroeconomic environment of Moldova in recent years and briefly summarizes
the report findings. Section II describes trends in poverty reduction and shared
prosperity in Moldova. Section III provides analysis of the main factors behind the
progress. Section IV continues by assessing the sustainability of the progress and
pointing out the remaining challenges and risks. The last section discusses policy
implications and concludes.

Moldova has experienced rapid economic growth in the past decade, despite volatility. The
country has grown on average by 5 percent annually since 2000 (Figure 3), much more rapidly than

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects


   Box 1. National Poverty Measurement Methodology
   Poverty in Moldova is measured using a basic needs approach and relies on consumption expenditure as
   an indicator of living standards. Consumption is the preferred welfare indicator because it is more accurately
   measured and less exposed to misreporting. To provide better comparability across the country, the
   consumption aggregate is modified in several ways, as follows:
   •	 Expenditures for durables and rent are excluded from the aggregate because there is not sufficient
       data to estimate correctly the stream of services from durables and imputed rent for the owners of
       housing.
   •	 The differences in energy tariffs are considered, and these price distortions are corrected to account for
      the actual benefit that the household receives.
   •	 Nominal expenditure has been adjusted for inflation as well as for regional price differences through a
      Paasche price index constructed using data collected in the survey and information from the official
      consumer price index.
   •	 To capture the economies of scale within the same households, equivalence scales have been adopted.
      The former scale of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is used: 1 for the
      first household member, 0.7 for any other adult, and 0.5 for children ages below 15.
   The poverty line is set using cost of basic need methods. The food poverty line is set to meet the minimum
   energy requirement of 2,282 calories per day per average person, which corresponds to 3,004 calories per
   day per adult equivalent. The structure of the food bundle is taken directly from the survey and corresponds
   to the actual set of consumed food by the groups in the HBS from the second to the fourth deciles. The
   nonfood component of poverty lines is calculated as the share of nonfood expenditures of households the
   total expenditures of which are equal to the food poverty line. A standard set of poverty measures proposed
   by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) is used to determine the poverty rate.
   The poverty methodology has deteriorated for various reasons. First, the sampling frame is outdated
   because the 2004 census continues to be used. The results of the 2014 census have not yet been released.
   This is an important consideration, given the large changes the country has experienced in the past decade,
   including migration. The poverty line also needs to be updated to reflect changes in consumption patterns,
   particularly because poverty has declined. Efforts to carry out this updating are under way at the NBS.
   Finally, there is high nonresponse at the national level, at 34 percent by December 2013, and response rates
   declined by 2.6 percent between 2006 and 2013. This is driven by refusal rates, which peaked in October
   2010 at 22.3 percent from a baseline of 10.4 percent in January 2006 and stood at 18.1 percent in December
   2013. Starting from an already low response rate in 2006, the response rate continues to be extremely low
   in urban areas (41 percent), particularly in Chișinău (24 percent), after small but systematic declines. In rural
   areas and other regions, the changes are much smaller, and the response levels are higher.

   nonresponse analysis.



Poverty has declined throughout the country, but regional disparities persist. In 2007–09, a period of
sharp GDP contraction, the progress in poverty in urban and rural areas diverged. Poverty increased in rural
areas and declined in urban area (Figure 8). In 2010–14, both poverty rates fell by half, and rural poverty
remained at three times the level of urban poverty (16.3 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively). A similar gap
existed between the urban Chișinău, the capital, which accounts for 23 percent of the population, and the
rest of the country. Although the gap has shrunk in the last decade, poverty in other regions is still more than
five times the rate in Chișinău (Figure 9). Poverty rates in the north, center, and south followed similar
trends, although they diverged from the same starting point in 2007.

share of the economically active population involved in labor emigration grew from 8 percent to 27 percent

population continues to decrease, hence raising the share of migrants among the active population (Figure

The unique geographic location of Moldova has provided the population with many opportunities for
migration. Situated between the EU and Russia, many Moldovans choose these two key emigration
directions. Currently, in the Commonwealth of Independent States (which attracts 63 percent of all Moldovan
emigrants), the most popular migration destination is Russia (56 percent of the labor migrant stock). In the

Spatial and cross-group inequalities persist
The poor and bottom 40 are concentrated in rural areas
Moldova is a rural country, and poverty is a rural phenomenon. Around two-thirds of the population are
estimated to live in rural areas.34 Most people live in the north (31.5 percent) and the center (30.5 percent).
Although the share of the rural population has declined, partly driven by labor migration, the urbanization
profile reveals a greater similarity with Central Asia than with Eastern Europe (Figure 52). Rural poverty
stands at 19 percent compared with urban poverty, at 5 percent. Of the bottom 40, 75 percent live in rural
areas, while 84 percent of the poor live in rural areas; only 7 percent and 2 percent, respectively, live in large
cities (Figure 53 and Figure 54). This is consistent with a higher poverty rate in rural areas relative to cities.
Part of the higher poverty rates in rural areas may be associated with the nature of income sources. Rural
people are dependent on agricultural income and remittances, which are more volatile compared with other
income sources, making these people more vulnerable to poverty (see below and Figure 42 and Figure 43).

    These beneficial effects largely depend on supportive conditions in other sectors. Thus, linking unemployed

    and service development needs an enabling environment for doing business (Berg et al. 2015). The link
    between better transport infrastructure and poverty  36        reduction through greater farm production can be
    mediated by solving issues of land ownership, access to credit, trade barriers, and labor mobility (Starkey
    and Hine 2014).

      Transport policies may also affect households and locations differently, which often leads to ambiguous
      aggregate effects. For instance, households in a village closer to an urban center are likely to pay lower
      prices for consumer goods (manufacturing and services) because of lower transport costs (Emran and
      Hou 2013). But they may also face higher prices for housing and agricultural products because of their
      urban proximity. The relocation of activities from one place to another induced by changes in the transport
      network may have potential gains in one place and losses in the other (Berg et al. 2015). Rural residents
      with greater access to capital and resources, particularly more well educated individuals, are more able to
      adapt to changing market conditions and use new economic opportunities. For this reason, transport
      upgrades are less likely to benefit the chronically poor, at least in the short run (Benjamin et al. 2002;
      Duncan 2007; Starkey and Hine 2014).

      Given the large urban-rural welfare gap in Moldova, exploring how connectivity is associated with
      household consumption, income, and employment outcomes in rural areas is key. This may help expand
      the knowledge base within a multicriteria approach to prioritize road investments through a welfare and
      equity lens.

                                                         Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects


      This initial research focuses on a specific aspect of transport infrastructure and policies: the distance of
      households to roads. Using new geographic information system–based data on the distance of communities
      to three types of roads, local, republican, and magistral (highways), merged with data on households and
      individuals from the 2008–13 HBSs can help identify the links between distance to roads, household
      welfare, and labor market outcomes. Proper instruments to deal with the potential endogeneity of transport
      investments were not found; so, this paper relies on repeated cross-sections with raion- and year-fixed
      effects and assumes that the road network and the quality of the network rarely change within a short
      period.

      The results on the effect of distances to local, republic, and magistral roads on outcome variables among
      rural households and individuals are mixed and nonrobust. These outcome variables include real and
      spatially deflated rural household per capita consumption, labor income, agricultural income among
      individuals, rural household nonfarm income, the probability of poverty based on the absolute poverty
      line and subjective measures, an individual’s probability of employment, and the probability of employment
      in agriculture, conditional on being employed.

      The results suggest other aspects of transport infrastructure and policies should be examined, such as
      prices and transport services, which may matter more than distance to roads. Research is thus needed to
      identify how road quality, transport costs, and the market for transport services affect, especially, rural
      welfare. Given the heterogeneous effects of transport connectivity on labor markets and household welfare,
      the impact may be muted, and unpacking the household and individual benefits of enhanced road networks
      would be crucial.

      a review of existing research on the relationship between transport and poverty reduction (covering about 360 studies). The same
      literature warns about possible negative externalities generated by transport activities such as air pollution, road accidents,
      congestion, impact on health, displacement of the poor, and degradation of ecosystems.




Ethnic and language minorities have less access to services and labor market opportunities36

Ethnic and language minorities face significant barriers to using public services. Moldova is an ethnically
diverse country. Around one-quarter of the population is of other ethnic groups, such as Gagauzian,
Romanian, Russian, and Ukrainian.37 There is also substantial diversity in the languages spoken as the first
language; over a quarter of the population is not exposed to Moldovan at home. In regions where non-
Moldovan groups are more prominent, such as in Gagauzia, children receive substandard instruction in the
national language at school. In 2011, 10 percent of high school graduates in Gagauzia failed to achieve even
a minimum passing score in their Romanian language exams, and were in jeopardy of not graduating. Part
of the reason is that there are not enough qualified Romanian-speaking teachers in Gagauzia or enough
teachers willing to teach in Gagauzia to help improve the quality of learning of the national language. As the
government rolls out the open governance initiative through e-services (all in the national language), the
barriers minority groups will face in using these services will become greater.

The barriers translate into lower labor market opportunities and welfare outcomes. These gaps in
education represent disparities in human capital, which undermine the capacity to obtain quality employment.
Given that data on minority groups are scarce and tend to be underrepresented in national surveys, there is
little information about the magnitude of the disparities. For example, the Roma, who account for a small
share of the population (around 0.4 percent, though they are likely underreported), fare poorly relative to
the general population on almost all welfare indicators. One in five Roma are unable to read or write, and

about a third complete primary school only. One-third of Roma households live in an insecure dwelling, and
more than 80 percent do not benefit from basic housing conditions such as the supply of potable water and
sanitation facilities.38

Households with children and elderly are less well off than the rest of the population
While the gender profile is about the same among the bottom 40 and the poor relative to the rest of the
population, the age profile is different. There are no major differences in gender characteristics across the
bottom 40, the poor, the nonpoor, and the top 60. Poverty has been declining across all age-groups in recent
years, but the elderly (ages 65 and above) and children are slightly more likely to be living in poverty, and,
together, they make up 40 percent of the population. Children account for a higher portion of the poor and
the bottom 40 than of the more well off groups. The share of the population below working age is 19 percent
among the poor compared with 16 percent among the nonpoor (Figure 55). Children are also more likely to
be in the bottom 40 (Figure 56). Among the poor, the share of pensioners—the population above the upper
limit of working age—is also relatively greater. Indeed, regression results show that people ages 55 and over
are substantially more likely to be poor (see annex A). Nonetheless, some pensioners managed to rise to the
top 60, indicated by an expansion in the share of pensioners in this group (beyond the effect of aging).

Migration and aging affect the demographics and, potentially, poverty. The share of people who live in
elderly-only households rose from 9 percent to 11 percent in 2007–14, likely driven by migration. The
elderly, however, are less likely than children to benefit from remittances. Families with children are more
likely to receive remittances, or it may be that having children and facing a higher risk of poverty are key
push factors behind migration (Figure 59). The elderly benefit less from remittances. Though 25 percent of
the population received remittances in 2014, only 10 percent of the people in elderly households did so. This
means that the latter are highly dependent on pensions, which will become less reliable in the future, raising
the risk of poverty among the elderly (see below). The poverty rate has been falling sharply among elderly

The population of Moldova is shrinking and aging rapidly. Driven by declining fertility and accelerating
emigration among the young population, the population shrunk by 16 percent in 2000–15. This is equivalent
to a reduction of around 670,000 people. The share of the working-age population (ages 15–64) rose from
66 percent to 71 percent during the period, creating a demographic dividend for the economy. This occurred

Volatility because of climate shocks is increasing, particularly among the poor and bottom 40
The agricultural sector, critical to the livelihoods of the rural poor, is highly volatile. Episodes of drought,
the most recent in the summer of 2015, are increasingly driving fluctuations in agriculture valued added,
household consumption, and overall GDP (Figure 80). A majority of farm households are smallholders, who
tend to be poorer and have less buffer against shocks. More than one-third of all farm households reported
they faced difficulties in paying for the food needed to ensure decent nutrition among household members
over the previous year. The numbers are higher among subsistence farm households. Subsistence farm
households consume more than 99 percent of their farm production, while other smallholder farm

 This means that there is little left for income generation.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects




Conclusion
Moldova has made good progress in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. However, the drivers
of this progress in the past are likely to exercise a much more limited role.
•	 Aside from increases in nonagricultural wages, pensions have been the biggest contributor to income
    growth among the bottom 40, as well as to poverty reduction. However, pensions are not the most
    efficient means to target the neediest. Moreover, given population aging, the shrinking workforce, and
    currently low employment rates and worker productivity, increases in pension spending will be fiscally
    unsustainable.49
•	 Remittances are volatile and are not likely to continue to grow at the high pace of the past given the
   external context and the already high share of the population living abroad.
Strengthening domestic labor markets is thus becoming more critical in the effort to maintain the progress
toward reaching the twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity and to address the
problems associated with an aging population in a fiscally sustainable manner. The accompanying analysis,
“A Jobs Diagnostic for Moldova,” explores in more detail the main challenges facing the labor market and
the areas for eventual action. Addressing issues of governance, which have taken center stage in Moldova in
recent years, is critical to creating an environment in which the necessary reforms and private sector-led job
creation are possible.

Because of the large share of the population, particularly the poor and the bottom 40, in rural areas and in
the agricultural sector, ensuring that rural areas enjoy the proper conditions for the development of the
nonfarm and farm economies is key. The accompanying analysis, “Structural Transformation of Moldovan
Small-Holder Agriculture and Its Poverty and Shared Prosperity Impacts,” examines the main challenges in
the agricultural sector, focusing on the nature and potential or lack of potential in smallholder agriculture.

Policies to promote healthier labor markets need to take account of and address the structural challenges to
the extent possible, as follows:
•	 Aging: The country needs to prepare for the rapidly aging population. By 2060, the population is projected
    to have dropped by 29 percent, while the share of the elderly (ages 65+) will have tripled to 30 percent.
    Given the substantial migration, low fertility, and weak labor markets, the demographic dividend may
    vanish before the country has reaped the benefits. This raises serious questions about the ability of society
    and the economy to support a growing elderly population.50 Efforts to reduce old-age mortality,
    accompanied by policies to improve education and health care and to promote active aging, can allow
    people to work longer and contribute more to the economy.
•	 Regional disparities: The gaps in welfare and access to services across urban and rural areas and among
   ethnic minorities call for more active engagement by the government to enhance the provision and
   quality of services in remote areas. Failing to address these barriers would risk widening inequality and
   undermining economic mobility and harmonization across the country. Improving the equitable access

      to and the quality of education, particularly among the less well off, is also key to increasing productivity
      and the opportunities to find jobs. Equity in access to services, including health care, without the
      currently high OOP expenditures is also critical to permitting individuals to build up their human
      capital.
•	 Significant vulnerability: The vulnerability to external and climate shocks seems to be increasing, and
   this will affect more heavily those households dependent on the agricultural sector. The poor are more
   highly exposed to such shocks. Mitigation and measures to help households adapt to climate shocks are
   needed. Social assistance can also be improved. The targeting of social assistance has been enhanced
   through the Ajutor Social and heating allowance programs, although they still represent a small share of
   total spending and cover only 4 percent and 6 percent of the total population, respectively. There is
   likewise scope for improvements within the overall expenditure envelope, including program
   consolidation to provide room to expand the coverage of social assistance programs.
Previous analyses of poverty and equity in Moldova point to challenges similar to those discussed in this
report. More than a decade ago, a similar document identified challenges related to the lack of sufficient
investment in human capital accumulation by the poor, large spatial inequalities in living standards,
dependence on pensions, increasing inactivity, and dependence on subsistence agriculture, substantial
migration, and the poor coverage of social assistance.51 Addressing these challenges once and for all is critical
for sustainable growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity in coming years.
