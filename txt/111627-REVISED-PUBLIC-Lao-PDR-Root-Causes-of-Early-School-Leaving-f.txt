22. Almost 1/5 of poor non-Lao Tai girls living in rural
areas never enter school, and a further 16 percent
drop-out before completing primary. The corresponding
rate for poor boys in rural areas is about 10 percent,
while among Lao-Tai the rates are even lower. Another
important result in Figure 13 is overage primary enrollment.
Among poor non Lao-Tai minority groups, about 20
percent of children aged 14-17 are still enrolled in
primary school. It is, of course, possible that these
children will go on to ﬁnish primary school, but by the
time they do so they may no longer have time to
continue their studies at secondary level. If the
family’s—or the child’s—goal was simply to complete
primary school, then this issue of late entry may not be
particularly consequential. But if these children hope
to obtain higher levels of education, their late entry is
going to be a serious constraint on future schooling for
the simple reason that they are entering a period of
their life when they can help their families more with
work (“opportunity costs”), or even start their
own families.

23. A summary of what this report has so far examined
highlights a number of important ﬁndings related to
school attendance and dropout in Lao PDR. These
include:
i.   Never enrolling is more common than early grade
     drop-out, although it is possible that children are
     dropping out of grade one repeatedly, which is a
     version of grade repetition;
ii. Late enrollment in primary school is common,
    especially among the poorest households, and
    among non Lao-Tai families;
iii. Late entry in turn appears to reduce the total time
     that children have to study, although the ultimate
     impact of late entry does depend on how far the
     family intended the child to study;
iv. Leaving school before completing grade 5 is
    prevalent among certain groups, especially girls from
    ethnic groups with disadvantaged backgrounds, who
    live in rural and remote areas.

  The discussion in this section is based on fairly standard economic models of school attendance decision-making, which can be traced to the
earliest versions of human capital theory: see Schultz, T.W. (1963). Human capital. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; and Becker, G.S. (1967).

are also very large literatures in the economics andsociology of education covering topics related to the determinants of schoolattendance,
as well as student outcomes like achievement. See Glewwe, P., E.A. Hanushek, S. Humpage and R. Ravina (2015), “School resources and educational
outcomes in developing countries: A review of the literature from 1990 to 2010”, in Glewwe, P. (2014), Education policy in developing countries.

30. School access refers to a speciﬁc sub-set of school
characteristics. For young children, the most basic indicator
of access is whether or not there is a primary school in
the child’s home village. But access must also be viewed
in terms of the availability of post-primary levels of schooling,
since the importance of completing primary school may
be reduced when post-primary schooling options are far
away. Class size and crowding can also be thought of as
access characteristics, since they potentially impact the
student’s access to the teacher, and to learning
materials.

31. Finally, culture is a commonly cited inﬂuence on
school attendance decisions. In societies with strong
patriarchal norms, girl’s schooling may be valued less, or
even viewed as threatening to the established order.
There are also general cultural beliefs about the importance
of education that can, in turn, impact a household’s
prioritization of school attendance and the help that is
provided children outside of school. This is also related
to child-rearing practices and the degree to which parents
provide a nurturing environment in the home that
facilitates learning and going to school.

DEMAND FOR SCHOOLING
35. For demand, the potential range of inﬂuences is much
broader. Most discussions focus on direct and indirect
costs associated with schooling, which can present
substantial barriers to participation for the poorest fami-
lies. This is because they cannot afford even the basic
school materials that are required (uniform, pencils, etc.),
or because their children are needed to do other things
around the house, ﬁeld, or market.

38. Ethnic groups —especially Mon-Khmer and
Chinese-Tibet—are much more likely to cite “Not
Interested” as the reason for never attending school:
roughly 70 percent of these households chose this
reason. Figure 18 compares reasons for never attending
school (for 10-14 year olds) by ethnic group and gender.
Several results stand out. Firstly, the explanations are
similar to those given in the 2010 LFS data, with “Not
interested” being mentioned most frequently. However,
the prevalence of “Not Interested” among ethnic groups
does not appear to be explained by a cultural “mismatch,”
or concern about the language or adequacy of the
teaching force.

40. Taken together, the results in Figures 17 and 19 help
to better understand the underlying dynamics of school
attendance in Lao PDR, which in turn will help identify
policy options and new interventions (see below). In terms
of supply-side inﬂuences, relatively few households cite a
lack of schools (or teachers) as the reason for not entering
school, or dropping out. However, these responses may
be somewhat misleading, since roughly 40 percent of
children who left school after completing grade 3 were
studying in a school that did not offer grade 4, while 30
percent of children who left after grade 4 had no grade
5 to go on to. These results again point to the need to
make all primary schools in Lao PDR complete. However,
it is important to note that not all children who drop out
before completing primary school are doing so because
of supply-side constraints.

41. Rather than supply constraints, the most commonly
cited reasons for never attending or dropping out indicate
a combination of low perceived value of education ("no                   a large proportion of children contribute to household
interest", "no value", etc.) and high perceived cost. The                chores and economic activity.As they get older, the
cost of attending school can be relatively high for a poor               potential value of children to their households only
family, which mainly refers to the cost of uniforms, food                increases(Figure 21). This appears to be especially true
and transport (Figure 20). In terms of opportunity costs,                for girls.

characteristics having the largest effects on learning
outcomes, although teaching practices are shown to
have larger effects than in the ASLO results. Two teaching
and learning process indicators have positive effect sizes
of the same magnitude as the most signiﬁcant back-
ground variables (e.g., gender, SES). Many variables
from the EGRA questionnaires are not included in the
summary due to a lack of statistical signiﬁcance. These
include the frequency of parental meetings, the
frequency of pedagogical advisor visits, reading hours,
coverage of pedagogical advisor topics, the existence of
a reading corner at the school and the number of hours
of its use. The preponderance of insigniﬁcant classroom         50. Several factors could be driving this strong

60. The role of the pedagogical advisors also seems crucial,
as they provide support to teachers and to VEDC members.
Both pedagogical advisors and VEDC members were inter-
viewed. The typical pedagogical advisor interviewed had
worked in that capacity for 12 years, and most had gradu-
ated from a training college. They were mostly male. In the
middle and top-performing cohorts, all pedagogical advisors
had graduated from training college. This was less common
in the low-performing cohort. Those in the top-performing
cohort reported spending less time on administrative work,
more time observing teachers, and were more likely to report
visiting schools. These pedagogical advisors in the
top-performing cohort were also more likely to share their
evaluations with the school.
