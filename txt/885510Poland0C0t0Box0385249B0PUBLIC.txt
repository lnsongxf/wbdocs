II. Methodology
In May-July 2013, 278 stakeholders of the World Bank in Poland were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minister; office of
a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation
agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the
financial sector/private banks; NGOs; the media; independent government institutions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 92 stakeholders participated in the survey (33% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via post and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Poland; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Poland; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Poland.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Poland: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Poland is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities in the country, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty,
   boosting shared prosperity, and generating economic growth in Poland.

II. Methodology
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Poland, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Poland solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner .
   Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, the most effective
   instruments in helping reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in Poland, with which
   stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, to what extent the Bank should
   influence the global development agenda, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed
   or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Poland’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across twenty four development areas, such as public sector governance/reform,
   job creation/employment, private sector development, and economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   effectiveness in providing implementation support and sharing international best practices,
   disbursing funds promptly, providing services tailored to Polish circumstances, and
   increasing Poland’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Poland: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Poland in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank, that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that
   the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Poland, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from PMUs were combined with
        consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects/programs; respondents from
        private sector organizations were combined with those from the financial sector/private
        banks; and the few respondents from the Office of the President, Prime Minister, office of
        a minister, NGOs, private foundations, and the media were included in the “Other”

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There was one instance in which there were significant stakeholder group differences
        across these twenty four areas of development. Respondents from private sector
        organizations/financial sector/private banks and academia/research institutes/think tanks
        gave the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in the education sector whereas
        employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies and
        respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank-supported projects gave
        significantly lower effectiveness ratings.

       Respondents across all geographic locations in Poland gave statistically similar ratings
        for the World Bank’s effectiveness in these twenty four areas of development.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Poland, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty four specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results incr ease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development resu lts.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Poland. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at trade and exports; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment.
       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Poland, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at trade and exports; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.
