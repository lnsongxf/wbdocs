DR. KIM: We are here altogether because we know that the world needs to fight climate
change with much, much greater seriousness; so 40 ministers will be here today to discuss
the issue of climate change. Taking action now will not only solve the problem of protecting
the planet, but it will be a tremendous boost for economies.


We know that climate change will strengthen economic growth, especially in the poorest
countries, but everywhere as well. We are tackling some of the most difficult issues.
Despite the fact that it's controversial we've got to tackle the issue of carbon pricing. Some
countries are already working very hard on this. Others know that it's a direction that we
have to go.

Its 165 days before the climate summit that the Secretary General has called. We have to
get serious about bringing real commitments to the table for that summit in
September. That will set us up for COP20 in Lima, Peru, and then we hope that it will lead
to a very different outcome in Paris in 2015, where we'll come with some very serious
agreements that we can all take to protecting the planet and battling climate change. Thank
you.
