Overview
Transportation Asset Management is a strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, upgrading
and expanding physical assets effectively throughout their lifecycle. It focuses on business and engineering
practices for resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of better decision-making based upon
quality information and well defined objectives. This definition from AASHTO1 envisages an end-to-end
process, which is able to address both the short-term and long-term needs of the assets, in order to deliver
the services to those using the road, in the most cost-effective manner.

Climate change, in the realm of asset management is being considered as a disruptive force within the
otherwise stable asset management process. While there are many theories on what is causing climate
change (and equally how to prevent it from worsening), evidence suggests that the climate is changing with
two key outcomes being observed:

    •	    Average temperatures, rainfall and other climate related indicators are changing from year-to-
    	     year; and
    •	    Extreme events are occurring more frequently than in past decades.

The impacts of climate change are not expected to be equally shared by all countries, illustrating that many
of the less developed countries are also facing the greatest vulnerability to climate change impacts. The
impact, however, will not be isolated to countries with higher vulnerability, it will affect everyone.

The question then arises as to how road authorities should go about integrating climate change thinking into
their business-as-usual asset management processes.

The Asset Management Process

There is no universal asset management process that all road authorities follow. Here, the AM Process from
the International Infrastructure Management Manual (NAMS, 2011) has been adopted as per Figure O.2. It
is envisaged that those road authorities following a different process, will be able to identify largely similar
steps in their processes and from this, still be able to relate to, and implement the recommendations.

Climate Change – Slow Changing versus Shock Events

Road networks are the socio-economic backbone of any community. They provide access and movement
of people and goods that fulfil all the functions necessary for people in a community to live and prosper.
Roads mostly consist of natural gravels in combination with other materials such as asphalt and concrete.
The design of the pavements and materials takes into account the natural impact of the environment.
Engineers are well aware of the negative impact water ingress has on pavements and design the pavements
and associated drainage assets to counter this impact. Likewise, asphalt and other surfacing materials are
designed for prevailing climatic conditions including rainfall and ambient temperatures expected during the
design life of the surface.

Both rainfall and temperatures are starting to vary beyond the accepted design envelopes in the current
design methods and standards of road pavement, surfacing and drainage structures. While slow changing
environmental impacts put strain on the performance of the road network, a more significant impact is
often observed from shock events of weather patterns.

Historical design methods expect shock events to exceed the design parameters on the premise that
these events are infrequent. Recent studies have strongly indicated these shock events to be increasing in
frequency and intensity, such that roads are now subject to more extreme events within their design life.
Simply accepting these events to exceed the design capacity of roads and structures is not a sustainable
option any longer as there is a shortening of life cycles and/or temporary loss of accessibility. As an example,
Table O.3 lists the main climate change events expected in the Nordic countries and how these impact on
the road infrastructure. The NDF (2016) report also lists a number of mitigation or adaptation techniques to
combat some of the impacts listed in the following table O.3.

In general, the long-term changes in average climatic indicators can be readily assimilated into the AM
processes owing to the life cycle of many road assets being less than that of the time it takes for significant
change to occur. The main exceptions being around very long life assets such as structures and major
drainage assets wherein designing for the climate that is present today will likely not meet the requirements
throughout the life of the asset.

Shock events occur frequently even within the lifecycle of the shorter-lived road assets and therefore needs
to be considered as part of the day-to-day business of the road authority. This includes preparing in advance
of the events; how to respond during an event; and what is to be rebuilt after the event to ensure a ‘build
back better’ outcome is achieved to make the network more resilient for when the next event occurs.

Response to Climate Change

Prior to Events

As part of the business-as-usual practices within a road authority, there are a number of actions that can be
taken to prepare for climate change (both long-term changes and shock events) with these including:

     •	   Identifying key (life line) routes recognizing the many roads are also corridors other essential 		
          infrastructure such as water, power etc.;
     •	   Having agreements in place on how the damage from major events will be funded and who will be
          entitled to financial support;
     •	   Developing models that predict the impacts of climate change events on the road network, including
          the collection of data to feed and calibrate these models;
     •	   Defining what resilience means for different road categories and making residents and road users 	
          aware of how long they may be without transport access after events;
     •	   Having contracts in place with the private sector to respond to shock events when they do occur;
     •	   Revising design guides to take into account the changing frequency of climatic events;
     •	   Retrofitting infrastructure that is found to be deficient; and
     •	   Trialing new materials that may better resist climate change.


During and Immediately After Events

During major shock events, most road authorities will be focused on the monitoring of the network and
making road closures as necessary to ensure that safety is not compromised. In the immediate aftermath,
roads will typically be reinstated to facilitate basic access. It is during these periods that much of the prior
planning will come into benefit.


Post Events

After the initial response is over, if large scale damage has occurred, there is an opportunity to build back a
road network that is more resilient to future events for relatively little (if any) additional cost. Furthermore,
there will be an opportunity to use data collected during the event to update predictive models and to refine
processes further.


Disaster Response and the AM Process

Figure O.4 takes the previously presented AM process and overlays the above discussion on responses. Of
note is that most of the means of integrating climate change into asset management is related to being
prepared in advance of the event. Only three activities arise during the event, and one after.
Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management                                                                                    11




During the event, the response is largely restricted to the operational and maintenance plans in place, and
the format of any service delivery contracts. In the long term, the response is largely constrained to the
capital works strategies that are in place.

Collectively this all points to a position that the best time to address climate change is before you need to
deal with it – i.e. now.

Recommended Approach to Integration of Climate Change into Asset
Management

Table O.5 contains a recommended series of actions for road authorities to undertake across the full scope
of asset management. Not all recommended actions will be applicable to all road authorities, although it
is certainly advisable to at least consider each within the overall asset management improvement process.
12                                                                     Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




For some highly vulnerable road networks, actions beyond those in the table may be necessary. In extreme
cases these steps may go as far as abandonment of certain road assets that cannot be reasonably protected
from climate change. While such a decision is feasible from an asset management decision making process,
the consequence of such a decision is beyond the scope addressed in this study – which is predicated on the
basis that existing routes would be developed and protected from climate change.

Conclusions
Even though climate change is widely accepted as being upon us, few road authorities have moved beyond
cursory consideration of how to include this into their business processes and practices. Unfortunately,
many of the most vulnerable parts of the world for climate change impacts are also the least economically
developed – meaning that the impacts will be magnified if mitigation measures are not put in place, while at
the same time, resources are constrained for investing in effective mitigation measures.

Asset management is an overarching business model that provides the framework upon which climate
change initiatives can be readily implemented into a road authority. This transport note and the associated
technical report have identified a range of specific actions that road authorities should be considering as
part of their asset management practices.

In practice, the vast majority of measures to mitigate climate change needs to be put in place prior to major
events to yield maximum benefit and ensure that the services provided by the road network are restored as
soon as practicable and that the network is made more resilient after an event.

1.  Introduction
1.1  The Changing Climate

There is a wealth of scientific reports that records the actual climatic changes that have been taking
place during recent years. While there is debate over the causes of climate change, the rate at which this
phenomenon is increasing (World Bank, 2013; and Ebinger and Vandycke, 2015) is overwhelming – with
the evidence indicating that the changes in our environment will impact large parts of the globe. Figure 1.1
illustrates the vulnerability for the different regions around the world. It is accepted that some regions will
be affected more than others; however, climate change will be a global problem as many of the countries
predicted to be most impacted are also the least developed to deal with it.

Figure 1.1: Vulnerability of Climate Risk on Global Level (Ebinger and Vandycke, 2015)




Although the actual climate warming and sea level rise predictions are not massive, the impact on the
earth’s climatic balance is significant. An observation from literature suggests that climate change results
in prevailing weather patterns to be more amplified. Therefore, if extreme rainfall impacted on a country
16                                              Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




before, the frequency and intensity of these storms are increasing. The same applies to other weather
patterns such as droughts. Therefore, one can expect the following impacts on the different regions around
the globe:

     •	   Extreme rainfall events;
     •	   Seasonal and annual average rainfall;
     •	   Higher maximum temperature and higher number of consecutive hot days (heat waves);
     •	   Droughts (consecutive dry days); and,
     •	   Extreme wind speed.

Most noticeable is the increase in floods and storms, especially within the South-East Asia region. For
example, Figure 1.2 indicates the number of floods and storms for some Asian regions between 2000 and
2008. The significant increasing number of floods is self-evident.

                                                                    Indonesia

The number of floods is obviously only one part of the statistics, the loss suffered by countries due to
these storms are astronomical. For example, Table 1.1 illustrates the damage caused by storms in Samoa
since 1990 in terms of the scale of each storm, the damage and losses in GDP. The scale of the damage is
significant, being more that twice the annual GDP for some storms.

Some additional observations from the table include:

    •	    The nature of each storm was different and as a result different sectors are being affected with each
          storm;
    •	    During the past 22 years, there were three storms exceeding the 1:50 year expected return period
          with two of these exceeding the 1:100 expected return period;
    •	    There is some indication that the asset damage is decreasing over time due to Samoa adopting
          more resilient options, although this could be owing to changes in storm patterns.

Some countries may even be impacted by a number of specific climatic changes. A vulnerability assessment
of Mozambique showed an increase in floods, tropical cyclones, and droughts (Refer to Figure 1.3). An
alarming relationship is also shown between the increase in climatic events and the increase in human
epidemics.

Overall, climate change impacts are grouped into two categories – slow changes to average temperatures/
rainfalls, and an increase in the frequency of large shock events. The following section details the specific
impact on road infrastructure.

1.2  The Impact of Climate Change on Road Infrastructure –
Slow Changing versus Shock Events

Road networks are the socio-economic backbone of any community. They provide access and movement of
people and goods that fulfil all the functions necessary for people in a community to live and prosper. Roads
mostly consist of natural gravels in combination with other materials such as asphalt and concrete. The
design of the pavements and materials takes account the natural impact of the environment. Engineers are
well aware of the negative impact water ingress has on pavements and design the pavements and associated
drainage assets to counter this impact. Likewise, asphalt and other surfacing materials are designed for
prevailing climatic conditions including rainfall and expected ambient temperatures expected during the
design life of the surface.

Both rainfall and temperatures are starting to vary beyond the accepted design envelopes for the design
methods of road pavement, surfacing and drainage structures. While slow changing environmental impacts
put strain on the performance of the road network, a more significant impact is often observed from shock
events of weather patterns. Historical design methods expect shock events to exceed the design parameters
accepting that these events are normally infrequent. Yet, the previous section has indicated these shock
events to be increasing in frequency and intensity – such that roads are subject to more extreme events
Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management                                                              19



within their design life. Simply accepting these events to exceed the design capacity of roads and structures
is not a sustainable option any longer with the consequence being both a shortening of life cycles and/or
temporary loss of accessibility along the road. Table 1.2 lists the main climate change events expected in the
Nordic countries and how these impact on the road infrastructure.

The NDF (2016) report also lists a number of mitigation or adaptation techniques to combat some of the
impacts listed in the table above. The asset management approach incorporating some of these techniques
is discussed further in following sections.




1.3  Objectives of Technical Report


The aim of this technical note is to explore the opportunities for integrating climate change into road asset
management. Specific objectives are to:

     •	   Review the entire asset management process in the context of how climate adaptation measures
          could be incorporated;
     •	   Explore specific techniques related to data collection and decision making that fits within the
          problem domain of climate adaptation; and,
     •	   Identify the future development issues that will assist seamless integration of climate adaptation
          into asset management processes.

2.  Integrating the process of Asset Management in
the Context of Climate Adaptation
2.1  Traditional Asset Management Process

There are many definitions for asset management, all highlighting the importance of asset management to
deliver an acceptable level of service. One example definition is:


               Transportation Asset Management is a strategic and systematic process of
               operating, maintaining, upgrading, and expanding physical assets effectively
               throughout their lifecycle. It focuses on business and engineering practices for
               resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of better decision making
               based upon quality information and well defined objectives.

               Source: AASHTO Subcommittee on Asset Management in January 2006



Considering the definition of asset management, it is only logical that asset management would be an
effective vehicle for driving appropriate climate adaption measures for countries. Comprehensive asset
management results in understanding the resilience of the network and striving to deliver the required
level of resilience for the least cost. However, many road authorities are not well positioned to incorporate
climate change into their asset management practices and processes as a result of not understanding the
magnitude of the consequence; not understanding the issues involved; not having the data to implement
change; or simply having other more pressing demands on time and resources. Overall it is considered
that much more could be done through asset management in creating a better future through appropriate
infrastructure strategies.

Figure 2.1 shows the traditional asset management process that are being grouped into “understanding the
requirements”, “development of strategies” and “asset management enablers” For each of these groups and
each item listed under these groupings, there are actions that can be taken to embed climate adaptation
measures into asset management planning. The lay-out of the asset management process within Figure 2.1
forms the structure of the remainder of this report.

2.2  Asset Management Needs Created through Climate Change

There are two distinct climatic changes that should be allowed for in asset management (Refer to Figure 2.2):

   1.	 Road infrastructure will be impacted through slow changing climatic trends such as increasing
       temperatures and higher rainfall and/or longer drought periods. These changes will impact on the
       long-term performance of infrastructure thus automatically impact on the entire asset management
       planning activities. For the purpose of this report, all asset management processes and activities
       related to the slow changing environments will be under improving resilience and readiness
       activities of climate adaptation; and,
   2.	 Shock events often resulting in major parts of road networks being destroyed. Effective use of asset
       management processes in advance of the event, during the event and within the rebuild planning
       stages, assist not only in more efficient rebuild scheduling but also assist in the long-term strategic

In relation to the asset management process in Figure 2.1, shock events are primarily addressed through
the identification of risks, and the operational and maintenance plans; while slow changing climatic trends
encompass the entire asset management process.

The World Bank has defined the four pillars of climate adaption in Table 2.1 as being Sectoral & Spatial
Planning; Resilient Infrastructure Solutions; Enabling Environment; and Post-Disaster Risk & Recovery
Support. All four of the pillars indicated can be addressed through using asset management processes
and enablers. In the same World Bank report, the monitoring techniques and adaption strategies were
further explored to identify the asset management system component that addresses the needs from a
climate adaptation perspective (refer to Table 2.2). Subsequent sections explore these asset management
components in more detail.

3.  Asset Management Policies and Strategic Aspects
3.1  Driving Successful Implementation from an Executive Level

McPherson and Bennett (2005) investigated the key success factors of Road Management Systems (RMS)
that could be categorised into three groups: processes; people; and technology, all being adequately support
by sufficient funding (Refer to Figure 3.1).

As with other studies, McPherson and Bennett (2005) also emphasised the importance of having the
executive level of countries, agencies and organisations specifically driving the successful adoption of asset
management processes and systems (now also including climate adaptation aspects). The conclusions form
this study is directly relevant to asset management today and tomorrow with an increased emphasis on
taking account of the pressures from the environment and providing services to an ever-changing population.
Figure 3.2 presents a framework of such a holistic asset management process that takes account of the
challenges we are facing today and increasingly tomorrow.

Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management                                                        27




               Executives and managers would be demonstrably committed to the system, both in
               their relations with external stakeholders and internally in their agency through good
               management principles. Policies would explicitly state the goals and objectives of the
               organization with regard to road asset management, and procedures would detail exactly
               how the RMS would be used to achieve these goals.



Some specific recommendations from the McPherson and Bennett (2005) report worth repeating are:

   •	   Funding: Have annual budgets in place for data collection and operation of the RMS. Even if this
        initially requires donor funding support, there should be a phased increase in local budgeting to
        ensure that the RMS is self-funding within a given timeframe.
   •	   Introduction of an RMS by itself is not a guarantee that it will be used, or that it will be successful.
        The agency must also follow basic asset management principles. Strong involvement of executives
        and managers prior to and during the implementation of the system is absolutely necessary.
   •	   Clear and explicit RMS planning and programming cycle/schedule developed with clear deadlines of
        and correlation between main tasks
   •	   Annual Reports/Business Plans should be prepared, using ‘Asset Value’ and other Key Performance
        Indicators derived from the RMS. This is an executive and managerial responsibility. It also helps put
        focus on the RMS itself, since it provides the data and improves the chances that budget and funds
        are available to run the system.
   •	   Institutional support consisting of high ranking decision-makers fully-committed to the asset
        management/asset preservation ‘philosophy’.
   •	   Regular briefings should be given to ministers and other high government officials on the importance
        of asset preservation, and what is being done to make sure that the preservation of the road
        infrastructure is dealt with satisfactorily
   •	   Have specific and realistic key performance indicators, targets to measure asset value and to
        preserve/enhance that value. Monitor those targets, and assess at the end of each year whether
        they have achieved them or not, and take appropriate action. By publishing this information in
        Annual Reports, they are accountable to it.
   •	   Have policies and procedures in place for data collection, and for quality assurance of that data.
   •	   Technical (internal and/or external) auditing must be carried out on data and systems, and the
        recommendations acted on.
   •	   A program of Continual Quality Improvement is also critical. No system is static. All systems can be
        improved.

3.2.1  Integration of Climate Adaption into Asset Management

In response to legislation that detailed more formal asset management expectations in countries such
as New Zealand (Local Government Act, 2002) and the USA (MAP-21), local road agencies have created
dedicated teams who were responsible for asset management planning and processes. The creation of
asset management teams did not only ensure that there was sufficient focus on achieving the delivery of
asset management plans and strategies, but it also ensured that a common team was planning across all
engineering disciplines.

These dedicated asset management teams did not undertake all aspects of asset management in all parts of
an organisation as part of the asset management process. Instead, the asset management teams ensured
a common understanding was in place and took responsibility for ensuring that all parts of the organisation
were aware of their respective responsibilities from an asset management perspective. Similar approaches
have been successfully adopted by all manner of organisations for addressing health and safety requirements.

The same principle applies when venturing into integrating climate adaptation into asset management. The
asset management process is already a complex process that requires the input from a multi-disciplinary
team. This is further complicating by introducing climate adaptation aspects into the planning processes. It
is therefore recommended to have a dedicated asset management team that also include experts in climate
adaption needs and technologies.


3.2.2  Governing Major Rebuilding Programmes


Normal governance structures simply cannot cope with major rebuilding planning and activities. The reality
is that the governance structure of road agencies is normally structured to fulfil the “business-as-usual”
operations. Following a major shock event, a completely separate and dedicated governance structure
needs to take full ownership of all aspects related to the rebuilding programme.

For example, following the Christchurch earthquakes in 2012 and 2013, the city was faced with a significant
rebuild programme of the CBD and infrastructure within the entire city’s boundaries. For such a significant
rebuilding process an additional governance structure had to be set up to manage the investment,
programming, decision process and contracts. The Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team
(SCIRT) was established as an alliance between the Christchurch City Council, the NZTA Transport Agency, the
New Zealand Government and the five major infrastructure contractors from New Zealand that participated
in the rebuilding process. The Alliance was managed by a Board representing each of the Alliance partners.
Separately, a Client Governance Group consisting of representatives of the government, Christchurch City
Council and the New Zealand Transport Agency provided direction to the Alliance on scope and programme
priorities. A similar governance structure could also be set up in situation where an external donor or funding
agency assists a country during a rebuilding process.

The responsibilities of the Client Governance Group were (OAG, 2013a):

   •	    The CGG’s role is to produce and maintain a governance framework for delivering the Infrastructure
         Rebuild Plan. This includes providing a process for escalating issues and making decisions about
         infrastructure, and appointing subcommittees as needed.
   •	    The CGG has several strategic and planning roles. It is to inform the development of wider recovery
         strategies and to ensure that work delivered under the SCIRT alliance is consistent with the wider
         recovery strategies. Also, the CGG has to prepare a process for approving decisions about betterment
         and exceptions to standards. External factors can affect the work of the Alliance, and the CGG is
         responsible for considering and responding to the effect of those factors.

     •	                   All members of the CGG are directly or indirectly funders of SCIRT. Therefore, the CGG approves
                          the annual work programme and budgets, and co-ordinates SCIRT’s funding requirements. It also
                          reviews audit reports and the implementation of controls.
     •	                   The CGG is responsible for meeting the clients’ obligations under the Alliance Agreement. It monitors
                          SCIRT’s progress and budget through annual and monthly reports that cover progress, trends, and
                          performance against milestones and performance objectives. Importantly, the CGG is to ensure
                          value for money and manage prioritization of the rebuild programme to be delivered by SCIRT within
                          the available funding.




3.3  Funding, Policy and Legislation

Some infrastructure agencies around the world would take out insurance cover against natural disasters.
However, it often happens that the insurance is not sufficient to cover all damages as many disaster damages
are more widespread compared to estimated “worse cases”. Following the Christchurch earthquake during
2013, the significant shortfall in insurance has resulted in New Zealand Government having to significantly
assist with the rebuild costs. As a consequence, the Office of the Auditor General conducted a study into the
level of insurance cover amongst local government and concluded that a large number of the agencies were
not insured (Refer to Figure 3.4).

The cost of disasters in the future could well be astronomical unless prior mitigation measures are put in
place to minimise the impacts. Figure 3.5 shows the global estimated economic loss due to all disaster
hazards. It is safe to assume that only a small portion of the infrastructure indicated in the high-risk areas
would be insured. This is mostly where governments, donor organisations and relief funds assist those
affected by disasters.


                         When a disaster hits, where is the money going to come from?




Figure 3.5: Estimated Economic Loss due to Disaster Hotspots - All Hazards




The reality is that pre-empting disasters, planning and mitigating some of the risk would be far less costly
than trying to recover from an “unforeseen” disaster. Therefore, it is recommended that countries and
agencies prepare for disasters at this level through:

   •	   Planning the funding resources that could be utilised following a disaster including insurance,
        cash reserves, and agreements in principle with external financiers. Where these are not in place,
        then it is likely that funds will be diverted from normal maintenance and renewal activities, into
        the recovery activities – which in turn places the wider network at a higher risk of deterioration.
        Understanding this potential in advance is essential to determining where to source funds for the
        recovery should come from;
   •	   Policy has to be developed in order to:
        ◦ provide for adapting planning processes to take account of climate change;
          have policies in place in mitigating disastrous events;
        	
        ◦ develop policies for dealing with all aspects related to disaster response, including emergency 	 	
          protocols, recovery governance and rebuilding organisation;
32                                             Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




     •	   Legislative preparedness: Often, policy that sources and distributes funding needs to be supported
          and controlled through appropriate legislation. In most cases, the nature of events would be
          unknown until it occurs and pre-empting the required legislation may be difficult to foreseen.
          However, if only a process of passing emergency legislation is enabled, it may ease the process
          following a disaster; and,
     •	   Agencies should focus on creating analysis capabilities to assess options for resilience. The aim
          would be to minimise investment over the long run in addressing slow changing climatic impacts,
          preparing for disasters and rebuilding following disasters (Refer to Section 6).

A key learning point from many disasters is that trying to develop policies while immersed within disaster
does not always lead to sound decision making. Policies of who would be entitled to compensation under
various scenarios should be developed rationally; independent from the disaster taking place, rather than
being developed in the midst of a rebuild programme.




3.4 Procurement

Procurement is one of the most important delivery mechanisms for an effective implementation of an
asset management strategy. In the context of climate adaptation, the area of procurement is such a broad
subject matter that it warrants a full study of its own. Table 3.1 list some procurement actions that may be
considered by road agencies in the context of climate adaptation.

In addition to the actions in the table that can be worked into existing contracts, there is also the potential
to have ‘on-call’ emergency response contracts with industry that cover typical urgent response tasks. Such
contracts can sit in addition to either in-house force account or private sector contractors that are involved
with the day-to-day maintenance of the network.

  Adaptation Stage         Action
  Addressing resilience   Include specific climate adaptation strategies e.g. in China the Bank project OPRC
  and slow changing       project has two elements: 1. Trial different asphalt mixes. 2. Increase the capacity of
  climate impacts         drainage facilities in conjunction with other works on the network.
                          Include the ability into contracts to incentivise innovation for climate adaptation
                          technologies
  Post disaster Event     •	   Long-term contracts should include performance measures on key vulnerabilities
  Procurement             •	   Long-term contracts should include clauses to deal with shock events
                          •	   Pre-developed contract templates should be prepared to deal with post disaster
                               works
                          •	   Policies and legislation to allow for most efficient procurement formats and
                               strategies
                          •	   A governance structure to be in place for managing multi-contracts and
                               administration. (See Section 1.1.1)

4.  Asset Information Management
4.1  Background to Asset Management Data

Robust data, data management and information management systems are core to all the asset management
activities. This section will not go into any detail on the data collection, management or storing aspects related
to “business as normal” asset management. The aim of this section is to highlight any potential implications
on current data practices from integrating climate adaption considerations into asset management. A list of
the asset management use of asset data that would also be relevant for climate adaptation integration are
(AUSTROADS, 2016):

    •	   Network extent and definition including geospatial maps;
    •	   Asset valuations;
    •	   Risk Management;
    •	   Condition/performance monitoring and management;
    •	   Demand Management;
    •	   Access management;
    •	   Works cost recording and reporting;
    •	   Forecasting decision making tools; and,
    •	   Forward works programming and planning.

The characteristics of data to note are summarised in Table 4.1.

4.1  Background to Asset Management Data

Asset managers often make a mistake of defining data needs on the basis of what they are able to collect.
A far more effective manner to determine data needs is to consider the ultimate use of the data and often
it centres on the decisions that have to be made and what knowledge or information is required to make
those decisions. Figure 4.1 illustrates the progression from data to knowledge, accepting data without any
interpretation is often of little value. Also, knowledge is based on a combination of data from various sources
plus experience.

The purpose of data use in asset management is listed in the previous section. It is expected that climate
change may have an influence on all the outcomes of the asset management activities listed. As for specific
climate adaption data, three distinct areas are identified by Dinshaw et al., (2012):

     •	     Problem definition – Qualify and quantify the specific issues climate adaptation needs to resolve.
            Data that would enable vulnerability assessments, assessment of risk exposure and future impact
            studies;
     •	     Adaptation options analysis and selection – Any technology, processes and/or design addressing
            climate adaptions needs to undergo either economic, financial or socio-economic assessments.
            Sufficient data in terms of the exact impact and life expectancy of these technologies would be
            essential for these types of analysis; and,

    •	   Monitoring and Learning – Although sufficient data exist on the climate change itself, little data and
         knowledge exist on the exact impact of climate change and the success of adaptation in mitigating
         some of these risks. There is a mammoth data need in the area of climate adaptation impact data
         in order to build onto the knowledge base of this topic area. At the simplest level this includes the
         recording of the magnitude of climate related events (e.g. depth and duration of flooding, along
         with rain fall data) such that models can be developed and calibrated to local conditions. While at
         the more complex level, the data includes detailed analysis of temperatures and associated changes
         in pavement performance over time.


4.2.1  Data Needs for Improving Resilience and Adaptation


In order to improve the overall systems resilience, much can be achieved through keeping and storing the
right type of data. Data fulfil two distinct functions in improving resilience including:

    •	   Data can contribute towards understanding vulnerabilities on a network and also highlight areas
         that could be address to mitigate these risk; and
    •	   Secondly, by storing the right kind of data in a useful format, data could significantly assist in the
         recovery and rebuilding processes following a shock event.
 
Table 4.2 lists some data items that could assist in the improvement of resilience. Please note that the
purpose of the table is not be a complete list of data required for day-to-day asset management activities, it
rather just highlights specific resilience improvement data items.

4.2.2  Post Disaster Data Needs


There is no stronger emphasis on the importance of data than having to start planning post disaster recovery
or rebuilding processes without any data. It is equally important to have robust data of the network prior to
an event as it is to have sufficient and appropriate data post shock event. These two temporal datasets give
the required perspective on a GAP analysis of infrastructure needs being:

     •	   What infrastructure services was in place prior to the event;
     •	   What has been damaged during the event; and,
     •	   What needs to be replaced under given geographical or physical constraints for post disaster
          environment and/or in cognisance of potential future re-occurrence of shock events? For
          example, infrastructure may not be re-established in areas of liquefaction or areas where future
          flooding is certain.
Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management                                                    37



Most disasters are followed by a period of urgency in order to get the data collection, planning completed
and recovery and rebuilding processes commencing as soon as possible. Some of the drivers towards rapid
data collection and planning are:

   •	   An urgent period of the response and recovery stage is to identify locations of on-going hazards to
        the community. These areas need to be cordon off or neutralised for further harm to the community;
   •	   The agency has a limited time period to appeal for additional funding and/or relieve aide, knowing
        the exact extent of damage strengthen the case for relieve funds;
   •	   The recovery includes the urgency of getting critical assets functioning quickly, again driving the
        needs to have an understanding of the damage to these asset groups;
   •	   Despite media focusing on the tragic side of any disaster, what is often of greater importance is to
        get the local economy up and running as soon as possible. With infrastructure being the back-bone
        of the socio-economic environment, it is critical to get the infrastructure functioning as soon as
        possible.

Little evidence was found on the specific stages of data collection following a shock event but it is
recommended that this should be done in two stages of:

   •	   Stage 1: Initial screening for determining the functionality of the road network in terms of access
        and potential hazards. For example, some of the items being recorded at this point may include:
        ◦ Evacuation routes/highways being blocked and/or over congested;
        ◦ Road closures plus reason for closure (broken/abandoned vehicles, other objects on the road or
           unpassable damage;
        ◦ Bridge damage/closure;
        ◦ Flooding as a result of event or secondary flooding due to broken pipes;
        ◦ Risk of secondary spills, leaking gas pipes or fallen power lines; and;
        ◦ Pedestrians or people evacuating on foot.
   •	   Stage 2 – Detail assessment or repair needs – this stage would do more detailed damage
        assessment of targeted infrastructure in order to determine the actual damage and repair/
        rebuilding requirements. This assessment would also include feasibility of emergency repairs
        that may temporarily restore the functionality of the route with some more intensive restoration
        happening at a later stage.

The following sections detail some technologies related to the data collection and management of the data.
38                                               Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




4.3  Closing the Data Needs Gap

The prior sections have shown that the bulk of data required for climate adaptation is already part of the
data requirements for business as normal asset management. Unfortunately, it is also known that in most
countries having robust and complete data for asset management planning remains an on-going challenge
for road agencies. In some cases, the value of investing into data collection may even be questioned.
However, there is no smarter investment than ensuring sufficient information is available for the required
decision making processes. The value of sufficient information is more amplified in the context of adapting
to climate change.

The priorities for closing data gaps are as follows:

     1.	 Ensure sufficient and robust data is collected for day-to-day asset management purposes (See
         Bennett et al., 2007);
     2.	 Undertake a criticality analyses on main routes;
     3.	 Including geospatial element to all data;
     4.	 Start storing climate data;
     5.	 Gather and store vulnerability information;
     6.	 Gather specific adaptation information;
     7.	 Create capabilities for rapid data collection processes.


            Better data and information assist in better decision making. Investing into the collection of
            relevant data and information is the first and foremost investment into climate adaptation.




4.4  Data Security/Resilient Systems

Cyber security has become an important resilience topic area, similar to that of resilience of the physical
asset. Our dependence on computer and web technology has left us vulnerable to this technology going off-
line for an array of potential threads or events. It is therefore particularly important to consider computer
and web technology as part of the resilience planning of infrastructure. Its interdependency with other
infrastructure is a significant part of understanding the over-all system’s vulnerability. For example, all cyber
technology is completely dependent on power thus power supply and distribution networks. At the same
time, cyber technology is often controlling assets groups through automated processes including:

     •	   Intelligent transport systems;
     •	   Public transport control systems for rail, ports and airports.
     •	   Power and water supply systems; and,
     •	   Financial systems.
Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management                                                      39



The relevance of system resilience and data security is two-fold:

    1.	 The asset management processes need to incorporate the mitigation of both slow changing climatic
        impacts plus improve residence in preparation for potential shock events. Cyber and data security
        is at the heart of this mitigation; and
    2.	 The dependency on pre-event data plus the ability to analyse post-event asset status rest upon the
        availability and access to the network data plus the planning systems.


The second point above emphasises the importance of off-shore back-up of both systems and data, plus
the protocol of retrieving the data and system in an emergency event. Fortunately cloud technology has
already solved much of the technical challenges for backing up systems but agencies still have to ensure that
processes and protocols are in place for when needed – including how to access data stored in the cloud
when telecommunications channels may be down during a major climatic event.


                  A common characteristic of data collection techniques related to climate
                  adaptation and disaster events is its strong connection to geospatial
                  positioning – “the power of knowing where it is”




4.5  Data and Rapid Data Collection Techniques and Processing

Most data collection techniques used in asset management of roads would be directly applicable to the
sorts of data required to incorporate climate adaptation. In most cases, current data collection practices only
need a slight emphasis shift towards incorporating some of the required data items for climate adaptation
(See Table 4.2). For example, a data area that has been highlighted to have greater importance would be
comprehensive geospatial data for the network. Being diligent in keeping this up to date to the required
information needs is essential. Also, greater focus on specific asset groups that are directly impacted or
are mitigating impacts from the climate such as drainage, coastal protection structures and slope stability
information needs to be collected to a level that allows adequate information to manage the functioning
and effectiveness of these assets.

Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 show the survey vehicle and outputs from the moisture surveys performance on
road pavements. Pavement performance is directly related to the moisture content that is managed through
the provision of adequate drainage. Henning et al. (2014) has determined that a road with adequate drainage
lasts 30% longer compared to the same road without adequate drainage. With an increase in rainfall, the
potential moisture problem areas will have a significant increasing impact on road maintenance funding.
40                                            Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




Managing the pavement moisture levels would become an effective mitigation measure to detect moisture
issues early. Figure 4.3 shows the left-hand side of the road to have significant moisture build-up. Supporting
scans and images suggest the water build-up is mostly likely originating from the side slope on the left-hand
side of the road. For this instance, sub-soil cut-off drains in conjunction with adequate side drains would
prevent future failures of this road length.

Literature on other types of data collections, monitoring and reporting frameworks for example, for
monitoring slope stabilities are readily available (McNuilty and Stevens, 2016) and (Wieczorek and Snyder,
2009). Figure 4.4 gives an example of a three-dimensional display of rock-fall hazards.

The most significant area of development would be in the rapid data collection techniques used for post
disaster damage assessments. Some of the most common data collection techniques are summarized in
Table 4.3. Jovel and Mudahar (2010) also describe the data collection process for damage assessment in
more detail.

 Technique
 LiDAR Data Collection   Most commonly used for all disaster types. It is quick to mobilize      World Bank,
 (Including drone        and often more than adequate for initial damage and hazard              2010
 surveys)                identification.
 Geospatial Video and    LiDAR technology has been vastly improving during the last couple       Kwan and
 Photographic Data       of years. It is particularly useful for the geospatial positioning of   Ransberger,
                         each measurement. It provides an accurate three-dimensional             2010
                         image that could be used directly for additional measurements
                         and other special queries. It could typically be used for road and
                         structural damage, detection of defects and obstructions.
 Satellite Imagery       Satellite imagery is perhaps the most accessible and easy to            World Bank,
                         source through a number of providers such as Google Earth. It           2010
                         is powerful for the initial damage assessment of buildings and
                         critical assets on a large scale. Obtaining images directly following
                         a disaster event may require special arrangements.
 Aerial Imagery          Aerial imagery technology has been improving significantly              World Bank,
 Collected               during the last decade with the use of drone planes becoming            2010
                         particularly popular. Given the high resolution of the images
                         plus the potential combination with LiDAR information results in
                         three dimensional images for accurate estimation for damages
                         to buildings and critical infrastructure on a vastly large scale (See
                         Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6.). It can also be used to identify route
                         blockages and further hazards on a large-scale disaster.
 Crowd Sourcing (e.g.    A downside of most imaging and sometimes LiDAR information              World Bank,
 Geo-Can)                is that it relies on post processing and interpretation of images in    2010
                         order to translate these into useful information to a level where
                         to satisfy planning and estimation activities. Especially for last
                         scale disaster such as flooding and earthquakes, the extent of
                         the processing may be astronomical. For these cases utilizing
                         volunteers through a crowd sourcing framework may well be
                         the most efficient course of action to turn images into the useful
                         information. The World Bank report (2010) has assessed the
                         effectiveness of these techniques during the aftermath of the
                         Haitian earthquake during 2010.
 Specific Surveys        Specific geological and other surveys are often needed following        World Bank,
 (Hazard Detection)      disasters to identify ongoing hazards to the community or identify      2010
                         areas that would no longer be suitable for inhabitance or re-
                         establishment of infrastructure. Typical examples include areas
                         with liquefactions, high probability of slope failures or rock falls,
                         or areas where flooding would be an ongoing issue.
 Light Weight Survey     For road infrastructure, it is often required to undertake rapid        Forslöf and Jones,
 Equipment               assessment of condition, whereas the mobilization of data               2015 and

5.  Understanding Risk and the Vulnerability
5.1  Risk Based Asset Management in Context

Risk analysis techniques are well-known and used as an asset management process. Especially when dealing
with water infrastructure risk-based analyses processes are commonly used. Risk analyses and management
is key to organisational strategic asset management. For example, the MAP-21 legislation in the USA has
brought risk management to the forefront of strategic asset management (FHA, 2012). Given the nature of
the questions related to climate adaptation, risk management fist naturally to the entire concept. The very
nature of climate change events cannot be explained differently than considering probabilities and impacts
of specific events. For that reason, risk principle has been widely used already in the risk assessment and
vulnerability assessments for a number of countries such as Samoa and Mozambique.

It should be noted though that managing risk as a result of climate change is but only one risk category faced
by asset managers. At an agency level, risk related to finances, strategy, hazards and operations have to be
assessed holistically (Refer to Figure 5.1).

Vulnerability can also be illustrated on a continuum of eminent risks, resilience for potential future events
to the long-term sustainability of a community (Refer to Figure 5.2). Asset management processes need
to consider all these three from a perspective of minimizing risk, building future resilience in a sustainable
manner within available and often constrained funding.

Hill et al. (2014) categorised risk management for roads into four classes of planning, management, delivery
and physical risk assessment and management (Refer to Figure 5.3). The figure also shows specific risk items
that can be categorised within each one of the risk classes. According to this scheme natural events and
environmental risks are categorised under planning risks.

5.2  Vulnerability Assessments

The topic area of vulnerability assessments is well documented on a global scale and also on a local country
levels (Diley at al., 2005, ILO, 2011, World Bank 2013). Evidence has also been found for vulnerabilities on
a more local and detail level (Guzzetti, 2003, NDF, 2016). The purpose of this section is to contextualise
vulnerability assessment to the asset management problem domain. The reader is encouraged to undertake
further reading to learn more about the vulnerability assessments itself.

Although vulnerability assessments are undertaken for an array of reasons and applications, the essence of
these assessments remain the same as illustrated in Figure 5.4. This figure also illustrates the exact asset
management needs in order to plan for climate adaptions, those are:

   •	   Having an in-depth understanding if the nature of the changing environment;
   •	   Understanding the exact potential impact and extent of impact on the infrastructure; and
   •	   Having an estimated time frame for changes taking place and/or the probability of disastrous events.

5.3  Interdependencies of Infrastructure Groups

Traditional risk management and asset management processes are often asset specific centric. For
example, the vulnerability of the road link may be assessed on the basis of the hazards to the road and
the impact and/or consequences of the road link being out of operation is being assessed on the bases of
disruption time and redundancies provided through alternative routes. Often neglected is the impact of
road infrastructure on other services or asset groups. For example, a road corridor may facilitate a number
of asset services in addition to the road itself. Co-location of other assets and services such as power, sewer
and telecommunications may result in a road of lesser transportation importance being extremely important
from a resilience perspective. Another example is roads of apparent insignificance may be access to other
important locations such as water treatment plants or power stations.

5.4  Emergency Planning

Emergency planning is one of the specific outcomes from vulnerability assessments, with a strong focus
on community readiness to respond during a disaster event. It takes account of the most likely hazards for
a geographical area and pre-plans evacuation routes, assembly points and survival strategies in the event
of disasters (see Figure 5.6). The relationship between emergency planning and road asset management is
that these plans often contain critical infrastructure that is used during and directly after evacuation (life-
lines). The implication is that this infrastructure (roads and /or routes) will have a significant associated
criticality rating thus requiring top priority for maintaining at a high level to ensure protection at all cost
against potential damage. The next section discusses the analytical processes for decision making of road
maintenance. In the context of this section, a whole different set of criteria is applied when it comes to life-
lines roads to ensure its absolute residence.

                  Vulnerability assessments of road networks need to take a holistic view of other
                  assets types being dependant on specific road links.

5.5  Using Risk Management and Vulnerability Assessment in Asset
Management

Section 5.1 has explained how risk management is used in asset management. This section provides some
examples how vulnerability assessment and risk assessment related to climate change impacts are being
applied for asset management planning processes. These examples are:

     •	   Protection of critical links/life lines – Priority is given towards high risk/vulnerability road links
          in order to ensure these routes are able to withstand the expected storms/floods. Protection
          measures include sufficient provision of drainage, ensuring water-tight surface to prevent water
          ingress and subsequent pavement failures. Other measures may also include providing gabions on
          embankments and other flood protection measures;
     •	   Pre-empting relocation of infrastructure – It is sometimes difficult to resettle communities
          prior to disasters such as storm events. Yet following an event it may be more acceptable for a
          community to consider a re-location. Pre-planning of such relocation will assist in earmarking of
          future infrastructure needs. Land acquisition and proclamation will assist in speedier post event
          infrastructure development.
     •	   Preventing over-capitalization – When it is apparent that a road link is exposed to near certain
          risk of flooding or other climatic impact, it maintenance activities need to be adjusted to prevent
          over-capitalization that would be lost during an event. Minimum treatments and typical holding
          treatments could be used for such instances;
     •	   Identifying potential areas for resilient technologies – Trade-off analysis could be undertaken for
          high vulnerability areas in order to test the cost effectiveness of resilient technologies. Note that
          sometime weaker and cheaper options that need more frequent replacement may be more cost
          effective; and,
     •	   Retrofitting infrastructure that is found to be significantly deficient – Vulnerability assessment
          may highlight deficiencies or specific risks on some infrastructure such as bridges. A retrofitting
          programme could be an effective asset management strategy to reduce the potential impact form
          disasters.

6.  Decision Making and Planning
Within the overall subject area of asset management of roads, significant research and development have
been undertaken in the area of decision making. A spectrum of sophistication in decision making processes
and analysis techniques was developed with the aim at making sound road investment decisions, not only
for today, but also incorporating follow-on costs and returns on the investment in the long-run. These
developments have resulted in decision techniques and systems that are directly applicable in assisting with
some of the pertinent questions for investment into climate adaptation.

Which combination of analysis techniques is best suited to climate change adaptation may not be the same
as making decisions on maintenance standards. For example, in the past life-cycle costing analysis focussed
on the agencies own direct costs has been central to road asset management investment decisions for
many road agencies, whereas climate adaptation requires a much wider approach in determining the best
return on investment – especially when the benefits of taking some decisions may reside in services entirely
outside the road sector (e.g. maintaining a minor road in operational condition because it has a water main
beneath it).

Other factors such as community well-being, socio-economic factors and cultural considerations now has to
be part of a decision process that is very much focusing on future risks of climatic impacts. Where historical
analysis and modelling techniques had to understand variability in data, modelling climate adaptation also
brings a much greater emphasis on modelling uncertainty in predictions.

This section details some specific considerations of road asset management decision making processes and
how it relates to decisions for incorporating climate adaptation. This section also summarises some of the
most appropriate decision making analysis techniques that could be used in this area.




6.1  Resilience Planning

6.1.1  Importance of Resilience Planning


The importance of resilience planning is effectively illustrated in Figure 6.1. This figure attempts to illustrate
the benefits of building in more resilience into the infrastructure during the rebuilding of Christchurch
following the 2012 earthquakes. It shows that savings from resilience would be experienced in all the phases
of a shock event, including the emergency response, restoration, reconstruction and improvements.

Figure 6.1: Benefit of Increasing Resilience (Fairclough, 2013)




Resilience is not only a consideration following a shock event; it should be a priority before any event.
Asset management strategies have to be developed more proactively by focusing on network planning
and vulnerability assessment, developing the right technical specifications and materials and robust
environmental impact assessment rather than by focusing on the more reactionary aspects of emergency
response and rescue.


6.1.2  Resilience Planning Defined


Resilience planning focuses on the climate adaptation of infrastructure to better deal with both slow-
changing climatic impacts and being better prepared for the shock events. The over-all resilience planning
process is summarised in Figure 6.2, while some typical questions and analyses expected in this area are
summarised in Table 6.1.


            The climate change events provide an opportunity to learn from and build back better but the
            primary objective of climate resilient asset management should be to enhance the resiliency of
            road infrastructure and minimize the climate change impacts.

deliberately adopting an opposite strategy of providing weaker solutions that cost less to be replaced more frequently.

A case study on a specific route in Samoa investigated three resilience options:

     •	    Rebuild to existing standards;
     •	    Rebuild to improve residence; and,
     •	    Relocate to higher ground.

The aim of this case study was to compare the outcome in following an engineering economic assessment
process to a socio-cultural assessment process. The engineering/economic assessment considered:

     •	    Initial capital investment;
     •	    Long-term maintenance; and,
     •	    Risk cost for repeating storm damage.

The socio-cultural assessment used the Mauri2 model that was developed in New Zealand, and has been
successfully applied in the Pacific context (Morgan, 2009). Table 6.2 lists the Indicators used for the
assessment.

The main finding of this case study suggested that a pure engineering/economic assessment does not always
provide the ideal option analyses required for climate adaptation questions; a more holistic assessment is
often required. Figure 6.3 shows the outcome of the case study. The economic assessment favours the
relocation options, whereas the Mauri assessment significantly favours the road improvement option.

6.2  Risk Based Option Analyses

Two risk-based decision tools were assessed as part of this project. A brief description of both these tools
are followed by a comparative functionality assessment (Refer to Error! Reference source not found.).

ROADAPT (Deltares, et al, 2015) was developed on a grant from the Conference of European Director
of Roads (CEDR) Call 2012 ‘Road owners adapting to climate change’. It was largely based on the 2010
development of “Risk Management for Roads in a Changing Climate”.



           ROADAPT aims at providing methodologies and tools enabling tailored and
           consistent climate data information, a good communication between climate
           researchers and road authorities, a preliminary and fast quick scan for estimating the
           climate change related risks for roads, a vulnerability assessment, a socioeconomic
           impact analysis and an action plan for adaptation with specific input from possible
           adaptation techniques related to geotechnics and drainage, pavements and traffic
           management. (Quoted from Deltares, et al, 2015)

Valuing Resilience in Infrastructure (Cornish et al., 2017) A research project for the New Zealand Transport
Agency developed an updatable ‘decision support tool’ to consistently weigh up different controls to create
an acceptable level of resilience in (transport) infrastructure with priority given to desired community
outcomes. The tool has many strengths:

     •	   It follows a business case process of deciding on the most appropriate option to address a current
          vulnerability;
     •	   There is an existing data structure that underpins the tool – for most cases, the existing data can be
          used and only specific regional data such as climatic records and unit cost for treatment need to be
          updated;
     •	   It covers a multi-asset and multi-hazard approach;
     •	   It is able to capture organizational knowledge into a permanent record.

Note the tool will be officially launched and made available during early 2017.




6.3  Post Event Planning Considerations

Although the specific road/route functions may change over time, the road infrastructure remains one of
the top critical infrastructures during the entire duration and in the direct aftermath of the disaster. Table 6.3
lists some of the priorities following an event along with the specific road network function for each one of
the priorities. Although access is in most cases the main function for the road network, being able to carry
sufficient capacity (e.g. during evacuations) could also be important.

  Priority       Objective                                      Priority      Road Network Function

For obvious reasons decision making following a disaster event is unique. Although it is believed that asset
management processes could be of great value during these planning stages, there are some considerations
that should be kept in mind that include:

   •	   Planning stages (response, recovery, and rebuilt) are distinct stages following a disaster. Each one
        of these stages may include a full asset management cycle, although the planning time horizon of
        the stages are different:
        – Response – planning for the next hours and days;
        – Recovery – planning for weeks and months; and,
        – Rebuild – planning for the long-term, even longer than normal asset management cycles. For
        example, if planning a new city lay-out it may be taking account the needs of the next generation.
   •	   Overwhelming feeling of “where do we start?” Many post disaster reviews of major events often
        document the initial stages of the planning processes to be un-organised and fragmented. Having
        pre-event planning strategies in place assists bridging this stage quickly. Some of the pre-event
        planning strategies may include:
        – Where will the data be sourced from;
        – How to mobilise planning work forces;
        – Where is the most likely places where the planning will take place;
        – How will the planning processes be managed (See Section 1.1)?
   •	   Nature of the disaster. Obviously, the nature and specific damage following a disaster will determine
        the planning needs. Note some disasters may have a long period of follow-on effects;
   •	   Interconnectedness of infrastructure. During recovery and rebuild planning the Interconnectedness
        of infrastructure is a major driver during the planning process. For example, during the Christchurch
        rebuild, the replacement of sewer lines was the leading scheduled items during the rebuild –
        occurring prior to the rehabilitation of the road. This often meant that relatively easy to repair
        roads were deferred until other assets were repaired;
   •	   Mobilisation of workforce – The ability to get workforces mobilised is a significant challenge after
        major events as workers will also have their own families and properties o attend to, which can also
        drive the planning schedules (See Section 1.1)
   •	   Community involvement in decision making. Most disasters are often associated with significant
        tragic circumstances of loss of life, destroyed properties and the displacement of large numbers of
        people. The human and psychological element of the recovery process should be on the forefront
        of priorities. Getting community involvement in the decision making and actual rebuilding is vital
        also for the mental recovery that needs to take place. This priority does bring a specific need to the
        planning process, how it is done and how it is communicated;
   •	   Build back better is a concept of ensuring the best outcome for the community when decisions are
        being made and often financial aspects becomes only one of the considerations. One of the main
        considerations during this stage is the balance between cost and future proofing;
   •	   Rebuild centralised versus decentralised. One of the main resilience measures of infrastructure is
        to decentralise thereby creating redundancy in the system. Although road assets are less affected
        by this consideration when compared to other asset types, the outcome of these decisions may
        impact on road lay-out and specific design.

6.4  Analyses Techniques

Literature on the topic area of post disaster decision making mostly deals with incorporating community
involvement into the decision-making process (Binder et al., 2015). Less literature exists on advanced
decision-making techniques, in particular for the rebuilding investment planning process. By incorporating
existing asset management analytics, useful decision making information could contribute towards more
effective outcomes being achieved more efficiently. For example, during the rebuilding of Christchurch,
predictive modelling software normally used for long-term maintenance investment decision making was
effectively used for the investment planning of the road network reconstruction (Rainsford, 2012). An
outstanding characteristic of this analysis was the trade-offs between cheaper “holding actions” with more
expensive rehabilitation treatments.

Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5 show two typical examples of modelling outcomes produced for the reconstruction
of the Christchurch road network. The figures show both the forecasted investment needs and the predicted
condition outcome as a result of this investment. Note that by law, the New Zealand government could only
commit six years of funding towards the rebuilding process, hence the six-year spike in financial investment.
Furthermore, there is a clear change in the works programme focusing initially on access and “make-safe”
repairs to later treatments that were more permanent in nature.

6.5  Assessing the Benefits of Climate Adaption Techniques

There is already significant literature documenting climate adaptation measures for roads. These vary from
identified resilient technologies to other more general climate change mitigation measures. The World Bank
has recently released a report on the use of “Green Construction Material” in India (The World Bank, 2016).
The report particularly considered the use of by-product material as alternative construction material. Some
examples include (World Bank, 2016):

    •	   Reclaimed bituminous material (RA);
    •	   Crushed concrete;
    •	   Pulverized fuel ash (PFA or fly ash);
    •	   Blast-furnace slag;
    •	   Steel slag;
    •	   Other metallurgical slags (e.g. chrome, manganese, copper, zinc);
    •	   Aluminum industry wastes;
    •	   Colliery spoil;
    •	   Construction and demolition waste
    •	   Mine and stone processing waste (marble, slate, granite, etc.);
    •	   Phosphogypsum;
    •	   Used tires;
    •	   China clay sand;
    •	   Foundry sand;
    •	   Crushed waste brick;
    •	   Used rail ballast;
    •	   Furnace bottom ash;
    •	   Cement kiln dust;
    •	   Glass;
    •	   Spent oil shale.

A common trend that resulted from this work was the lack of information to the construction standards and
the performance expectations from these materials.

Another related aspect is to have a more sustainable approach to the design and construction of roads.
Given that climate adaptation fall within the sustainability concept, such a more holistic process is advisable
for adoption on a global scale. A good example for minimising environmental impacts form road is presented
in Quitero (2015). This document presents a strong methods of impact assessment and some suggestion to
mitigate the impacts.

A key success factor in analysing different options for road programmes with the aim of integrating climate
adaptation is the ability to assess the long-term outcomes from these options. There is significant uncertainty
of the specific impact of climate change on road networks, which is further aggravated by uncertainty of the
long-term outcomes from adaptive technologies and strategies (refer to Figure 6.7).

                           In order to warrant the use of resilient technologies, we have to know what value it
                           returns in relation to reducing the vulnerability of the asset. This area is perhaps the
                           area of greatest need for research and development.

6.6  Monitor the Progress towards Resilience

A major part of asset management – particularly in the planning cycle of asset management – is the
measurement and monitoring of performance in relation to defined standards and/or past performance.
Planning into the future is underpinned by the knowledge of the historical performance up to the current
situation. Performance monitoring and measurement consist of the following processes (Henning, Costello
and Tapper, 2013):

   •	    A report on the status of the current performance;
   •	    Trend monitoring that tracks the past performance in relation to the factors that may have impacted
         on the performance (such as investment levels); and,
   •	    Benchmarking – where an agency compares a matrix of performance measures against other
         agencies.

A literature scan has revealed substantial work that has been completed in the topic area of quantifying
resilience for communities, regions and countries. The process varies significantly from theoretical processes
to more simplistic measurement and reporting of key measures that define the resilience. The following
paragraphs provide two examples of such frameworks.

During a study for the U.S National Science Foundation, a measurement framework was developed to assess
resilience of a coastal community along the Northern coastline of Mexico. A theoretical model was developed
that calculates the resilience inference. It uses three elements (exposure, damage, and recovery indicators)
to denote two relationships: vulnerability and, adaptability (Refer to Figure 6.8). The next resilience cycle
consists of adaptation (minimising the future damage) and mitigation (minimising the exposure).

Figure 6.9 illustrates the process of calculating the coastal resilience. The input data for the model was
obtained from two sources:

     •	   Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS); and,
     •	   National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Climate Data Centre
          (NCDC), which provided the exposure and damage data for the coastal counties.

The UK Overseas Development Institute has developed a measurement framework for measuring disaster
risk reduction on a global scale (Refer to Figure 6.10). The output element that could be monitored includes:
disaster risk, and social and economic resilience. Ultimately, the outcome measures would include disaster
loss and disaster impacts.

From this report, a number of valuable recommendations were proposed (Mitchell et al., 2014):

    •	     “A target set on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) should combine the targets with a methodology that
           assesses levels of disaster risk. Only then can we adequately track progress in reducing disaster risk;
    •	     Indicators could monitor inputs and outputs, such as presence of plans or legislation, number of
           people covered by effective early warning systems and/or school and health facilities built to hazard-
           resistant building codes, linked to the hazard risk in the area.
    •	     It is important to establish clear, numerical targets at a global scale to act as eye-catching, awareness-
           raising;
    •	     A disasters data revolution is needed, involving the systematic collection of data on disaster risk and
           disaster losses across countries to enable the establishment of national and global trends;
    •	     A monitoring methodology for tracking national progress on DRR must focus on the use of detailed
           disaster risk information, including high-resolution data on national building inventories, population
           data (including by socioeconomic group), mapped hazard data and DRR plans;
    •	     Upgrades to poverty data should involve modules on shocks. Where countries start more
           comprehensive, regular monitoring of poverty dynamics, potentially by extending household
           surveys, such poverty surveys or other data collection methods should incorporate modules or
           questions about the impact of disaster events on income poverty and other dimensions of human
           development, such as health or school attendance;
66                                            Integrating Climate Change into Road Asset Management




     •	   Tracking progress on disaster losses and risks requires data to be normalised for key variables, like
          population or GDP, to allow for comparisons between time periods. It also requires the establishment
          of a baseline against which progress can be assessed.
     •	   The institutional architecture for delivering a global monitoring system needs to involve multiple
          groups at different scales, each serving a distinct function; and,
     •	   While governments will continue to self-report progress, it is vital that independent groups at all
          levels can contribute to the overall framework for monitoring progress on DRR.”

The latter approach is perhaps the most relevant and appropriate for monitoring resilience in the developing
countries. It is recommended to develop a resilience framework specifically aimed to monitor the resilience
of countries and regions on the bases of the Bank’s investment agendas and development objectives.

7.  Conclusions
7.1  Main Findings

This report considers the integration of climate adaption to existing asset management processes and
techniques. The specific objectives were to:

   •	   Review the entire asset management process in the context of how climate adaptation measures
        could be incorporated;
   •	   Explore specific techniques related to data collection and decision making that fits within the
        problem domain of climate adaptation; and,
   •	   Identify the future development issues that will assist more seaming less integration of climate
        adaptation into asset management processes.

The main conclusion of this report is that asset management, when undertaken according to best practice, is
already one of the most significant climate adaptation strategies. There are many processes and techniques
that are used to develop optimal maintenance and renewals programmes that result in more resilient road
networks. However, so much more could be done in order to effectively integrate climate adaptation into
business-as-usual asset management.

Better data and information assist in better decision making. Investing into the collection of relevant data
and information is the first and foremost investment into climate adaptation. With minor adaption to existing
asset management processes (refer to Figure 7.1) and techniques, a far greater return may be gained from
investment to allow for changing demands on road infrastructure, both from a changing climate and from
an ever-changing population.


                 Climate change is real and it will cost road agencies money. Doing something
                 about the changes proactively will not only mitigate the financial impacts but
                 also result in more resilient communities.

7.2  Further Work

One of the findings of this report suggests that the integration of climate adaptation into asset management
is not an onerous and significant process. Many existing processes and techniques are directly applicable
to consider climate adaptation. However, considerable commitment and leadership is required to facilitate
and incentivise such integration. Therefore, there is a significant responsibility of road agencies and funding
bodies to push for drastic changes that will allow for this integration. The reality is that the do-nothing
option in this regard is simply unaffordable.

This report also highlighted some challenges to the research and academic fraternity in understanding
climatic impacts on road networks better, developing more resilient technologies and, most importantly,
developing a better understanding to quantify the impact/benefits of climate adaptation strategies.
