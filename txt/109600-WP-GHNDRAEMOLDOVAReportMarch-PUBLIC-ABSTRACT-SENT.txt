KEY MESSAGES
Moldova continues to experience a concentrated HIV epidemic among people who inject drugs
(PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and their clients and
their sexual partners in the general population. The HIV epidemic is more severe on the left
bank of the Nistru River, where coverage of prevention programs is lower.

The country could increase the impact of its HIV response by increasing investment from
US$8.7 million to US$14.2 million. Compared to continuing current spending, optimally
allocating resources will result in a 36 percent decrease in incidence and a 48 percent decrease
in HIV-related deaths. Optimal allocation would avert an estimated 4,000 new infections and
2,400 deaths. In the long term, these effects will have not only health benefits but also financial
benefits in reduced health care cost for people living with HIV (PLHIV). Optimized allocation of
resources would entail:

   Scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention for key populations including in the
    highly affected areas of east of the Nistru River
   Increasing investment in prevention programs for PWID, opiate substitution therapy (OST)
    and programs for FSW and MSM
   Improving geographic prioritization and introducing OST, MSM, and FSW programs on the
    left bank
   Reinvesting funds currently allocated to programs for the general population in the above-
    mentioned priority programs
   Reviewing the unit cost and technical efficiency of ART and OST programs as well as for
    management and other costs.
Compared to current levels of program coverage, adding a test and offer treatment approach 1
will enable reducing HIV incidence by 36 percent by 2020. However, in a long-term analysis up
to 2030, scaling up an optimized combination of programs would avert 56 percent more new
infections and 17 percent more deaths as than scaling up exclusively testing and treatment.

Although HIV accounts for approximately 3.0 percent of disease burden in years of life lost in
Moldova, total annual spending on HIV accounted for only 0.8 percent of total health
expenditure in 2013. Thirty-three percent of funds for HIV programs was provided by
international partners, suggesting the need for a substantial increase in domestic financing of
the HIV response.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As part of a Regional initiative, the Republic of Moldova conducted an HIV allocative efficiency
(AE) analysis to inform its strategic decisions on investment in the HIV response.

Moldova continues to experience a concentrated HIV epidemic, in which the largest
portion of new infections occur among key populations. These are people who inject
drugs (PWID); men who have sex with men (MSM); and female sex workers (FSW), their
clients, and their sexual partners. The epidemic already has transitioned from an early
concentrated epidemic in which the highest rates of transmission were among PWID; to an
advanced concentrated epidemic in which onward transmission to sexual partners of PWID;
sexual transmission among MSM; and among FSW, their clients, and their sexual partners have
become large sources of new infections. Assuming that current conditions (program coverage
and behaviors) are maintained, the model predicts an increase in annual new infections
over 2015–20 from 1,400 in 2014 to 1,700 in 2020; and to 2,500 in 2030.

Within Moldova, there is a large variation in the HIV epidemic between the areas west of
the Nistru River (“right bank”) and the areas east of the Nistru River (“left bank”). On the
right bank, the fastest growing segment of the HIV epidemic is among MSM, for whom a 3-fold
increase in annual new infections is projected by 2030 with prevalence projected to exceed 10
percent by 2020. On the left bank, despite projected increases in HIV incidence among MSM
and moderate increases among FSW, the largest share of new infections will continue to occur
among PWID. New infections among other female adults accounts for nearly one-third of
new infections, due largely to sexual transmission from male PWID, FSW clients, and MSM.

Available evidence suggests that in the left bank, the HIV epidemic is more severe. In 2013
in the left bank, 47 new HIV diagnoses were made per 100,000 people vs. 13 per 100,000 on
the right bank. Moldova’s HIV disease burden is among the highest in Europe, accounting for
9.4 percent of years of life lost (YLL) in the 15–49 age group (University of Washington 2014).
The fact that the rates of new diagnoses in the left bank have increased 300 percent since 2004
suggests that the left bank region is experiencing one of the most severe HIV epidemics
in Europe and that the necessity to match this situation with an accelerated HIV
response and increased investment is urgent.

Several optimization analyses were conducted for different levels of funding covering 2015–20
and for achieving the national targets over the same timeframe. Overall trends of allocations in
all optimization analyses were similar. They strongly emphasized the need to increase ART
coverage and to focus on prevention among key populations. Reallocating funding from
programs for the general population to scaling up programs for key populations is a
more efficient use of the available resources.

                     With increased availability of funding, a large part of the budget should be allocated to ART
                     (Figure 1). If the total HIV budget could be increased by 60 percent,2 treatment should receive
                     71 percent of all spending on direct programs, increasing coverage from 23 percent of all
                     PLHIV to 65 percent of all PLHIV. Twenty-two percent of program spending should be
                     allocated to prevention programs. These include needle and syringe programs (NSP) opiate
                     substitution therapy (OST) and programs for MSM as well as FSW (both including condoms),
                     HIV testing and counseling (HTC, and outreach services). To reach this level of ART coverage,
                     another 5 percent of program funding would be allocated to HTC programs for other
                     populations beyond the key populations. This additional HTC still should be well targeted to
                     geographic areas and communities with high HIV prevalence. Pregnant women should
                     continue to be covered with HTC and ART in an integrated way to minimize separate overhead
                     costs for PMTCT. Compared to continuing current spending, the increase of resources to
                     approximately US$14 million, combined with the proposed optimized allocations, would result
                     in a 36 percent decrease in incidence and a 48 percent decrease in HIV-related deaths. The
                     increase also would avert an estimated 4,000 new infections and 2,400 deaths from 2015 to
                     2020 (Figure 2).

To inform optimized allocations of HIV resources in Moldova, it also will be important to
understand the cost structure of Moldova’s HIV response. This study did not include a
detailed technical efficiency analysis. However, available cost information suggests that
prevention programs for key populations in Moldova have relatively low unit costs, whereas,
based on a rapid comparison of seven countries, ART and OST costs in Moldova were slightly
above average. Consequently, Moldova’s ART allocations absorb a relatively large proportion
of the country’s HIV spending. Optima also suggests that, if funding is limited, the efficiently
implemented needle-syringe exchange program would be the most cost-effective option to
contain and reverse the epidemic among PWID. A lower unit cost of ART and OST would
create substantial savings, which could then be used to also increase coverage of OST
and other programs. Given the already constrained HIV response budget, additional
funding for OST could be sought from other health and social programs, as justified by the
wide benefits of OST for health, social integration, and crime reduction.

Introducing new ART guidelines that lead to 70 percent of PLHIV being diagnosed and 90
percent of the diagnosed population being retained on ART will help to slow the spread of HIV
and decrease mortality. However, the projections suggest that an exclusive focus on ART
scale-up is less effective and more expensive in the long term than a scenario of a
combined scale-up of ART and prevention for key populations (Figure 1, right column).

In summary, Moldova’s HIV response is already covering key services required to progress
toward reducing the HIV epidemic. Nevertheless, increased investment in HIV, more strategic
allocations to key populations, improved geographic targeting, and technical efficiencies are
required to achieve the necessary scale-up of programs and corresponding impacts.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      Necessity for allocative efficiency
Current HIV programs are faced with the need to scale up prevention and provide treatment to
a larger number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) than ever before. In the current
environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV responses, focused design and efficiency
in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do more with less.

In the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, countries agreed to reduce
sexual and injection-related transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminate mother-to-child-
transmission, initiate 80 percent of eligible people living with HIV on treatment, and end HIV-
related discrimination by 2015 (UNGASS 2011). The 2014 Gap Report illustrated that, to
achieve these targets, substantial additional efforts will be required in most countries (UNAIDS
2014c). Despite the progress made, HIV remained among the unfinished agenda items in the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which need to be transitioned and integrated in the
post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Against this background, UNAIDS globally
defined a Fast-Track strategy to achieve the goal of Ending AIDS by 2030 (UNAIDS 2014b). One
core element of the Fast-Track approach are the 90-90-90 targets, which set out to achieve
that 90 percent of all PLHIV are diagnosed; 90 percent of diagnosed PLHIV are on ART; and 90
percent of PLHIV on ART are virally suppressed (UNAIDS 2014d). The Fast-Track approach
also emphasizes the need to focus on the geographic areas and communities most affected by
HIV. Fast Track recommends that resources be concentrated on the programs that have
demonstrated the greatest impact.

In this context, a shift toward investment thinking in the design of HIV responses is being
promoted by UNAIDS and cosponsors globally to maximize the impact of program investment
and best realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. Investment
cases are being developed by a number of countries to understand HIV epidemics as well as to
design, deliver, and sustain effective HIV responses. The investment cases are complemented
with a human-rights-based approach to health care. In support of HIV investment cases, in
2014–15, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, as well as a
number of countries outside the ECA Region, carried out allocative efficiency (AE) analyses.3
This report summarizes the results of the analysis for policy makers, program leaders, and
technical experts in Moldova.

The concept of allocative efficiency (AE) refers to maximizing health outcomes with the least
costly mix of health interventions.4 HIV AE studies generally try to answer the question “How
can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response interventions that
will yield the highest impact?” This concept not only is critical for maximizing current and

3   For published study reports, see, for example, Republic of Tajikistan 2014 and Fraser and others 2014.
4   Technically, maximization can be achieved in two ways: within a fixed budget envelope (maximize impact with
    given amount of money), or within defined impact targets (minimize cost to achieve a given impact).

    future impact. The concept also is an integral element of transition to full domestic financing
    and sustainability of the response because a response that is allocatively and technically
    efficient will be easier to sustain.

    There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
    amount of HIV funding, or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding if
    resources are distributed optimally or if resources are used in the most efficient ways.

    1.2       Objectives of the analysis
    Moldova has set the priorities for its HIV response in its National Strategic Plan 2011–15. The
    plan includes the following key impact targets:

       Prevalence of HIV among key populations:
          ∙   Among PWID, not higher than 20.0%
          ∙   Among female sex workers, not higher than 11.0%
          ∙   Among MSM, not higher than 5.0%
          ∙   Among prisoners, not higher than 3.5%
          ∙   Among the general population, not higher than 0.44%
       Percentage of adults and children with HIV still alive and known to be on treatment after
        initiation of antiretroviral therapy:
          ∙   After 12 months, not lower than 88%
          ∙   After 24 months, not lower than 80%
          ∙   After 60 months, not lower than 75%
          ∙   Among infants born to HIV-infected mothers, not higher than 2%
       Prevalence of hepatitis B:
          ∙   Among IDU, not higher than 5.9%
          ∙   Among CSW, not higher than 4.5%
          ∙   Among MSM, not higher than 3.8%
          ∙   Among prisoners, not higher than 11.3%
       Prevalence of hepatitis C
          ∙   Among IDU, not higher than 63.0%
          ∙   Among CSW, not higher than 11.0%
          ∙   Among MSM, not higher than 3.0%
          ∙   Among prisoners, not higher than 10.7%
       Prevalence of syphilis
          ∙   Among IDU, not higher than 2.0%
          ∙   Among CSW, not higher than 3.9%
          ∙   Among MSM, not higher than 7.7%
          ∙   Among prisoners, not higher than 8.5%

    tools for optimization analysis for multiple diseases are still under development. The findings
    of this study will assist the Government of Moldova to further strengthen its HIV

investment case, through which it attempts to increase effectiveness of HIV investments and
define corresponding priorities, strategies, and impacts of the response. The national HIV
allocative efficiency study was designed to answer four main questions:

1. How can Moldova optimize the allocation of its current HIV funding?
2. What might be gained from increased investment in HIV programming?
3. What is the minimum spending that would be required to meet national targets and
   how should funds be allocated to achieve the targets?
4. What are the health and financial impacts of implementing different ART
   guidelines?

2.      MOLDOVA’S HEALTH AND HIV FINANCING
        CONTEXT
Moldova’s third national report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) showed that
Moldova had made substantial progress on several objectives before the target date of 2015
(GoM 2013). For example, for MDG1, poverty incidence decreased from 34.5 percent in 2006
to 20.8 percent in 2012. The final targets set for 2015 for MDG 4 on infant mortality and under-
5 mortality rates also were achieved. In the words of Moldova’s third MDG report, the “…most
troubling area is MDG6 on combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases. None of the
targets under this goal was achieved, and it will not be possible to reach them by 2015.”

2.1     Burden of disease
The general burden of disease in Moldova is characterized by prevailing noncommunicable
diseases. In the population aged 45 and above, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cirrhosis
are predominant causes of total years of life lost (YLL) (Figure 2.1). In the working age
population, the main causes of YLL are noncommunicable diseases, injuries, as well as
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. In the age group 15–49, HIV is the second largest cause of YLL
accounting for 9.4 percent of all YLL, exceeded only by cirrhosis of the liver. In the age group
40–44, approximately 17 percent of total YLL result from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, or 8,539
YLL of a total of 50,000 YYL for this age group. The largest effect on total YLL caused by
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis is observed for the population aged 20–44.

HIV disease burden in Moldova is among the highest in Europe and the second highest after
Ukraine among the seven countries included in this Regional initiative. Separate burden of
disease estimates for right bank and left bank regions were not available. Nevertheless, data on
new HIV diagnoses suggest that the disease burden is approximately three times higher in the
left bank region, indicating that the left bank experiences one of the most severe HIV epidemics
in Europe. In Moldova, Figure 2.2 illustrates that HIV accounts for 3 percent of YLL and 2.1
percent of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) overall, but for only 0.8 percent of total health
expenditure (THE). In most of the other countries included in the Regional analysis, the level of
HIV disease burden and the percentage of health spending allocated to HIV were similar to
each other. This finding suggests that total HIV spending in Moldova has been relatively
low compared to disease burden and—considering the large disease burden―low
compared to most other countries included in this analysis.

           In the given situation, addressing the continued spread of HIV and HIV/TB co-infection
           represents an important priority in the effort to increase overall life expectancy as well as to
           decrease excess mortality by providing comprehensive and efficient services for key
           populations and PLHIV.

2.2      Health and HIV financing
Moldova is a lower-middle income economy that had a total 2013 per capita health
expenditure of US$263.5 According to the latest WHO estimates, public expenditures on health
in the Republic of Moldova in 2012 constituted 5.3 percent of GDP, which is lower than the EU
average of 7.3 percent. However, in 2012 the share of health spending in the total government
expenditure (13.3 percent) was the highest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
region (average 10.2 percent).

Since January 2004, health financing in Moldova has been based on national compulsory
health insurance. Total public health spending covers all health care institutions.
Interventions at the central and local levels are funded through the national insurance scheme
and comprise 90 percent of the public health budget. The Ministry of Health administers
approximately 10 percent of health spending, allocated to public health services, several
national programs, and central administration. Table 2.1 provides a summary of trends in
health expenditure. Overall expenditure for health was growing over the last decade, with
increases in all three key sources of funding.

    Out-of-pocket expenditures represent a considerable share of total health spending in the
    country—almost equal to what the government provides, whereas NGOs’ contribution
    accounts for approximately 10 percent (Figure 2.3).

    Over the past decade, external support to Moldova grew. In 2012 it accounted for
    approximately $500 million per year (Figure 2.4). Approximately 6 percent of external funds
    was targeted for health and population policies, and 1 percent was targeted specifically for
    HIV/AIDS. In 2012 external support for HIV/AIDS was US$5.8 million, and for health and
    population was US$28.7 million.

    Although government spends a considerable share of its total expenditure on health, the
    Moldova HIV response budget is moderate compared to other countries in the Region. The
    HIV response in the country is heavily dependent on international support. In 2013
    government expenditure on HIV comprised US$2,459,879 (30 percent); international
    resources constituted US$5,503,307 (68 percent); and private national resources allocated to
    HIV programs were US$173,357 (2 percent) (Figure 2.5). From 2012 to 2013, public financial
    resources increased by 7.6 percent, from US$2,381,695 to US$2,459,879, respectively.
    Conversely, compared to 2012, expenditures for the HIV response in 2013 decreased by 8.6

percent to US$8,136,543. The lower total is explained by the reduction of external or
international resources by 14.8 percent. At US$8.1 million, HIV spending represents 0.8
percent of Moldova’s total expenditure on health (US$937 million) in 2013.

In 2013, of the total HIV response budget, approximately 40 percent was allocated to the
treatment and care program, 27 percent for prevention, 18 percent for program management,
8 percent for social mitigation, 4 percent for human resources, 2 percent for enabling
environment, and 1 percent for research.

To cover the National HIV Program deficit, Moldova was awarded a grant from the Global Fund
as per its New Funding Model of a total of EUR 11.5 million for 2015–17. Of the total grant, 43
percent will be allocated for prevention; 38 percent for treatment, care, and support; and 10
percent for community capacity and sustainability.

3.     METHODOLOGY: HOW WILL THIS REPORT
       ANSWER KEY QUESTIONS?
Chapter 3 outlines the main steps taken and tools applied to carry out the analyses presented
in this report. Additional detail is available in appendixes A, B, and C.

3.1    Optima model
To carry out the analyses, the team used Optima, a mathematical model of HIV transmission
and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis framework.
Optima uses HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on biological
transmission probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual mixing patterns, and drug
injection behaviors. In consultation with in-country experts, Optima was calibrated to HIV
prevalence data points available from the different subpopulations (including FSW, PWID and
MSM), as well as to data points on the number of people on ART.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and determine an
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population, and prevention program
being considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the level of funding
allocated to each program will impact on overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine an optimized allocation of
funding across different HIV programs. Additional details about Optima are contained in
appendix A.

3.2    Analytical framework
The study was conceptualized by a Regional steering group involving the Global Fund, UNAIDS,
UNDP, and convened by the World Bank. A national technical group convened by UNAIDS in
collaboration with government was formed. Country-specific objectives of the analysis and
parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological, program, and cost
data were collected by in-country experts with technical support from international partners
using an adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In November 2014, a
Regional mathematical modelling workshop was conducted in Yerevan, Armenia. There,
national experts and specialists from international partners including worked together with
mathematical modelers from UNSW to carry out modelling analyses using the Matlab software
package. This Regional process also aimed at data comparison and exchange, quality
assurance, and development of capacities in HIV epidemic and response analysis using

     mathematical modelling techniques. Preliminary results were then consulted with government
     experts and other in-country partners and summarized in this report.

     Optima is a flexible model that enables the user to decide which populations, programs, time
     frames, and funding levels to consider in a country analysis. Table 3.1 summarizes the main
     parameters, which were identified based on contextual, epidemiological, national strategic,
     programmatic, and funding information and agreed with in-country stakeholders.

     Direct programs (included into optimization). Direct programs have a direct effect on HIV
     incidence or deaths and therefore could be included in the mathematical optimization analysis.
     For the expenditure areas selected for modeling, all prevention programs for the left and the
     right banks were included separately because there are considerable differences between their
     programs. The programs for FSW and clients and MSM, as well as OST, are not available on the
     left bank. Furthermore, the coverage levels differ for the two banks. For instance, as of 2013,
     on the right bank 42 percent of PWID were covered with NSP, whereas on the left bank only 8
     percent were covered. Thus, prevention programs for MSM, PWID, FSW and clients, and OST
     on the right and left banks were included separately in the model. ART, PMTCT, HIV testing
Methodology: How Will This Report Answer Key Questions?                                                                 13



and counseling, and behavior change communication (BCC) and condom programs were
included as single interventions operating on both banks.

Indirect programs (not included in optimization). Programs included in this category are
part of the response, but their effect on HIV incidence and mortality is not clear or cannot be
quantified. The total amount spent for these interventions remains fixed for different scenarios
run within the modeling. Since these management and other costs already account for over 33
percent of HIV response costs, it was assumed that these programs would continue at their
current level of funding.6 The indirect programs are stigma reduction, strategic information,
research, M&E, management, STI control, blood safety, post-exposure prophylaxis,
precautions, enabling environment, training, infrastructure and social protection.

Time frames include baseline year and time period for modeling the results of changed
allocations. For this study, the baseline year is 2013; the time periods for modeling are 2015 –
20 and 2015–30.

Baseline scenario funding represents current allocation as described in the 2013 National
AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA).

Costs per person reached in Table 3.2 have some comparison limitations. For example,
although all of the calculations are based on NASA/GARPR reporting, the calculation
methodology applied could have differed among countries. The range of services included in
service packages could be different as well. In other words, higher unit cost may not
necessarily mean lower technical efficiency but also could imply that the package is more
comprehensive. The big-picture comparison of unit cost shows that exploring possible
technical efficiency gains would be useful, particularly for OST and ART.

3.3      Limitations of analysis
    There are some gaps in data, particularly for MSM and FSW and clients populations on the
     left bank of the Nistru River. As in other models, estimates of HIV prevalence in the general
     population were derived from data for pregnant women as a proxy for prevalence in the
     general population.
    The analysis used past ratios of expenditure-to-coverage as the basis for determining
     program cost rather than unit costs from a costing of future programs. Using past cost and

6   This assumption would require additional, more nuanced analysis, which goes beyond the scope of this study.
    Some management costs are expected to grow with scale, while technical efficiencies will emerge in other areas.
    Here it was assumed that a balance of such increases and reductions is feasible, considering that reductions also
    are achieved in the programs included in the optimization.
14                                                                Optimizing investments in Moldova’s HIV Response



          results has a number of advantages over using projected costs from plans and budgets,
          which, ultimately, are predictions of future cost. However, this past-cost approach also has
          a disadvantage: there may be future cost increases or decreases in relation to new
          approaches, implementation arrangements, or technologies.
         The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness among programs
          includes assumptions about the impact of increases or decreases in their funding. These
          assumptions are based on unit costs and observed ecological relationships among
          outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the amount of money spent on
          programs in the past. Another assumption is that increased spending could cause some
          saturation in the possible effect of programs.
         The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs. Gains in technical
          efficiency would lead to different unit costs and therefore affect resource allocation.
         Modeling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of
          evidence-based parameter estimates of the effectiveness of individual interventions.
          Although these estimates were derived from a systematic global literature review,7 they
          may vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly
          the levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and spending categories for which
          such parameters cannot be obtained, such as enablers and synergies, could not be included
          in the mathematical optimization. Because they nevertheless have important functions in
          the HIV response, they have been treated as fixed costs and, in some specific scenarios,
          adjusted with specific justifications.
         Effects outside the HIV endpoints―including non-health benefits of OST, effects of needle
          exchange on hepatitis, and effects of condoms on contraception and STIs—are complex to
          consider. Given that, for OST, the majority of benefits are beyond HIV outcomes, specific
          consideration was given to the non-HIV benefits of OST (appendix A). However, given the
          complexity of interactions among interventions and their non-HIV benefits, this approach
          was applied only for OST. Similarly, the model does not seek to quantify human rights;
          stigma and discrimination; or ethical, legal, or psychosocial implications but to
          acknowledge that these are important aspects to be considered.
         Other models may not always produce exactly the same projections as those produced by
          Optima. The analysts used the best possible data, the combined experience from model
          application in over 20 countries, and Regional comparison and validation of inputs through
          comparison of different sources including data from clinical records, surveillance, and
          research.

This section presents the findings of the analyses, beginning with epidemic analysis and then
moving into optimization analysis as well as related cost-effectiveness analysis.

4.1 What is the current status of the HIV epidemic in
Moldova?
A summary of key national data on the HIV epidemic is provided in Table 4.1. It illustrates the
rapid growth of the epidemic between 2000 and 2010 and then the slowing of epidemic
growth approximately in 2010.

         By the end of 2013, over 8,500 HIV diagnoses had been registered in Moldova since 1987. In
         2013 there were 706 newly registered cases of HIV after a rapid increase in HIV incidence in
         the 2000s. The number of newly registered cases of HIV peaked in 2008, with some
         stabilization at the beginning of the 2010s. The total number of PLHIV receiving ART by the
         end of 2013 was 2,493, which represents fewer than 20 percent of PLHIV covered. The
         epidemic in Moldova continues to be concentrated among key populations, mostly people
         who inject drugs (PWID), with an increasing incidence among female sex workers (FSW) and
         men having sex with men (MSM). Over the last 5 years, sexual transmission became the most
         common self-reported mode of HIV acquisition. In 2013, 92 percent of people who were newly
         diagnosed with HIV self-reported sexual transmission as the most probable route. Figure 4.1
         shows the annual rate of newly diagnosed PLHIV per 100,000 population on the right bank and
         left bank of the Nistru River. The data suggest that, since 2004, new diagnoses consistently had
         been more than three times higher on the left bank.

         4.2 What are the expected trends if current conditions are
         maintained?
         Based on the available data, the model was calibrated as described in appendix B and
         produced the HIV epidemic estimates summarized in Table 4.2. The estimates suggest that in
         2014, there were 13,200 PLHIV in Moldova, a number that is consistent with the registered
         number of PLHIV and moderately lower than the estimated number of PLHIV in the Spectrum
         model used to produce national and global HIV estimates (UNAIDS 2015). Assuming that
         current conditions (current behaviors and program coverage) are maintained, the PLHIV
         population is projected to grow to 17,700 PLHIV by 2020. The estimated number of new
         infections in 2014 was 1,400, and, assuming that current conditions apply, this number is
         projected to grow to 1,700 by 2020. Estimated AIDS-related deaths were approximately 580 in
         2014 and are projected to grow to 680.

The model-predicted evolution of new HIV infections in different populations is presented
in Figure 4.2. The projections are made assuming that all programs receive 2013 funding
between now and 2030. This projection suggests that the epidemic would grow continuously
and that the annual number of new infections would grow by over 67 percent by 2030 (from
1,400 new infections in 2015 to approximately 2,500 new infections in 2030). On the right
bank, the HIV epidemic among MSM is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the
epidemic because annual new infections will triple by 2030. HIV incidence among other key
populations likely is to be stable in the medium term. On the left bank, the model also
suggests an increase in new infections among MSM and a moderate increase in new infections
among FSW and their clients and PWID.

The results show that, currently, new infections among the general population represent
approximately one third of the total annual incidence on both banks and a large portion of
these infections is among female sexual partners of PWID, MSM and FSW clients. The number
of infections are projected to increase among both female and male adults on the left bank, and
in female adults on the right bank.

      4.3 How will outcomes improve by optimizing allocations
      under the current level of funding?
      Optimization analyses were carried out for different levels of funding and different policy
      questions in line with the agreed Scope of Work document. Results show some variations for
      different policy questions, but also indicate some overarching trends. When interpreting the
      results, readers should keep in mind that all management cost and other costs for related
      health services were kept stable and were not included in the mathematical optimization.8 All
      optimization analyses suggest that there is room for substantial improvement of current
      allocations among the program areas, as detailed below.

      The first optimization presented here describes optimized allocations with constant 2013-
      level HIV funding available up to 2020.

      The analysis suggests that optimized allocation of currently available resources could
      avert 20 percent of deaths and 16 percent of new infections. The largest reallocation proposed
      with constant levels of funding is to prioritize ART by increasing funding from approximately
      US$2.7 million to US$4.1 million (Figure 4.3), resulting in an increase of coverage from 23 percent
      to 35 percent. A rough comparison of ART unit costs in the Region shows that Moldova implements
      its treatment program slightly above average and median costs. This finding suggests that there
      could be some efficiency gains within the program to increase value for money. On the left bank,
      the annual treatment cost per person in 2013 was $826, vs. $1,264 on the right bank, suggesting
      the potential for unit cost reduction on the right bank.

      Similar to other concentrated epidemics, in Moldova the model suggests discontinuing
      provision of services for the general population. HIV testing and counselling as well as BCC
      and condom programs for the general population were not part of the optimized allocation at
      the 2013 level of spending. These interventions currently account for over 20 percent of
      investment, or US$1.8 million per year―a substantial amount to be reallocated. HTC is part of
      programs for key populations and also received increased allocations. This finding should not
      imply stopping HTC, but strengthening the targeting of HTC. The model is indicating that, with
      limited resources and given unit costs, it will be most cost effective to initiate already
      diagnosed PLHIV on ART and provide HTC to key populations.

Note: a=Pregnant women should continue to be covered with ART as part of the increased ART budget. In
practice, this would also require continued HIV testing and counseling for pregnant women, which could be
financed from maternal health budgets; b=HIV testing and counseling would continue to be provided as part of
programs for key populations. As discussed below, persons requesting to be tested for HIV should continue to
receive the service, even if they are not part of key populations. What the model suggests is that, from a cost-
effectiveness perspective, expanded testing for the general population is not among the most cost-effective
programs when no additional resources are available.

      Optimized allocations also provide funds for scale-up of three prevention interventions on
      the left bank, and scale-up prevention for key populations on the right bank. Prevention
      services for PWID, FSW, and MSM should receive significantly more funding on both banks of
      the Nistru River, with NSP receiving the biggest share of funds on both banks (Figure 4.4).
      Although OST currently is not available on the left bank, the model suggests introducing OST
      to the left bank by providing $31,000 of annual funding to this program. On the right bank,
      according to the modeling results, current budgets allocate slightly less funding to OST than
      originally budgeted. However, this fact should not be seen as a recommendation to decrease
      coverage of OST. This finding is due to the fact that this optimization seeks to minimize both
      new infections and deaths. Since there is no alternative to ART for reducing death in the
      medium term, high allocations are given to ART despite relatively high unit cost. For reducing
      new infections, the model allocated limited resources to the most cost-effective programs,
      which for PWID in this context was the NSP program. Moldova has relatively low unit cost for
      other prevention programs, but—according to a big-picture comparison of costs per person
      reached—relatively high OST unit cost compared to other countries in the Region. In the 6
      countries included in the analysis, OST unit cost averages US$747; whereas in Moldova OST is
      currently provided at a unit cost of US$935 (INSERM and UNAIDS 2015). This large difference
      suggests possible technical efficiency gains in the OST program could be explored.

      4.4 What could be gained from increased funding and how
      should reduced funding be prioritized?
      The results in this section are optimized allocations for different levels of funding available
      ranging from 0 percent to 200 percent of current spending on direct programs with the goal to
      minimize both HIV incidence and deaths. In this optimization, the level of spending on
      management, enablers, and other costs has been kept stable.

      At all levels of funding, provision of ART for PLHIV requires the largest funding allocations. In
      case of budget reductions, compared to the current level of spending, the key interventions
      would be ART and prevention for key populations including PWID, MSM, and FSW and their
      clients. With additional funds available, the funds should be invested in continuous increase
      of ART and prevention programs for key populations.9 At the current level of budget

             deaths appears in appendix 4.

availability, the model suggests to stop all prevention services for the general population. With
200 percent of budget availability, HIV HTC is recommended to receive approximately 7
percent of the budget (US$0.8 million). This allocation is required because, to increase ART
coverage further, HIV testing needs to be provided beyond key populations.
The optimization analysis was carried out for 2 different time frames—2015–20 and 2015–
30—to test whether substantial differences in allocations exist. However, the overall trend
remained the same. Detailed allocations for all funding levels from 0 percent to 200 percent
are detailed in appendix D. Since the contextual analysis established that HIV funding in
Moldova has been relatively low and that the treatment gap is substantial, the results in Figure
4.5 focus on possible scenarios to increase HIV funding.

The level of available funding and focus of allocations would have a substantial effect on the
number of new infections in Moldova. Assuming there were no funding starting from 2015,
by 2020 there would be cumulatively approximately 18,000 new infections. With the current
level of funding and current allocation, there would be approximately 11,000 new infections in
6 years (Figure 4.6). In contrast, optimizing the current budget would reduce the cumulative
number of new infections to 9,200 cases in 5 years—a decrease of incidence of 16 percent.
Doubling the 2013 budget for direct programs and allocating it optimally would
decrease new infections to 7,000 during same period—a decrease in incidence of 36
percent compared to the baseline scenario.
If starting from 2015 funding for the HIV response were not available, there would be
approximately 7,000 HIV-related deaths by 2020. With the current allocation and level of
spending, the estimated number of cumulative HIV-related deaths would be approximately
5,000 by 2020 (Figure 4.7). Optimization of current spending could reduce the cumulative

     number of deaths by 1,000 (to 4,000 deaths in 5 years, or a 20 percent reduction). Availability
     of 200 percent of the 2013 budget for direct programs could reduce HIV-related deaths
     to approximately 2,600 (a 48 percent reduction compared to the baseline scenario).

     Note: Amounts rounded to the nearest US$1,000; a=Pregnant women should continue to be covered by ART as
     part of the increased ART budget. In practice, this coverage also would require continued HIV testing and
     counseling for pregnant women, which could be financed from maternal health budgets; b=HIV testing and
     counseling would continue to be provided as part of programs for key populations. As discussed below,
     persons requesting to be tested for HIV should continue to receive the service even if they are not part of key
     populations. What the model suggests is that, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, expanded testing for the
     general population is not among the most cost-effective programs when no additional resources are available.

     The large increase and relatively large share of spending allocated to ART is due to a
     combination of factors. As mentioned, ART is without alternative for reducing death in the
     short and medium terms and reduces new infections. In addition, ART unit cost in Moldova,
     particularly for the right bank, is above average. If the ART unit cost could be reduced,
     substantially more funding could be allocated to HIV prevention, even if less than 200 percent
     of current spending on direct programs is available. Programs for prevention of mother-to-
     child transmission (PMTCT) were not part of the optimized mix of interventions. Purely from a
     cost-effectiveness perspective, excluding them is common for concentrated epidemics because
     a large number of pregnant women must be tested to identify one HIV positive woman, leading
     to high cost per HIV infection averted. This reality does not mean that funding for PMTCT
     should be discontinued, but that HTC and ART for pregnant women should be provided at
     minimal cost by including and prioritizing pregnant women within the allocations for ART and
     HTC. Within the scenario for 200 percent of 2013 spending on direct programs (US$14.2
     million), the increased allocations for these 2 programs could be partially used for continued
     HTC and ART access for pregnant women.

     Optima also suggests substantial increases in programs for key populations: particularly OST
     and NSP on the left bank; and programs for FSW, MSM, and NSP on the right bank (table 4.4,
     figure 4.8). With the levels of funding available, there is also a proposed increase in funding for
     OST on the right bank. However, under current cost assumptions, the increase is only
     moderate. The relatively high unit cost for OST in Moldova has the opposite effect from ART in
     the model allocations. The model—using current unit cost assumptions—prioritizes NSP and
     other prevention programs for key populations due to their lower cost. However, as has been
     shown in other countries in the Region, where OST cost is relatively lower, OST can be cost
     effective with lower unit costs. To be able to expand OST, the unit costs for ART (because it
     absorbs the bulk of funding) and OST should be reviewed. As mentioned, considering OST’s
     non-HIV benefits, scaling up OST is justified due to a number of health and social benefits and
     should be pursued in any case with cofinancing from different health and social sectors.

     Figure 4.8 details the optimized allocations for prevention among key populations on the right
     bank and the left bank at different levels of available funding. As indicated above, new HIV
     diagnoses per 100,000 people are 3 times higher on the left bank as is HIV prevalence among

both PWID and women in the general population. Nevertheless, current investment in HIV
prevention for key populations on the left bank is limited. Regardless of the level of spending,
Optima suggests substantially increasing prevention allocations for key populations, on both
the left bank and the right bank, but the increases are more pronounced for the left bank.

4.5 How much does it cost and how should resources be
allocated to achieve national targets?
The optimizations presented in the previous sections sought to identify optimized allocations
for given amounts of funding available while maximizing impact on new HIV infections and
deaths. The optimization analysis presented in this section describes optimized allocations
to achieve a given impact as specified in the national strategy, while minimizing the amount
of money required to achieve this impact.

The National Program for HIV/AIDS and STI Control and Prevention for 2011–15 was
approved by the Moldovan Government on December 16, 2010. The targets of the National
Program were described in section 1.2. Three of four national HIV prevalence targets— for
PWID, FSW, and the general population—are achievable with optimized spending by year
2020 (Table 4.5). However, considering the epidemic’s projected trajectory, the national target
for HIV prevalence among MSM would not be achievable. With optimized resource allocation
and current cost-coverage outcome assumptions, it would be possible to achieve only 7.6
percent HIV prevalence.

     HIV prevalence targets on their own are ambiguous because they may be due to a reduction in
     new infections, or to an increase in deaths. Thus, for purposes of optimization analysis, to
     avoid the conclusion that the reduction in prevalence is achieved by an increase in deaths, the
     prevalence targets need to be translated into HIV incidence targets. For this reason, the
     national targets were expressed in form of a 40 percent reduction in HIV incidence by 2020.
     To achieve national targets, substantial increases in funding beyond 200 percent of
     current spending would be required: a budget of US$20.3 million10 against the 2013
     budget of US$8.7 million (Figure 4.9).

     achievement of national targets on incidence will be allocated to ART (66 percent of optimized
     budget, or $11.3 million). This increase in funding would increase coverage from 2,700 to
     approximately 12,000 PLHIV. To achieve such high levels of coverage, a substantial increase in
     HTC would be required in parallel to increased allocations for prevention programs for key
     populations. Table 4.6 provides all the detailed funding allocations and corresponding
     coverage.

Note: This finding does not suggest that OST programs should be defunded. It suggests only that the
prevalence level proposed in the national target for PWID (and corresponding HIV incidence levels) could be
achieved by focusing on NSP (in combination with treatment programs and other services reaching PWID).
However, as other optimizations to maximize impact on HIV incidence and deaths have shown, OST is essential
to be sustained and scaled up.


4.6 What are the health and financial impacts of implementing
different ART guidelines?
ART was introduced in Moldova in 2002. By the end of 2013, 2,500 people were on treatment.
However, using the eligibility criterion for treatment of CD4 count <350 cells/mm3, the
estimated need was more than twice that, at 6,600. In this context, the government committed
to increase treatment coverage and increase its share of ART program funding.

The study team carried out an analysis to establish the effect of a test and treat approach,
which would imply that all PLHIV are eligible to begin treatment regardless of their CD4 count.
The results presented here are for the following test and treat scenario:

     70 percent of all PLHIV diagnosed by 2020
     90 percent of those diagnosed on ART by 2020
     90 percent of those on ART with viral suppression by 2020.
The analysis (Table 4.7) suggests that a test and treat approach would have a positive impact
on both new infections and deaths averted.11 Compared to current levels of treatment
coverage, applying a test and treat approach would enable reducing HIV incidence by 36

11   The comparison is done for the baseline scenario: the number of people on treatment in 2013 with no additional
     scale-up.

     percent by 2020 and by 30 percent by 2030. In total, by 2020, the new eligibility criteria
     would avert 3,000 new infections and 2,400 deaths. Considering a longer period (2015–30),
     the cumulative number of averted infections would be 11,900; and the cumulative number of
     averted deaths, 8,000. Introducing new eligibility criteria is projected to cost an additional average
     US$6.1 million per year, resulting in US$30.5 million of additional funding needed by 2020, and
     US$91.5 million by 2030.

     The impact of the test and treat approach on the epidemic was analyzed assuming that other
     behaviors and other programs remain constant from 2015 onwards. Using the current
     coverage of other programs and current numbers of PLHIV on ART, the model suggests that
     the annual number of new infections and deaths will continue to grow between 2015 and 2030
     (Figure 4.10). Scaling up the treatment program will reduce incidence and deaths in the
     medium term (by 2020). However, in the long term from 2020, incidence and mortality will
     continue to increase by more than 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. This
     projection suggests that, to stabilize the epidemic, continued ART scale-up beyond 2020 and
     other programs remain important, particularly for key populations, including PWID, FSW, and
     MSM.

     The team also compared (a) the impact of a scenario with increased ART eligibility as the
     only change to optimized allocations with (b) minimizing both incidence and deaths with
     funding at a level of 200 percent of 2013 spending on direct programs, which corresponds
     to 163 percent of the 2013 budget, or US$14.2 million. This comparison suggests that the
     combined scale-up of different programs will have better results and require less funding.

percent more new infections and 17 percent more deaths, compared to exclusively scaling up
treatment. As mentioned above, ART would remain a focus of the combined scale-up of
programs and receive 71 percent of funding for direct programs, which is 55 percent of the
total HIV spending. However, other prevention interventions for key populations will remain
essential to maximize impact, particularly on new infections.

5.        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following are key conclusions and recommendations from this study:




          1
                  Moldova’s HIV epidemic remains concentrated among key populations
                  (PWID, FSW, and MSM) and their sexual partners. Available data suggest
                  that the epidemic has transitioned from an early concentrated epidemic in
                  which the highest rates of transmission were among PWID; to an advanced
          concentrated epidemic, in which onward transmission to sexual partners of PWID and
          other key populations has become a large source of new infections. Because Moldova’s
          HIV epidemic is projected to keep growing, it is critical to keep monitoring epidemic
          trends among key populations and their sexual partners. Data gaps on HIV prevalence
          among key populations such as FSW and MSM, particularly on the left bank, should be
          filled by including sites on the left bank in bio-behavioral surveillance studies for these
          groups.




          2
                  Moldova should continue to prioritize ART scale-up, which is essential to
                  minimize both HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths. Depending on the
                  amount of funding available, ART spending should account for 50 percent–70
                  percent of all HIV spending. With current funding, to reduce deaths by 20
          percent by 2020, ART coverage should increase from less than 20 percent in 2013 to
          35 percent of all PLHIV. If total HIV spending could be increased from US$8.7 million to
          over US$14.0 million between 2015–20, a 3-fold increase in ART spending and
          coverage is recommended. Compared to business as usual (2013 funding), this
          increase would expand ART coverage to 65 percent of all PLHIV and avert 48 percent
          of AIDS-related deaths. Also compared to business as usual, scaling up a test and treat
          approach would reduce new infections by 36 percent. However, overall, it would be
          less effective than a combined scale-up of ART plus prevention for key populations.12




          3
                 HIV testing and counselling is a critical component of programs for key
                 populations at all levels of spending as an entry point for ART. However, at
                 current levels of funding, HTC for the general population is not cost effective.
                 With increased availability of funding, to achieve high ART coverage beyond the
          already diagnosed PLHIV and key populations, expanding HTC beyond key populations
          will be required. Nevertheless, HTC still would remain focused on the geographic
          locations, in which partners of key populations and their partners are likely to be
          found. As noted above, PMTCT should be provided at minimal cost and focus on
          diagnosis of HIV in pregnant women that is integrated into comprehensive maternal
          health services with referral to ART services, thus avoiding overhead for PMTCT as a
          separate program.

12   This finding is consistent with a cost-effectiveness analysis carried out in the Region, which showed that
     combined scale-up of ART and harm reduction programs would have the largest impact on HIV and HCV in
     Moldova. See INSERM and UNAIDS 2015.

     4
             There is a need to focus prevention interventions on key populations and
             reallocate funding from general population prevention programs such as
             BCC to interventions that reach key populations. At all levels of funding up
             to 200 percent of 2013 program spending, prevention for the general
     population (behavioral change communication and condom programs) should be
     replaced with targeted programs for PWID, MSM, and FSW and their clients. Particular
     attention should be paid to (a) MSM on the right bank because HIV prevalence is
     projected to increase from 4 percent in 2014 to 11 percent in 2020; and to (b) PWID
     on the left bank, among whom HIV prevalence already stood at an estimated 18
     percent and is projected to increase to 21 percent by 2020.




     5
            Given the severe HIV epidemic on the left bank of the River, prevention
            programs should be scaled up as soon as possible including through
            further increasing coverage of needle-and-syringe exchange programs,
            while introducing services for MSM and FSW, as well as OST. These key
     prevention programs are not in place on the left bank, a region within Moldova in
     which general adult HIV prevalence is projected to increase beyond 1 percent
     according to Optima and to even higher levels according to the 2015 Spectrum
     estimates.




     6
            Rapid assessments of technical efficiency of ART and OST programs
            should be carried out. Although analysis of technical efficiency was not a part
            of this study, a Regional comparison of cost per person reached suggests that
            technical efficiency could be further improved in some program areas. While
     costs for some prevention programs for key populations appear comparably low in
     Moldova, costs for ART and OST are not. The intra-Regional differences require
     exploration within Moldova of specific areas for unit cost reductions, particularly for
     ART, which will absorb the majority of funding if programs are scaled up.




     7
             Given the multiple health benefits of OST, additional cofinancing for OST
             and potentially other expenditures covered from HIV budgets should be
             sought from other social and health budget lines. Management, enablers,
             and other costs, which are considered part of national HIV spending, include a
     number of areas whose scope goes beyond HIV programming. Examples are OST,
     blood safety, STI control, and social protection. A technical efficiency analysis of these
     costs and a review of funding sources would reveal whether the potential exists to
     reallocate funding to the high-impact programs prioritized in optimized allocation
     scenarios. Over the long term, in the context of transitioning to full national ownership
     and program sustainability, HIV programs should be integrated with the wider health
     response. Within that, HIV components of the budget would complement, rather than
     pay for, these services.




     8
            By increasing investments in the HIV response, including domestic
            financing, Moldova could realize high returns in reducing deaths and
            improving lives by averting new HIV infections. Although, in Moldova, HIV
            accounts for approximately 3.0 percent of disease burden in years of life lost
     (YLL), total annual spending on HIV accounted for only 0.8 percent of total health
     expenditure in 2013. In fact, 67 percent of funds for HIV programs came from
     international partners. This vast gap suggests the necessity for a substantial increase
     in domestic financing of the HIV response. Compared to current spending, increasing
     total HIV investment from US$8.7 million to US$14.2 million and optimally allocating
     resources would decrease incidence by 36 percent and HIV-related deaths by 48

        percent. In the long term, these effects would have not only health benefits but also
        financial benefits in reduced health care cost for PLHIV.

APPENDIX A.              TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350–500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line
therapy, treatment failure, subsequent lines of therapy, and HIV/AIDS-related or other death.

     Note: Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified health state. Each arrow
     represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
     “susceptible” represent individuals living with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.

     The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
     PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
     material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
     two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
     population group based on their dominant risk.13 HIV infections occur through the interactions
     among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including transactional) sexual
     partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through mother-to-child
     transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals become
     infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals are
     exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction with
     other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the force
     of- infection has the general form:



     where 1) the same line as the l fl ri, and on the same lndividuals are exposed in a given period
     (either within their population groups or through interaction with other population groups)
     and the infection probabilthrough which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the
     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.

     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection


     13   However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
          non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
          female sexual partners).
Appendix A                                                                                                               37



for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.14 In addition to the force-of-
infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.15

The change in the number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the
relevant rates described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on
which they act.16




14   For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
         HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
         Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
         Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
         Proportion of men who are circumcised
         Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
         Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
         Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
         Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
          preventing HIV transmission.
      For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
      HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
      Number of injections per person per year
      Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
      Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
          behavior.
      For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
      Birth rate among women living with HIV
      Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
      Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
      Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
15   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
     greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
     count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
     individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
     CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
     and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
     diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
     treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
     initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
     second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
     higher CD4 counts.
16 For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
   cells per microliter is:




     where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
     350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350–500 cells/mL);
     t is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4
     cells/mL); m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider
     movement among populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa—
     something which is included in Optima.)

     Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
     model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
     A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
     infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
     terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
     distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
     of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
     are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
     manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
     consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION AND PROGRAM COVERAGE TARGETS
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
Appendix A                                                                                                               39



outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.17 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:




where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV
responses.18 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step
sizes and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of
optimization problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized
solutions with fewer function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including
gradient descent and simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,

17   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
     coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
     longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
     behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
     more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
     because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
     the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost–
     coverage curves (appendix 2).
18   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
     using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
     team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
     service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the team derived
     one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
     linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
     strategies aim to achieve).
40                                                                    Optimizing investments in Moldova’s HIV Response



     users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
     very high spending.19




     19   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
           experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
           ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
           analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
           behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
           estimates.
APPENDIX B.              CALIBRATION OF THE MODEL TO EPIDEMIC
DATA
Using available demographic, epidemiological, behavioral, and clinical data (recorded in the
Optima data entry spreadsheet), the team calibrated Optima to the HIV epidemic in Moldova
over 2000–13 (Figure B.1 and Figure B.2). Based on the calibration, the team estimated the
overall and population level incidence over 2000–20.

Figure C.1 shows cost-coverage-outcome curves for HIV programs in Moldova. The
relationship between program spending and coverage is shown in the left panel of subfigure
C.1a. This relationship describes the level of output (availability of a service to a specific
proportion of the target population) achieved with a specific level of financial input (cost in
US$). For example, this relationship would describe what proportion of female sex workers
can be covered with an investment of US$0–US$1 million. The relationship between coverage
level and outcome is shown in the right panel. This relationship describes the proportion of
people who will adopt a specific behavior (such as condom use or consistent use of ARVs
leading to viral suppression). These relationships were reached in collaboration with
Moldovan experts.

APPENDIX D.               ADDITIONAL RESULTS
Epidemiology
The populations included in modeling differ in the number of infections that they transmit and
acquire. Figure D.1 illustrates which groups received more new infections than they
transmitted (values below 1) and vice versa (values above 1). As of 2013, on the right bank,
more new infections were transmitted by three key populations: PWID, FSW, and MSM. On the
left bank, the biggest share of infections were transmitted by PWID.

received) among populations, 2013




Source: Populated Optima model for Moldova.
Note: Female populations are in pink; male populations are in blue.

On the right bank, the increase in new infections among female adults likely was due to
interactions with MSM, men who inject drugs, and clients of FSW. Clients of FSW received
more infections than they transmitted. The vast majority of HIV infections that FSW clients
received were from FSW. However, because many infections that the clients transmitted were
to female adults in the general population, FSW clients remain an important bridging
population. On the left bank, the high and increasing incidence among females likely was
caused predominantly by contacts with men who inject drugs, with a contribution of contacts
to clients of FSW and MSM.

      Financial Savings to 2030
      Optimizing spending may result in potential savings given that number of new infections likely
      will decrease and therefore—compared to maintaining current allocations—fewer people will
      need treatment. Considering projected epidemic and economic trends, in 2050 the country will
      need to allocate US$40 million per year to provide necessary services for PLHIV.
      Optimization of spending starting from 2015 is projected to require slightly higher health care
      costs by 2035 (Figure D.4) because, due to higher ART coverage, more PLHIV will survive and
      continue to require treatment. However, in the long run, optimization will not only increase
      impact but also reduce future cost. As of 2050, the expected annual savings through
      optimization alone will account for approximately US$1.5 million and will continue to increase.
      With additional investment in prevention and treatment now, more new HIV infections could
      be averted and future cost further reduced.

current and optimized spending scenarios




Figure D.5 shows the comparison of future spending for people infected before and after 2015.
The trend for PLHIV infected prior to 2015 is similar for current and optimized allocations. In
the optimized spending scenario (B), treatment cost for PLHIV infected before 2015 will be
higher because reallocation will lead to a decrease in HIV-related mortality, thus more people
will survive. However, in the long term, the overall spending would be lower for the optimized
allocation given that optimized allocation of HIV funding also would reduce incidence.

Allocative efficiency      Within a defined resource envelope, AE of health or HIV-specific
(AE)                       interventions provides the right intervention to the right people at the
                           right place in the correct way to maximize targeted health outcomes.
Behavioral                 Discourages risky behaviors and reinforces protective ones, typically by
intervention               addressing knowledge, attitudes, norms, and skills.
Biomedical                 Biomedical HIV intervention strategies use medical and public health
intervention               approaches to block infection, decrease infectiousness, and reduce
                           susceptibility.
Bottom-up costing          Costing method that identifies all of the resources that are used to provide
                           a service and assigns a value to each of them. These values then are
                           summed and linked to a unit of activity to derive a total unit cost.
Cost-effectiveness         Form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes
analysis (CEA)             (effects) of two or more courses of action.
Effectiveness              Degree of achievement of a (health) outcome in a real-world
                           implementation setting.
Efficiency                 Achievement of an output with the lowest possible input without
                           compromising quality.
Financial sustainability   Ability of government and its partners to continue spending on a health or
                           HIV outcome for the required duration and to meet any cost of borrowing
                           without compromising the government’s, household’s, or other funding
                           partner’s financial position.
HIV incidence              Estimated total number (or rate) of new (total number of diagnosed and
                           undiagnosed) HIV infections in a given period.
HIV prevalence             Percentage of people who are infected with HIV at a given point in time.
                           Set of measures to ensure that programs are implemented in a way that
Implementation             achieves outputs with the lowest input of resources. In practical terms,
efficiency                 improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                           solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service
                           delivery models, and assessing and addressing service delivery
                           “roadblocks.” Implementation efficiency will improve the scale, coverage,
                           and quality of programs.
Incremental cost-          Equation commonly used in health economics to provide a practical
effectiveness ratio        approach to decision making regarding health interventions. ICER is the
(ICER)                     ratio of the change in costs to incremental benefits of a therapeutic
                           intervention or treatment.
Model                      Computer system designed to demonstrate the probable effect of two or
                           more variables that might be brought to bear on an outcome. Such models
                           can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                           results in an accessible format.
Opioid substitution        Medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a
therapy (OST)              longer acting but less euphoric opioid. Methadone or buprenorphine
                           typically are used, and the drug is taken under medical supervision.

Opportunistic              Treatment given to PLHIV to prevent either a first episode of an OI
infectionunder             (primary prophylaxis) or the recurrence of infection (secondary

prophylaxis)
Pre-exposure             Method for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of
prophylaxis (PrEP)       acquiring it to prevent HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug.
Program effectiveness    Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
                         and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating proven
                         practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
Program sustainability   Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
                         service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                         response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over time
                         as intended by the strategy.
Return on investments    Performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or
(ROI)                    to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To
                         calculate ROI, the benefit (return) of an investment is divided by the cost
                         of the investment; the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
Saturation               Maximum level of coverage that a program can achieve.
Technical efficiency     Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
                         the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                         standards.
Top-down costing         Costing method that divides total expenditure (quantum of funding
                         available) for a given area or policy by total units of activity (such as
                         patients served) to derive a unit cost.
Universal health         Universal health coverage (UC), is defined as ensuring that all people have
coverage (UC)            access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative
                         health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while
                         ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to
                         financial hardship.
