       Mapping Manila Transit
       A New Approach to Solving Old Challenges

       Whether they attempt to build jeepney stops,
       expand transit access, or improve bus routes, transit
       projects across much of the developing world are
       often hampered by (1) the lack of accurate transit
       maps and data and (2) the weak capacity of transit

       and a suite of open-source software applications
       based on free, internationally supported open data
       standards. The solutions have allowed the quick,
       low-cost production of transit maps; and they have empowered the agencies—and potentially
       businesses and the rest of government—for the first time to make ambitious planning and
       investment decisions based on accurate, comprehensive transit data. The global applicability of
       this approach has been demonstrated by its adoption in six other developing countries to date.

       Advancing Development with Mobile Phone
       Locational Data
       Improving the Effectiveness of Assistance
       Ryan Haddad, Tim Kelly, Teemu Leinonen, and Vesa Saarinen



       Mobile phones, and especially smartphones, are opening new ways to assess and improve assistance
       and the delivery of basic services in the developing world. Each year, developing countries see an annual
       gain of about 500 million new smartphones, virtually all of which generate not only call data records but
       also, with their GPS and Wi-Fi capabilities, a rich set of more precise data on location and movement.
       The rapid diffusion of the phones and the locational data they generate are helping fuel the “science of
       delivery”—the evidence-based, experimental approach to project assessment and improvement.

       The technology is finding an expanding variety of uses. Recent examples involving transport and
       logistics include:

       Boosting Mass Transit through
       Entrepreneurship
       Going beyond Subsidies to Reduce the Public Transport Funding Gap

       Daniel Pulido and Irene Portabales

       average, 25% of metro operating expenditures                           of all metro system

       fares and political sensitivities to road user                         farebox revenue
       taxes, metro systems have been increasingly
       pursuing income from commercial activities
       connected with their operations. Metro systems that earn commercial income—such as from
       advertising, naming rights, and especially real estate activities—are making inroads in their
       operating deficits. Commercial revenue in some systems is nearing 20% of fare revenue.
       Although reforms of transit financing structures remain high on the policy agenda, a review of
       ancillary income streams of metro systems around the world shows that a more entrepreneurial
       approach to tapping their commercial potential can help them narrow their funding gap.

       Key Pathways to High-Speed Internet in the

       Spurring Competition and Building New Networks

       monopolized, inadequate infrastructure; weak
       investment incentives; and high costs. High-speed (broadband) Internet can drive economic
       and social transformations. To realize that potential, a recent World Bank study finds that MENA
       countries must pursue a three-pronged approach: (1) Reduce costs by fully liberalizing access
       to the existing Internet infrastructure. (2) Support the resulting competition with independent
       national regulators working within a harmonized regional framework of regulation. (3) Promote
       investments in new fiber-optic networks and other ultrafast broadband infrastructure (including
       Long-Term Evolution or LTE) alongside existing technologies.1 With these measures, plus
       aggressive strategies for sharing public works infrastructure and subsidies for rural access,
       MENA can leapfrog its current information and communication bottlenecks.

       the world is strongly boosting GHG emissions:
       the massive rise in motorization as household
       incomes and technical advances make it affordable. This tendency will push transport fuel
       emissions much higher unless projects sharply expand the opportunities and incentives for users
       to adopt low-emission modes.

       The World Bank’s GHG analysis for transport shows whether a given transport project can help
       lower the trajectory of the sector’s GHG emissions. A central feature is an estimate of the wider
       social costs of emissions under various modes—for example, air pollution and accidents—as well
       as climate change. Including them greatly increases the demonstrated benefit of emissions-

       Challenges and Opportunities in Urban
       Transport Projects
       Career Reflections of Two World Bank Specialists

       Problems or even failure in transport initiatives
       are more likely for projects set in the urban areas
       of developing countries. Connecting a rural village
       to an all-weather road or restoring a section
       of national highway is usually straightforward.          The number of countries in which
       Costs are modest, institutional issues limited,           the World Bank supports urban
       and the benefits obvious. In contrast, urban                      transport solutions
       transport is not a single mode governed by a
       single agency but a collection of modes with
       varied administrative boundaries and many private sector stakeholders. Successful urban transport
       strategies reflect an understanding of linkages among transport, land use, and environmental
       factors. Working out the complex local challenges requires social, political, and technical capacities
       often in short supply in developing countries. And even when a project manages to attain its
       physical objectives, the civil and governmental capacity needed for sustainability often remains
       underdeveloped. The institutional frictions and gaps point to the elements of the way forward on
       urban projects: thoroughly understand the local context, then build broad public consensus around
       the value of better transport and the value of institutional arrangements to sustain it.

       five years, 2010-2014, five cities in Latin America and

       lines using PPPs. In four of these projects, the PPPs are fully bundled, that is, they encompass design,

          The resolution gave neither a forecast nor a numerical target for reduction. In its 2013 Global Status Report on Road Safety, the World
        Health Organization projected annual worldwide traffic deaths as rising from 1.3 million in 2011 to 1.9 million by 2020. It noted that
        steadily reducing the death rate over the decade to 0.9 million—a much more ambitious goal than stabilizing and then reducing—would
        save 5 million lives by 2020.

       The Expanding Role for Open Data

       sector has taken a new turn in Burkina Faso. Open
       data has always been recognized as an enabler of
       economic development and government transparency.
       But in October 2014, when a popular uprising ousted
       Burkina Faso’s long-standing leader and established a
       transitional government, the country’s nascent Burkina
       Open Data Initiative (BODI) took on new life as an
       enabler of the transition. With support from the Open       The number of government
       Data Initiative and the World Bank, BODI had debuted       data sets currently available
       just four months before the uprising, showcasing               to the public under the
       about 50 data sets of government information and an        Burkina Open Data Initiative
       app that focused on education. In the months since
       then, the development of BODI has only accelerated,
       with more staff, more data sets posted, and new applications launched or planned. Under the
       transitional government, BODI has expanded with a web page for finding data on government
       contract awards and a program to help track and manage the country’s persistent drought
       problems. And BODI envisions a polling-place finder and reporting of vote totals as ways to
       support turnout and transparency for the scheduled October 2015 national elections.

       traffic jams, it changed course and helped Korea make      metro or bus
       a historic transition to green urban transport. It shifted
       from supply-side policies focused on expanding
       roadways and metro lines to green demand-side
       policies focused on creating transit-oriented cities.
       Today, Seoul boasts a passenger-trip share for metro
       and bus of more than 60%. Energy consumption in Korea’s road sector is lower than in other
       countries with similar GDP. Congestion costs have been decreasing, and CO2 emissions in the
       transport sector have been kept under control. This pathbreaking transition was founded on
       multimodal solutions integrated by information and communication technology (ICT) in a context
       of strong political leadership and public financing.

       Actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to
       stabilize warming at 2oC, as agreed by the international
       community in 2009, will fall short if they do not
       include the transport sector. Transport is responsible
       for around 23% of global carbon dioxide emissions and
       emissions are expected to rise without further action
       to curb emission growth and invest in low carbon
       transport modes. Investment needs are estimated
       at around $3 trillion to increase the sustainability of
       existing and new transport systems and to mitigate

       important catalyst will not be sufficient to meet
       needs. The actions taken today to send the right policy signals, and establish the enabling
       institutions and regulations to attract the necessary private finance will be critical to support this
       transformation. Significant investment opportunities exist in public transport systems, vehicle
       efficiency improvement, and reducing the need for travel through demand management, regional
       development policies, and land use planning. As the international community embarks on the

       A new World Bank initiative, “Impact Evaluation (IE) —
       Connect for Impact,” aims to radically transform and
       better inform the way that transport and information
       and communications technology (ICT) projects are
       designed and implemented.
       Although multilateral lending to this key strategic sector
       comprises 29 percent of all global assistance, only 0.4
       percent of impact evaluations have had transport as a
       subject. This initiative aims to fill the gap and bring high
       quality and valuable feedback to projects — improving
       design, enabling mid-course corrections, and informing

       The world faces two urgent challenges: eradicating
       poverty through economic development, and tackling
       climate change. Sustainable transport is crucial to both.

       United Nations in September 2000. The omission was
       widely viewed in the transport community as a missed
       opportunity to use the strong linkage between transport
       and economic development to advance the attainment
       of the MDGs. Now a new 15-year development

       key contributor to sustainable development. The SDGs               transport
       comprise 17 goals and 169 targets; five of those targets
       directly involve transport, and attaining at least another
       six will critically depend on it. But efforts to influence the post-2015 development agenda will go on
       after the summit because the question of what indicators will be used to measure success is yet to
       be resolved. Attention in the transport community must now pivot toward that question to assure
       the selection of the most effective measures.

       Creating Pro-Poor Transport
       Connecting the Dots: Transport, Growth, and Poverty Reduction

       Muneeza Mehmood Alam1

       Transport plays a crucial role in connecting people to goods



                                                                                                      11.5km
       and services and fostering sustainable development. The
       literature links improved transport infrastructure to economic
       growth and poverty reduction through five key mechanisms
       (1) reducing transport and production costs, (2) creating jobs,
                                                                             The minimum distance

       depend on supportive conditions in other sectors, such as             in Kenya
       access to credit, functioning land markets, low trade barriers,
       and so on. Therefore, any assessment of potential gains from
       transport infrastructure and services should also account
       for the interaction with complementary markets. However,
       the analysis of such interactions—assessing how and when
       transport infrastructure can help reduce poverty and income inequality—is largely missing from
       the literature, leaving significant knowledge gaps across the spectrum of transportation settings.
       This note highlights existing findings and some limitations in the literature on three basic types of
       transport infrastructure: large projects such as regional or national highways and railroads; rural
       transport; and transport in urban areas

       Most urban transport projects have focused on
       improving the ability of citizens to move freely and
       swiftly about the city. Typically, that ability has been
       measured by the share of the population living within,
                                                                                        and

       New technologies and richer databases now make
       accessibility—the number of jobs, health facilities, schools, and other essential services that
       are available without a car in, say, 30–75 minutes—a practical criterion for judging the state of
       mobility and for designing ways to improve it. Using the accessibility criterion will be critical to
       achieving SDG 11, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal to “make cities and human

       Transport efficiency and safety in the advanced
       economies have long benefited from information
       and communication technology (ICT). However,
       these ICT applications have typically been high-cost,

       less costly and more powerful “intelligent transport

       efficiently manage transportation assets and improve
       road safety. In the process, such projects have also
       demonstrated improvements in the traveler’s experience and the attractiveness of public transit.
       Moreover, the greater potential of the new technologies to reduce congestion and travel times
       means that the new era has also strengthened the potential of ITS to reduce greenhouse gas
       (GHG) emissions. However, realizing the potential of ITS in developing countries depends on
       improvements in assessment practices to find what works best and in the data capabilities of
       domestic institutions. Significant improvements in these areas are critical to the success of ITS.

       The widening use of smartphones, high urbanization
       rates, and the rapid evolution of technologies
       are driving the expansion of real time passenger

       conventional systems represent an increasingly outdated model. The new technologies can allow
       cities to obtain more economical and more adaptable RTPI systems, and government officials
       should consider these new developments when designing transit projects and procurement
       processes.

      ICT at COP21: Enormous Potential to

       The transformational potential of new information and
       communication technologies (ICTs) was on display
       in Paris at the Twenty-First Conference of the Parties
       (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention
       on Climate Change. ICTs—including the Internet, mobile
       phones, geographic information systems (GIS), satellite
       imaging, remote sensing, and data analytics—could                                       Estimated

       20% by 2030, thus holding them at their 2015 level.    1             global    carbon emissions
       Moreover, ICT emissions are expected to decrease to                            by 2030 through
       1.97% of the global total by 2030, from 2.3% in 2020,                   expanded      application

       ICTs are also critical for climate change adaptation,                               technologies
       providing vital tools for all phases of the disaster risk
       management cycle. Although the opportunities for
       ICTs to support the climate change agenda are enormous, much work remains in order to realize
       them. Governments of developing countries must be further encouraged to include ICTs in their
       national climate change policies. And the international development community will have to make
       significant efforts, particularly in low-income countries, to develop ICT infrastructure as well as
       the institutional capacities and skills to implement and sustain these solutions.


       By 2030, ICTs could eliminate the equivalent of 12.1                        logistics, car sharing (e.g., Uber), and other ICT-en-

      Harnessing the Internet for Development
       Samia Melhem

       Universal access to the Internet has become a top
       development priority. Getting there requires affordable,
       reliable access to fast, “always on” broadband
       networks, one of the United Nations’ Sustainable
       Development Goals (SDG 9.c). Finland has recognized
       access to broadband as a fundamental human right




                                                                                                         60%
       since 2010.1 In 2011, a key UN commission also declared
       that broadband access is a basic human right, along
       with health care, shelter, and food.2 Affordable Internet
       access enables progress on some of the toughest
       development challenges in the world’s poorest
                                                                          The proportion of the

                                                                       world’s population that has

       to the Internet to 75% ( reaching 5.6 billion people)
       would add $2 trillion per year to world GDP and help
       create 140 million jobs—a lofty goal: today, only about 40% of the world’s population (3.2 billion)
       is connected.3 But reaping those benefits requires more than adding Internet connections: while
       digital technologies have been spreading, “digital dividends” have not. Getting traction will
       require a major reevaluation of Internet development and reform projects. That reevaluation
       is the focus of the World Bank’s World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends (WDR 16).
       It highlights the size of the digital divide and shows that a robust program of development in
       the supporting environment points the way for the development community to make decisive
       headway on the enormous promise of the Internet.

       Will the Digital Revolution Help or
       Hurt Employment?
       Adaptation a Key to Realizing Job Gains
       Siddhartha Raja and Mavis Ampah

       What will technological change deliver in the coming
       decades? Higher unemployment? Or a wealth of new
       job opportunities? And what can we do to determine
       the outcome? Technological change in any given
       society is never smooth and always negotiated.
       Although both perils and opportunities await,
       the ultimate result depends on our choices today.



                                                                        600 million
       Governments, businesses, and individuals have shown
       that adapting to changing circumstances can alter the
       consequences of apparently “inevitable” changes. And
       developing countries can be profoundly affected by
                                                                      The estimated global number of new
       changes seemingly limited to the advanced economies;           jobs required by 2030 for the global
       they must adapt to what is actually a global                    employment rate to keep pace with
       technological playing field. The World Bank’s recently                  population growth
       issued World Development Report 2016: Digital
       Dividends focuses on strengthening the “analog complements” of the digital economy, including
       adapting skills to get the most out of the digital revolution (See Connections Note 2016-1).
       Countries whose governments can facilitate innovation, strengthen education and skill building,
       and build up the social safety net may be the most likely to benefit from the coming changes.

       nowadays, the robots are coming to take our jobs,        about technological change and work.

       Bringing Paved Roads to the Hinterland
       A cost-saving way to speed travel and transport

       Extreme poverty is a predominantly rural phenomenon,
       and the poor quality of roads linking remote areas to
       market centers is one of its distinguishing features.
       The time and cost of moving goods over poor roads
       makes rural traders uncompetitive. The problem
       often remains unsolved because sparse traffic makes            Savings using
       it cost-prohibitive to pave rural roads by traditional         geo cell pavement

       for extending paved road networks into rural areas.
                                                                      Kiribati, Central

       concrete poured into flexible plastic webbing offers a
       promising alternative. These “geo cell pavements” cost
       less to build and maintain than concrete, asphalt, or
       chip seal pavements. The new pavement technology
       has been used in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and
       the Pacific, offering an affordable way to improve accessibility for poorer remote areas. Geo cell
       pavements that link rural traders and farmers to market centers could become an important tool
       in the effort to eliminate extreme poverty.

       people (about 2.8% of all households) in small, widely
       scattered settlements throughout Russia by installing 200,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cable
       providing speeds of at least 10 Mbps. The assignment is both a great opportunity and a huge
       challenge for Rostelecom and for the entire Russian broadband sector. What can Russia do
       to ensure Rostelecom’s successful completion of its specific task as well as the success of the
       broader 2018 target?

          The goal translates to 40 million households—at least a six-fold increase in the share of households with such speeds given that, as of mid-2015,
        only about 13% of broadband connections exceeded 15 Mbps (Akamai, State of the Internet Report, https://content.akamai.com/PG3046-Q2-
        2015-SOTI-Report.html). Broadband Internet is the successor to telephone dial-up technology (56 kilobits per second). Broadband Internet is an
        “always on” service delivering a download rate of at least 256 kbps through conventional telephone, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and wireless
        modes. The newest of these modes have dramatically raised broadband speeds. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in
        early 2015 raised its definition of minimum broadband data speeds from 4 Mbps to 25 Mbps for download and from 1 Mbps to 3 Mbps for upload.

           Relative to wireless, fixed broadband capability is currently a more significant factor in decisions of foreign direct investors.

       Open Data for Sustainable Development

       The “open data” principle is becoming an increasingly
       important part of the data revolution, which is
       recognized worldwide as a key engine for achieving the
       post-2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Open

       one of the most underutilized key assets of modern

       at converting open data into formats that can be

       create $3 trillion to $5 trillion annually in economic
       value worldwide.1 The direct, annual economic value of
       public governmental data has been estimated at up to €40 billion for the European Union and £2
       billion for the United Kingdom. Numerous examples illustrate how the use of open data can give
       significant support to achieving the post-2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals.2

       subscribers has combined to stall the expansion of this

       developmental value of high-speed Internet and
       the strategy of colocating cable with transport and
       power corridors are well understood (see Connections
       Note #7 and #2016-4). The missing piece is a legal and regulatory push to ensure that cable
       is accommodated when private or public infrastructure is built or renovated in rural areas.
       With technical assistance informed by precedents in advanced economies, the international
       community and developing countries themselves can accelerate adoption of such policies.

       Measuring Economywide Effects of Big

       The state of urban travel in many developing countries
       is grim. Congestion and low-quality infrastructure—

       Though urbanization is an important ingredient in
       poverty reduction, it inevitably strains urban transport,
       so it is widening the financing gap. World Bank research
       released this year has pinpointed sources of the
       financing problem and proposed a response based on the concept of “who benefits, pays.” By
       tapping into innovative revenue sources that promote eﬃcient pricing, increase overall revenue,
       and strengthen all elements of sustainable transport, urban areas in developing countries can
       fund a wide variety of urban transport projects in a manner that will ensure their sustainability.

       Unlocking the Potential of Freight Logistics

       Bernard Aritua

       New, comprehensive analysis of data on the current
       routing of goods in India have positioned the country
       to break through its freight transport gridlocks and
       logistics inefficiencies. With a growth rate of more

       improvements in advanced economies have shown that,
       with sufficiently detailed data on freight flows, targeted interventions in specific corridors and
       subsectors can enable transformational changes in freight logistics performance. Researchers
       and logistics experts from the World Bank and South Africa’s Stellenbosch University have
       assembled and modeled such data for India, identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for more
       strategic investment and collocation of activities to achieve production synergies and lower the
       costs of logistics and trade.

       appeals to governments that want to provide more
       accessible, secure, and cost-effective public services. However, putting government data
       in the cloud—that is, on remote, Internet-connected devices owned by another, typically
       private, organization—poses the question of readiness to handle issues that are inherent in the
       technology, including security, dependability, and the scope of control that might be exercised
       by the owner of the cloud hardware and the Internet service provider. The World Bank’s ICT unit
       (hosted in the Transport and ICT Global Practice), in collaboration with Accenture Consulting,
       recently developed a toolkit that can assess government readiness for cloud migration. It
       is now conducting pilot studies to improve and refine the ability of the toolkit to provide
       recommendations to interested national policy makers and digital leaders.
