THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Ordinance No. 857 simplified the license application process in the

        Lima). Law 28976 of 19 January 2007 on the operating license (Ley
        Marco de Licencia de Funcionamiento) has simplified the system by
        eliminating the need of a Certificate of Compatibility as a requisite and
        by replacing it by a simple verification that the new company meets
        zoning regulations.

        The requirements for the Certificate of INDECI have also been
        simplified. Categories I and II licenses (premises up to 500 m2) do not
        need to submit a Certificate of INDECI but the compliance with health
        and security requirements is now checked by the municipality with
        inspections after submitting request for Municipal Operating License.
        This system is now operating in all Lima’s District Councils.

        • details of the electrical load.
        The plans for the System of Use by the client are also required, so that
        Luz de Sur can verify that the customer's installation will not cause a

       A Property Registry Certificate (CRI, Certificado Registral Inmobiliario) is
       obtained from the Property Registry to verify the existence and
       characteristics/description of the property (land and construction), the
       identity of the owner, and to check whether it is a clean title (free from
       attachments, mortgages, or any encumbrances of judicial or extra judicial
       nature).
        The notary will verify that the municipal taxes (Property Tax (Impuesto
       Predial) and Municipal services (public gardening, public parks, municipal
       police, garbage collection, other services)) have been paid. The
       information is obtained at the municipality by requesting a “cortado” at

       Deed related to the sale of real estate, the official document showing the
       cancelation of the Property Tax for all years.
       However, for the perfection of the transfer (Public Deed) it will require a
       Notary. The tax amounts to 1.61% of a Peruvian Tax Unit (T.U.). For Fiscal

      alcabala) and verifying that the seller has made the last payment of
      municipal taxes, the Notary will prepare the official transcription of the
      minuta (Public Deed) in the Notarial Registry. The Notary verifies the
      identity of the parties, compliance with all mandatory formalities and as
      the case may be of corporate and civil Powers of Representation (powers
      of attorney) and proceeds to have the parties sign the Public Deed after
      which he himself signs thus authorizing the completion of the Public
      Deed as a public Notarial document. The document is ready for

      Registry.

      Payment of Transfer tax (“Impuesto de Alcabala”)

      The Transfer tax (Alcabala) must be paid at the Tax Service
      Administration (Servicio de Administración Tributaria, SAT). The tax
      agency SAT is connected with the notaries through the internet
      (https://www.sat.gob.pe/TF/default.asp) to facilitate the payment of
      municipal taxes (including the transfer tax called Alcabala). The payment
      can be made on behalf of a client by the notary instantaneously, and no
      physical visits or wait time is involved in this process. Nevertheless, the
      aforementioned payment may also be executed in Notaries with debit
      and credit card, or bank transfers since late 2008, due to notaries have                   3% of the

      Municipal value of the property and the transfer value on the excess of

      discounted from the tax basis. This tax is payable by the purchaser. Since
      January 2014, the TU is PES 3,800. Even if there is usually a difference

      Filing for registration of the Public Deed with the Property Register.
      Normally, it is the Notary who carries out this act but it is not mandated
      by law. Filing is a free act and is not restricted to any Officer in particular.
      If the Notary is not in the same jurisdiction of the Property Register, he
      may engage a Notary with the same Notarial Jurisdiction as that of the

      When the client submits the transfer to SUNARP, SUNARP checks and
      verifies if the sale falls into this category. It then assigns the work to the
      relevant "seccion" (composed of one registrador, 2 assistants and one
      apprentice). Some "secciones" are specifically assigned to this type of
      transactions. Also, standard minutes have been published in the website
      to promote their use. The legal framework of Peru does not allow
      providing incentives for employees. Regular registration of the public
      deed in the Property Registry takes a maximum of 35 working days, but
      during the first 7 days of this term the Pubilc Registry is obliged to issue
      a notice regarding the situationof the public deed filed for registration.
