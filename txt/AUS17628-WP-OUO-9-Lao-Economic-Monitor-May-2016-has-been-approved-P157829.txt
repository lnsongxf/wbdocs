    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

    1.	     The Lao economy is estimated to have expanded by around 7 percent in 2015, a
    slight moderation from 7.5 percent in 2014. Similar to the last decade, the resource sec-
    tors (hydropower and extractives) continued to make an important contribution to growth.
    Power generation got a boost from the commissioning of the first two blocks of the 1,878
    MW Hongsa lignite power plant and an additional 250-300 MW of installed capacity in
    the hydro sector. Furthermore, despite lower global commodity prices, mining output still
    increased as metal prices remained above the mines’ cost recovery levels. Construction
    remained robust as capital inflows (FDI and loans) into the power sector and real estate
    development remained resilient. Manufacturing and exports of parts and components in-
    creased, albeit from a low base, as Lao PDR was able to attract a few companies that relo-
    cated part of their production from other countries in the region to special economic zones
    in Lao PDR. Tourist arrivals, mostly from the region, remained strong. These gains were
    partially offset by slower external demand (including for timber), stronger control on public
    spending as well as lower output in agriculture due to unfavorable weather and lower com-
    modity prices. Average annual inflation fell from 4.2 percent in 2014 to 1.3 percent in 2015
    and further to 1.1 percent in March 2016 due largely to continued decline in fuel prices, with
    core inflation at around 1.7 percent.

    2.	     The fiscal deficit is estimated at about 3.7 percent of GDP in FY14/15, slightly
    down from 3.8 percent of GDP a year earlier. Revenues remained stable in nominal terms,
    but declined as a ratio to GDP from 24.1 percent to 23 percent in FY14/15 as lower commod-
    ity prices affected revenues (royalties and taxes on mining, excises and VAT on oil etc.) and
    grants declined. This was offset by the robust performance in value added tax and profit
    tax due to efforts to strengthen collection. At the same time, tight control over the wage bill
    and public recruitment limited the growth in expenditures with total expenditures, meas-
    ured as percent of GDP, declining from 28 percent to 26.6 percent. The deficit was largely
    financed by external public borrowing, bringing Lao PDR’s total public debt to about 65
    percent of GDP in 2015 (about US$7.7 billion)1. The issue of public sector arrears continues
    to linger on, suggesting that domestic public debt may be understated. An inter-Ministerial
    Committee has been setup to validate the arrears and fraudulent cases have been investi-
    gated. There is a plan to establish a new public investment management division under the
    Ministry of Finance aiming to improve the coordination with the Ministry of Planning and
    Investment and supervise the planning and disbursements of the investment spending.

3.	     Monetary and exchange rate policies remained focused on tight management of
the kip/US dollar exchange rate, resulting in further appreciation of the kip against re-
gional currencies. With exchange rate stability being one of the key objectives of the Bank
of Lao PDR, the monetary authorities kept the kip/US$ exchange rate largely stable, which
in an environment of strengthening US$ resulted in further appreciation of the real effec-
tive exchange rate of the Kip. In an effort to stimulate credit growth, the Bank of Lao PDR
also reduced the discount rate slightly in mid-2015 and introduced inflation-linked caps
on deposit and lending interest rates, which led to a reduction in both deposit and lend-
ing rates by about 3 percentage points to about 6 percent and 10 percent respectively by
end-2015. The reserve requirements remained unchanged while BOL credit to state-owned
enterprises remained unchanged. In response, credit growth accelerated slightly in the sec-
ond half of the year; however, at around 17 percent year-on-year in December 2015, credit
growth remained well below rates seen in earlier years. A significant part of the financial
sector, mostly some state-owned banks, may be facing declining capital buffers and dete-
riorating loan portfolios.

4.	       The current account deficit is estimated to have widened slightly to about 11.6
percent in 2015 as the increase in exports of parts and components and the lower import
bills of fuel were insufficient to offset the impact of lower copper and gold prices and slower
external demand (including the slowdown of timber export to China and Vietnam from very
high levels during the last two years). Still, financing needs are lower as a substantial part
of the imports (around 14 percent of GDP) are FDI-related (in the resource sector) and with
secured external financing. Significant external borrowing financed the rest of the current
account deficit and allowed for an increase in foreign reserves to almost US$ 990 million
in December 2015, covering around 2.2 months of imports of goods and services and about
30 percent of foreign currencies deposits. The level still implies limited buffers, particularly
in the context of tightly managed exchange rate of the kip to the US dollar.

5.	     Several important reforms were undertaken in 2015. The revised State Budget
Law, approved in December 2015, enhances the authority of the National Assembly in
budget oversight and Ministry of Finance in budget management. In addition, with regards
to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, the Government strengthened
key regulations (including on forfeiture of assets, border declaration, penalties for non-
compliant entities) recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which helped
remove Lao PDR from the FATF’s list of “jurisdictions not making sufficient progress”. The
outlook will depend on the progress in the implementation of the recommendations and
agreed measures. In the banking sector, the Bank of Lao PDR removed the minimum loan
size limit to be recorded in its credit registry database and expanded coverage of borrow-
ers. As a result, the country’s rank on the Doing Business getting credit indicator signifi-
cantly improved from 128th in 2015 to 70th in 20162.

    6.	      The near-term outlook remains favorable with growth projected at around 7 per-
    cent in 2016, but with some downside risks. Power generation is expected to increase by
    more than 30 percent compared to 2015. Recent trends in manufacturing are expected to
    continue while the liberalization of air transport is expected to give a boost to tourist ar-
    rivals. Fiscal expansion is expected as Lao PDR hosts ASEAN chairmanship events in 2016.
    The current account deficit is expected to narrow to about 10.4 percent of GDP with exports
    growing by about 7 percent as a jump in electricity export and continued export of parts
    and components to Thailand is expected to more than offset a risk of further slowdown in
    external demand for other exports. Imports bill growth are expected to remain contained
    as oil prices remain depressed in 2016. However, there are a number of downside risks. Ex-
    ternal risks come from faster-than-expected slowdown in China, prolonged weak growth
    in Thailand as well as further declines in commodity prices. China accounts for 25 percent
    of Lao PDR exports, and is among the top three largest source of FDI and among top-ten
    biggest sources of tourist arrivals, all of which will be affected by a sharper slowdown in
    China. Similar concerns apply to Thailand, which is also an important migrant destination
    and export market. The impact of the decline in commodity prices appears to have been
    contained, with the exception of rubber; however, further price declines may have a big-
    ger impact. Additionally, domestic economic risks remain elevated, including risks in the
    banking sector that some banks may continue to have limited capital buffers and poor loan
    portfolio.

    7.	      Similar trends are projected to continue during 2017-2018. GDP is expected to ex-
    pand at around 7 percent per annum as a healthy pipeline in the power sector keeps invest-
    ments strong and increases electricity production and exports by almost 40 percent. Sta-
    bilization of growth rates in China and some acceleration in Vietnam and Thailand should
    increase demand for Lao PDR exports. On the other hand, some gradual fiscal consolidation
    is expected, largely through broadening the revenue base and efforts to improve efficiency
    in spending and should help strengthen the outlook for public debt sustainability and lower
    the risk of debt distress from its current level of moderate, but borderline to high.

Thematic Section: Drivers of Poverty Reduction in Lao PDR3
8.	      Poverty in Lao PDR declined over the past decade. The Lao Expenditure and Con-
sumption Survey 2012/13 (LECS 5) showed that poverty declined from 33.5 percent in
2002/03 to 23.2 percent in 2012/13, helping Lao PDR achieve its MDG target of halving
extreme poverty by 2015. This translated into a 0.47 percent reduction in poverty for every
percentage point of GDP growth, one of the smallest in the East Asia and Pacific region
(with the exception of the Philippines). With growth patterns little changed since the last
official poverty measurement survey, the poverty rate may have declined further, but may
be at a pace less commensurate than economic growth, following the past pattern.

9.	     Among those who became non-poor, key factors pulling them out of poverty are
increasing education attainment and the move to non-farm jobs as well as better con-
nectivity. Complete primary education helped boost productivity in agriculture while lower
secondary education helped the transition into non-farm employment. This shows that the
increase in endowments and productive opportunities in non-farm sectors were key drivers
of poverty reduction. More recently, notable growth in services (such as trade and tourism)
and manufacturing sub-sectors as aforementioned, may have opened up more employ-
ment opportunities. In addition, better connectivity through road access in rural areas also
increased likelihood of reducing poverty in rural areas compared to rural area with no road
access. In this respect, the latest 2015 population census shows the share of rural popula-
tion with road access increased from 52 percent in 2005 to 59 percent in 2015 while the
share of urban population increased from 27 percent in 2005 to about 33 percent in the
same period. All in all, the recent trends imply that poverty may have further declined in
2015.

10.	   Nevertheless, the creation of productive jobs was less proportionate to the strong
economic growth. During 2003-2013, GDP more than doubled and employment increased
by 20 percent (or around 500,000 jobs) bringing total employment to about 3.1 million.
With significant part of the population having access to subsistence farming, the official
unemployment rate remained very low. However, only about 80 percent of jobs created
were non-farm jobs and 17 percent of these were in the public sector. Most of the jobs cre-
ated were in wholesale and retail trade, characterized by low technology and productivity.
The agriculture sector provided jobs for 64 percent of the employed in 2013, down from 73
percent a decade earlier. Around 10.5 percent of jobs were in the trade sector, up from 8.2
percent in 2003. Manufacturing accounted for 7 percent of employment, only marginally
up from 6.2 percent a decade ago, while public services provided jobs for 6.1 percent of the
employed workforce.

     11.	    The pace of poverty reduction and inclusiveness was less commensurate to the
     rate economic growth. With the capital intensive resource sectors creating few jobs and
     a relatively slower pace of new job creation in the non-farm and non-resource sectors, the
     growth model did not translate into a broad-based proportional increase in households’ in-
     come and consumption. Consequently, consumption per capita increased by only 2 percent
     per year lagging behind the annual GDP per capita growth of almost 6 percent. Even this
     small increase in consumption benefited the non-poor population more than the poor as the
     consumption of the richest group increased by 2.4 percent compared to only 1.3 percent of
     the poorest population. As a result, inequality increased with the Gini coefficient increas-
     ing from 32.5 in 2002/03 to 36.2 in 2012/13. In this regard, while poverty has declined, the
     pace appears to lag compared to some other resource-rich countries such as Uzbekistan,
     Tajikistan, Mongolia and Chile that employ effective redistribution policies.

     12.	    In addition, the vulnerability of falling back into poverty is high, particularly due to
     agriculture and health shocks as well as a lack of adequate safety nets. The observed con-
     sumption growth pushed those escaping poverty only slightly above the poverty line, where
     the risk of sliding back into poverty is high. Actually, half of the poor people in 2012/13 were
     non-poor five years earlier. Households, especially in agriculture, are vulnerable to shocks
     from farm produce price fluctuations, loss of land and adverse weather conditions. In addi-
     tion, with just 20 percent of the population covered by health insurance (mostly public and
     private sector wage workers), health shocks and catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures
     pose a significant risk to households’ welfare. Finally, low financial inclusion and the ab-
     sence of adequate safety nets limit the ability of households to mitigate risks.

     13.	    Going forward, improvement in productivity in agriculture and non-farm sectors
     as well as off-farm job creation is essential to raising household income and therefore to
     reducing poverty. In addition, putting in place social safety nets such as insurance pro-
     grams will help improve people’s resilience against shocks.

PART I: RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

GROWTH
1.	     Lao PDR has been one of the fastest growing economies in the East Asia and Pa-
cific region, to a significant degree propelled by the natural resource sectors. GDP ex-
panded at an average growth rate of 7.8 percent per annum over the last decade with es-
timated GNI per capita reaching US$1,730 in 2015 and making Lao PDR a lower middle
income country. In response to buoyant external demand, the resource sector attracted
strong foreign investments. A mining “boom” began in 2005 with the start of exploitation
at the Sepon mine (copper cathode and gold) followed by the commissioning of the Phu Bia
mine (copper concentrate and gold); though, the 2007-2008 global crisis and weaknesses
in the regulatory environment dampened growth prospects from which the sector is yet
to recover. Around the same time, the power sector started its robust export-led expan-
sion as investors began to tap into the ample hydro potential to meet demand from the
fast growing region. By 2016, the installed capacity reached around 6,000MW, a ten-fold
increase from a decade earlier. More recently, Lao PDR was able to attract investments in
real estate development, trade and manufacturing; however, compared to regional peers,
the extent of structural transformation (both in terms of GDP structure and employment)
remained limited, largely due to weak performance of agriculture and manufacturing. Ser-
vices and construction account for 48 percent of GDP and 26 percent of employment4, but
remain characterized by low technology and productivity. Industry, excluding the mining
and power sectors, accounts for about 9 percent of GDP with 7 percent of employment.

2.	     In 2015, the Lao economy expanded by an estimated 7 percent, a slight modera-
tion from 7.5 percent in 2014 (Figure 1). Power generation got a boost from the commis-
sioning of the first two blocks of the 1,878 MW Hongsa lignite power plant and an additional
250-300MW of installed capacity in the hydro sector (Figure 2, 3).5 Construction remained
robust as capital inflows (FDI and loans) into the power sector and real estate develop-
ment stayed resilient. Furthermore, despite lower global commodity prices, mining output
increased by 5 percent for copper (from 159,676 tons in 2014 to 167,700 tons in 2015) and
30 percent for gold (from 168,000 oz in 2014 to 221,000 oz in 2015) as global prices still
remained above the cost recovery levels (Figure 4). Still, export earnings from mining are
estimated to have declined by about 9 percent in 2015.

     3.	      Importantly, some non-resource sectors posted strong performance. Manufactur-
     ing and exports of parts and components increased, albeit from a low base and much reliance
     on imported content, as Lao PDR was able to attract a few companies that relocated part of their
     production from other countries in the region to special economic zones in Lao PDR (see Box 1).
     Tourist arrivals, mostly from the region, remained strong at 13 percent growth year-on-year in
     2015 partly attributable to improved air transport connectivity. For instance, the number of ar-
     rivals at the Wattay International Airport increased by about 60 percent from a year earlier, with
     Korean nationals accounting for the biggest share of the increase facilitated by more frequent
     direct Vientiane-Incheon flights as well as new routes to some China cities, Singapore and Malay-
     sia. However, this was partially offset by slower external demand (including for timber), stronger
     control on public spending as well as lower output in agriculture due to unfavorable weather and
     lower prices.

    Box 1: Special Economic Zones in Lao PDR

    The special and specific economic zones (SEZs) have long been promoted but recently
    some manufacturing sub-sectors start to emerge. There are more than 10 SEZs with
    about 200 registered business units at varied stages of development across the coun-
    try with focus mostly on services sector (e.g. entertainment services, logistics) fol-
    lowed by industry (manufacturing) and commerce. Most businesses are foreign owned
    and relocated to Lao PDR from neighboring countries (Figure 5), due to relatively lower
    wages, government incentives and perceived political stability. To date, there are more
    than 11,000 workers employed in the SEZs, out of which about 60 percent are foreign
    workers (Figure 6).

    Over the last few years, Lao PDR was able to attract a number of multinational com-
    panies, including Nikon, Essilor, Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Polycom, which resulted in
    rapid growth in the assembly and equipment parts sectors, albeit from a low base. The
    export of equipment parts (such as camera parts) has emerged and increased from
    a low base in 2013 to about US$ 300 million in 20156. While production relies on im-
    ported intermediate inputs to a significant degree, the growth of the sector does show
    that Lao PDR can effectively participate in regional and global value chains, a feature
    that was lacking so far in the country’s growth model. While a large proportion of labor
    in all zones are foreign, a few zones (such as Savanh-Seno and VITA park that focus on
    manufacturing exports as part of the regional supply chain) mostly hire Lao workers
    (Figure 6).

     4.	     On the expenditure side, growth continued to be driven by consumption, which
     was partially offset by a slight moderation in investments, public consumption and wid-
     ening trade deficit. Data limitation prevents precise estimation of GDP by expenditure.
     Nevertheless, private consumption increased as reflected by a robust consumer sentiment
     index7 in 2015 (Figure 7) as well as strong household electricity consumption growth (11
     percent year-on-year). Tight management of the wage-bill limited the contribution of gov-
     ernment consumption. A lower business sentiment index, though still in expansionary terri-
     tory, suggests that investments have moderated from very high levels in earlier years. Still,
     investment remain strong as a number of power projects are still under construction and
     as a few companies relocated their investments to Lao PDR, particularly in the special eco-
     nomic zones. Net real exports were a drag on GDP growth as the real export declined faster
     (due to agriculture, particularly timber offsetting an increase in power and equipment parts
     exports) than real imports (increased fuel demand was partly offset by a decline in demand
     for electrical machinery and equipment due to completion of some power projects).

5.	     Lao PDR’s growth model has produced strong GDP growth rates, but has done less
well on sharing the benefits of growth. With an average growth rate of around 7.8 percent
per annum over the last decade, Lao PDR has been the second fastest growing economy in
ASEAN and among the World’s 15 fastest growing economies. Still, growth was, to a large
degree, driven by natural resources which are capital intensive and create fewer jobs, while
low productivity in agriculture and weak performance in manufacturing limited the income
generating opportunities for most Lao people. Lao PDR had around 2 million adults engaged
in agriculture, representing 64 percent of the country’s workforce and making Lao PDR
one of the most agrarian economy in East Asia. Productivity in the sector is low and, more
worryingly, has not increased significantly. In 2014, average agricultural value added per
hectare (in 2005 US$ prices) was US$578, compared to US$994 in Thailand and US$1,380
in Vietnam. At the same time, a difficult business environment (Lao PDR is ranked 134th out
of 189 economies on the 2016 Ease of Doing Business rankings) hampers investment, keeps
firms small and informal, which limits job creation. This, combined with still not universal
coverage with some basic services (public health, water supply and sanitation etc.) keeps
malnutrition rates high. While there are some signs that the situation may be improving
more recently, making growth pro-poor remains a priority. Improving agriculture produc-
tivity and putting in place a business environment that will be streamlined and effectively
implemented can help in raising incomes and creating jobs. All in all, while poverty rates in
Lao PDR declined, the pace was considerably slower than other regional peers such as Cam-
bodia and other resource rich countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Mongolia and Chile
where greater poverty reduction is achieved through effective use of redistribution policies.
Part II of this edition of the Lao Economic Monitor provides a more detailed discussion on
the drivers of poverty reduction in Lao PDR.

     INFLATION
     6.	      Lower oil and commodity prices kept inflationary pressures low during 2015 and
     so far in 2016. The consumer price inflation averaged 1.3 percent in 2015, down from 4.2
     percent a year earlier. Inflation declined further to 0.8 percent (year-on-year) in January
     and picked up slightly to 1.1 percent in March 2016 (Figure 8). Retail fuel prices reached
     their lowest level in six years with a 26 percent year-on-year decline in March 2016, mir-
     roring loosely the 29 percent decline in the global crude oil price in the same period (Figure
     10). Lower fuel prices are likely to benefit consumers, given that fuel accounts for 8 percent
     of consumption basket. As global crude oil price are projected to remain depressed in 2016,
     the low inflationary pressure on the domestic retail fuel prices and the overall price level is
     likely to persist.

     7.	     Food prices picked up, potentially in response to lower yields due to adverse
     weather. Food inflation peaked at 5.5 percent (y-o-y) in October 2015 before retreating to
     4.7 percent in March 2016 (Figure 9). The average food inflation was 4.6 percent in 2015
     and about 4.7 percent during January-March 2016. This was still lower than the 7 percent
     average food inflation recorded in 2014 as a slower increase in meat prices (higher import of
     live animals in early 2016 may have lowered price pressures) offset the growing vegetable
     and rice prices, partly due to unfavorable weather conditions and the base effect from the
     previous year.

     8.	     The slight moderation of economic activity also kept core inflation low. Core in-
     flation, excluding fuel and food, remained stable at an average of 1.8 percent in 2015 and
     slightly fell to 1.7 percent during January-March 2016. During the first quarter of 2016,
     prices for restaurants and hotels experienced slightly slower growth (2.8 percent compared
     to about 3 percent a year ago) while an increase in housing, water, electricity and gas prices
     was much slower (1.8 percent compared to 9.2 percent a year earlier) due to upward adjust-
     ment in electricity and water supply tariffs last year.

     FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS

     9.	     The fiscal deficit in FY14/15 is estimated to have declined slightly from the previ-
     ous fiscal year supported by control on expenditure growth and stronger efforts to in-
     crease non-resource revenues. The fiscal deficit in FY14/15 is estimated to have declined
     slightly to 3.7 percent of GDP from 3.8 percent of GDP in FY13/14 (Figure 11). With revenues
     related to commodity prices and grants declining, the reduction in the deficit was attribut-
     able to strengthening of revenue administration, particularly VAT and profit tax but also
     tighter expenditure measures to control wages and public recruitment. Despite falling min-
     ing revenues, the non-mining fiscal balance (fiscal balance including grants but without
     mining revenues) declined to 5.3 percent of GDP in FY14/15 from 5.8 percent in FY13/14.
     Direct financing by the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL)8 appears to have declined compared to the
     previous fiscal year as the Government adopted a decision to limit financing only to on-
     going projects and stopped new off-budget projects (Figure 23). The stock of BOL direct
     lending to state-owned enterprises (with some elements of off-budget spending) reached
     US$796 million at the end of 2015, or about 6.3 percent of GDP compared to 7.7 percent
     back in 2011. This marks a considerable reduction in the pace of financing compared to few
     years ago, when direct lending was growing by more than 1 percent of GDP per annum. The
     authorities have also made some important steps towards strengthening the legal frame-
     work for public financial management by revising the State Budget Law (SBL), which was
     approved by the National Assembly in December 2015, and formulating a long-term fiscal
     strategy (See Box 2).

       Direct financing by the Bank of Lao PDR has elements of off-budget spending and is added to the overall fiscal
     position. This is recorded as BOL lending to state-owned enterprises in the Monetary Survey.

10.	     Total revenues increased only marginally in FY14/15 compared to the previous fis-
cal year as important revenue sources came under pressure from lower commodity prices
and as foreign grants declined. The modest increase brought the revenues short of plan by
5 percent and as percent of GDP down to 23 percent in FY14/15 (about US$2.8 billion) from
24 percent a year earlier (Figure 12). Strengthened revenue collection helped boost VAT and
profit tax through improved enforcement of regulations and more modalities in tax pay-
ment. However, the lower value of imports and oil prices kept customs and excise taxes flat.
The mining revenues are estimated to fall by about 10 percent (from about US$220 million
in FY13/14 ) as gold and copper prices declined by almost 8 percent and 20 percent, respec-
tively, in 2015. Grants fell by 13 percent year-on-year (from US$650 million in FY13/14 to
US$560 million in FY14/15) as some donor financed projects were completed and disburse-
ments on others was below plans.

11.	     In response to the revenue shortfall, the authorities also limited expenditure
growth. Total expenditures slightly rose but were still about 6 percent below budgeted lev-
els. At around US$3.2 billion, expenditures were 26.6 percent of GDP in FY14/15, down from
28 percent of GDP in FY13/14. Public wage bill declined from 9.3 percent to GDP to 8.7
percent in FY14/15 (due to continuation of the wage freeze and control on public recruit-
ment (about 5,000 new positions were authorized in FY14/15 compared to 10,000-15,000
in earlier fiscal years). In addition, some under-execution of investment spending as well as
lower quasi-fiscal spending helped contain capital expenditure growth. Recent information
on planned and actual spending by sectors is not available to enable sectoral breakdown
analysis.

22   Lao Economic Monitor May 2016



     12.	    The fiscal deficit was financed largely by external borrowing. Project loans (of
     about US$320 million or about 3 percent of GDP) as well as bond issuance at the Thai capi-
     tal market (US$365 million in 2, 5 and 10 years bonds or about 3 percent of GDP) largely fi-
     nanced the deficit. An additional issuance of US$ 182 million (in 10 and 12 years maturities)
     was issued in December 2015. The increase in project loans, supported by bilateral borrow-
     ing, were mostly associated with financing the Government’s share in power projects such
     as Nam Khan 2, Nam Khan 3, Xayaboury and Hongsa Lignite projects while spending on
     other non-resource infrastructure projects were slightly under plan. This brought Lao PDR’s
     total public debt to about US$ 7.7 billion or 65 percent of GDP in 20159. The 3-year bonds
     issued in FY12/13 is maturing in FY15/16 and is expected to be rolled-over through further
     external borrowing.


         Box 2: The authorities’ effort in strengthening public financial management

         The implementation of recently adopted legislation should strengthen public financial
         management arrangements in Lao PDR. The State Budget Law (SBL), implemented
         since 2006, was recently revised and approved by the National Assembly in December
         2015. The revised law, to be implemented as of 2017, enhances the authority of the Na-
         tional Assembly in budget oversight as well as the authority of the Ministry of Finance
         in budget management. In addition, it introduces a new way of budget allocation will
         take into account roles and responsibilities of the budget units, number of civil serv-
         ants, population size, poverty status, geography and socio-economic characteristics
         of the local area, which is expected to improve budget targeting. The revised law also
         puts in place a new timetable for budget preparation and requires presentation of an-
         nual and medium term budget and public debt framework to the National Assembly
         which should result in a more credible budget preparation process.

         In addition, the authorities have been working on a Long-term Fiscal Development
         Strategy to be adopted in 2016. The objectives of the Strategy include i) maintain-
         ing macro-economic stability and low inflation rate; ii) developing revenue-expendi-
         ture management policy and arrangements for the State Budget, iii) modernizing debt
         management and budget financing in accordance with international standards; iv)
         enhancing effectiveness of State budget expenditure, the coordination between the
         central and local levels; and lastly adopting end enforcing adequate financial control
         framework to ensure financial discipline. Several rounds of consultations have taken
         place.

13.	    The still unresolved issue of public sector arrears may mean that the total public
debt stock could be understated. Domestic public debt (as borrowing from the banking
sector) was estimated around 7.6 percent of GDP at end 2015. However, the issue of public
sector arrears continues to linger on, suggesting that domestic public debt may be higher
than officially reported. The actual stock of arrears remains unclear with significant differ-
ences in numbers reported by various Government agencies. The implementing decree for
the FY14/15 Budget stated that about 35 percent of the budget users’ annual allocation for
domestic investment spending should be used for arrears settlement for completed public
investment projects. An inter-Ministerial Committee has been setup to validate the arrears
and the Government’s inspection services have taken steps to investigate fraudulent cases.
In order to strengthen the coordination between Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Plan-
ning and Investment as well as monitoring of public investment spending, there are plans
to establish a new public investment management division under the Ministry of Finance to
supervise the planning and disbursements of the investment spending.

14.	    Lao PDR has increasingly turned to bilateral borrowing and less concessional
sources to finance its budget and investment in resource projects. Most less-concessional
bilateral borrowing, particularly from China and Thailand, goes to financing equity stakes
in revenue generating projects in the power sector, and general Government budget financ-
ing in the case of bond issuance. As a result, the share of bilateral creditors in the external
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt stock increased to about 60 percent of total ex-
ternal PPG in 2015 from about 57 percent in 2012 while commercial borrowing increased to
about 14 percent from none in the same period. Growing reliance on non-concessional bor-
rowing will have implications for debt service obligations. Currently Lao PDR spends around
2.1 percent of GDP on debt servicing (both interest and principal); however, this is likely to
increase fast, especially as bonds begin to mature. Furthermore, while Lao PDR has so far
received healthy demand for its debt, the limited access (only the Thai capital market) ex-
poses the country to risks from more significant turbulence which cannot be rule-out in the
current external environment.

15.	    Further increases in the public debt and shift towards non-concessional debt may
test the solvency of fiscal accounts in the future. During the 2014 Debt Sustainability
Analysis, Lao PDR was already classified as being at moderate, but borderline to high, risk
of debt distress10 and increases in public debt are already increasing the cost of debt ser-
vicing. Total public debt reached 7.7 billion or 65 percent of GDP in 2015. External debt ser-
vice (interest and amortization repayments) increased by more than 60 percent to about
US$250 million in FY14/15 (2.1 percent of GDP) from US$150 million (about 1.7 percent of
GDP in FY12/13) three years ago. Therefore, it would be important to put in place policies
that will lead to stabilization of the public debt burden and its gradual reduction consistent
with fiscal sustainability level. This will require gradual fiscal consolidation through improv-
ing revenue collection and improved efficiency in public spending.

EXTERNAL SECTOR
16.	    The current account deficit is estimated to have slightly widened due to weaker
external demand and commodity prices. The trade balance widened as lower external de-
mand (including for timber export to neighboring countries) and the fall in metal prices
more than offset the impact of the falling fuel price over imports. On the other hand, robust
tourism proceeds (around US$600 million) are expected to have kept the services account
in surplus. The impact of lower profit repatriation by FDI (largely the two copper mines)
over the income account may have been offset by higher cost of debt financing. As a result,
the current account deficit is estimated to slightly widen to 11.6 percent in 2015 from 11.2
percent a year ago. The deficit was financed by FDI inflows mostly in the power sector and
more external borrowing allowing for a slight increase in reserves by year end.

17.	    Merchandise exports to the three main export destinations11 are estimated to
have declined by about 10 percent. Lao PDR mainly trades with Thailand, China and Vi-
etnam, with China having an increasing influence on the external balance and the overall
economy (Box 3). Exports to these markets fell to US$3.7 billion in 2015 driven by a fall in
agricultural export earnings, including a welcomed reduction in exports of timber to China
and Vietnam from very high levels in the past two years as well as declining mining exports
due to lower gold and copper prices (this despite higher output). Average 2015 copper and
gold prices declined by 20 percent and 8 percent respectively offsetting the copper and
gold output increase of about 5 percent (159,676 tons in 2014 to 167,700 tons in 2015) and
30 percent (from 168,000 oz in 2014 to 221,000 oz in 2015), respectively. As a result, min-
ing export earnings declined by about 9 percent from a year earlier to about US$1.2 billion.
Power export were largely flat as the export from two blocks of the Hongsa Lignite power
plant helped offset the under-plan hydropower exports due to lower water flows. Power ex-
port to Thailand, the main market, increased by 4 percent in volume while remained flat at
about US$577 million in 2015). On the other hand, importantly, the exports of manufactur-
ing, especially equipment parts to Thailand surged to around US$300 million in 2015 from
US$150 million a year earlier, although so far contained to a handful of companies located
in two Special Economic Zones (See Box 1).

     18.	    Imports also fell but to a smaller extent largely due to lower fuel prices and im-
     ports of electrical machineries and equipment parts from China. The completion of some
     larger projects, including the Hongsa Lignite power plant reduced the imports of invest-
     ment goods by around 25 percent in 2015. Oil price also fell by 47 percent year-on-year in
     2015. Given that fuel accounts for about 20 percent of Lao PDR’s imports, the low oil prices
     have potentially benefited local producers.

     19.	    Robust FDI inflows and foreign borrowing allowed for some increase in foreign ex-
     change reserves. Capital inflows (FDI and loans) remained resilient reflected in investments
     in the pipeline of power projects and real estate development, and external borrowing (bond
     issuance) also helped boost reserves. The reserves reached almost US$990 million in De-
     cember 2015, higher than the same period last year by US$ 170 million, but lower than peak
     in June 2015 by 16 percent (when reserves got a boost from the inflows of funds from bond
     issuance in FY14/15). The reserve level is estimated to cover around 2.2 months of imports
     of goods and services, less than 30 percent of foreign currency deposits and only about 13
     percent of broad money. Excluding FDI-financed resource sector imports, reserves are esti-
     mated to cover 3.4 months of non-resource imports. The indicators further improve when
     taking into consideration the foreign assets of commercial banks; however, they still imply
     substantial vulnerability in the external balances particularly in an environment of growing
     external economic uncertainty and tightly managed exchange rate policy. A stronger re-
     serves cover, supported with gradual fiscal consolidation can increase the cushion against
     shocks and is critical for maintaining resilience and macroeconomic stability.

Box 3: Influence of China on the Lao Economy

Lao PDR has strong economic relations with China as the latter is the second largest
trading partner and among the top investors and creditors to Lao PDR. To some ex-
tent, the uncertainty and a risk of slowdown in the Chinese economy appear to have
some direct and indirect impacts on Lao PDR, particularly through trade and commod-
ity prices.

Trade and Tourism

China is Lao PDR’s second largest trading partner, accounting for about 25 percent
of total trade. China supplies a significant part of capital imports to Lao PDR and is a
market for a large part of Lao PDR’s agriculture, timber and mining exports. Accord-
ing to China trade statistics, trade flows with Lao PDR declined by about 28 percent
in 2015 from the previous year, with timber import from Lao PDR declining from a
high base last year and lower mining earnings affected by lower commodity prices,
while imports also fell partly due to the completion of large power projects that re-
quired capital imports from China, including Hongsa Lignite project. On services ex-
port, China has emerged as one of the top ten sources of tourism revenue for Lao PDR.
Chinese tourists accounted for 12 percent of tourists visiting Lao PDR in three quarters
of 2015, more than 46 percent increase compared to a year ago, despite a slowdown
of the Chinese economy.

       Investment

       China is one of Lao PDR’s biggest investors in various sectors. These include owner-
       ship of the two largest copper/gold mines (through Australian-managed companies),
       investments in energy, agriculture, banking and trade as well as construction of com-
       mercial real estates. For instance, many power projects are either partly or entirely
       financed by Chinese investment. This partly explains the growing number of Chinese
       bank branch establishments and their increasing assets in Lao PDR in recent years.
       Chinese labor is also engaged on large investment projects such as those in the power
       sector and infrastructure construction as well as real estate projects, while some mi-
       grated to Lao PDR for trading opportunities. The slowdown of the Chinese economy
       may effect some potential investment on some pipeline projects that do not yet have
       secured financing.

       External Debt

       Lao PDR runs a sizeable current account deficit which is financed by robust invest-
       ments (mostly in its power sector) as well as increased borrowing, with China being
       both an important investor as well as creditor. Total public debt outstanding has in-
       creased to reach about 65 percent of GDP. Out of public external debt, China accounts
       for about 44 percent by 2015 compared to 35 percent three years ago. The funding is
       mostly channeled to infrastructure and power projects. With the discussion on large
       infrastructure projects going forward, the role of Chinese investment in and lending to
       Lao PDR could scale up.

EXCHANGE RATE
20.	 The authorities continued the policy of maintaining the stability of the Kip by
tightly managing the exchange rate of the kip against the US$. In line with the Bank of
Lao PDR key objective of maintaining the stability of the local currency, the kip depreciated
by only 1 percent against the US dollar in 2015 compared to the previous year average,
without more significant fluctuations throughout the year. With the regional currencies de-
preciating against the US dollar, the kip appreciated against the Thai baht by 8 percent
year-on-year by December and the Vietnamese dong by 6 percent in the same period, for
instance. Similar trends continued in early 2016. By the end of February 2016, the kip de-
preciated by 0.3 percent against the US dollar while it appreciated against the Thai baht by
9 percent compared to a year ago.

21.	    In an environment of low inflationary pressures both in Lao PDR and in the region,
the real effective exchange rate continued to appreciate. The real effective exchange rate
appreciated by 11 percent year-on-year in November 2015, adding further to the overvalu-
ation of the kip. The continued real appreciation, in addition to the supply side constraints,
reduces the competitiveness of Lao PDR’s exports; though with a minimum wage of around
US$115/ per month, labor costs appear to be still competitive.

     MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
     22.	 Credit growth picked up slightly in the second half of the year potentially as a
     result of BOL’s measures to lower the policy rates and cap commercial banks’ interest
     rates. Following credit growth rates of close to 60 percent in mid-2012, the rate of lend-
     ing gradually moderated, reaching about 11 percent in June 2015. In response, the authori-
     ties adopted a few measures in order to stimulate credit expansion. First, BOL lowered the
     policy rate in July 2015 to 4.5 percent from 5 percent, the first correction since 201012.
     Subsequently in August, this was followed by the setting of (inflation-linked) caps on de-
     posit and lending rates for kip. Under the new regulation, the maximum rate on kip deposits
     should be at most 2 percentage points higher than the inflation in the previous year while
     the lending rate can be at most 4 percentage points higher compared to the deposit rate. As
     a result, kip deposit and lending rates for one year maturity declined from almost 9 percent
     and 13 percent in 2014 to 6.13 percent and almost 10 percent at end 2015, respectively. In
     response, the growth rate of time and saving deposits in kip moderated from 25 percent
     in June to about 18 percent in December. The credit to deposit ratio is well below 1, though
     most deposits remain short-term and limit banks’ ability to provide longer-term loans.

     23.	 The increased lending to the industrial sector offset the contraction in lending
     to construction. Commercial bank lending to the economy increased by 20 percent year-
     on-year in September 2015, with half of the increase coming from lending to the industry,
     followed by commerce (retail and wholesale trade) sector. At the same time, exposure to
     construction declined with negative growth in September 2015, which could be due to the
     stronger control on public spending and the attempts to deal with off-budget spending.

     12
         BOL lowered the policy rates from 5% for loans with less than 1 week maturity, 6.25% for loans with matu-
     rity between one and two weeks, and 12.5% for loans with maturity of up to 1 year to 4.5%, 5.625% and 11.25%,
     respectively (www.bol.gov.la).

24.	 The banking sector expanded significantly with new foreign branches entering
the market and existing banks growing their portfolios. The banking sector assets grew
by about 57 percent from US$ 8 billion in 2013 to US$ 12 billion in 2015, making the ratio
of the banking sector assets to GDP rise from 70 percent in 2013 to about 95 percent in
2015. Such increase was driven by the entering of a number of foreign branches from China,
Taiwan, Malaysia and Thai banks, bringing the total number of banks to 40. As a result, the
share of foreign branches’ assets rose from about 18 percent in 2013 to 26 percent in 2015,
while the share of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) fell from 53 percent to 46 per-
cent in the same period. Nevertheless, the SOCBs still remain dominant, accounting for 47
percent of total bank lending in 2015. The capital buffers were reportedly much lower than
a prudential level for some state-owned banks, indicating that the sector is still at risk of
distress. Growing banking sector also poses a challenge to bank supervision.

     25.	 A few important reforms in the financial sector took place over the last year.
     With regards to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, the Government
     strengthened key regulations (including on forfeiture of assets, border declaration, penal-
     ties for non-compliant entities) and is planning to launch a National Risk Assessment as
     recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These helped removed Lao PDR
     from the FATF’s list of “jurisdiction not making sufficient progress”. The outlook will depend
     on the progress in the implementation of the recommendations and agreed measures.

     26.	   In addition, BOL removed the minimum loan size limit to be recorded in its credit
     registry and expanded coverage of borrowers. As a result, the country’s rank on the Do-
     ing Business getting credit indicator significantly improved from 128th in 2015 to 70th
     in 201613. While improved credit information infrastructure can help, making a stronger
     improvement in access to finance in Lao PDR would depend on the ability to put in place a
     business environment that will protect creditor rights and ensure effective enforcement of
     contracts.


     OUTLOOK
     27.	    GDP growth is projected to remain stable at around 7 percent in 2016. The 1,878
     MW Hongsa lignite power plant will fully come on stream this year and together with the
     output expected from other new power projects (around 500MW) will increase power gen-
     eration by more than 30 percent compared to 2015. In early 2016, power export to Thai-
     land increased by three folds from US$55 million during January-February 2015 to US$142
     million in the same period in 2016. In addition, the gradual liberalization of air traffic is ex-
     pected to facilitate more tourist arrivals. Some fiscal expansion (with the deficit projected
     to increase to 5.1 percent of GDP in FY15/16) and investment as Lao PDR chairs ASEAN in
     2016 will add to domestic demand. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to
     about 10.4 percent of GDP in 2016 from 11.6 percent in 2015 as power exports are projected
     to increase and recent trends in exports of parts and components continue while global oil
     prices are assumed to still be pressed in 2016. This will help import bills as fuel import ac-
     counts for about 20 percent of Lao PDR’s import.

     28.	    However, there are a number of downside risks. A slowdown in main trading part-
     ners such as China, with its projected deceleration from 6.9 in 2015 to 6.7 in 2016 and
     further down to average of 6.5 in the medium term and a scenario of Thailand’s slower-
     than-expected growth (migrant destination, investor and market for electricity exports)
     might affect trade and investment (Table 1). Additionally, domestic economic risks remain
     elevated, including systemic risks in the banking sector. Moreover, the situation of some
     state-owned banks may have deteriorated due to high non-performing loans and limited
     capital buffers. The 2014 Debt Sustainability Analysis suggested Lao PDR is at moderate,
     but borderline to high risk of debt distress. The weak enforcement of fiscal discipline, if
     continues, can result in growing public debt burden.
                                                              Lao Economic Monitor May 2016      33



29.	 In the medium term, strong, though more moderate, rates of expansion of the
power sector will continue to propel growth of around 7 percent. The challenge for Lao PDR
will potentially be to secure markets for its rapidly growing power generation and develop
the required transmission systems. During 2017-2020, the power sector is expected to be
the key growth engine with an average increase in power generation of above 15 percent
growth per year. The mining output is projected to remain flat as the main mines gradually
exhaust their deposits. The non-resource sector is expected to expand as rents from the re-
source sector trickle down into higher domestic demand and efforts on investment climate
reforms accelerate. The fiscal deficit is projected to gradually decline below 5 percent of
GDP as non-resource taxation is strengthened and public financial management improves.
Stronger power exports should help gradually narrow the external balance. The start of
some large infrastructure projects, including the Lao PDR section of the Kunming – Singa-
pore railway, can boost economic activities such as construction and help Lao PDR make
more of its location in the middle of the Indochina region. However, such large scale projects
need extensive evaluation of the economic and financial costs, particularly impacts on the
debt outlook, as well as environment and social impacts.

     PART II: DRIVERS OF POVERTY REDUCTION IN
     LAO PDR14
     1.	     Poverty in Lao PDR declined over the past decade. The Lao Expenditure and Con-
     sumption Survey 2012/13 (LECS 5) showed that poverty declined from 33.5 percent in
     2002/03 to 23.2 percent in 2012/13, helping Lao PDR achieve the MDG target of halving
     extreme poverty by 2015 (Figure 25). This translated into a 0.47 percent reduction in pov-
     erty for every percentage point of GDP growth, one of the smallest in the East Asia and
     Pacific region (with the exception of the Philippines). With growth patterns little changed
     since the last official poverty measurement survey, the poverty reduction rate may have
     declined further, but may still be at a pace slower than economic growth.

     2.	     Improvements in other socio-economic indicators provided further evidence that
     living standards of people improved (Figure 27). The number of households that lived in
     houses built with bricks or concrete and those living in houses with cement floors or floor
     tiles increased almost three folds compared to a decade earlier (41 percent in 2012/13
     compared to 14 percent in 2002/03). Nearly 80 percent of households were connected to
     electricity in 2012/13 and the proportion of households without any type of toilet almost
     halved (27 percent in 2012/13 compared to 50 percent in 2002/03). At the same time, net
     enrollment in lower secondary school increased to about 50 percent in 2012/13 from 26.8
     percent in 2002/03, but the increase was higher for the non-poor households than the poor
     households (See World Bank, 2014)15. Despite these improvements over time, Lao PDR con-
     tinues to lag the EAP average on most of these indicators.

Increases in endowments, primarily human capital and access to land coupled with non-
farm job creation were major drivers of poverty reduction.

3.	     Welfare gains were driven by increasing educational attainment and transition
to non-farm employment as well as better connectivity. The increase in education at-
tainment was especially critical in facilitating the transition to non-farm incomes and in
increasing returns to agriculture. Complete primary education was associated with higher
productivity in agriculture while lower secondary education facilitated the transition into
non-farm activities. Increases in endowments and productive opportunities were thus the
key drivers of poverty reduction. More recently, notable growth in services (such as trade
and tourism) and manufacturing sub-sectors as aforementioned, may have opened up
more employment opportunities. In addition, better connectivity through road access in
rural areas also increased likelihood of reducing poverty in rural areas by 10 percent com-
pared to rural area with no road access. In this respect, the latest 2015 population census
shows that the share of rural population with road access increased from 52 percent in
2005 to 59 percent in 2015 while the share of urban population increased from 27 percent
in 2005 to about 33 percent in the same period. All in all, the recent trends may imply that
poverty could have further declined in 2015.


4.	      Raising agriculture income is also an important driver of poverty reduction. De-
spite the declining share of agriculture in GDP to about 24 percent in 2015 from 35 percent
a decade ago and low productivity compared to regional peers, the sector remains impor-
tant as it provides work for 64 percent of the labor force (despite a fall from 73 percent in
2002/03) and accounted for 44 percent of the poverty reduction between 2003 and 2013.
A more productive agriculture sector will create new jobs in agribusiness sectors and fa-
cilitate the move of labor towards other sectors as well as improve livelihoods for the large
part of the population that will remain engaged in the sector. A third of farmers are already
above 40 years of age and with at most primary education. They are unlikely to transition
out of agriculture and will depend on agriculture income growth to move out of poverty.
With access to productive land being limited, a more sustainable path to raise agriculture
income should be through productivity improvement. The supply chain is not functioning
effectively, keeping prices for farmers low and for consumers high, reflecting both agricul-
ture-specific as well as economy-wide constraints to doing business. As a start, provid-
ing more education to farmers has the potential to achieve higher productivity (Table 2).
Furthermore, a transition away from a focus on rice self-sufficiency to competitiveness of
rice-based farming systems is needed. More and smarter government programs (extension
services, quality seeds and fertilizers etc.) and market-friendly agricultural policy can fa-
cilitate this shift.

     However, despite overall reduction in poverty at the national level, progress varied across
     population groups and regions

     5.	     As overall poverty declined, the pattern was uneven. Poverty was substantially
     higher in rural areas, at 28.6 percent, compared to 10 percent in urban areas. Such gap wid-
     ened over the past five years as poverty in urban areas declined faster. Poverty was higher
     among ethnic groups. Lao Tai accounted for 55 percent of the poor, while Chine-Tibet ethnic
     group did relatively better. Poverty was also higher among households whose household
     head had lower education levels and those who mainly relied on agriculture for income as
     well as those unemployed. Geographically, poverty generally declined in the north (except
     Bokeo) and central, but increased overall in the south, particularly Saravan and Champa-
     sack. The more number of poor people did not necessarily live in provinces with highest
     poverty rate. As a result, the uneven pattern of poverty reduction progress caused rising
     inequality, which was shown in an increase in the Gini coefficient from 35.0 in 2007/08 to
     36.2 in 2012/13.

In addition, faster poverty reduction could have been achieved had growth been more
broad-based.

6.	      Very few productive jobs were created, despite the strong economic growth.
During 2003-2013, GDP more than doubled and employment increased by 20 percent (or
around 500,000 jobs) bringing total employment to about 3.1 million. With significant part
of the population having access to subsistence farming, the official unemployment rate
remained very low. However, only about 80 percent of jobs created were non-farm jobs and
17 percent of these were in the public sector. Most of the jobs created were in wholesale and
retail trade, characterized by low technology and productivity. The agriculture sector pro-
vided jobs for 64 percent of the employed in 2013, down from 73 percent a decade earlier.
Around 10.5 percent of jobs were in the trade sector, up from 8.2 percent in 2003. Manu-
facturing accounted for 7 percent of employment, only marginally up from 6.2 percent a
decade ago, while public services provided jobs for 6.1 percent of the employed workforce.
While more recent information is not available, anecdotal evidence suggests that the move
towards non-farm jobs may have accelerated in recent years, especially with the emerging
manufacturing sector as well as the continued expansion in services.

7.	     Equally important, when good jobs were created, firms complain about inadequate
skills of the labor force. The 2014 Lao PDR Development Report found that many workers
lack foundational skills such as the ability to read. Without these foundational skills, work-
ers struggle even in the most basic jobs and teaching them more skills is challenging. In ad-
dition, high prevalence of malnutrition and stunting and, in general, the poor health status
of the population limit the economic potential of workers, even from their young age.

     8.	     The pace of poverty reduction was slow compared to the relatively high economic
     growth. Poverty declined by just 0.47 percent for every 1 percent increase in GDP per capita
     between 2007/8 and 2012/13 – quite low compared to surrounding countries like Cambo-
     dia and Vietnam but also Indonesia. As the robust growth of the Lao economy has been
     led by the natural resource sectors, which are capital intensive and created few jobs, such
     growth pattern did not translate into broad employment creation and a commensurate
     increase in household consumption. Therefore, such pattern disproportionately benefited
     the non-poor, resulting in a smaller decline in poverty compared to a scenario if it had been
     equitably distributed across all income groups. Average consumption per capita grew by
     2.2 percent per year between 2002/3 and 2012/13, almost three times less than the rate
     of economic growth. Even this small increase in consumption benefited the non-poor more
     than the poor population as the consumption of the richest group increased by 2.4 percent
     compared to only 1.3 percent of the poorest group. As a result, Lao PDR had one of the low-
     est growth elasticities of poverty in the South East Asia region (Figure 28). It also compares
     less favorably to some other resource rich countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Mongo-
     lia and Chile that employ effective redistribution policies.

9.	     Poverty could have declined by more had a large number of vulnerable households
not fallen back into poverty. About half of the poor in 2012/13 were previously non-poor in
2007/08 and more than two thirds of them had been non-poor at some point during that
10 year period. Many people escaping poverty remained close to the poverty line where
vulnerability is high. About 80 percent of the population in 2012/13 still lived on less than
PPP 2005 $2.5 per day and faced at least a 10 percent chance of falling into poverty in
subsequent periods. Such vulnerabilities are induced from various shocks.

Agriculture shocks and health shocks are main drivers of household vulnerability

10.	     The losses in welfare were driven by agriculture shocks, mainly in the form of food
price changes and loss of land, and to some extent catastrophic health expenditures. The
observed consumption growth pushed those escaping poverty only slightly above the pov-
erty line, where the risks of sliding back into poverty is high. Actually, half of the poor people
in 2012/13 were non-poor five years earlier. There are more net sellers than net buyers of
rice in Lao PDR, especially in the rice surplus areas in the center and the south, therefore an
increase in the price of rice has a net benefit while a decrease results in a net aggregate loss
in welfare. The drop in prices in 2012/13 compared to 2007/8 thus had a negative welfare
impact in the center and the south. The loss of land impacted urban dwellers who supple-
ment their non-farm incomes with farming, which serves as a strong reminder that produc-
tivity at the entry level in the non-farm sector is not yet high enough to sustain livelihoods
of poorly skilled people to completely transition out of agriculture. Vulnerability is highest
among ethnic groups, some of whom (the Monkhmer and Hmong-Lu-Mien) are twice likely
to fall back into poverty than other groups. In addition, with just 20 percent of the popula-
tion covered by health insurance (mostly public and private sector wage workers), health
shocks and catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures pose a significant risk to households’
welfare. Finally, low financial inclusion and the absence of adequate safety nets limit the
ability of households to mitigate risks.
40   Lao Economic Monitor May 2016



     Looking ahead, higher poverty reduction in Lao PDR can be achieved by improving pro-
     ductivity, creating better economic opportunities for both the poor and non-poor, and by
     strengthening the social protection system.


     11.	    Growth in agriculture incomes is still an important pillar for reducing poverty.
     Many people engaged in agriculture, especially the less educated mid-aged, will remain in
     the sector for the foreseeable future. Raising agriculture income is the main pathway out of
     poverty for them. This will require i) lowering marketing costs through public investments
     and better regulations and supporting open trade policies to uplift farm prices and increase
     the profitability of farming, ii) focusing on increasing productivity more through production
     methods and labor skills as further land expansion, which was the driver for growth in ag-
     riculture, could be unsustainable iii) improving human capital of farmers through training
     and agricultural extension services to allow the majority of less educated farmers to catch
     up with more educated farmers in raising their productivity.

     12.	    Promoting greater resilience, especially in the agricultural sector, through im-
     proved social safety nets and insurance will be important for ensuring the sustainability
     of poverty reduction going forward. Key areas of focus should be i) increasing resilience in
     agriculture since farming households are twice as likely to fall back into poverty than non-
     farming households, ii) strengthening social insurance – especially on health insurance or
     universal access to health care, iii) putting in place social welfare programs that target the
     vulnerable and the chronically poor and iv) deepening financial inclusion to expand options
     available for households to cope with shocks.

     13.	     In the meantime, job creation, stimulating productivity growth and improving the
     quality of jobs in the non-farm sector is also a key pathway for reducing poverty in Lao
     PDR. This can be achieved by creating a vibrant labor intensive non-farm sectors, espe-
     cially in services and manufacturing by improving the regulatory and business environ-
     ment where Lao PDR is the second lowest ranked within the region, while in the meantime
     continue to invest in education in order to prepare human capital to take up created oppor-
     tunities. In order to attract more investments that will generate more non-farm jobs and
     wage income, an improved business environment and higher productivity in the non-farm
     sectors are necessary. Higher wage earning coupled with improved productivity can reduce
     the impact on competitiveness. In addition, further investment in education is needed to
     provide people with the pre-requisite skills to obtain non-farm jobs rewarding enough to
     keep them out of poverty and alleviate the skills constraints that have also hampered firm
     growth.
