This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

procedures are those that apply to a company

       Reserve a unique company name at the Huduma Center

       The name reservation is regulated by the Companies Act 2015 (Part V,
       Section 48). The procedure begins by making a payment for name
       reservation at the cashier's desk of one of the Nairobi Huduma Centers.
       Then a payment slip, together with an application for reservation of a
       company name (Form CR14) are submitted to the counter service
       provided by the Nairobi Huduma Centers. The name is reserved for 30
       days and can be extended to a maximum period of 60 days from the
       time of reservation.

       In addition to the Hudumas Center, the name reservation can also be
       done through a text-messaging system or online through the ecitizen
       portal. The text-messaging system (through safari.com company) works                        KES 100 per name

       need to visit the Huduma Center to receive final name approval. This is
       why the majority of applicants choose to visit the Huduma Center
       directly, rather than use the text-messaging system. The ecitizen online
       platform (www.ecitizen.go.ke) is fully electronic and enables online
       name reservation. However, due to various challenges--such as
       inconsistent reliability of the system and lack of good internet
       connection and infrastructure for entrepreneurs--the online platform is
       not widely used.

      The National Social Security Fund provides the employee with a lump-

      is considerably less than that achieved by private schemes, but
      participation is mandatory. The employer pays a standard contribution
      of about 1% of salary, subject to a maximum of KES 400 per month. Half
      the contribution is deductible from the employee’s salary. The precise
      amount of the contribution (less than the maximum) is determined by           1 day         no charge

      contribution is 12% of the pensionable wages made up of two equal
      portions of 6% from the employee and 6% from the employer subject

      The employee contributes a fixed sum to the National Hospital

      the employees’ salary.

      As of April 1, 2015, the rates of contribution range from a minimum of
6     KES 150 for employees earning up to KES 5,999 to KES 1,700 for                1 day         no charge
      employees earning more than KES 100,000 per month. The
      contributions are used to offset the costs of medical treatment, but they

      employees with medical insurance.

        Obtain approval of the environmental impact study

        Following the enactment of new Environmental Management
        and Co-ordination Act on February 27, 2009, companies now
        have to obtain approval of projects from the National
        Environment Management Authority. Projects of all risk
        categories are subject to approval and an environmental impact
        assessment (EIA), including the BuildCo warehouse. It takes 30
        days on average. The cost is set at 0.05% of warehouse value            30 days               KES 10,000

        rate was 0.1% of warehouse value.

        The regulation regarding environmental impact assessment
        approval for Kenya has been in place since 1999. However, in
        recent years NEMA started enforcing the rules more vigorously.
        NEMA conducts periodic inspections during the construction. If

      Submit and obtain approval of the architectural plans

      The structural engineer submits all the structural and
      architectural drawings to be approved using an online platform
      https://ccn-ecp.or.ke/. The required documents to be submitted
      are the following:
      i. The proposed development;
      ii. A survey plan from Survey of Kenya;
      iii. Ownership documents
      iv. Up-to-date rates payment receipts.
      v. Structural plans

      The City Council will issue an invoice that must be paid, this can
      take up to 2—3 weeks to be obtained. The drawings are
      reviewed by all relevant departments simultaneously. Once the
      structural and architectural drawings are approved, they will be
      signed on by the governor of Nairobi. When all signatures have
      been obtained, the approved plans are scanned and uploaded in
      the system so that they can be retrieved by the architect.

      On June 27, 2013 the Nairobi City County adopted the new             45 days      KES 313,126

      Financial Act 2013 which became effective as of October 1, 2013.
      The Act modified the method of assessing the building permit
      fees and consolidated several costs into one. The building
      permit fee is now based on the size of the building. The Joint
      Building Council Rates provide the estimated cost per square
      meter which varies depending on the type of building (e.g. office
      block, residential, industrial complex, etc.).

      For the Doing Business case study, the estimated cost is KES
      21,000 / sq. m.
      The fees are as follows:
      (i) Building plan approval fee: 1% of the estimated cost of
      construction
      (ii) Construction sign board fee: KES 25,000
      (iii) Application fee: KES 5,000
      (iv) Inspection of building file: KES 5,000

      Apply for project registration with the National Construction
      Authority (NCA)

      BuildCo has to register the proposed construction project with
      the National Construction Authority (NCA) and fill a project
      registration form providing details of the construction work (that
      can be downloaded from the NCA website since 2012,
      www.nca.go.ke). This is line with the adoption of the National
      Construction Authority Regulations (2014) that mandate
      contractors to register their construction projects and obtain
      compliance certificate from NCA before construction. It takes
      around a week to obtain the compliance certificate. Upon
      submission of the application, BuildCo receives a temporary
      certificate that testifies the registration is under process.
      Most of the time, construction companies start building just after
      submission at NCA without waiting to receive the compliance
*7    certificate as they should be doing. NCA conducts periodic            1 day        no charge
      inspections during the construction looking for registration
      certificates and structural flaws. NCA ensures that the safety of
      the workers on site and the general public is respected.
      BuildCo submits the project registration form to the authority
      with several documents listed below. BuildCo is issued with an
      invoice on the amount of levy it should pay the authority at
      selected bank accounts, which are posted on the NCA website.
      The levy is 0.5% of the total cost of the project (percentage
      applicable to projects with a value of over KES 5,000,000).
      The following documents must be provided for the registration
      application
      1.        Authenticated architectural plans (original)
      2.        Authenticated structural plans (original)

      Once the construction is completed alongside statutory
      inspections, BuildCo applies for an occupancy certificate. The
      Structural engineer will file a form AA65, according to the
      Planning and Building Regulations 2009, certifying that the "that
      the structural work of the building mentioned below has been
      carried out as per my structural design and details and that the
      said structure is safe and stable for the purpose for which it is
      intended".

      This certificate is issued to completed developments that have
      complied to all approval conditions and have undergone the
      regular inspections at the required stages. The application has to
      be accompanied by:Copy of approved building plans; Copy of
13    approved structural plans; Structural Engineer’s indemnity form;      5 days       no charge
      Architect’s report; Plumbers certificate; and Kenya Bureau of
      Statistics form duly filled.

      The occupancy certificate is given when the City Council deems
      the building is in compliance with the approved architectural
      drawings.

      The application is then forwarded to the Assistant Director
      Enforcement so that an inspector is assigned for the final
      inspection of the construction. Normally it should be a combined
      visit from several other departments.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Receive site inspection by Government valuer and obtain valuation
      report

      Once the draft transfer has been filed at the land office, an inspector
      visits the site to verify the development and state of the property. Due
      to lack of transport, in practice, the inspector often has to be picked up
      in person and driven to the site. Previously, such inspections were
      conducted on a random basis, but now every transaction requires such
6     an inspection. The issues involved are similar to the inspections by the     20 days        no cost
      land officer and, therefore, may happen within 1 day to up to over one
      month. Once the valuer has inspected the property to assess its value, a
      report is compiled after which the value is endorsed on the transfer and
      then it is submitted for assessment of the Stamp duty.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

 Indicator        Answer                                        Explanation
                                     After Mirage's default on payment, as the debenture holder, BizBank would
                                   initiate receivership by filing an application requiring the High Court of Kenya
                                   to verify an identified receiver pursuant to Part VII Receivers and Managers of
                                    the Companies Act. Mirage or other unsecured creditors may appeal against
                                       the appointment before the Court, and according to Section 223 of the
Proceeding      receivership
                                   Companies Act, the Court can stay or restrain proceedings accordingly based
                                      on relevant parties' application, then the receivership proceeding can be
                                    converted into liquidation. However, the conversion is unlikely to happen for
                                   Mirage's case as BizBank holds 74% of the total outstanding debt and it's likely
                                                that the Court would approve its receivership request.

                                       The hotel will continue operating as a going concern after the BizBank
Outcome       going concern
                                            appointed receiver sell it as a going concern to a third party.

                                   The receivership will approximately take 4.5 years until BizBank is repaid some
                                     or all of the money owed to it upon the completion of the proceeding. The
                                       delay is largely due to the inefficiency of court and difficulty to organize
                                     hearings. It takes about 2 years until the final judgment is made to approve

                                   would take additional 2.5 years to find a potential buyer of the company, sell it
                                                   as a going concern and receive the sale proceeds.

                                   The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 22% of the

        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
