Engaging the Private Sector in Education                                                                                 2015

Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools                                                                          Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Policies allow schools to make their own decisions on appointing, deploying, and dismissing teachers;
    determining teacher salary levels; and setting class size standards. Schools are restricted in their ability to
    determine teacher certification standards and methods for delivering the curriculum.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    Standardized exams are administered annually to select grades of students; however, results are not
    disaggregated. Policy dictates that schools be inspected based on need and requires schools to submit
    action plans to district or divisional offices. No sanctions are administered based on the results of
    inspections or exams.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Examination results are published in terms of pass and fail percentages. There is no systematic way of
    reviewing the whole school such as school report cards. Parents and students participate in focus groups as
    part of the inspection process. The government does not provide tax subsidies or cash transfers to parents
    for their child to attend private independent schools.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    No provider types are prohibited from operating private schools. There are no standardized school fee
    schedules and no explicit restrictions on tuition. Public and independent private schools have relatively
    equivalent operating standards; however, guidelines for school registration are not publicized. Independent
    schools are able to operate without paying regulatory fees.


Policy Goals for Government-Funded Private Schools                                                                    Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Policies allow schools to make their own decisions on appointing, deploying, and dismissing teachers;
    determining teacher salary levels; setting class size standards; and determining operating budgets. Schools
    are restricted in their ability to determine teacher certification standards and methods for delivering the
    curriculum.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    Standardized exams are administered annually in select grades; however, results are not disaggregated.
    Policy dictates that schools be inspected regularly based on need and requires school to submit action
    plans to district or divisional offices. No sanctions or rewards are administered based on the results of
    inspections or exams. Schools are not required to report on the use of public funding.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Examination results are published in terms of pass and fail percentages. There is no systematic way of
    reviewing the whole school such as school report cards. Parents and students participate in focus groups as
    part of the inspection process. Schools are not prohibited from selecting students based on academic
    performance or geography. Schools are not prohibited from charging compulsory or voluntary fees.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    Public and government-funded private schools experience relatively equivalent operating standards and
    receive equal funding. Schools do not receive initial funding to open. No policy requires government to
    inform schools of upcoming funding in advance. Registration guidelines are not made public.

The four policy goals enable a government to increase
innovation and strengthen accountability among the
critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts, they
can have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.

Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
   4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
      to attend with government-provided funding;
      these schools can be operated by the
      government or non-government providers or
      both, depending on the system.

The overall score for each policy goal is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
indicators. For example, a hypothetical country receives
the following indicator scores for one of its policy goals:
         Indicator A = 2 points
         Indicator B = 3 points
         Indicator C = 4 points
         Indicator D = 4 points

Recent data on the distribution of educational spending
shows that Malawi has the most inequitable distribution
of educational resources of any country in Africa (World
Bank 2010). In the average African country, 43 percent of
all educational spending goes to the most educated 10
percent. In Malawi, roughly 74 percent of all spending
goes to the most educated 10 percent (Ibid.). The
wealthiest one-fifth of students in the country benefit
from 68 percent of public resources for education.

Student performance on national achievement exams
indicates a substantial need for better quality in primary
education. In 2007, Malawi was the lowest-performing
country in reading and the second lowest in math among
the 15 countries whose students took the SACMEQ
(Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring
Educational Quality) III exam. Malawi’s grade 6 students
performed 0.8 standard deviations below the mean
score in reading and 0.6 standard deviations below the
mean score in math. Only 27 percent of students reached
the upper levels of reading competency in the country,
compared with an average of 64 percent across all
SACMEQ countries. In math, only 8 percent of Malawian
students reached the upper levels of competency,
compared with 37 percent in all SACMEQ III countries
(SACMEQ 2010).

an inferior standard of education than that provided by
the public school system. Many of Malawi’s current
education policies are outlined in the Education Act of
1962, which was enacted before the country achieved
independence. Needless to say, the act needs to be
revised in order to adequately address the current needs
of the school system. Unfortunately, a revised act has
been under discussion for over a decade (Kadzamira et
al. 2004) and a more current piece of legislation still
awaits enactment.

A number of Malawi’s key policy documents recognize
the potential role of the private sector in improving
access to and the quality of education services. As the
Education Sector Implementation Plan 2009–2013
states, the Malawi education system “belongs to
everyone” and “reinvigorating it will take the combined
efforts of the Government, private sector, development
partners, civil society and parents/guardians” (MEST
2009).

The Malawi National Examinations Board (MANEB) is
responsible for developing, administering, and
processing national examinations in the country. All
public and private school students studying the primary
and secondary curriculum take the MANEB
examinations. Some independent private schools follow
an alternative curriculum and administer international
examinations.

The main policies, laws, and official documentation used
to benchmark the education system in Malawi include:

       Education Act of 1962
       Policy and Investment Framework (2000)
       Education Sector Implementation Plan 2009–
        2013
       Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II
        2011–2016
       National Education Sector Plan 2008–2017

  Government-funded private schools:

In Malawi, the policies in place to promote diversity of
supply for independent private schools are
established—representing systematic good practice. For
government-funded private schools, these policies are
emerging—representing some instances of good
practice.
Overall, government policy supports entry and relatively
unburdened operation of multiple private education
providers into the market. Schools are free to set their
own tuition fees. All types of providers (community, not-
for-profit, for-profit, and faith-based) are allowed to
operate private schools. Private and public schools are
subject to equivalent operating standards. Schools are
able to operate without paying operating fees to the
government. The government does not, however, make
clear regulatory guidelines available in order for new
schools to become registered.
In government-funded private schools, academic and
additional budgets are equivalent to those of public
schools. However, these schools do not receive targeted
funding to meet individual student needs (e.g., students
from marginalized groups or who have special
educational needs). Government-funded private schools
also do not receive start-up funding, nor do they receive
information on funding amounts and timelines for
delivery of this funding.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
       systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
       associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies of engaging the private
       sector in education.
