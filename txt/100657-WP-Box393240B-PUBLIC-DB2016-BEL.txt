THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

must complete to incorporate and register a new                  Legal form: Société privée à responsabilité
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through             limité/besloten vennootschap met beperkte
collaboration with relevant local professionals and              aansprakelijkheid (SPRL/BVBA)
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available
information on business entry in that economy.                   Paid-in minimum capital requirement: EUR
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,             6,200
along with the associated time and cost. These                   City: Brussels
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the          Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

                                                                                       Time to

                                                                                      complete
       Deposit at least 20% of the initial capital with a Belgian credit
       institution and obtain a standard certification confirming that the
       amount is held in a blocked “capital” account

       The full amount of capital must be fully and unconditionally subscribed,
       but it does not have to be immediately paid in unless the capital
       contribution is fully in kind. However, by law, a fifth of the total capital
       paid-in cash (no less than EUR 6,200) must be paid in.

       For those private limited liability companies incorporated by only one
   1   shareholder, the amount of the capital to be paid in is EUR 12,400. In          1 day           no charge
       some cases, the paid-in and minimum capital can be reduced to EUR 1.
       Indeed, the Belgian legislation allows, when certain conditions are
       present, to set-up a limited liability company (called SPRL Starter /BVBA
       Starter) without the minimum capital and paid-in capital of the
       SPRL/BVBA (article 214, §2 Company). However, this does not apply to
       the case study.

        from the local VAT administration or through the centralized company
        docket, which can apply for the VAT registration number electronically
        (but in both cases, the VAT registration number will be granted by the
        VAT administration). The VAT registration and social security
        registration are done through a single enterprise number. The company
        therefore only needs to request the activation of the enterprise number
        as VAT registration number, if necessary for its activities. This activation
        can be done by the one-stop shop or directly by the VAT

        zelfstandigen") at the latest on the day of the start of the activities, and
        no longer within 3 months of incorporation. It must pay into this fund
        an annual contribution of EUR 868 at most. In addition, if the company
        has employees in Belgium, it must register with the Belgian social
        security administration for salaried workers (ONSS/RSZ) and comply
        with all applicable Belgian employment regulations.

        entity and EUR 82.5 for every additional business unit to be registered

        VAT registration is (a) free of charge if done directly through the local

        Obtain a recent proof of land ownership

        The administration must check two items:
        1. That the person requesting the building permit has the right
        to do so. He might not necessarily be the owner of the land, but
        acting on behalf of the owner.
        2. The applicant must submit a recent list of neighboring plots. In
        case of inquiry they should be able to consult the neighbors.

        Therefore, the cadastral extract must be recent. Although the
        town has access to cadastral plans, the applicant must still obtain
        a recent cadastral extract. It costs around 50-100 Euros and it
        takes a maximum of 15 days to obtain it.

        Agency: Bureau de l’Enregistrement



        Obtain clearance from the Fire Department

        Some municipalities request a fire department report on the
        owner’s behalf. The cost to obtain this report is set in the official
        fee schedule published in the law: December 18, 2003 Arrêté du

      after 2 years from the date of issuance, if construction has not
      started within that period.

      The Urbanism Department has 30 days to inform the applicant
      that the application is not complete. After that period, the
      administration has another 3 months, depending on the type of
      construction to deliver the "permis d'urbanism." Other
      clearances are required such as obtaining clearance from
      VIVAQUA for sewage, obtaining information regarding the
      sewage and the depth at which the sewage pipes are located.
      This can take another 30 days. Contacting VIVAQUA is done by
      the Urbanism Department and is part of the permit request
      process.

      Agency: Municipality



      Inform Municipality of commencement of work

      The builder must inform the Municipality of the commencement
      of work by writing a certified letter 8 days prior to the start of
      construction. According to Art. 194/2 of the CoBAT, it is
      mandatory that the permit be posted on the construction site           1 day        no charge

      Agency: Municipality



      File application and receive an inspection by the Cadastre
      upon completion of construction

      Within 30 days after the warehouse is in use, BuildCo must file an
      application at the Cadastre for "Le Revenu Cadastral." The
7     request is made by completing and submitting the form. An              1 day        no charge
      agent will visit the building and determine its value. BuildCo does
      not need to be present at the inspection. They inform BuildCo of
      the new property tax by certified mail. The value of the property
      is revised on an annual basis.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Parties give initial sale agreement to notary

       The transfer of ownership can be done by an agreement between seller
       and buyer. However, in order to validate the transfer of ownership vis-à-
       vis third parties, the initial agreement needs to be notarized and
       registered with the mortgage register by a notary. The notary will draw
       up a deed and obtain all necessary documentation (see following
       Procedures). The notary also checks, for companies, the copy of the
       publication of the names of the directors in the Belgian Official Gazette.                        Included in

      mortgage backed facility agreement) will be included in the documents.
      The notary obtains copies of the transfer deeds over a 30-year period at
      the same place. The mortgage registry provides (i) "full transcription" of
      the title or of the judgment attributing the title: the date of acquisition of
      the full ownership or other right over the property (such as usufruct -
      right to use the property-, superficies-right to construct), the terms and
      conditions of the acquisition including the purchase price, the existence
      of lease contracts exceeding 9 years and information on the rights of
      third parties such as judgments, servitudes/easements and seizures
      affecting the property in question for the past 30 years and (ii) by
      "inscription" whether the right over the property is encumbered by a
      mortgage or a legal lien (beneficiary, amount, costs, term).

      * Notary obtains tax certificates relating to the seller's tax position
      from tax administration (Inland Revenue)

      The notary obtains tax certificates relating to the seller's tax position
      from the Inland Revenue, the VAT authorities and the municipal tax
      collector relating to the seller's tax position. A request for this
      information can be submitted online, but the response will arrive 15 days
      later. If there is no answer within 12 working days, the notary can process
      the deed anyway, therefore assuming there are no tax issues. The only
      tax information which still needs to be asked by registered letter is the
      municipal or provincial tax information. Since April 2007, the request             15 days
      could be submitted online but the response would still arrive within 15        (simultaneous         EUR 60 (included

      time the seller's social security position. The notary has to verify with       2, 3, 5 and 6)
      every social security fund (there are +/- 15 of them). However, this
      process is done electronically, simultaneously with the verification of the
      tax position. The Procedure is integrated in the existing Procedure
      related to the tax position of the seller. The time needed for this
      verification is 15 days as well. It takes place fully electronically, just as
      getting the tax certificates.

      (valid) request to obtain a soil certificate. The seller of an immoveable
      good has to ask the Brussels environmental authorities (BIM) for a soil
      certificate (attestation du sol/bodemattest) which he has to transmit to
      the buyer before the conclusion of the private sale agreement
      (compromis de vente). For some type of lands, an expert must examine
      the land to check whether the soil is polluted ("reconnaissance du sol
      /verkennend bodemonderzoek"). On basis of the results of this survey,
      BIM decides whether the transfer can take place without any further
      measure or whether the condition of the soil requires additional
      measures to be taken (e.g. clean-up). If additional measures have to be
      taken, the transfer can nevertheless take place before the clean-up if
      some conditions are fulfilled. This new Act is a transposition of European
      legislation (article 17§2 of the Ordinance of 5 March 2009).

      registration of the deed with the mortgage registry.

      The documentation shall include*:
      Before execution of the deed, the notary will normally have obtained the
      following documents:
      Excerpt and plan from the land register (“kadaster / cadastre”) indicating
      the exact land register references (obtained in Procedure 2)
      Copies of all transfer deed over a 30-year period (obtained in Procedure
      3)
      Zoning certificates; (obtained in Procedure 4)
      Tax certificates from the Inland Revenue, the VAT authorities and the
      municipal tax collector relating to the seller’s tax position (the same
      certificates will be requested with regard to the buyer company if it
      finances the acquisition through a mortgage backed facility agreement);

      authorities, if any;
      Excerpt from the mortgage register in order to verify whether certain
      third party rights were granted over the property, e.g. mortgages, rights
      to construct (“opstalrecht / droit de superficie”), etc; (obtained in
      Procedure 3) and
      A 30-year title search (if the acquisition is financed through a mortgage
      backed facility agreement) (obtained in Procedure 3).

      The notary’s fees are determined by law (Arrete Royal) and the payment
      of the registration duties and notary fees takes place after the signature
      of the deed.

      * The new Brussels legislation on soil clean-up obliges a seller of real
      estate to conduct a soil survey for lands where pollution is suspected, if
      clean-up is deemed necessary by the Brussels environmental authorities
      (BIM), to perform clean-up measures prior to transferring the polluted
      site. Contrary to the Flemish Region (where property rights may be
      transferred as soon as sufficient financial guarantees are in place), the
      Brussels statute on soil clean-up does not allow to proceed with the
      transfer before the actual clean-up works have been completed.

      * The pre-emption rights exist in some predetermined areas of the
      Flemish and Brussels Region. The seller or the notary notifies the
      competent administration (GRONDREGIE / REGIE FONCIERE ) as soon as
      he receives the "compromis". These administrations then have 2 months
      to decide whether to exercise their pre-emption right. Some pre-
      emption rights also exist in the Walloon Region. The areas in Brussels
      where needed to obtain a waiver for preemption are specified in the
      website:

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

 Indicator     Answer                                          Explanation
                             Mirage's management is obligated to commence insolvency proceedings within
                                   1 month from the moment Mirage stops paying its debts (art. 9 of the
                                Bankruptcy Law). Mirage's management will request judicial reorganization,
                                 because it wants to keep the company operating. This will allow Mirage's
                                directors to remain in charge of the business during the proceedings and to
                                  continue operations and preserve employment. Once request for judicial
                            reorganization is made, all enforcement proceedings will be stayed for 6 months.
                             If necessary, the moratorium period may be extended by court decision to up to
                                                             12 months in total.

                            During that time, Mirage will prepare and present a reorganization plan that will
                            then need to be approved by a majority of the creditors representing more than
                            50% of the outstanding undisputed claims. If approved by the creditors and the
                               Commercial Court, the reorganization plan will be binding on all creditors.

Proceedin reorganization The reorganization plan may involve the reduction and/or postponement of the
g                               claim of unsecured creditors. With respect to the secured creditor, the
                          reorganization plan cannot provide for a reduction of its claim. However, it can
                         provide for the suspension, without its express consent, of its rights (with regard
                          to the principal amount) for a period of up to 24 months from the filing date of
                            the petition, which period can be extended once for 12 months under certain
                         conditions, without prejudice to the right of these creditors to receive interest on
                           their claims. No other measures can be provided for in the reorganization plan
                                            without the secured creditors' express consent.

                            If it is not possible to reach an agreement on the reorganization plan, it is always
                                possible to convert the proceedings into a different reorganization scenario,
                                   being the court supervised transfer of the business in going concern. A
                             reorganization with transfer of the business implies that the current owners and
                              managers lose their business unless they are involved in the NewCo acquiring
                                                                 the business.

                          In case of successful reorganization, the hotel will continue operating. Once the
                               reorganization plan is adopted and confirmed by the Commercial Court,
                          Mirage's management will be able to continue operating the business as long as

                              debtor will draw up a list of all claims and securities in relation to those claims
                             and submit it to the creditors within 14 days from the date when the moratorium
                              is grated. Creditors review the information and, if there is any disagreement, it
                             must be resolved in court. Within the said moratorium period, the reorganization
                              plan must be approved by the creditors and, subsequently, by the Commercial
                             Court. To be approved, the plan must be accepted by at least 50% of the debtors
                                 who, collectively, represent at least 50% of the total undisputed claims (in

                              moratorium period will lapse and the plan will enter into force. The term of the

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
