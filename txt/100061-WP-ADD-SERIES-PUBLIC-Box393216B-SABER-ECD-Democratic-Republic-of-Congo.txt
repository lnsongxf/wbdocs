     1. Establishing an Enabling Environment
         The 2012 National Policy on the Integrated Development of the Young Child
         and the inclusion of ECCE in the recently revised National Education Law of
         2014 are important achievements toward the construction of a strong ECD
         system. However, these frameworks lack government endorsement and
         costed implementation plans. Tracking and allocating a clear budget toward
         ECD could also improve effectiveness of delivery.

     2. Implementing Widely
         The Democratic Republic of Congo has some of the highest under-five
         mortality rates in the region and one of the lowest enrollment rates for
         preprimary education. The devastation of the five-year conflict (1998 to
         2003) made it difficult to provide comprehensive ECD services to children in
         their early years. Despite established health, nutrition, and education
         services in all provinces, few are mandatory and most have fees, making
         access difficult for most of the population.

    3. Monitoring and Assuring Quality
       Data to monitor standards and ensure quality are not available. Standards for
       learning environments such as infrastructure exist but are not enforced, and
       although there are no standards for number of students per teachers, the
       national average is above international standards, with overpopulated
       classrooms that make it difficult for educators to teach.

terms of ECD programs in the nutrition sector, three
programs exist to target pregnant women and children:
programs that promote breastfeeding, micronutrient
support/food supplementation for pregnant women,
and complementary feeding for children. A health
program that covers children ages three to seven is the
National School Health Program, which works to manage
the health of students and prevent health problems in
public and private schools; health monitoring includes
hygiene, vaccinations, and disease detection.

The few ECD education interventions implemented and
administered by the government are provided to all 11
provinces, but they are neither universal, mandatory, nor
free. These public preschool programs are the
Programme National d’Enseignment Maternel (National
Preschool Program) and the Espace Commnunitaire
d’Eveil (ECE; Community Space Awakening), both
targeting children ages three to five. Although the
government finances the National Preschool Program
paying for teacher salaries, the ECE program is mostly
funded by UNICEF and/or the community. A parental
education program—Encadrement Parentale—targets
mothers and fathers and covers education, health, and
nutrition aspects of children in all 11 provinces.

Social protection programs are few—a couple programs
exist for children in streets but lack funding and
organization.

Preliminary Benchmarking and International
Comparison of ECD in the Democratic
Republic of Congo
Table 16 presents the classification of ECD policy in the
Democratic Republic of Congo within each of the nine
policy levers and three policy goals. The SABER-ECD
classification system does not rank countries according
to any overall scoring; rather, it is intended to share
information on how different ECD systems address the
same policy challenges.
Table 17 presents the status of ECD policy development
in the Democratic Republic of Congo alongside a
selection of countries in East and West Africa. The level
of development in the Democratic Republic of Congo can
be compared to that of Uganda and Nigeria, while Kenya
has achieved slightly higher levels of development.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policy makers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Early
       Childhood Development.
