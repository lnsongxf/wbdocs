THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      federal savings bank (Caixa Econômica Federal) with a copy of: the
      company's taxpayer registry number (CNPJ/MF), the adhesion form
      issued by the Federal Saving Bank (Caixa Econômica Federal), the list of
      employees, and the company's articles of association or bylaws. Upon
      opening the employee FGTS accounts, the company will make monthly
      deposits equal to 8% of the total payroll. The employees are entitled to          1 day,

        Before the application process, the engineer and architect
        responsible for the project need to obtain an ART. An ART is a
        document required by the Engineers Syndicate (Crea) that
        defines, for legal purposes, who is responsible for the execution
        of works or services and provides an opportunity for
        professionals to register their works or services with Crea.

        The ART is required for each project according to the Federal
        Law N° 6.496 of 7 December 1977. It is possible to obtain it
        online within a couple of hours and it costs BRL 167.68. The value         0.5 days               BRL 168

      BuildCo must apply for construction approval permit and the
      construction execution permit with the Municipality. If the
      project conforms to municipal legislation, zoning laws, and the
      municipal building code, the Municipality will issue a document
      approving construction. To apply for these permits, BuildCo must
      submit the architectural drawings and real estate documentation
      (real estate title or real estate tax).

      After examining the project’s architecture and engineering and
      issuing the permit, the Municipality examines the practical and
      installation aspects and begins the process of issuing an              274 days      BRL 4,200

      BuildCo can request both permits simultaneously, but the
      Municipality grants the permits in a specific order.

      Valid for a year, the construction approval permit is a
      prerequisite for subsequent procedures. The construction
      execution permit is valid for 3 years. Due to backlog of projects,
      the time required for this procedure is at least 9 to 10 months.

      Register employees with the Social Security Office

      For each construction site, BuildCo must register employees separately
      with the Social Security Office (Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad
      Social, INSS). The website to register employees is:
      http://www.servicos.gov.br/.                                                 0.5 days      no charge

      inspection.

      Agency: Social Security Office



      Request and obtain construction approval permit and construction
      execution permit

      BuildCo must apply for construction approval permit and the
      construction execution permit with the Municipality. If the project
      conforms to municipal legislation, zoning laws, and the municipal
      building code, the Municipality will issue a document approving
      construction. To apply for these permits, BuildCo must submit the
      architectural drawings and real estate documentation (real estate title
      or real estate tax). After examining the project’s architecture and
      engineering and issuing the permit, the Municipality examines the            365 days       BRL 805
5
      practical and installation aspects and begins the process of issuing an
      execution permit. BuildCo can request both permits simultaneously,
      but the Municipality grants the permits in a specific order. Valid for a
      year, the construction approval permit is a prerequisite for subsequent
      procedures. The construction execution permit is valid for 3 years. Due
      to backlog of projects, the time required for this procedure is at least 9
      to 10 months.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

        Registry with jurisdiction over the property to finalize registration
        and name change

        There are 18 Real Estate Registries in São Paulo. The registration of the
        deed at the competent Real Estate Registry is required for the transfer of
        ownership of the property. It can be arranged directly by the parties or
  13    by the notary if the notary offers this supplementary service. By law, the       15 days          BRL 2887.20
        Real Estate Registry has 30 days to analyze the documents and register
        the transfer deed. Usually, the registry will come back with some issues
        that need to be fixed prior to registration.

        Theoretically, the Real Estate Registry should inform the Municipality
        about the transfer of the real estate and the Municipality should
        automatically update its land taxation records. In practice, however, this        5 days (

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                                investor, or renegotiate its debt. Insolvency proceedings will therefore
                                                start with Mirage (debtor) filing for court-supervised reorganization
                                                (recuperação judicial) with the Bankruptcy Court of the District of São
                                                Paulo. Mirage will benefit from the automatic stay / moratorium

                                                case will be converted into liquidation, for the following reasons: (i)
                                                BizBank will most likely vote against the plan, since for BizBank the
                                                most efficient outcome is the sale of the business as a going concern,
                                                free and clear of labor and tax claims (which cannot be achieved
                                                through a reorganization), and (ii) no plan can be approved without
                                                Mirage’s consent, as it is the only creditor holding secured debt (class

                                              A reorganization procedure that is then converted into liquidation will
                                              approximately take 4 years in total. According to the Bankruptcy Law,
                                              the reorganization plan must be approved by the creditors within 180
                                              days from commencement of reorganization proceedings (this is the
                                              maximum period for which the individual actions are stayed). However,
                                              this time will probably be extended several times, because the

                                              our case study assumptions. The case will then be converted into
                                              liquidation (where the assets would be sold as a going concern), taking

                                              The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately
                                              12% of the value of the debtor's estate (280,000 BRL). The main

figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
