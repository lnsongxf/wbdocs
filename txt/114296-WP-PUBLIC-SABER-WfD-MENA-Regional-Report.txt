                                      progress in introducing
                                      competency standards

                                      are not yet competency
                                      based. Standards are
                                      defined on the basis of
                                      internal consultations and

                                      education, only private
                                      providers are required
                                      to obtain accreditation;
                                      accreditation standards are
                                      publicized and enforced
                                      to a large extent. Training
                                      providers are offered some
                                      incentives to seek and
                                      retain accreditation, mainly
                                      in the form of a license to
                                      operate.

                                      limitations. For example,
                                      TVET students can pursue
                                      formal skills acquisition

                                      but their options are limited
                                      to vocationally oriented
                                      programs. Most certificates
                                      for TVET programs will
                                      be recognized in the
                                      proposed NQF, however,
                                      qualifications certified by
                                      noneducation ministries are

                                         providers are registered

Annex 2: Key Findings of SABER
Multiyear Country Report (2013)
for Republic of Korea

Strategic Framework                                                                                   2010
Strategic Framework was assessed at the established level in 1970 and 1990 and had reached
an advanced level by 2010. These results reflect active apex-level leadership on the part of
the government, which consistently maintains a close alignment between Korea’s economic
development priorities and workforce development (WfD) policy; the integration of robust              1990
surveys of the demand for and supply of skills into the policy-making process; and the clear
delineation of the legal roles and responsibilities of governmental and nongovernmental
stakeholders involved in setting WfD strategy.
                                                                                                      1970




System Oversight                                                                                      2010
System Oversight was assessed at the emerging level in 1970, progressed to an established
level by 1990, and reached an advanced level in 2010. These results reflect strong oversight
of the WfD system through the consistent enforcement of appropriate accreditation standards
for all providers that receive public funding; a credible and comprehensive system of skills
testing and certification; and an education system that creates multiple pathways in and out of       1990
vocational education at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. The system has steadily
improved with respect to facilitating lifelong learning and using criteria to allocate WfD funds in
order to both incentivize efficiency in resource use and ensure alignment of WfD programs with
economic development priorities.

Service Delivery was assessed at the emerging level in 1970 and 1990 and progressed to an

foster links among individual training providers, research institutes, and industry; encourage
diversity in training provision by supporting private providers and companies that train              1990
workers; and make extensive use of data collection and analysis to both identify strengths and
