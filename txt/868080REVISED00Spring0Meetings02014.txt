*As of March 2014



Project Background:
The Decentralized Rural Development Project (DRDP) was approved on March 1, 2005 for a credit of $7 million. Effective March 21, 2011, under the Global
Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund, a grant for $5 million was allocated to Bhutan as additional financing for the DRDP. The
additional DRDP grant funds were to help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities and to address the impact of the continuing high prices
associated with essential food commodities. Due to significant exchange rate savings/gains the project was restructured and the closing date extended to
December 31, 2014.

Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project development objective is to improve market access and increase agricultural output for rural communities in selected areas of Bhutan. The
project supports improvements/rehabilitation of rural infrastructure (rural roads and irrigation) and promotes extension activities particularly for rice,
maize and potato crops to address disease outbreaks and low productivity.

The DRDP Additional Financing supports three components. The first component focuses on the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation canals and on
the improvement of selected roads which support rice, potato and maize production areas. The second component helps farmers improve production of rice
and maize through demonstration, knowledge sharing, improved technologies and capacity building. Finally, the third component focuses on institutional
strengthening activities such as capacity-building at the local-level administration, for planning aspects, and for the physical reporting of project
implementation performance, to ensure the appropriate transfer of funds to the local level. In addition, capacity building activities for pest surveillance,
financial management, environmental and social screening will be supported.

Results:
   The project is on course to achieving its targets in improving rural infrastructure (irrigation canals and farm roads) and food crop production (rice,
    maize and potato). To date the project has benefitted over 8,272 households (target 6,700 households) from improved infrastructure and over 8,703
    households (target 8,500 households) through improved extension services.

    43.95 km of farm roads have been improved exceeding the end of project target of 15 km. Similarly, 256 km out of a required 200 km of irrigation
     canals have been rehabilitated.

    In the last cropping season Jan-Feb 2013, 111 tons of basic seeds of potatoes were produced. With the increase in number of contract farmers for seed
     production and also with the increase in National Seed Center (NSC) area for cultivation, the total basic seed production is expected to exceed the 700
     metric ton target by the project closing date. The multiplication of seeds of new rice, maize, and potato varieties has started, and is expected to be
     increasingly adopted by farmers. The adaptation rate for improved rice varieties is 45 percent against a project target of 25 percent. On the other hand
     27 metric tons of Green Leaf Spot (GLS) disease tolerant maize seeds were produced by community based seed production (CBSP) groups, resulting in
     60% of GLS affected maize seeds being replaced. The target replacement rate for the project is 80 percent.

Project Background:
The Kingdom of Bhutan has experienced rapid social and economic development over the past two decades, and this socio-economic transition is fueling
rapid urbanization. Meeting the challenges of urban development, management and finance is now a key developmental agenda of the Royal Government of
Bhutan (RGOB) and its international development partners. The World Bank started its support with the Bhutan Urban Development Project (1999-2006),
which helped develop urban infrastructure systems in ten secondary towns. The RGOB showed strong interest and appreciation of the Bank’s policy advice
through the project and technical assistance to prepare the National Urbanization Strategy (2008) and the Thimphu City Development Strategy. On the RGOB
side, the Local Government Act of 2009 and Municipal Finance Policy (2012) provide the framework for the roles and responsibilities of urban local
governments. In that context, the ongoing BUDP2 focuses on supporting urban/municipal development in Thimphu (the capital and Bhutan’s largest city) and
Phuentsholing (second largest city and a commercial hub) as well as technical assistance for the urban local governments and the Ministry of Works and
Human Settlement.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project development objectives are to (i) support Bhutan’s municipal reform program by strengthening municipal finance an d management services in
Thimphu and Phuentsholing; and (ii) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no formal services are currently available.

The BUDP2 consist of three components: (i) municipal Finance and Management; (ii) Thimphu Northern Area Development; and (iii) Capacity Building.
Component 1 ($1.5 million) aims at strengthening the institutional systems of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes (city corporations). The support for the
city-specific reforms is being done broadly through (i) strengthening the local revenue administration systems and processes; and (ii) strengthening the
expenditure management systems and financial management systems and processes of the two Thromdes. This component also supports Royal Government
policy reforms aimed at setting up a policy framework for municipal financing. C omponent 2 ($9.3 million) supports the development of basic infrastructure
systems in two ‘local area plans’ in northern Thimphu, including roads, stormwater drainage, water supply, sewerage and stree t lighting, as well as support
for increase in low-income housing units in these areas. Under component 3 ($1.2 million), resources are being provided for training programs, equipment,
technical assistance, and studies based on the needs of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes. It aims at significant upgrading of each Thromde’s capacities in
various aspects of their internal work processes and service delivery to citizens through training of operational staff and provision of relevant equipment.


Key Results: [Target Values at end of Project]
   Increase in local revenue collection: 50 percent by Thimphu and 40 percent by Phuentsoling.
   New building permits issued for serviced plots: 175 (in two Thimphu Local Area Plans being developed)
   Number of households with new piped water and sewerage connections: 600 (in two Thimphu Local Area Plans).
   Number of municipal staff trained: 250 (with 150 in Thimphu and 100 in Phuentsholing)

Project Background:
The Kingdom of Bhutan emphasizes preservation of its culture, environment, and identity, while pursuing economic growth. The country’s unique
development agenda, based on the concept of Gross National Happiness, highlights a synergistic and harmonious balance between material well-being and the
spiritual, emotional, and cultural needs of individuals and society. As Bhutan pursues this goal, however, the country is experiencing a profound and rapid
transition from a largely subsistence rural economy to a more urban society. This rapid urbanization is threatening the coun try’s traditional buildings and
historic sites and undermining the practice of traditional arts and crafts. It is important that these skills and traditional knowledge are conserved because:
(a) built heritage represents the country’s unique style of architecture and urban design and preserves centuries of insig hts on adaptation to local topography
and climatic conditions; (b) traditional arts and crafts express the culture and identity of the country and are an important source of social cohesion; and (c)
the country’s cultural assets provide much of the basis for Bhutan’s competitiveness in high-value, low-volume tourism. As the country responds to new and
evolving challenges, cultural heritage conservation can be a dynamic force for its sustainable development. The proposed grant activity will pilot
conservation-led urban planning to respond to Bhutan's goal of preserving and promoting cultural values, which is a main pillar of the government’s
development philosophy. The focus will be Thimphu, the country’s largest city and its economic, administrative, and tourism center.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The PDO of this activity is to incorporate cultural heritage and sustainable tourism in the economic development of Thimphu and surrounding peri-urban
areas, and create income-earning opportunities in the heritage conservation and cultural tourism sectors for unemployed youth, women, and other vulnerable
groups. The project consist of three components:
Component 1: Strategic Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Development Plan – Update of Thimphu Structure Plan. This component
supports (a) the review of the Thimphu Structure Plan (notified in 2004), and (b) the updating and expansion of its cultural heritage and tourism elements of
that plan in order to protect heritage and integrate culture into the broader economic development of Thimphu. The activity will address cultural heritage as
both a national and local priority and involve the hiring of an international consultant to work with local planners, a series of stakeholder workshops, and
production of a planning document.
Component 2: Improvements at Changangkha Lhakhang. Component 2 finances improvements to this iconic temple founded in the 12 th century that is of
great importance for Bhutanese and is a primary tourist destination in Thimphu. The investments are based on a plan prepared by the MoWHS and approved
by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs and other key agencies. Grant funds are used to address conditions that are undermining the sanctity, safety,
and sustainability of Changangkha Lhakhang.
Component 3: Capacity Building and Awareness Raising for National and Local Government Institutions and the Private Sector. This component is a
direct response to Bhutan’s rapid urbanization, rising standards of living, escalating land prices, increasing costs of maintenance, and the pace of
reconstruction after the 2011 earthquake, all of which are factors contributing to new construction and inappropriate repair of traditional structures that
disrupt the visual harmony and value of Bhutan’s urban areas. To assist with conserving one of Bhutan’s most important cultu ral assets, its traditional
architecture and urban landscapes, the MDTF is financing the preparation, publication, and dissemination of Bhutanese architecture guidelines under this
component.


Key Results: This activity is expected to result in:
   Increased stakeholder participation in decision making related to heritage conservation and tourism development
   Improved access, safety, and sustainability of a cultural heritage site important to the local population and tourists.
   Increased awareness and appreciation of local cultural assets
   Increased national and local commitment to safeguard cultural heritage

 Project Background:
 As development proceeds apace (8 percent average growth in the past three decades), Bhutan is facing pressures on its natural endowment stemming from
 population growth, agricultural modernization, hydropower and mineral development, industrialization, urbanization and infrastructure development. In keeping
 with Bhutan’s enduring national commitment to protecting the environment , one of the five main development objectives included in Bhutan’s 20-year
 perspective of development goals, Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness is environmental conservation. Nevertheless, conservation efforts
 have been challenged by an inadequate system of prioritizing the wide range of environmental needs, weak institutions and capacity as well as limited financing.
 In recognition of the constraints, the government established the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) in 1992. A GEF grant of $10 million
 implemented during 1992-97 helped to create a permanent, well capitalized institution. In comparison to BTFEC’s notable grow th in capital from bilateral donor
 contributions and careful management of investments, its grant-making performance has been modest and below its potential. With the socio-economic
 development needs of a modernizing and growing population especially with the advent of constitutional democracy in 2008, BTFEC’s challenge has become more
 formidable. It needs to gain greater prominence, authority and credibility as an effective and reliable institution for sustained funding of conservation activities
 and for setting annual conservation priorities.

 Project Development Objective and brief component description:
 The project development objective (PDO) is to improve the operational effectiveness and institutional sustainability of the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental
 Conservation. The project components are: (1) enhancing the operational effectiveness and sustainability of BTFEC by adopting more modern governance and
 business practices and ensuring the adequacy of its resources and tools going forward; (2) improving conservation management of the high altitude northern
 areas (HANAS) that support a globally important ecosystem under threat from population growth, patterns of agricultural cultivation, livestock grazing and
 urbanization; and (3) capacity building for mainstreaming of conservation and sustainable forest and natural resource management approaches into national
 policies, strategies and plans.

Project Background:
The Remote Rural Communities Development Project (RRCDP) project area covers 26 geogs in 6 dzongkhags located in south-western and south central
Bhutan. The RRCDP is designed to improve living conditions and incomes in the country's poorer and more remote rural areas. The populations in these areas
currently rely on subsistence agriculture, and lack roads, irrigation, technologies, and community and social infrastructure that would allow them to improve
their incomes and social integration.

Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The main objective of the project is to increase agriculture productivity and access to community assets in remote rural areas by improving access to markets,
irrigation, agricultural technologies, and community infrastructure. Improvement in market access would be achieved by investments in farm roads and
marketing infrastructure. Agricultural productivity and rural incomes would increase through promotion of improved irrigation and agronomic practices and
rehabilitation of productive assets for key commodities. Community-led investments will improve the access of the poorest people to the critical and missing
infrastructure in the selected area. The RRCDP consists of three components:
Component A. Rural Infrastructure: The focus of this component is to connect the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production
potential through improved availability of irrigation.
Component B. Community, Marketing and Productive Infrastructure: This component would cover investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure,
critical community-level infrastructure, and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity.
Component C: Project Management and Institutional Strengthening: This component supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation
functions of the project. It covers: (a) technical and financial management; (b) procurement; and (c) supervision of compliance with environmental and social
safeguards. This component will strengthen the capacity of the MoAF to effectively coordinate implementation and provide procurement support to local
communities as needed.

Results:
   The Remote Rural Communities Development Project became effective mid-November 2012 and had its first implementation support mission in March
    2013. It is therefore too soon to assess progress against the PDO or report on results in relation to the intermediate outcome indicators.

    The project management team has been taking proactive steps to develop 18-month work plans for the project components; identification of geogs where
     project activities will be first implemented; started the recruitment process including the preparation of TORs for key staffing positions; and currently
     updating its operations manual and procurement plans.

    The PDO indicators are:
        o    Productivity of crops increased by at least 20 percent in targeted irrigation systems
        o    Marketed value of agricultural production increased by 20 percent in targeted area
        o    Share of beneficiaries with access to critical community infrastructure increased by 20 percent in targeted area

    The project is expected to directly benefit about 6,440 rural household living in the project area.

Project Background:
Bhutan faces a set of challenges typical of countries seeking to make a rapid transition from a mostly rural, agrarian society to one characterized by increasing
levels of education, a large number of young people looking for more opportunities and, with increased globalization, shifting expectations and aspirations on
the part of its population. It is critical for a country with such potential, yet facing a diverse set of challenges, to foster private sector-led growth and poverty
alleviation. Strengthening of the banking sector is a key pre-requisite in this.

Project Development Objective and brief component description:
This landmark investment by IFC in a leading commercial bank in Bhutan is one of IFC’s most significant and impactful investments in South Asia. IFC’s $28.5
million investment for 20 percent stake in Bhutan National Bank (BNB) marked the following milestones: IFC's first equ ity investment in Bhutan, IFC’s fourth
and largest investment in Bhutan to date, and for the country, the largest investment to-date by a foreign investor. The project brings together IFC’s two
pillars of investment and advisory services to achieve optima l results for the client. IFC’s funding will help expand the bank’s outreach into the underbanked
population of Bhutan. By capitalizing on BNB’s strong platform to reach underbanked SMEs, the expected improved access to fi nance will help address a key
impediment to private sector competitiveness.

Results:
The project will have a strong development impact on many fronts. It will initiate and generate: (i) increased access to finance in Bhutan, a frontier market,
with a sizeable underbanked and rural population, which will also support inclusive growth and job creation in the country; (ii) benefit Bhutan by providing
BNB with access to international best practices in the areas of IT, risk management, social and environmental management and corporate governance, (the
latter three are initiated) and by assisting the Bank in implementing its new growth strategy and expanding into new underserved market segments; (iii)
positive influence on the country’s developing financial market and strengthening of the cou ntry's investment climate by introducing international guidelines
and standards, thereby reducing systemic risk; and (iv) improvement in overall financial intermediation by promoting benefici al competition in the country’s
banking sector.

 Project Background:
 The Amankora project involved the construction of five luxury guest-house type resorts at different locations in Bhutan. The project operates under the
 Amanresorts brand of hotels which is recognized in the tourism industry for its ability to create high-end resorts in unique/frontier destinations. Project is funded
 with a with a long term loan of $10 million and an equity of $8 million.

 Project Development Objective and brief component description: The project contributes to the development of the tourism sector in Bhutan, more specifically
 the project has the following development impacts:

           Created a demonstration and catalytic effect with regard to attracting private investment into Bhutan in general and to higher end hotels in particular
            (The Uma, Taj etc);

           Direct and indirect job creation;

           supports the government's 'high value - low impact' approach to expanding the tourism sector in Bhutan by attracting high spending, environmentally
            conscious and culturally interested visitors to the country;

           transfers international best practices in hotel management, including service and quality standards, occupational health and safety, and environmental
            management, by an experienced sponsor to the emerging Bhutanese tourism industry;

           reduces the risk of the dominance of the Indian Rupee on Bhutan's foreign exchange reserves by generating US dollar revenues for the country; and

           encourages utilization of a significant proportion of goods and services required by the resort guests from local sources which will help develop the local
            supply base and encourage the growth of SMEs;

Results: Bhutan appeals to world travelers seeking exotic locations and unique habitats. Amankora Resorts helped address limited hospitality infrastructure to
enable the country to take advantage of its natural beauty to attract the tourist trade. The construction of the five lodges has resulted in the creation of 400-plus jobs.
These developments have also stimulated an arts community, as local craftspeople, artisans, and performers benefit from tourist spending.

 Key Partners:
 The sponsors of the Amankora project are: (i) Bhutan Hotels Limited (BHL), a company incorporated in Bhutan and fully owned by Silverlink Holdings Limited a
 BVI-registered company and the owner of the Aman resorts brand of luxury hotels; and (ii) Bhutan Tourism Corporation Limited (BTCL), a publicly listed
 Bhutanese company and the third largest tour operator in Bhutan.

Project Background:
According to Doing Business 2010, Bhutan’s ranking in ease of doing business and starting a business was #126 (#124 in 2009) and #80 (#66 in 2009)
respectively. In this context, the Royal Government of Bhutan undertook a broad scope of reforms to improve efficiency of its services. The Economic
Development Policy (2010) set the goal of reducing the burden of compliance through elimination of overlapping approvals and streamlining requirements
for business start-up and operations by 2011.

As requsted by the government, IFC conducted an inventory of business licenses and identified 119 licenses (issued by 29 agencies). The inventory also
identified business entry constraints such as, inefficient and cumbersome procedures related to ex-ante licenses, systemic shortcomings including gaps in the
regulatory basis, duplication of information required by different issuing agencies, and poor access to information which affects both domestic and foreign
investors.

To improve business licensing in Bhutan, IFC designed this project to play a special role by focusing on the in-depth analysis of key technical licenses, bringing
knowledge of good international practice and corresponding regulatory changes. In addition, the project covers system-wide reforms to introduce good
practice in business licensing and to develop an electronic Licensign e-portal containing information related to business licenses.

Project Development Objective and brief component description:
This project will help the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) improve regulatory requirements underlying selected business licenses and promote
streamlining, and achieve at least 25 percent time savings to the private sector due to process streamlining of three selected priority licenses, and better
availability, quality and transparency of licensing information with a targeted 10 percent reduction in compliance costs for entry licenses made more
accessible through improved provision of information.

Licensing Policy: The project is supporing the government to adopt a Licensing Policy to apply international good practices in business licensing.
Information Access: The project is supporting the government to improve information both online (www.g2b.gov.bt) and at the issuing agencies’ offices.
Prirority License Reform: The project identified three priority licneses namely, FDI Approval, Project Approval and Environmental Clearance for in-depth
reform.
The project has aimed to contribute to the following impacts by April, 2015 (i.e. three years after project completion)
•          $1 million compliance cost savings;
•          $10 million FDI facilitation.

 Results:
    G2B Licensing e-Portal developed and launched. PM issued Executive Order prioritizing the e-Portal for G2B interface.
    Information about licensing made more available through Information Charters and Brochures for 11 pilot licenses.
    FDI Approval process and Policy streamlined making it significantly faster to get FDI approvals. For the priority sectors the time reduction is from 213
     days to 10.5 days and compliance cost savings is $1.07 million.
    Domestic Project approval for medium and large businesses has been streamlined making it faster and easier.
