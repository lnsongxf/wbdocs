Guiding Principles of Warehouse Receipt
Financing Reform
To be successful, the introduction of a warehouse receipt system (WRS) needs to be built upon
the following key elements:



Principle 1
Warehouse receipt financing reform makes sense            the introduction of the system can have detrimen-
only if certain conditions are met—from having            tal consequences; readiness assessments need to

Principle 2
Regulation seeks to establish trade instruments           to be included in the WRS through the legislative
and to define the ways to use them; as such, cer-         reform process (Module 5—Legislative Reform
tain specific features of warehouse receipts need         Content)



Principle 3
Regulation by itself cannot ensure that a WRS             •	 Warehouse operators have a key part to play.
would function properly; trust in the system is key;        Their role will need to be well defined and
stakeholder engagement will be a determining                made appealing for the private sector, as their

Principle 4
Establishing a proper legal and regulatory                implementation of a WRS, from the system’s
framework is just a first step. Many other criti-         supervision to issues pertaining to warehousing
cal challenges have to be overcome during the             standards, or insurance coverage, among others.

     Step 1
     The Depositor Brings the Commodity to the Warehouse
     for Safekeeping
                The WRS process starts when a deposi-         safekeeping. Traders, on their end, may opt for the

     the low farm gate price they are offered and instead     ing capital costs (e.g., financing their stocks of raw
     have their goods transported to the warehouse for        materials and/or finished products).




18
    Box 1—Costs Borne by Depositors



    Three types of costs need to be considered by depositors when participating in a WRS:

    •	 Transportation and logistical costs associated with bringing the goods to the warehouse;

    •	 Storage fees charged by the warehouse operator for handling and storing services (including any grad-
       ing, drying, cleaning, fumigating fees that may be required to store the goods properly);

    •	 Financing costs (i.e., interest and fees) charged by the bank for financing the goods in storage in case the
       warehouse receipt is used as collateral for a loan.

    Those costs should be offset by the benefits of:

    •	 Lower potential post-harvest losses due to inadequate local or self-storage;

    •	 Delayed sale during oversupply market conditions and possible price increases after harvest season;

    •	 Opportunity to have products graded as part of the storage process;

    •	 Availability of insurance coverage; and,

    •	 Access to credit opportunities, using the warehouse receipt as collateral.

    Moreover, in many cases, storage fees charged as part of a WRS are regulated and standardized, and designed
    to be affordable for users. Similarly, financing costs tend to be lower than those charged for other financial
    products thanks to the system’s standardized approach and the lower risks offered to banks by the WRS.




Step 2
The Warehouse Operator Issues a Warehouse Receipt
          Upon reception of the goods from                    storage contract that specifies the fees for storage

       A GUIDE TO WAREHOUSE RECEIPT FINANCING REFORM




         Box 2—Common Features of Warehouse Receipts



         Once the goods enter a warehouse and once a warehouse receipt is issued for them, certain common
         features—and certain rights for the warehouse receipt holder—are derived from the warehouse receipt:

         •	 Ownership of the goods stored—Unless the warehouse receipt is sold to someone else, the
            depositor—just as the person who parks their car in the garage or stores their luggage in a staffed locker
            room or hands an overcoat to a coat check—remains the legal owner of the goods. As explained in a
            prior section, warehouse receipts are a document of title representing the goods stored. The owner of
            a valid warehouse receipt is therefore the rightful owner of the goods stored. Even in the case of the
            warehouse operator’s bankruptcy, the warehouse receipt owner remains the owner of the goods, as
            those goods are never considered to form part of the warehouse operators’ assets;

         •	 Transfer of ownership—A warehouse receipt is a document whose ownership can be transferred and
            transferring the ownership of the receipt (i.e., selling the receipt) corresponds to transferring the owner-
            ship of the underlying goods stored in the warehouse. The modalities of the transfer or sale, by negotia-
            tion or assignment, will depend on whether the warehouse receipt is negotiable or non-negotiable and
            will be explored in further detail when describing Steps 5 & 6;

         •	 Pledging the receipt and the underlying goods stored—As highlighted previously, a warehouse
            receipt can also be used as collateral for a loan, as pledging the receipt is equivalent to pledging the
            underlying goods. The modalities of pledging warehouse receipts will be explored in further detail when
            describing Steps 3 & 4;

         •	 Rights against third parties—Except in case of theft, the rights of the warehouse receipt owner over
            the goods deposited normally take precedence over claims of subsequent good faith purchasers or
            pledgees;

         •	 Rights against the warehouse operator—The warehouse operator is liable to take proper care of the
            goods when handling and storing them and only the warehouse receipt owner can decide when the
            goods are released from the warehouse. The rights and duties of the warehouse operator will be detailed
            further when describing Steps 7 & 8.




     Steps 3 & 4
     The Depositor Pledges the Warehouse Receipt and Receives a Loan
     from the Bank
                           As shown in Figure 3, if a              Should the depositor decide to wait, he or she can
                           buyer offers a purchase price           reach out to a financial institution partnering with
                           that is deemed sufficient by            the WRS to obtain a loan using the warehouse

depositor of the goods—could use the receipt                      the buyer could legitimately keep the goods in
as collateral for a loan while they still possess the             storage, go to a bank and pledge the rightfully
receipt. Taking the example shown in Figure 3,                    acquired receipt (i.e., in such case, the process
after having received ownership of the warehouse                  would resemble Step 3 of Figure 2).



       Box 3—Pledging the Warehouse Receipt



       In order for a bank to grant a loan using a warehouse receipt and the underlying stored goods as collateral,
       it must evaluate risks related to both the depositor (borrower) AND the warehouse operator. In many cases,
       banks limit their warehouse receipt lending to a small number of pre-qualified warehouses with which they
       have a close relationship and regularly monitor.

       In practice, the borrower completes a loan application process and relinquishes the warehouse receipt to the
       bank. The loan is usually provided against only a percentage of the current market value of the commodity in
       storage. This might range from 50 to 80% and is valued this way to take into consideration potential price
       fluctuations of the commodity and the likely costs involved in recovering and then liquidating the commod-
       ity, should the borrower fail to repay the loan.

       Not all banks are willing to lend against warehouse receipts. Those that do apply three elements of collat-
       eralized credit:

       •	 Verification: The bank must be able to verify that the goods exist and belong to the borrower;

       •	 Valuation: The bank must be able to determine the amount the borrower is likely to receive when the
          goods are sold;

       •	 Control: The bank must be able to ensure that the goods or their proceeds will be used to repay the
          loan.

       Warehouse receipt systems fulfill these three criteria. The goods are deposited in a warehouse that is autho-
       rized under local law to issue warehouse receipts that show the quantity, quality and location of the goods.
       The law will provide that the holder of the warehouse receipt (now the bank) is the legal owner of the
       goods, has the sole right to authorize the warehouse to release the goods, and has the right to sell the
       goods by delivery of the warehouse receipt to the warehouse operator or a buyer.4




Steps 5 & 6
The Depositor Sells the Goods to a Buyer
                           While the goods are in stor-           charge of finding a buyer. Once the depositor and

     in charge of paying the outstanding storage



         Box 4—Selling the Goods, Selling the Warehouse Receipt



         As was explained above, the warehouse receipt represents the goods in storage and it can be transferred to
         another person as a direct sale or given to a bank as security for a loan.

         The modalities of transfer of a warehouse receipt will depend on whether the receipt is negotiable or
         non-negotiable:

         •	 Negotiable warehouse receipts—Such receipts can be issued “to the bearer,” i.e., to anyone in physi-
            cal possession of the receipt, in which case the ownership of the goods is transferred simply by delivery
            of the warehouse receipt. To sell the receipt and the underlying goods, one needs only to physically give
            the receipt to the buyer. Negotiable warehouse receipts can also be issued to the order of a person XYZ.
            In that case the “negotiation” or sale of the goods is complete when the receipt is delivered AND the
            buyer (i.e., the subsequent holder of the warehouse receipt) endorses the receipt.

         •	 Non-negotiable warehouse receipts—Such receipts are issued to a specific individual, “person XYZ.”
            Their transfer requires three steps:
             i.	 An agreement between the receipt holder and the buyer;
             ii.	 Sending a written notice to the warehouse operator; and
            iii.	 A confirmation from the warehouse operator that the goods are now held in the warehouse on
                  behalf of the buyer.

     indicated on it.

Box 5—The Duties and Rights of the Warehouse Operator



The warehouse operator plays a key role in a WRS. As discussed previously, depositors need to trust that the
goods they bring to the warehouse will be kept safely and returned to them intact when need be. Similarly,
banks will agree to extend loans against warehouse receipts only if they are convinced of the warehouse
receipt’s trustworthiness and therefore of the warehouse operator’s reliability. As a result, the role of the
warehouse operator—his or her duties and rights—needs to be clearly defined for the WRS to flourish.

The Duties of the Warehouse Operator

The duties of warehouse operators licensed as part of a WRS are generally specified in the law. They are
deemed responsible for the following:

•	 Due care—The warehouse operator is expected to take due care of the goods when handling and stor-
   ing them. Due care implies that the operator will protect the goods from a set of risks ranging from theft,
   to weather hazards, to infestation by pests and disease; and

•	 Delivery—Ultimately the warehouse operator must be able to deliver the goods according to the speci-
   fications indicated on the warehouse receipt and the storage contract in terms of quantity and quality
   upon presentation of the receipt.

It should be noted that the warehouse receipt and/or the storage contract may indicate an accepted range
of variations in quantity and quality due to the handling and storage of the goods (e.g., cleaning and drying
the goods will result in a weight loss due to the removal of impurities and a decrease in humidity as well as
in an improvement in quality).

Appropriate legislation and robust enforcement mechanisms will ensure that the above-mentioned duties
are duly fulfilled. As seen previously, with such safeguards, the goods will for instance remain the property
of the warehouse receipt owner and be available to him or her even in case of the warehouse operator’s
bankruptcy.

The Rights of the Warehouse Operator

In exchange for the above-mentioned duties, the warehouse operator has certain rights.

•	 Unpaid fees—If there are outstanding storage and handling fees at the time the warehouse receipt
   owner comes to retrieve the goods, the warehouse operator can keep the commodity until payment is
   received or sell a portion of the commodity to cover costs as is likely specified in the storage contract;

•	 Delay—If no one comes pick up the goods within the agreed upon timeframe, the warehouse operator
   is authorized to sell the goods to cover his or her fees. In case of unpaid fees or delay, the warehouse
   operator has to return the excess profit to the warehouse receipt owner, when he or she comes to claim
   the goods, if the proceeds of the sale exceed what was owed to the warehouse operator; and

•	 Loan default—When a depositor defaults on a loan where the commodity in storage was used as col-
   lateral, the warehouse operator can claim the fees directly from the bank when it comes to reclaim the
   stored goods. In this case the warehouse operator is considered to hold a lien over the stored goods.
   This legal term essentially means that the warehouse operator has a legal claim over the goods to secure
   payment of the outstanding fees.

     Risk Management
     When implementing WRS legislation reforms, it is              most common risks throughout the WRS reform
     possible to encounter general risks that are com-             process and how the Program Management Team

     cal risks and/or financial risks. There are also risks        should be noted that a different set of risks will be
     that are more specific to warehousing legislation,            encountered when implementing the WRS once
     which could be considered as technical risks. The             the law and regulations are in place.

         Box 6: Advantages of Mapping the Existing Legal Environment



         The mapping approach has a number of practical advantages:

         •	 It will assist in assessing the extent of the reform needed;

         •	 It will assist in determining one of two methods of reform:

            •	 Enacting new warehousing legislation with harmonization of related legislation; or

            •	 Reforming existing legislation without enacting new legislation;

         •	 It provides a simple and clear reference for the extent of the reform required on existing legislation;

         •	 It assists law reformers to understand modern warehousing legislation and its components;

         •	 It allows for a continuous and updated procedure of reform taking into account any intervening amend-

     or warehouse receipts under a pre-existing contract
     of sale. Only a buyer that takes possession of the
     goods or warehouse receipts covering such goods or
     has a right to recover such goods under applicable
     laws may be a buyer in the ordinary course of busi-
     ness. “Buyer in ordinary course of business” does not

     bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfac-
     tion of a money debt.
     (d) “Delivery order” means a record that contains an
     order to deliver goods directed to a warehouse.
     (e) “Fungible Goods” means (A) goods of which any
     unit, by nature or usage of trade, is the equivalent of
     any other like unit; or (B) goods that by agreement
     are treated as equivalent.
     (f) “Good faith” means honesty in fact and the
     observance of reasonable commercial standards of
     fair dealing.
     (g) “Goods” means all things that are treated as
     movable for the purposes of a contract for storage or
     transportation.

                                                              without some definitive sense of how the third party
                                                              registry systems will be structured. Systems that are
                                                              evolving to date tend to be “closed” systems in which
                                                              all participants must sign on to the master agreement

                                                              systems, the warehouse receipt never leaves the system
                                                              so the parties rely upon the master agreement as to
                                                              rights against the registry for its failures in dealing

                          control mechanism in this statute provides a method
                          for the participants in the closed system to achieve the
                          benefits of obtaining control allowed by this Section.
                          The Act also contemplates that parties will evolve open

                          agreement. In an open system a party that is expecting
                          to obtain rights through an electronic document may
                          not be a party to the master agreement. To the extent
                          that open systems evolve by use of the control concept
                          contained in this section, the law of contracts, agency,
                          and torts as it applies to the registry’s misfeasance or
                          negligence concerning the transfer of control of the
                          electronic document will allocate the risks and liabilities
                          of the parties as that other law now does so for third
                          parties who hold tangible documents and fail to deliver
                          the documents.

     (c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of
     presenting claims and commencing actions based on
     the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt
     or storage agreement.
     (d) This section does not modify or repeal any statute
     that imposes a higher responsibility upon the ware-
     house or invalidates a contractual limitation that would
     be permissible under this Act.

against the bailor for the maximum amount specified           house and the warehouse issued a warehouse receipt
on the receipt for charges other than those specified         for those goods. In the warehouse receipt it is stated
in subsection (a), such as for money advanced and             that the warehouse will also have a lien on goods cov-

                                                Example 5: Same facts as Examples 2 and 4 except the
                                                warehouse had stated on the negotiable warehouse
                                                receipt a specified amount or rate for the general lien
                                                on other goods (lot B). Under the last sentence of
                                                subsection (a), the general lien on lot A goods for the
                                                storage charges and the other expenses arising from
                                                storage of lot B goods is enforceable as against the
                                                person to whom the receipt has been duly negotiated.
                                                2. Subsection (b) provides for a security interest based
                                                upon agreement. Such a security interest arises out of
                                                relations between the parties other than bailment for
                                                storage, as where the bailee assumes the role of finan-
                                                cier or performs a manufacturing operation, extend-
                                                ing credit in reliance upon the goods covered by the
                                                receipt. Such a security interest is not a statutory lien.
                                                It is governed in all respects by the secured transac-
                                                tions regime of the country, except that subsection (b)
                                                requires that the receipt specify a maximum amount
                                                and limits the security interest to the amount speci-
                                                fied. A warehouse could also take a security interest to
                                                secure its charges for storage and the other expenses
                                                listed in subsection (a) to protect these claims upon the
                                                loss of the statutory possessory warehouse lien if the
                                                warehouse loses possession of the goods as provided in
                                                subsection (e).
                                                Example 6: Bailor stores goods with a warehouse and
                                                the warehouse issues a warehouse receipt that states
                                                that the warehouse is taking a security interest in the
                                                bailed goods for charges of storage, expenses, for
                                                money advanced, for manufacturing services rendered,
                                                and all other obligations that the bailor may owe the
                                                warehouse. As allowed by subsection (b), a warehouse
                                                may rely upon its statutory possessory lien to protect
                                                its charges for storage and the other expenses related
                                                to storage. For those storage charges covered by the
                                                statutory possessory lien, the warehouse is not required
                                                to use a security interest under subsection (b).
                                                3. Subsections (a) and (b) validate the lien and security
                                                interest “against the bailor.” Under basic principles
                                                of derivative rights as provided in Section 404, the
                                                warehouse lien is also valid as against parties who
                                                obtain their rights from the bailor except as other-
                                                wise provided in subsection (a), third sentence, or
                                                subsection (c).

Sections of the Law                         Draftsman’s Commentary

                              Example 7: Bailor stores goods with a warehouse and
                              the warehouse issues a nonnegotiable warehouse
                              receipt that also claims a general lien in other goods
                              stored with the warehouse. A lien on the bailed goods
                              for the charges for storage and the other expenses
                              arises under subsection (a). Bailor notifies the ware-
                              house that the goods have been sold to Buyer and
                              the bailee acknowledges that fact to the Buyer. The
                              warehouse lien for storage of those goods is effec-
                              tive against Buyer for both the specific lien and the
                              general lien (see Section 404).
                              Example 8: Bailor stores goods with a warehouse and
                              the warehouse issues a nonnegotiable warehouse
                              receipt. A lien on the bailed goods for the charges for
                              storage and the other expenses arises under subsection
                              (a). Bailor grants a security interest in the goods while
                              the goods are in the warehouse’s possession to Secured
                              Party (SP) who properly perfects a security interest in the
                              goods under the secured transactions regime. The ware-
                              house lien is superior in priority over SP’s security interest.
                              Example 9: Bailor stores goods with a warehouse and
                              the warehouse issues a negotiable warehouse receipt.
                              A lien on the bailed goods for the charges for stor-
                              age and the other expenses arises under subsection
                              (a). Bailor grants a security interest in the negotiable
                              document to SP. SP properly perfects its interest in the
                              negotiable document by taking possession through
                              a “due negotiation” (see Section 401). SP’s security
                              interest is subordinate to the warehouse lien (see
                              Section 209 (a), third sentence). Given that bailor’s
                              rights are subject to the warehouse lien, the bailor
                              cannot grant to the SP greater rights than the bailor
                              has, therefore perfection of the security interest in the
                              negotiable document and the goods covered by the
                              document through SP’s filing of a financing statement
                              should not give a different result.
                              As against third parties who have interests in the
                              goods prior to the storage with the warehouse,
                              subsection (c) provides that to validate the lien or
                              security interest of the warehouse, the owner must
                              have entrusted the goods to the depositor, and that
                              the circumstances must be such that a pledge by the
                              depositor to a good faith purchaser for value would
                              have been valid. Thus the owner’s interest will not be
                              subjected to a lien or security interest arising out of a
                              deposit of its goods by a thief. The warehouse may be
                              protected because of the actual, implied or apparent
                              authority of the depositor, or because of other cir-
                              cumstances which would protect a bona fide pledgee,
                              unless those circumstances are denied effect under

                Sections of the Law                          Draftsman’s Commentary

                                                purposes of clarity. The draftsman’s comments to Sec-

                                                ment or acquiescence.
                                                As to household goods, however, subsection (d) makes
                                                the warehouse’s lien “for charges and expenses in rela-
                                                tion to the goods” effective against all persons if the
                                                depositor was the legal possessor. The purpose of the
                                                exception is to permit the warehouse to accept house-
                                                hold goods for storage in sole reliance on the value of
                                                the goods themselves, especially in situations of family
                                                emergency.
                                                Example 10: Bailor grants a perfected security inter-
                                                est in the goods to SP prior to storage of the goods
                                                with the warehouse. Bailor then stores goods with the
                                                warehouse and the warehouse issues a warehouse
                                                receipt for the goods. A warehouse lien on the bailed
                                                goods for the charges for storage or other expenses
                                                arises under subsection (a). The warehouse lien is not
                                                effective as against SP unless SP entrusted the goods
                                                to the bailor with actual or apparent authority to store
                                                or sell the goods or with power of disposition under
                                                subsection (c) (1) or acquiesced in the bailor’s procure-
                                                ment of a warehouse receipt under subsection (c) (2).
                                                This result obtains whether the receipt is negotiable or
                                                nonnegotiable.
                                                Example 11: Sheriff who had lawfully repossessed
                                                household goods in an eviction action stored the goods
                                                with a warehouse. A lien on the bailed goods arises
                                                under subsection (a). The lien is effective as against the
                                                owner of the goods (see subsection (d)).
                                                4. This section creates a statutory possessory lien in
                                                favor of the warehouse on the goods stored with the
                                                warehouse or on the proceeds of the goods. The ware-
                                                house loses its lien if it loses possession of the goods or
                                                the proceeds (see subsection (e)).
                                                5. Where goods have been stored under a nonnego-
                                                tiable warehouse receipt and are sold by the person
                                                to whom the receipt has been issued, frequently the
                                                goods are not withdrawn by the new owner. The statu-
                                                tory lien for charges on the goods sold, granted by the
                                                first sentence of subsection (a), continues valid unless
                                                the warehouse gives it up. See Section 303. But once a
                                                new receipt is issued to the buyer, the buyer becomes
                                                “the person on whose account the goods are held”
                                                under the second sentence of subsection (a); unless
                                                the buyer undertakes liability for charges in relation to
                                                other goods stored by the seller, there is no general
                                                lien against the buyer for such charges. Of course, the
                                                bailee may preserve the general lien in such a case
                                                either by an arrangement by which the buyer “is liable
                                                for” such charges, or by reserving a security interest
                                                under subsection (b).

        (4) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable
        place to where the goods are held or stored.

        notification, an advertisement of the sale must be
        published once a week for two weeks consecutively
        in a newspaper of general circulation where the
        sale is to be held. The advertisement must include
        a description of the goods, the name of the person
        on whose account the goods are being held, and
        the time and place of the sale. The sale must take
        place at least 15 days after the first publication. If
        there is no newspaper of general circulation where
        the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be

     incurred in complying with this section. In that event,

     warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this
     article.
     (d) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pur-
     suant to this section.
     (e) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce
     a warehouse’s lien takes the goods free of any rights
     of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the
     warehouse’s noncompliance with this section.
     (f) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds
     of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the
     balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person
     to which the warehouse would have been bound to
     deliver the goods.
     (g) The rights provided by this section are in addition
     to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against
     a debtor.
     (h) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the
     course of its business, the lien may be enforced in
     accordance with subsection (a) or (b).
     (i) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure
     to comply with the requirements for sale under this
     section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for

(c) Endorsement of a non-negotiable warehouse             Any notice on the document sufficient to put a mer-
receipt neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the       chant on inquiry as to the “regular course” quality of
transferee’s rights.                                      the transaction will frustrate a “due negotiation.” Thus
                                                          irregularity of the warehouse receipt or unexplained
                                                          staleness may appropriately be recognized as negating
                                                          a negotiation in “regular” course.
                                                          A pre-existing claim constitutes value, and “due
                                                          negotiation” does not require “new value.” A usual

                                                          received as security for credit previously extended may
                                                          be in “regular” course, even though there is a demand
                                                          for additional collateral because the creditor “deems
                                                          himself insecure.” But the matter has moved out of the
                                                          regular course of financing if the debtor is thought to
                                                          be insolvent, the credit previously extended is in effect
                                                          cancelled, and the creditor snatches a plank in the
                                                          shipwreck under the guise of a demand for additional

                                                          disappears, as the case is explicitly excepted from “due

                                                          holder no matter how the holder acquired possession
                                                          or control of the document.

                                                          negotiation results from a delivery to a banker or buyer

                                                          person making the bailment. There is no presumption
                                                          of irregularity in such a negotiation; it may very well be
                                                          in “regular course.”

                            Again, where the seller allows a buyer to receive goods
                            under a contract for sale, though as a “conditional
                            delivery” or under “cash sale” terms and on explicit
                            agreement for immediate payment, the buyer thereby
                            acquires power to defeat the seller’s interest by transfer
                            of the goods to certain good faith purchasers. Both in
                            policy and under the language of subsection (a) (1) that
                            same power must be extended to accomplish the same
                            result if the buyer procures a negotiable document of
                            title to the goods and duly negotiates it.
                            This Comment 1 should be considered in interpreting
                            delivery, entrustment or acquiescence in application of
                            Section 209 (c).
                            2. Under subsection (a) a delivery order issued by a
                            person having no right in or power over the goods is
                            ineffective unless the owner acts as provided in subsec-
                            tion (a) (1) or (2). Thus the rights of a transferee of a
                            nonnegotiable warehouse receipt can be defeated by
                            a delivery order subsequently issued by the transferor
                            only if the transferee “delivers or entrusts” to the “per-
                            son procuring” the delivery order or “acquiesces” in
                            that person’s procurement. Similarly, a second delivery
                            order issued by the same issuer for the same goods will
                            ordinarily be subject to the first, both under this section
                            and under Section 302. After a delivery order is validly
                            issued but before it is accepted, it may nevertheless be
                            defeated under subsection (b) in much the same way
                            that the rights of a transferee may be defeated under
                            Section 404. For example, a buyer in ordinary course
                            from the issuer may defeat the rights of the holder of
                            a prior delivery order if the bailee receives notification
                            of the buyer’s rights before notification of the holder’s
                            rights. (Section 404 (b) (2)). But an accepted delivery
                            order has the same effect as a document issued by the
                            bailee.

                                                           Subsections (b) (1) & (2) require delivery of the goods
                                                           to enable other creditors, buyers and lessees of the

                                                           Delivery of the goods means the voluntary transfer of
                                                           physical possession of the goods. For this reason hold-

Section 405. Indorser Not Guarantor for Other              This section is limited to tangible negotiable receipts as
Parties.                                                   the concept of endorsement is irrelevant to electronic
                                                           documents of title or to nonnegotiable documents.

                                                           to be directed towards perfecting the transferee’s rights
                                                           rather than towards assuming additional obligations.
                                                           The language of the present section, however, does
                                                           not preclude the one case in which an endorsement
                                                           given for value guarantees future action, namely, that
                                                           in which the bailee has not yet become liable upon the
                                                           document at the time of the endorsement. Under such
                                                           circumstances the endorser, of course, engages that
                                                           appropriate honor of the document by the bailee will
                                                           occur (see Section 402 (a) (4) as to negotiable delivery
                                                           orders). However, even in such a case, once the bailee

                                                           been fulfilled and the policy of this section excludes any

Right to Compel Indorsement.                               concept of endorsement is irrelevant to electronic

                                                           it clear that an endorsement generally imposes no

                                                           on “due negotiation”). Similarly, despite the transfer to
