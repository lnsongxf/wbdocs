DISBURSEMENTS AND FUND BALANCE
June 30, 2014 and 2013
Expressed in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted



Note 1 - Organization and operations
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development
Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA), herein collectively referred to as “the Bank”, enter into legal agreements, individually or
                                                            1
jointly, with various external Development Partners (DPs). The Bank is the Administrator and/or Trustee of
such trust funds. IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA are members of the World Bank Group, which also includes the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

Trust funds generally provide grants to meet diverse development needs, including project preparation,
technical assistance, advisory services, debt relief, post conflict transition, disaster recovery, climate change
and co-financing of lending projects.

IBRD performs certain administrative, accounting, financial reporting and treasury services related to trust
funds’ activities on behalf of the Bank.

Basis of combination

Individual trust funds, which are administered by the Bank and are reported using the modified cash basis of
accounting, as described in Note 2, are included in the Combined Statements of Receipts, Disbursements and
Fund Balance (the Statements) except for those not yet confirmed by the DPs. The list of trust funds that are
included in the Statements is provided in Annex 1. These trust funds are referred to as “modified cash basis
trust funds” and are combined for the purpose of presenting the Statements.

In addition to the modified cash basis trust funds, the Bank administers a number of other trust funds which
are reported under a special purpose basis of accounting. These trust funds are separately audited and
excluded from the Statements. If the basis of reporting for these trust funds changes to modified cash basis
and is confirmed by the DPs, they may be combined in the Statements (see Note 4).

    Development partners represent any entity, including the Bank, that contributes to a trust fund.

                                                                                   MODIFIED CASH BASIS TRUST FUNDS

Activities of the modified cash basis trust funds are carried out primarily in the following ways:

Recipient-executed activities

Recipient-executed trust funds involve activities carried out by recipient third-party executing agencies
(Recipients). The Bank enters into legal agreements with and disburses funds to those Recipients, who then
exercise spending authority to carry out development activities and finance the investment and recurrent
needs of service delivery, capacity building and technical assistance. Recipients also submit progress and
audited financial reports to the Bank.

Bank-executed activities

Bank-executed trust funds involve activities executed by the Bank, as described in the relevant legal
agreements with DPs, for (i) supporting the Bank’s own work program, including analytical and advisory
services, (ii) trust fund administration, and (iii) other project-related activities. Spending authority is exercised
by the Bank. The Bank prepares the terms of reference, procures goods and services from suppliers, makes
payment, and submits progress and financial reports for these activities to DPs.

Financial intermediary funds

Financial intermediary funds comprise a heterogeneous mix of trust funds not covered by either the Bank-
executed or Recipient-executed categories. They include trust funds with complex financial structures or
arrangements in which the Bank provides specific administrative or financial services with a limited fiduciary
or operational role. Arrangements include the administration of a variety of debt service trust funds, fiscal
agency services funds and other more specialized limited fund management roles. Financial intermediary
funds hold and disburse funds in accordance with the instructions from DPs, or in some cases the governing
bodies operating on behalf of the DPs.



Note 2 - Significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation

The Statements have been prepared on the cash receipts and disbursements basis of accounting, modified to
record the modified cash basis trust funds’ share in the pooled cash and investments at fair value (modified
cash basis of accounting). Accordingly, net investment income includes realized and unrealized gains/losses
(see Note 7).




                                                                                                           9
                                                                             MODIFIED CASH BASIS TRUST FUNDS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF RECEIPTS,
DISBURSEMENTS AND FUND BALANCE
June 30, 2014 and 2013
Expressed in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted



The modified cash basis of accounting is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS); therefore, the Statements are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with U.S. GAAP or IFRS.
Receipts, with the exception of net investment income as described above, are reported when collected (i.e.,
when credited to the modified cash basis trust funds) rather than when pledged/earned, and disbursements
are reported when paid (i.e., when debited to the modified cash basis trust funds) rather than when incurred.

For example, the following transactions may be incurred in a different period than reported: (1) contributions
not credited to the modified cash basis trust funds at the period end date due to timing or other reasons, and
(2) any refunds of previous disbursements deemed by the Bank, to be ineligible in accordance with the
relevant legal agreements with the DPs.

Foreign currency adjustment

The Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the reporting currency.

    (i)      Transactions in currencies other than U.S. dollars are reported at the market rates of exchange in
             effect on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency gains or losses as a result of currency
             conversions are reported as foreign currency adjustment.

    (ii)     Project-related disbursements and administrative fees and expenses, made from the Bank’s
             resources, on behalf of the modified cash basis trust funds (refer to Notes 10 and 11), are
             reimbursed to the Bank by those trust funds on a regular basis. To the extent that disbursements
             are made in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Bank may be reimbursed a different amount
             due to the difference in exchange rates on various dates, and such transaction gains or losses on
             disbursements, if any, are borne by IBRD, on behalf of the Bank, and result in no foreign currency
             adjustment to the modified cash basis trust funds.

    (iii)    At the end of each reporting period, fund balances that are not denominated in U.S. dollars are
             revalued at the market rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the respective reporting period.
             Any adjustment resulting from currency exchange rate changes is reported as foreign currency
             adjustment in the Statements.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions based upon
information available as of the date of the Statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Areas
in which management makes estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts to be recorded include
the fair value of modified cash basis trust funds’ share of the pooled cash and investments .



                                                                                                       10
                                                                          MODIFIED CASH BASIS TRUST FUNDS

Note 3 – Trust Funds’ share of the cash and investments in the Pool
Amounts paid into the modified cash basis trust funds, but not yet disbursed, are managed by IBRD, on behalf
of the Bank, which maintains an investment portfolio (the Pool) for all of the trust funds administered by the
World Bank Group. IBRD, on behalf of the World Bank Group, maintains all trust fund assets separate and
apart from the funds of the World Bank Group.

The Pool is a trading portfolio and is reported at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains/losses included
in net investment income. The share in the pooled cash and investments represents the modified cash basis
trust funds’ share of the Pool’s fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Generally, the Pool includes cash and liquid financial instruments such as government and agency obligations,
time deposits, money market securities, and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Pool includes derivative
contracts such as currency forward contracts, currency swaps, interest rate swaps, and contracts to purchase
or sell mortgage-backed securities to-be-announced (TBAs). Payables and receivables associated with the
investment activities are also included in the Pool. The Pool may also include securities pledged as collateral
under repurchase agreements as well as derivatives with other counterparties. The Pool may also include
securities receivable from resale agreements as well as derivatives for which it has accepted collateral.

The Pool is divided into sub-portfolios to which allocations are made based on fund specific investment
horizons, risk tolerances and/or other eligibility requirements for trust funds with common characteristics as
determined by IBRD, on behalf of the World Bank Group. An individual sub-portfolio may hold all or a portion
of the types of financial instruments held by the Pool.

The modified cash basis trust funds’ share of cash and investments in the Pool has a fair value of $12,218
million as of June 30, 2014 (2013: $12,051 million). The modified cash basis trust funds’ share in the Pool is
not traded in any market; however, the underlying assets within the Pool are reported at fair value. All
investment decisions are made and performance is monitored at the Pool level.



Note 4 - Trust fund brought into the Statements
Effective January 1, 2013, pursuant to the change in the basis of reporting to the modified cash basis of
accounting, the Ozone Projects Trust Fund was included in the Statements for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2013. The fund balance of this trust fund as of December 31, 2012, was reported as ‘Trust fund
brought into the Statements’.       No trust funds were brought into scope during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2014.
