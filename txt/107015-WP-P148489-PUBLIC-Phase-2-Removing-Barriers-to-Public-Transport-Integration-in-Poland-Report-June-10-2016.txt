     Box 1: Public Transport in Olsztyn


     The City of Olsztyn provides bus services within the city and certain neighboring municipalities under
     gross-cost contracts with three operators. MPK Olsztyn has been designated as the city’s internal
     operator, under EU regulations, and it operates approximately 90 percent of city bus services. Two
     further bundles of ca. 10 percent and ca. 20 percent of services are operated by privately owned KDD and
     Irex / Meteor under 10-year contracts with the city. All city buses bear the same livery as will the new
     tram service to reinforce the integration of all city transport services. The city has decided to extend
     MPK’s mandate to include operation and maintenance of the new tram service; consideration was given
     to tendering the service to third parties, but it was decided that better value and integration would be
     achieved by using the city’s internal operator. A joint bus and tram operator will also facilitate
     reconfiguration of the public transport network and redeployment of staff when passenger service begins
     on the tramway and certain bus services will be withdrawn.

     Olsztyn’s city bus services extend to three municipalities adjacent to Olsztyn; these are Dywity, Purda,
     and Stawiguda. The city bus network had served all five municipalities adjacent to the city until around
     2010, but Olsztyn City Council decided that it could not afford to provide operating subvention for such
     an extensive network and some of the neighboring municipalities were unwilling to contribute
     sufficiently for the high-quality service that the city provides. Bus services that cross city boundaries into
     adjoining municipalities account for a small proportion of overall vehicle kilometers.

network are highly differentiated, exclusive rights
can also adversely affect markets that could
otherwise be vibrant, competitive markets and
effectively transform them into monopolies,
leading to an increasing need for subsidy

The 2010 Public Transport Act states in Article 20
that exclusive rights as defined under EC
Regulation 1370/2007 cannot be granted in
Poland. In some cases, the lack of exclusive rights
in the Polish legislation may lead local authorities
not to cover networks with the PSO, and therefore
realizing neither integrated transport schemes
nor quality improvement, due to the risks linked
with this situation, there will be areas where no
operator would be ready to accept at a reasonable
price a contract that is potentially submitted to
competition by other cream-skimming
companies.28

It should be also mentioned that, according to the
2010 Public Transport Act, transport plans have
to describe the networks that will be covered by
PSO and organizers are not allowed to contract
lines that are not stated in the plan. As the usual
Polish practice is to procure for entire networks
stated in the transport plan, and as only core
networks are described in the transport plans, this
prioritizes the network of PSO services over
commercial services. The resulting situation reaps
neither the benefit that contracting a local
monopoly for a given period would deliver in term
of cross-subsidizing profitable and less-profitable
lines, nor the benefit from the alternative
approach where commercial services would
constitute the core network and contracted PSO
services would fill the social gaps.

 Box 2: Public Transport Local Government Agreements and Unions


 Horizontal agreement of a municipality with a neighboring municipality. The municipality performing
 the organization of public transport covered by the agreement takes over the rights and duties of the other
 municipalities. There are no obstacles for municipalities from different voivodeships to make such
 agreement on condition that they neighbor each other and that they would participate in the financing of
 public transport organization.
 A union of the gminas or powiats. In Poland for many years unions of gminas and powiats have been
 allowed, although a single union can group either gminas or powiats and has legal difficulties to cooperate
 with non-member authorities by agreements. At present, there are gmina unions inter alia in the areas of
 Katowice, Gdańsk, and Rzeszów, but they exclude participation from voivodeships.

 Horizontal agreement of a powiat with another powiat and unions of powiats. The powiat may enter
 agreements on delegating performance of public transport organization with other powiats. For the
 purpose of joint performance of public tasks powiats may establish unions with other powiats, and
 agreements and unions with powiats from other voivodeships are allowed.
 Vertical agreements of a municipality with a powiat. The municipality may perform tasks the scope of
 competence of the powiat based on conditions defined in the agreement. Thus, there are no obstacles for an
 agreement with a powiat from a neighbouring voivodeship.
 Vertical agreement of a municipality with a voivodeship. The municipality may perform tasks from the
 scope of competence of the voivodeship based on agreements with those territorial government units. It
 should be noticed that entering the “vertical” agreement, the party transferring tasks must assure adequate
 financing.
 Vertical agreements of a powiat with a voivodeship. The powiat may enter agreements on public
 transport organization with the voivodeship within the area of which the territory of the powiat is situated.
 That provision indicates that the powiat may not agree with the neighbouring voivodeship within the area
 of which it is not situated.
 Unions of municipalities and powiats. Since legal changes which came into force in 2016, it is possible to
 create unions with mixed membership by cooperating municipalities and powiats, but exclude
 voivodeships, who are responsible for rail services.
 Metropolitan unions. Such union is created differently from the rest of union options. Instead of the
 bottom-up logic of other unions that may be created by local initiative, a metropolitan union needs to be
 accepted at the central level and some of the authorities may be forced to join them by law. Metropolitan
 unions are also more regulated by law and get additional budget co-financing.
 The Metropolitan Act specifies that all transport authority competences must be transferred by member
 powiats and gminas to a union. This makes many core urban authorities sceptical about these unions, as
 their budgets remain the main financing sources of the unions, but they would need to relinquish decision
 making powers.
 The latter two options are new, as the laws only entered into force in 2016. While this is an improvement
 over the past legal framework, it still does not allow voivodeships from participating in such unions,
 preventing commuter rail, being integrated in the public transport offer of the unions.

 Box 3: Silesian Public Services Card (ŚKUP)

 Silesian Public Services Card (ŚKUP) is a system allowing the processing of pay ments for services provided
 by public institutions. The system will allow the use of different services: transport, culture, sports and
 recreation, library or paid parking. It will also be a platform for the exchange of information between the
 participants and residents. Participants of the project are: KZK GOP, which oversees its implementation, as
 well as 21 cities in the Silesian agglomeration. The project has received funding from the European
 Regional Development Fund under the Regional Operational Programme of Silesia 2007-13.The project
 addresses the implementation of electronic public services in 120 institutions in the area of 21
 municipalities. ŚKUP introduces in the voivodeship a single strategy on pricing policy in the area of
 transport and parking. This will allow for the development of demand for the products of the institutions
 involved in the project, including through the implementation of a coherent fare discount policy tailored to
 the specific user groups. It will also apply special tariffs for specific groups of users.
