Box 1: Variable Fees and Income-Contingent Loans

 Variable Fees and Income-Contingent Loans
 Variable fees
 Variable (or liberalized) fees—set by universities—offer several benefits over a flat fee. They can increase the resources entering
 the higher education system by being open ended, and they can increase competition among universities, increasing quality
 and relevance, as well as the efficiency of resource use. And by being akin to income transfers to targeted income groups, they
 have the potential to be more equitable than other approaches to revenue generation, especially when they are set at higher
 rates for those who can afford them and are combined with redistributive policies to help poorer students pay those fees.
    In most variable fee schemes, the government usually places a ceiling on the maximum and has most students make at least
 some contribution toward their education, though exempting qualified poor students from fees based on need and equity
 helps ensure that they are not excluded or sent to low-cost and possibly low-quality institutions. Otherwise, requiring students
 to pay at least some of the cost generally improves their motivation and performance. Of course, governments will differ in
 what the variable fee structures and ceilings should be to ensure access, equity, and cost-recovery.
 Income-contingent loans
 More governments recognize that income-contingent loans are better for access. Repayment is contingent on the future in-
 come of the borrower: people with low earnings make low repayments, and people with low lifetime earnings do not repay the
 loan principal in full. Such a loan protects a student from excessive risk and can promote efficiency (by the protection from
 risk) and access (fees financed by the loans free resources for access).
