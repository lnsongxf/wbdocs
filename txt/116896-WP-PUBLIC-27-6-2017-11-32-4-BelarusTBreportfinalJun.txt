KEY MESSAGES
 Despite progress made in reducing TB incidence and deaths, Belarus’ TB response
   continues to face challenges, in particular in relation to drug resistant TB. The
   current TB response and allocation of resources—if continued—would
   sustain a moderate decline of the TB epidemic, but would be insufficient to
   achieve national and global TB targets set for 2020 and 2035.
 The allocative efficiency study presented in this report identified potential for
   reallocation of resources. The same budget available for TB-related activities in
   2015 (US$ 61.8 million) could,—if allocated optimally—achieve the following
   changes by 2035:
      Reduce prevalence in the general adult population by up to 45%;
      Reduce the total number of TB deaths by up to 60%;
 In order to achieve these changes specific reallocations are required in relation to
   how TB programs are delivered. Transitioning from hospital care to ambulatory
   care could free up approximately 40% of TB treatment cost for reallocation to
   higher-impact programs. Additional resources could be freed up in the area of
   involuntary isolation department treatment, the service modality with the highest
   unit cost, in palliative care and in mass screening.
 Resources freed up by changing treatment modalities would need to be
   invested in selected higher-impact interventions and delivery solutions. These
   include provision of incentives for providers of ambulatory TB care, procurement
   of new, more efficacious drug regimens for MDR-TB and XDR-TB, scale up of rapid
   molecular diagnostics, enhanced active case finding among high-risk populations
   and enhanced contact tracing.
 Findings of this study can inform the reform of TB care and TB care financing
   in Belarus as well as expanded pilots of these reforms at Oblast (province)
   level.

(TB) response, which was conducted using the Optima-TB model in 2016-17.

TB EPIDEMIC SITUATION AND RESPONSE
TB incidence, active TB prevalence and TB-related deaths declined in Belarus in the period
between 2000 and 2015, while the relative share of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively
drug resistant (XDR) TB increased during that same period. Belarus’ TB response has achieved
treatment success rates of 88% for new and relapse cases (2014 cohort), 54% for multi-drug
resistant TB (2013 cohort) and 38% for extensively drug resistant TB (2013, cohort). (WHO
2017b). Ambitious targets have been set nationally including a 35% reduction in TB related
deaths, a 12% reduction in TB incidence and an increase in MDR-TB treatment success to 75%
by 2020. Globally the End-TB strategy aims to reduce TB deaths by 95% and TB incidence by
90% (or below 10/100,000) by 2035.

Epidemic projections made in the Optima-TB model suggest that with the current level of TB
spending (US$61.8 million in 2015) and the current allocation of resources to different TB
response interventions, TB incidence, prevalence and deaths would continue to decline
moderately in Belarus up to 2035, but 2020 national targets and global milestones as well as
2035 End-TB targets would be missed.

ALTERNATIVE TB RESPONSE SCENARIOS
Mathematical modelling analyses suggest that alternative program scale up scenarios and
different service delivery modalities could improve outcomes of the TB response:

   Scaling up diagnosis and treatment to 90% coverage by 2020 is projected to avert 40% of
    active TB infections and 27% of expected TB related deaths compared with current coverage
    by 2020. Scaling up to 95% treatment coverage by 2035 is projected to avert 52% of active
    TB infections and 53% of expected TB related deaths compared with current coverage.
   A shift from the current model of hospital-based care to a model of extended ambulatory
    care would reduce TB treatment cost by up to 40% with the same treatment outcomes. Data
    from a global review suggests that ambulatory care enhanced by incentives has improved
    outcomes by approximately 16% in other settings. (Nguyen 2016)
   With current treatment success rates for extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB, even increased
    diagnosis and treatment coverage for XDR-TB, would only lead to moderate reductions in
    XDR-TB. If treatment success rates can be improved through introduction of new drugs such
    as bedaquiline, clofazimine and linezolid, this could reduce the prevalence of active XDR-TB
    by more than half by 2035 compared to scale up with current drugs.
   Current rates of TB diagnosis could be achieved more cost-efficiently by changing the mix of
    screening modalities and reducing the coverage of mass screening, while increasing active

          case finding among key populations such as people living with HIV, people who inject drugs,
          homeless populations, people with problematic alcohol use and diabetes as well as contact
          tracing.

      OPTIMIZED ALLOCATIONS
      Optimization analysis was carried out using a formal mathematical algorithm to establish, which
      mix of TB response interventions is expected to produce the largest reductions in TB incidence,
      prevalence and deaths. Figure ES.1 shows current allocations of resources and the optimized
      allocation of resources.

      The optimized budget allocation differs from current allocations across several different areas.
      The allocation to several program areas would decrease by more than 50% each. This includes
      involuntary isolation department treatment, hospital-based treatment modalities, mass-
      screening and palliative care. In the optimized allocation, funds are reallocated to incentivized
      ambulatory care, new MDR- and XDR-TB drug regimens, rapid-molecular testing and enhanced
      /incentivized contact tracing and active case finding among key populations.

      By 2035, optimized allocation of resources would reduce adult TB prevalence by 45% in
      comparison to current allocations. In addition, the optimized allocation would also reduce TB
      related deaths by 60% in comparison to current allocations, and by 70% compared to 2015
      levels.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the analyses conducted, 13 conclusions and recommendations were formulated (see
Chapter 7 for details):

1. Transitioning from hospital-focused to ambulatory treatment modalities could reduce
   the cost of TB treatment by up to 40% and free up resources for reallocation to high-impact
   interventions.
2. Strengthening ambulatory care through incentives for health worker outreach support
   and for patients’ adherence through a mix of delivery solutions is likely to improve
   treatment outcomes.
3. Enhanced ambulatory care requires a reform of tuberculosis care financing to replace
   bed-based payment modalities by results-based modalities based on patient-centred care.
4. Since involuntary isolation department treatment is the most expensive modality for
   delivering treatment, reducing and over time phasing out this delivery modality, would free
   up resources for other high-impact interventions.
5. Mass screening and screening of obligatory groups are the treatment modalities with
   the lowest testing yield and reducing their coverage in favor of more targeted screening
   approaches could increase diagnostic yield.
6. The contribution of contact tracing and active case finding among key populations to
   the total number of TB cases identified could be increased by introducing service delivery
   modalities using provider incentives.
7. The scale up of rapid molecular diagnostics will be an important step towards reducing
   time from screening to treatment initiation and thereby reduce the infectious period.
8. Reallocating savings from palliative care and involuntary isolation department treatment to
   new drug regimens including bedaquiline, linezolid and clofazimine is projected to
   improve treatment outcomes, in particular for XDR-TB.
9. Introducing alcohol screening for all adult TB patients and provision of a brief alcohol
   intervention for TB patients with problematic alcohol use, are low-cost interventions with
   the potential to improve treatment adherence and outcomes.
10. The number of TB notifications in prisons has declined substantially, but enhanced TB care
    and screening for prisoners post-release remains a priority.
11. Considering the country’s growing HIV epidemic, there is need for strengthened linkages
    between HIV and TB services.
12. Reaching the 2035 target of a reduction in TB incidence to less than 10/100,000 would
    require addressing latent TB, a major source of new cases, post 2020.
13. Closing strategic information gaps through operational research, will be essential in
    informing Belarus’ TB care reform.

1.       INTRODUCTION: WHY ALLOCATIVE
         EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS NOW?
1.1      NECESSITY FOR ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY
The adoption of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda (UNGASS 2015) and the
World Health Organization’s new End TB Strategy (WHO 2015a) have introduced a new era for
national TB responses. While the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) had aimed to halt and
reverse the epidemics of HIV, TB and Malaria, the SDG agenda sets out a more ambitious
pathway towards ending TB. (Lönnroth 2016) This has been translated into ambitious targets
of reducing TB incidence by 80% (or to less than 20/100,000) and TB deaths by 90% by 2030.
The WHO End TB strategy has set additional targets with a longer time frame of 2035 aiming for
a 90% reduction in TB incidence (or <10/100,000) and a 95% reduction in TB deaths.

The 2015 Global TB report by WHO (WHO 2015b) demonstrated that TB responses needed to
change if these targets were to be achieved. The decline in global TB incidence was negligible
(then estimated at just 1.5% annually), despite doubled TB funding in 2015 compared to 2006.
It was also reported that there were now more TB deaths than AIDS deaths, and that there was
a large gap between knowledge of what works and implementation.

The new frameworks imply that national TB responses are faced with the need to scale up
programs for screening, diagnosis and treatment to achieve substantially higher coverage and
treatment success rates than in the past. Since the vast majority of TB epidemics affect low- and
middle income countries, national TB responses are commonly faced with resource constraints.
While enhanced domestic and international resource mobilization for health continues to be
desirable, international assistance for disease response programs has stagnated in recent years
and domestic financing remains constrained by competing health, social and other public
financing priorities. Focused design and efficiency in TB program delivery are therefore
essential to ensure that programs can do more with what is available.

The World Bank supports countries in their efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
through a range of strategies relating to health sector reform, health financing as well as
analytical support to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery. Within the
broader support towards enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of health programs, the concept
of allocative efficiency refers to the maximization of health outcomes, with the least costly mix
of health interventions.1 .

As part of its wider support, the World Bank in collaboration with other partners has supported
disease-specific allocative efficiency studies in more than 40 countries. Initially, the focus of
allocative efficiency studies was on HIV responses. The focus is currently being expanded


1   Technically, allocative efficiency can be achieved within a fixed budget envelope (maximize impact with given
    amount of money); or within defined impact targets (minimize cost to achieve a given impact).


                                                       1
2                                                            Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


    towards TB, hepatitis, nutrition, malaria and child health. TB allocative efficiency studies
    generally try to answer the question, “How can TB funding be optimally allocated to the
    combination of TB response interventions that will yield the highest impact?”

    There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
    amount of TB funding; or that given outcomes could be achieved with less TB funding if
    resources are distributed optimally or if resources are used in the most efficient ways.
    Mathematical modelling is one way to determine optimized TB resource allocation.

    An allocative efficiency study of Belarus’ HIV response was carried out and informed national
    strategic planning and the country’s Global Fund application in 2015. (World Bank; Government
    of Belarus 2016) On the basis of this previous collaboration it was agreed to carry out a similar
    analysis of the national TB response in order to support Belarus in its decision-making on
    strategic TB investments in the coming years.

    1.2     TUBERCULOSIS IN THE CONTEXT OF OVERALL
            DISEASE BURDEN
    Belarus’ overall burden of disease is characterized by a high proportion of deaths and years of
    life lost attributable to non-communicable diseases, in particular ischemic heart disease, stroke
    and cancer. TB accounts for 0.3% of all deaths, 0.4% of all disability adjusted life years and 0.5%
    of all years of life lost. Although the contribution to overall disease burden is relatively small, TB
    remains one of the three major causes of death related to communicable diseases, in addition to
    HIV and lower respiratory infections. The country’s overall success in reducing the burden of
    preventable communicable diseases therefore heavily depends on the results achieved in the
    responses to TB and HIV.

    1.3     FINANCING OF TB IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH CARE
            FINANCING
    Table 1.1 provides a summary of health spending in Belarus according to the WHO national
    health accounts database. Although health spending per capita in Belarus increased
    substantially from US$75 to US$450 between 2000 and 2014, total health expenditure relative
    to GDP remained fairly stable since 2000 and stood at 5.7% of GDP in 2014, which is below
    regional (7.9%) and global (6.8%) averages (WHO 2017a). In 2014, the majority of health
    expenditure (65.8%) was government funded and private health expenditure was mostly out-
    of-pocket spending. Government health spending relative to GDP declined since 2000 and was
    3.7% of GDP in 2014, which is also below regional and global averages. Nevertheless, as
    illustrated in Figure 1.1, the share of Belarus’ government health spending relative to total
    government spending was 13.8%, which is above regional and global averages of 12.8% and
    11.7% (WHO 2017a). In other words, the relatively low level of government health spending
    relative to GDP is not due to a low allocation to health within government resources, but needs
    to be seen in the context of the lower tax revenue collection of 14.7% compared to many
    countries in the region and to the global average of 15.8% in 2015 (World Bank 2017).

    1.4      FINANCING OF THE TB RESPONSE IN BELARUS
    Total spending in the national TB program in Belarus declined from US$69.3 million and
    US$70.8 million in 2013 and 2014 to US$50.8 million in 2015 (Figure 1.2). This decline was
    recorded despite an increase in TB spending in national currency from 616.2 billion BYR to
    808.7 billion BYR and can be attributed to the declining rate of exchange between the Belarusian
    Ruble and the US Dollar. The majority of TB funding in Belarus is provided from the state budget.
    In 2015, the state budget accounted for 89.1% of TB spending, private expenditure for 0.6% and
    international funding for 10.3%. In addition, as outlined in more detail later in this report, an
    estimated US$11 million were allocated to other TB related health services such as screening
    programs in 2015, which are not part of the TB program expenditure but accounted for in other
    parts of the health system.

Figure 1.3 illustrates the thematic focus of TB program spending by funding source. State budget
funding for TB is primarily allocated to hospital care and secondarily to ambulatory care. Private
expenses primarily cover out-patient care. International funding is also primarily allocated to
ambulatory care with a focus on new diagnostic and treatment options, while also including
spending on grant management, hospital-care and prevention.

2.      WHAT ARE THE KEY QUESTIONS AND
        WHICH METHODS WERE USED TO ANSWER
        THEM?
This section outlines the main steps taken and tools applied to carry out the analyses presented
in this report. Additional details are available in appendices A and B.

To support the national strategy priorities and assist Belarus in meeting its set targets, this
report answers the following questions:

1. What are the current trends in Belarus TB epidemic?
2. What is the impact of current tuberculosis spending?
3. What is the expected future impact of different program implementation scenarios?
4. What is the projected future trajectory of Belarus’ TB epidemic with and without investment
   in specific programs, or with/without attaining program-specific targets?

The scenarios will cover the following aspects:

    Treatment scale up
    Hospital-focused vs. ambulatory treatment
    Enhanced XDR treatment
    Different TB case finding modalities

4. How close are we to National Strategic Plan targets under current funding?

Over the National Strategic Plan period, how close will Belarus get to their National Strategic
Plan’s disease-related targets:

a.   With the current volume of funding, allocated according to current expenditure?

b. With the current volume of funding, allocated optimally?

Additional more detailed questions on epidemiology and cost-effectiveness also are answered
in this report.

2.1     OPTIMA MODEL
To carry out the analyses, the team used Optima-TB, a mathematical model of TB transmission
and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis framework. Optima-
TB incorporates evidence on biological transmission probabilities, detailed infection

    In addition, compartments are further disaggregated by drug resistance types into drug
    susceptible (DS), multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR). A more
    detailed illustration of the compartmental model structure is included in Appendix A.

    In consultation with national experts and in the absence of a TB prevalence survey, Optima-TB
    was calibrated to Belarus’ TB epidemic primarily based on data on TB case notifications and
    registered TB deaths.

    To assess how incremental changes in spending affect TB epidemics and determine an optimized
    funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of TB intervention
    programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting outcomes (cost-
    coverage outcome relations). These relationships are specific to the country, population, and
    prevention program being considered.

    Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
    epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the level of funding
    allocated to each program will impact on overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
    mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima-TB is able to determine an optimized allocation
    of funding across different TB programs. Additional details about Optima-TB are included in
    appendices A and B.

    2.2     ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
    In partnership between the Government of Belarus, World Bank, Optima Consortium of Decision
    Sciences, the Burnet Institute and University College London, it was agreed to carry out the
    region’s first Optima-TB study in Belarus. An in-country study group was formed involving RSPC
    PT, RSPC MT, WHO and the World Bank. Country-specific objectives of the analysis and
    parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological, program, and cost
    data were collected by in-country experts in collaboration with international experts using an
    adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In order to establish baseline spending
    on TB, 2015 expenditure data from TB sub-accounts within the WHO national health accounts
    were used. This data was triangulated with other unit cost data to establish estimated TB
    spending by intervention. Input data, model calibration and cost-coverage-outcome relations
    were reviewed and validated by the in-country study group. The team then consulted with
    government experts and other in-country partners on the preliminary results and summarized
    them in this report.

     2.3      NATIONAL TARGETS AND HOW THEY WERE
              TRANSLATED INTO OPTIMA
     The strategic goals under the National Strategic Plan (NSP 2015-2020) and National
     Tuberculosis Program (NTP) include: i) to decrease the 2020 TB notified cases rate by 12
     percent points compared to the 2013 baseline, or to reduce annually the TB notified cases rate
     by 2 percent points; ii) to reduce the number of notified MDR-TB cases by 12 percent points by
     2020 compared to the 2013 baseline; and iii) to reach a 75 percent treatment success rate
     among MDR-TB patients by 2020. The resource needs of the TB program (2016-2018) were
     estimated at US$ 201.7 million with a remaining financial gap of US$ 11.9 million.

     In the analysis of long-term trends, global targets were used in the study including 2025
     milestones, 2030 SDG goals and 2035 End-TB Strategy targets. (Table 2.2)

2.4      LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSES
Similar to any mathematical modelling analysis, this study is based on a number of assumptions,
which necessarily imply specific limitations:

    As for all complex modelling studies of diseases, there are some gaps in data. The majority
     of countries globally including Belarus do not have actual TB prevalence surveys. This
     implies that routine data on TB notifications formed the basis for estimating disease burden,
     which implies that estimates on the size of the undiagnosed populations had to be made.
    Unlike HIV, there are no standardized national TB spending assessments undertaken in
     countries and current templates for national health accounts including TB sub-accounts do
     not provide sufficiently detailed breakdowns of costs by intervention area. As mentioned,
     above, unit cost assumptions based on national and international spending data had to be
     made.
    The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness among programs
     includes assumptions concerning the impact of increases or decreases in funding for
     programs. These assumptions are partially based on costs per person reached and observed
     ecological relationships among outcomes of program coverage and the amount of money
     spent on programs in the past or in other contexts.
    The analysis did not determine the implementation efficiency of several programs. Gains in
     implementation efficiency were mainly considered when analyzing delivery models for TB
     treatment. Additional implementation efficiencies such as reductions in drug prices would
     lead to different unit costs, which would affect resource allocation.
    Modelling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of
     evidence-based parameter estimates of the effectiveness of individual interventions.
     Although these estimates were derived from a global systematic literature review, they may
     vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly the
     quality of implementation and levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and
     spending categories, for which such parameters cannot be obtained could not be included in
     the mathematical optimization. Because they still have important functions in the TB
     response, they were treated as fixed costs and, in some specific scenarios, adjusted with
     specific justifications.

        Effects outside the TB endpoints are complex to consider (such as non-health benefits of
         different TB treatment modalities). Given the complexity of interactions among
         interventions and their non-TB benefits the model does not seek to take into account human
         rights, ethical, legal, employment-related or psychosocial implications; but acknowledges
         that they are important aspects to be considered in planning and evaluating TB responses.
3.      WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN THE
        TB EPIDEMIC?
Chapter 3 summarizes the current status of the TB epidemic in Belarus. The model assumed that
current conditions would continue until 2020, i.e. that the coverage of individual interventions
would remain constant.

3.1     SUMMARY OF KEY NATIONAL DATA ON THE STATUS OF
        THE TB EPIDEMIC
Despite a decline in TB incidence and mortality between 2000 and 2014, Belarus remains one
of the countries highly affected by TB within the European region. As shown in Table 3.1, WHO
estimated that 5,200 incident TB infections (including both new and relapse as well as
HIV+TB) occurred in 2015 and that an estimated 520 TB related deaths occurred in 2015.

Belarus recorded 4,177 total notified TB cases in 2015, of which 3,765 were new and relapse
cases. This suggests that 72% of the estimated 5,200 incident new and relapse cases were
notified and 28% remained undiagnosed. Among notified TB cases, 72% were tested using
rapid molecular diagnostics at the time of diagnosis and virtually all (99%) were tested for
HIV. Overall, 92% of notified cases were pulmonary TB cases, among which 78% were
bacteriologically confirmed.

     An epidemic highly affecting men

     Approximately 75% of incident TB cases are estimated to occur among males and the number
     of notified cases among males is substantially higher in all age groups, except older people
     aged 65 and above (WHO 2017b). The sex-disaggregated data suggests that there are specific
     risk factors among men causing increased incidence of active TB. These are likely to include
     higher use of alcohol, higher HIV prevalence, higher drug use, higher likelihood of
     imprisonment and potentially a range of other factors. In older people, the higher prevalence
     of diabetes mellitus in females compared to males as well as the larger number of women in
     this age group due to higher mortality among men due to other causes are likely to affect the
     sex pattern of TB notifications. (IHME 2015)

     Exceptionally high levels of drug resistance

     Belarus experiences one of the highest levels of TB drug resistance world-wide. In 2015, there
     were 1,800 MDR/RR-TB cases among notified TB cases and MDR/RR-TB cases represented
     37% of new cases and 69% of previously treated cases. In the same year, 69% of new cases
     and 65% of previously treated cases were tested for rifampicin resistance. (WHO 2017b)
     Analysis of 2016 data suggests that within 1808 MDR-TB cases 65% were XDR-TB or pre-XDR-
     TB (resistance against second line injectable agents or fluoroquinolones).

     Large variation in treatment outcomes

     There is substantial variation in treatment outcomes in Belarus. As mentioned above, and in
     line with a vast majority of countries the largest break point in the country’s treatment
     cascade is likely at the initial step of diagnosis, as 72% of the estimated TB cases are diagnosed
     in 2015 (Table 3.3). Based on WHO’s global TB database (WHO 2017c) a summary of the TB
     cascade was prepared for 2014 when an estimated 70% of incident TB cases were notified
     (Figure 3.1 a). Additional analysis based on the WHO database is presented for specific TB
     treatment cohorts. These TB treatment cohort cascades use the people initiated on treatment
     as the denominator.

     When considering new and relapse TB cases, the losses in the TB cascade from initiation of
     treatment to completion are 12% and attributable to a combination of loss-to-follow up, death,
     treatment failure and lack of evaluation (Figure 3.1 b) leading to a treatment success rate of
     88%.

     Among TB patients with known HIV status 6% were HIV positive and 84% on antiretroviral
     therapy in 2015. An analysis of the TB treatment cohort cascade for 2014 suggests that
     treatment outcomes for HIV positive patients were substantially less favorable than for HIV
     negative TB patients with a success rate of 74% and death being the largest breakpoint in the
     treatment cohort cascade. (Figure 3.1c)

Among people with MDR-TB, there are major losses in the TB-treatment cohort cascade.
Reported data suggest that loss-to-follow up, death and treatment failure are major
breakpoints in the cascade, which contributed to a treatment success rate of 54% in 2013.
(Figure 3.1d)

The treatment cohort cascade for XDR-TB for 2013 was based on a relatively small sample
(60) and suggests a treatment success rate of 38%. Major breakpoints in the cascade were
death and treatment failure. (Figure 3.1e)

3.2     EPIDEMIC TRENDS ESTIMATED IN OPTIMA
The Optima-TB model was used to estimate trends of TB prevalence, incidence and mortality in
Belarus. Estimates were made based on detailed epidemiological and program data received,
which are summarized in the Appendix B of this report.

The prevalence of active TB declined since 2000

Optima-TB results suggest that the prevalence of TB has declined since the year 2000 (Figure
3.2) in the general population. Although the number of TB cases declined across different age
groups, the decline was less pronounced among populations aged 65+. While drug-resistant
types of TB accounted for less than one quarter of active TB cases in 2000, more than half of
people with active TB in 2016 were estimated to be infected with a drug resistant type of TB.
(Figure 3.3). The declining trend in the epidemic is in line with WHO estimated TB prevalence
and the declining trend in TB notifications according to national TB program records. According
to Optima-TB the number of people with active TB among all populations declined from 17,000
people with active TB in 2004 to 12,000 in 2015. The estimated number of active TB cases in
Optima-TB is within the confidence bounds of WHO TB prevalence estimates for Belarus
between 2004 and 2015, but close to the upper margins. Given the absence of a TB prevalence
survey for Belarus, it is not possible to validate model estimates for TB prevalence with
empirical data. Higher estimates of TB prevalence in Optima-TB are likely due to different
disease input assumptions on parameters such as disease duration, which in the context of
Belarus is likely high due to the high prevalence of drug-resistant types of TB and a relatively
large number of people on palliative care who do not access any form of treatment.

An increasing contribution of HIV to the TB epidemic

While the prevalence of TB decreased by more than one third in Belarus between 2000 and
2015, Belarus’ HIV epidemic increased more than six-fold over the same time period from an
estimated 5,600 people living with HIV in 2000 to 35,000 in 2015. (UNAIDS 2016) Figure 3.5
illustrates the growing number of PLHIV in Belarus by TB disease status. Despite the decline in
TB prevalence, the estimated number of active TB cases among PLHIV nearly doubled between
2000 and 2016 (Figure 3.6). Optima projections suggest that the proportion of people with
active TB who are HIV positive increased from less than 2% of people with active TB in 2000 to
approximately 6% in 2016 with a growing share of MDR and XDR-TB among PLHIV.

     TB incidence declines in all general population groups except older populations

     The estimated incidence of TB in Optima suggests that new infections declined in the general
     population overall since the year 2000 by approximately one third (Figure 3.7). While the
     decline was sustained among 0-4, 5-14 and 15-64 year age groups, the number of incident TB
     cases was estimated to have stabilized in about 2010 among populations aged 65 and older
     (Figure 3.8). The model suggests that this is due to the continued activation of latent-TB
     infections among this age group.

Key populations - TB declined among prisoners but increased among PLHIV

Optima estimates suggest that the TB epidemic declined among prisoners, but increased among
PLHIV between 2003 and 2016. Optima projections suggest that TB prevalence and incidence
among prisoners declined faster than among the general populations. This projection is
supported by data on TB notifications, which declined nearly five-fold between 2003 and 2015
according to national program records.

Continued high MDR-TB prevalence

Despite the overall reductions in TB prevalence in Belarus between 2000 and 2010, Optima
projections suggest that the number of people with MDR-TB continued to increase up to 2010.
(Figure 3.10) Disaggregated data on MDR-TB notifications is not available for the time period
prior to 2010 and therefore model estimates could not be compared to actual data points for
this period. Our model estimates suggest that while the share of MDR-TB among all TB infections
remains stable at a high level after 2010, absolute numbers of active MDR-TB (excluding XDR-
TB) began to decline in 2012. This reduction is due to the combined effects of overall reduction
in TB prevalence, the increasing coverage of diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, and the
increasing number of people who moved from being classified as MDR-TB to being XDR-TB
cases.

When disaggregated by age, Optima-TB estimates suggest that the reduction in MDR-TB
(excluding XDR) was primarily due to a reduction in active MDR-TB in the 15-64 age group,
while the estimated number of people with active MDR-TB among older people aged 65+
remained stable. Among PLHIV, the number of people with active MDR-TB stabilized at a high
level.

     XDR-TB: Exceptionally high prevalence

     As outlined above (Figure 3.3) the proportion of people with active TB who are diagnosed as
     XDR-TB is exceptionally high in Belarus. Correspondingly, Optima-TB estimates suggest that in
     the period between 2000 and 2013 the number of people with active XDR-TB must have
     increased rapidly (Figure 3.11). Disaggregated data on XDR-TB notifications is not available for
     the time period prior to 2014 and therefore model estimates could not be compared to actual
     data points for this period.

     The available data is insufficient to produce precise estimates and projections of trends. Based
     on the limited available data, Optima-TB projections suggest that the number of people with
     active XDR-TB stabilized in children and people aged 15-64, but continues to increase among
     people aged 65+ and among people living with HIV.

Latent TB: The reservoir sustaining the TB epidemic

The actual prevalence of latent TB in Belarus is currently unknown. While earlier estimates
suggested that up to one third of the world’s population was infected with latent TB, the most
recent global estimate suggests that global latent TB prevalence is less than 25%. (Houben 2016)

Estimates of the prevalence of latent TB in Belarus have been produced using the Optima-TB
model, based on observed active TB cases. Optima-TB estimates the number of latent TB cases
to be approximately 900,000 in 2015. Optima-TB estimates suggest that the number of latent
TB infections is stable or declining in most populations in Belarus (Figure 3.12). Latent
infections were estimated to be increasing slightly in older populations (aged 65+). Further
work is needed to understand whether there is an increase in latent infection among
populations aged 65+ and what possible causes may be. Hypotheses for explaining an increase
in latent TB among people aged 65+ might include aging of cohorts of people with higher
exposure to people with active TB prior to 2000 including in the 1990s when active TB incidence
in Belarus was higher than after 2000. Independent estimates suggest that the number of people
with latent TB in Belarus is between 770,000 and 1,400,000 - with an estimated total of 920,000
cases (Houben 2016)

                 TUBERCULOSIS SPENDING?
This chapter describes the programmatic focus of TB spending in Belarus and the corresponding
epidemiological outcomes if current spending patterns would be sustained.

4.1              FOCUS OF CURRENT TB PROGRAMS IN BELARUS
In 2015, an estimated US$61.8 million were spent on TB programs and TB related activities in
other parts of the health system as outlined in Chapter 2 of this report. Figure 4.1 provides a
detailed breakdown of TB spending in 2015 in Belarus by intervention area.

     More than half of TB spending in Belarus was allocated to hospital-based treatment. Involuntary
     isolation department treatment was estimated to absorb 26.8% of all TB related spending.
     Hospital-based care for DS, MDR and XDR-TB accounted for another 22.1%. Palliative care for
     TB patients for whom suitable drugs were not available was estimated to account for 4.7% of
     TB spending based on an estimated number of 537 palliative care patients (WHO GLC report)
     receiving hospital-based care. When considering that 364 patients were covered under
     involuntary isolation department treatment, spending of US$16.6 million in this program area
     translated into an annual cost of US$45,600 per patient in 2015, by far the highest cost of all
     treatment modalities.

     Ambulatory care for all types of TB was estimated to absorb 12.3%. Screening for the general
     population and professional groups at risk of elevated TB transmission accounted for 15.8% of
     TB spending, while all other diagnostic interventions accounted for 4.3% of total TB spending.
     Management, administrative and procurement costs were 2.9% of total TB spending.

     4.2    WITHOUT TB PROGRAMS, TB INCIDENCE AND DEATHS
            WOULD RISE SUBSTANTIALLY
     A scenario analysis was performed to assess the impact of current TB programs. This analysis
     assumed that the level of 2015 resources would be sustained up to 2035 and funding allocated
     in the same way as it was allocated in 2015 (see Figure 4.1). The effect of this ‘ current
     conditions’ scenario was compared to a scenario of zero-spending on TB. The effects of ‘current
     conditions’ and ‘no TB funding’ on TB incidence, prevalence (number of people with active TB)
     and TB deaths were established (Figure 4.2).

     The scenario analysis suggests that current funding for TB programs is making a significant
     impact on the TB epidemic and would have continued effects on the TB epidemic up to 2035
     compared to zero-TB spending. Compared to zero-spending, current investment would avert
     approximately 25% of new infections, an estimated annual 6,000 active TB cases in 2035 and
     more than 1,500 TB related deaths in the year 2035. (Figure 4.2).

     While current TB spending is clearly beneficial compared to no public spending on TB, current
     spending and allocations would only achieve moderate reductions in TB compared to 2015
     epidemic levels. This implies that according to projections performed in Optima –TB, national
     and global targets outlined in chapter 2 of this report would not be achieved with current
     allocations of resources. The following chapters explore alternative resource allocation
     scenarios.

5.       WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT
         PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS?
This chapter summarizes different scenario analyses, which were conducted to understand the
effect that specific programmatic changes would have on Belarus’ TB epidemic.

5.1      SCENARIO GROUP 1: SCALING UP COVERAGE OF KEY
         DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS
A scenario analysis was performed to understand the level of changes to the TB epidemic that
would occur if key national targets and global milestones were achieved by 2020 and if global
targets were achieved by 2035. Table 5.1 summarizes the parameters, which were modified in
the model to assess the effect of the scenarios. Three scenarios were defined to compare the
effect of current coverage to achievement of 2020 milestones for coverage and achievement of
2035 coverage targets. For each scenario, there is a time frame for programmatic change to
occur, which is the time period, over which programmatic targets are achieved, and another time
frame for tracking impact, which is the time period, for which the effect of these achievements
is measured. Although in the 2020 target scenario, coverage targets are achieved by 2020, the
impact of achieving and sustaining 2020 coverage levels is tracked up to 2035.

     Figure 5.1 illustrates the effect of achievement of 2020 and 2030 targets on prevalence of active
     TB in the general population aged 15-64 and among PLHIV. As already established in chapter 4,
     current coverage levels would lead to a continued decline in prevalence of active TB, but the
     decline would gradually slow down and both 2020 and 2030 targets would be missed. The
     results on PLHIV also illustrate that while the number of active TB cases among PLHIV will
     continue to increase due to the increasing population of PLHIV as shown in chapter 4, the
     prevalence of active TB among PLHIV is actually expected to decline even with current coverage.
     Optima-TB analyses suggest that achievement of 2020 targets will reduce prevalence of active
     TB by approximately one third compared to sustaining only current coverage up to 2030.
     Compared to 2015 levels of TB prevalence, achievement of 2020 targets would imply more than
     a 50% reduction in active TB, both in the general population aged 15-64 and among PLHIV.
     Achievement of 2035 targets would imply greater impact with more than 40% reduction
     compared to business as usual and more than 60% reduction of active TB prevalence by 2035
     compared to 2015 levels.

Figure 5.2 shows the effect of the same scenarios on TB-related deaths. With current coverage
of interventions, the number of TB deaths per year would continue to decline among the general
population aged 15-64. The projected increase in the number of TB-related deaths among PLHIV
occurs in a context of a rapidly increasing number of PLHIV and despite moderately declining
TB prevalence as shown in Figure 5.1. The effect of scaling up diagnosis and treatment on
mortality is slightly larger than on active TB prevalence. Achieving 2020 targets would lead to
more than 40% reduction of TB deaths by 2020 and more than 50% reduction by 2035 in the
general population aged 15-64. This corresponds to a reduction by approximately two-thirds
when compared to 2015 levels. Among PLHIV, scaling up TB diagnosis and treatment would halt
the increase in TB related deaths. However, in the absence of scaled up HIV prevention and
treatment interventions – which were not included in the Optima-TB analysis – the number of
TB related deaths among PLHIV is projected to increase again moderately after 2020. This
suggests that TB-related mortality among PLHIV can only be reversed if HIV prevention and
treatment interventions are scaled up in parallel to TB treatment.

     Figure 5.3 illustrates the effect of the same scenarios on the number of active TB cases
     disaggregated by drug resistance type (DS, MDR, XDR) and by treatment status (undiagnosed,
     diagnosed, treated) among all populations. The analysis confirms that reductions in active TB
     prevalence will be achieved across different drug resistance types. The undiagnosed population
     is also projected to decline substantially with the scale up of interventions.

     Overall, scaling up to meet 2020 national targets and key global milestones is projected to avert
     40% of active TB infections and 27% of expected TB related deaths by 2020 compared with
     current coverage. Scaling up to meet 2035 global End-TB targets is projected to avert 52% of
     active TB infections and 53% of expected TB related deaths compared with current coverage.

     5.2     SCENARIO GROUP 2: SHIFTING FROM IN-PATIENT TO
             OUT-PATIENT MODALITIES OF TB TREATMENT
     A specific scenario analysis was conducted in order to assess the potential effect of a shift from
     in-patient to out-patient treatment modalities for TB treatment. This analysis compares current
     hospital-focused treatment to modalities with standard ambulatory care and a modality with
     incentivized ambulatory care. All modalities include both hospital-costs and ambulatory costs.
What Will Be the Impact of Different Program Implementation Scenarios?                                        33


What differs between hospital-focused and ambulatory modalities is the duration of
hospitalization. Table 5.2 summarizes the durations of TB-treatment, which were assumed for
the different treatment modalities based on WHO recommendations and consultation with in-
country experts. The assumed reduction in in-patient days for ambulatory modalities
corresponds to the estimated time required to achieve smear conversion suggesting that the
patient is no longer highly infectious. Available data suggest that current average duration of
hospitalization in Belarus is substantially longer than required on average to achieve smear
conversion.

Table 5.3 provides a breakdown of the estimated cost for different treatment modalities based
on a combination of estimated drug costs, costs of hospitalization per day, duration of
hospitalization and costs for any incentives. The costs in the table represent the cost for a full
course of treatment for one patient in different treatment modalities. Detailed assumptions used
are summarized in Appendix C. A shift to ambulatory treatment modalities would reduce costs
per patient on treatment by 25-28% for the DS, MDR and XDR-TB treatment courses. Even if
incentives for health workers providing ambulatory services were included, an estimated 15-
20% reduction in cost per patient could be achieved. The largest saving could be made by
reducing involuntary isolation department treatment.

Figure 5.4 shows the effect of three treatment modalities on overall cost of TB treatment
considering current levels of treatment coverage. Using current modalities, treatment cost was
estimated at approximately US$32 million per year versus US$18 million per year for standard
ambulatory treatment and approximately US$20 million for incentivized ambulatory treatment.

Optima-TB analyses suggest that a transition from the current hospital focused modality to
ambulatory care could save 40% of treatment costs and that these resources could be
reallocated to more effective TB interventions.

There was insufficient in-country data to estimate the epidemiological impact of a transition
from a hospital-focused system to ambulatory modalities. An international systematic review of
the evidence supports the assumption that ambulatory care could achieve current coverage
levels in target populations. (Bassili 2013) A meta-analysis of 540 articles reported no statistical
difference for treatment outcome rates (success, death, default and failure), between
ambulatory and hospital-based delivery of TB care. The review found that standard ambulatory
care can be as effective as hospital-based care (Bassili 2013) There is also evidence to suggest
that ambulatory care that is enhanced by specific incentives might be more effective than
standard ambulatory care alone. A Cochrane review suggested that ambulatory care coupled
with cash-incentives for patients may be more effective than un-incentivized ambulatory care,
particularly among high-risk groups. (Lutge 2015) A WHO review of evidence also suggests
improvements in treatment adherence through food and financial support as well as TB care
enhanced through a mix of incentives. (Nguyen 2016) Within Belarus, the Mogilev pilot included
food packages for patients and financial incentives for providers and a transition away from bed-
based to outcomes-based financing. (Gurbanova 2017)

5.3     SCENARIO GROUP 3: ENHANCED DRUG REGIMENS AND
        COVERAGE OF XDR-TB TREATMENT
As outlined earlier in this report, rising levels of drug resistance are the key challenge for
Belarus’ TB response. In 2016, two thirds of all MDR-TB patients were classified as being
infected with pre-XDR or XDR-TB. In the same year, 537 patients were receiving only palliative
care and no drugs. Understanding the benefits of scaling up programmatic interventions for
XDR-TB is therefore essential. Since pre-XDR-TB cases were not analyzed separately within
Optima-TB, patients diagnosed with pre-XDR TB were included among the MDR-TB diagnoses.
Therefore the analyses presented here only refer to patients diagnosed as XDR-TB cases.
36                                                                 Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


     As shown in chapter 3 of this report, the treatment success rate for XDR-TB in Belarus was 38%
     for the 2013 treatment cohort, which is substantially lower than for DS-TB and MDR-TB. New
     alternative XDR drug regimens containing linezolid, clofazimine and bedaquiline are available
     and have higher success rates than current drug regimens. In this context, it is important to
     examine whether interventions to minimize XDR-TB should focus primarily on identifying XDR
     cases or whether new drug regimens would substantially increase population-level impact.

     Table 5.4 describes the key parameters used for this scenario analysis. Current conditions are
     compared to a scenario of scaling up XDR diagnosis and treatment using currently available drug
     regimens versus increased coverage of new XDR drug regimens. For the new drug regimens, a
     treatment success rate of 60% was assumed based on international literature.

     Figure 5.5 shows the effect of the different scenarios of XDR treatment on the total number of
     active XDR-TB cases.

The comparison of scenarios suggests that provision and increased coverage of new XDR drugs
reduces the prevalence of XDR cases by approximately 65%. Increased coverage through the
correct diagnosis of XDR cases is an important step for scaling up, but our analysis suggests that
the higher treatment success rate of new drug regimens is the most important factor to reducing
the number of XDR cases. Analyses also suggest that XDR treatment requires sustained support
beyond the current NSP funding period to make an impact by 2035.

Figure 5.6 summarizes the effect of the different XDR-TB treatment scenarios on mortality.
Optima-TB analysis suggests that while there is a small mortality-related benefit of scaling up
XDR-TB diagnosis with current drug regimens, impact can be substantially enhanced by using
more efficacious drug regimens, both for adults in the general population and among PLHIV.

Figure 5.7 summarizes successful and unsuccessful treatment outcomes for the three XDR-TB
treatment scenarios for all populations. As shown above, current conditions will imply a
continued relatively high mortality among people with XDR-TB as a substantial proportion of
people with XDR-TB will be missed by treatment. As shown in Figure 5.7, high coverage with
current drug regimens would moderately reduce the need for XDR-TB treatment by 2035, but
the number of people in need of XDR-TB treatment would remain high at approximately 1,300
patients in 2035. With high coverage of new, more effective drug regimens, treatment
completion would increase substantially. Patients covered by new drug-regimens are expected
to be less likely to relapse or undergo re-treatment, ultimately decreasing the number of
treatments needed. The Optima-TB model suggests that these benefits would accumulate over
time and substantially reduce the number of people requiring XDR-TB treatment to
approximately 300 in 2035.

Figure 5.8 further illustrates that high coverage with new drug regimens has the potential to
reduce the number of people with active XDR-TB by half by 2021 and sustain this reduction up
to 2035.

     In summary, the scenario analyses carried out in Optima-TB support the recommendation of the
     2017 Green Light Commission (GLC) report, which calls for the improvement of MDR/XDR drug-
     regimens. (Gurbanova 2017) The GLC report estimated that there is need for 400 additional
What Will Be the Impact of Different Program Implementation Scenarios?                            39


regimens for MDR-TB patients, which include new and repurposed drugs (e.g. bedaquiline,
linezolid, clofazimine), to meet demand in 2017-2018 – and an additional 250 courses to cover
patients previously treated with other drugs for XDR-TB. (Gurbanova 2017)

There is evidence from studies assessing the efficacy of new and repurposed drugs, which
supports the assumption of improved treatment outcomes made in the Optima-TB analysis.
Linezolid results in significantly higher rates of sputum-smear conversion and overall treatment
success for MDR-TB (Sotgiu 2012). Clofazimine and bedaquiline demonstrated promising
outcomes for XDR-TB treatment despite the need for more evidence (Gualano 2016).

5.4      SCENARIO GROUP 4: EFFICIENT SCREENING AND
         DIAGNOSIS OF ACTIVE TB
As shown in chapter 4 of this report a substantial proportion of TB-related spending in Belarus
is allocated to screening and diagnostic interventions. A scenario analysis was carried out to
assess whether current rates of TB diagnoses could be achieved more cost-efficiently with a
different mix of diagnostic interventions. The scenario analysis compares current screening and
case finding practices with alternatives, including contact tracing, incentivized contact tracing,
enhanced screening of key populations and a combination of enhanced contact tracing and
screening of key populations. Table 5.5 summarizes the assumptions made for this scenario
analysis.

6.      WHAT MIGHT BE GAINED FROM OPTIMIZED
        ALLOCATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
        FUNDING?
The analysis presented in this chapter answers the core questions of this allocative efficiency
study. Previous chapters have identified the effects and costs of specific programmatic changes.
This chapter analyzes the TB response holistically and answers the question of how resources
need to be allocated to maximize health outcomes. The results presented in this chapter were
obtained through the optimization algorithm mentioned earlier in this report and described in
detail in Appendix A.

As outlined in chapter 4 of this report, the current allocation of resources in Belarus is projected
to lead to continued moderate declines in TB incidence, prevalence and mortality. The scope of
this chapter is to explore to what extent and how further reductions could be achieved.

6.1     OPTIMIZED ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO MINIMIZE
        INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE AND DEATHS
In general, optimized allocations of resources are only optimal relative to a specific set of
objectives and a given time frame. In other words, the optimized allocation to minimize TB
incidence may differ from the optimized allocation to minimize TB prevalence or deaths. In
order to reflect the different dimensions of the TB response, optimization analysis was
performed for a combination of three objectives with equal weighting:

    Minimize the incidence of TB
    Minimize the prevalence of active TB
    Minimize TB-related deaths

In addition, optimizations for specific objectives were run to explore to what extent optimized
allocations would differ for different sets of objectives.

How to reallocate resources?

The overall optimized allocation of resources to minimize TB incidence, prevalence and deaths
is shown in Figure 6.1. In this analysis it was assumed that the same US$61.8 million that were
available for TB-related programs in 2015 would remain available on an annual basis up to
2035. The optimized budget allocation differs from current allocations across several different
areas. The allocation to the following program areas decreased by more than 50% each:

    Involuntary isolation department treatment;
    Hospital-based treatment modalities;
    Mass-screening;


                                                42
What Might Be Gained from Optimized Allocation of Currently Available Funding?                            43


   Palliative care.

In the optimized allocation, funds are reallocated to

   Incentivized ambulatory care;
   New TB drug regimens;
   Rapid-molecular testing;
   Enhanced /incentivized contact tracing and active case finding among key populations.

Notes: 2015=base year (current allocation); Optimized budget: It was assumed that the budget of US$61.8
million that were available for TB-related programs in 2015 would remain available on an annual basis up to
2035.

Shifts within testing and diagnosis programs

Gaps in diagnosis represent a major break point in the TB care cascade in most countries. In
Belarus 3,765 new and relapse cases (72%) were notified in 2015 against an estimated 5,200
incident TB infections (WHO 2017b) as outlined in chapter 4 of this report. According to Optima-
TB projections, optimized allocation of resources would imply an increase in diagnostic
interventions. Figure 6.2 shows current and optimized investment into diagnostic interventions.
Compared to the current diagnostic approach, which primarily builds on mass screening,
optimized investment into screening and diagnosis would imply a mix of diagnostic
interventions. In addition to currently available interventions, incentivized types of contact
tracing and active case finding could absorb substantial investments as part of optimized
allocations. Within currently available interventions, allocations to screening programs based
on fluorography could be reduced substantially, while diagnosis including rapid molecular tests
should be scaled up and provided to all people with presumptive TB. Overall, and considering
44                                                            Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


     potential savings on hospital-care, optimized allocations imply doubling investment into case
     finding and diagnostic interventions to find the missing cases.

     Considering that the actual prevalence and incidence of TB and thereby the size of the
     undiagnosed population in Belarus are not known, strategies to increase case finding should be
     continuously monitored and carefully evaluated during scale-up. This is required in order to
     assess whether the yield of newly identified cases is commensurate to the additional
     investments.

     incidence, prevalence and deaths

     Shifts within treatment and care programs

     TB treatment and care (including hospital, ambulatory and palliative care as well as involuntary
     isolation) absorbed approximately three quarters of Belarus’ TB spending in 2015. Optimization
     analysis suggests that large reallocations are possible within TB treatment and care programs.
     Optimized allocations imply that a combination of shortened hospital-based treatment,
     ambulatory care and incentivized ambulatory care would provide for approximately 90% of TB
     patients. Advice from national experts suggested that immediately closing involuntary isolation
     departments was not possible and that not all palliative care patients could be transitioned to
     new drug treatment regimens immediately. These treatment modalities, which were not cost-
     effective, were therefore constrained in the analysis, which means that investment into
     involuntary Isolation and palliative care in Figure 6.3 represents the minimum funding level that
     is needed to sustain the transition process from these modalities to more cost-effective types of
     treatment.

Improved outcomes with optimized allocations

The optimized allocation of resources as shown in Figure 6.1 would have substantial effects.
Figure 6.4 describes trends in TB prevalence and TB related deaths in the general population
aged 15-64. Optimized allocation of resources would reduce adult TB prevalence by 45% by
2035 in comparison to current allocations. In addition, the optimized allocation would also
reduce TB related deaths by 60% in comparison to current funding, and by 70% of 2015 levels,
by 2035.

     Figure 6.5 shows key outcomes of optimized allocations for PLHIV. The optimized allocation
     would reduce new infections by 45% by 2035 in comparison to current funding. TB prevalence
     among PLHIV is projected to decline by 30% through optimized allocations. Furthermore,
     optimized allocations were projected to avert 30% of TB-related deaths among PLHIV by 2035
     in comparison to sustaining current allocations, and 15% of 2015 baseline levels.

     Other areas for optimizing the TB response, which were not analyzed in the model

     The analyses represented in the optimized allocation do not include all possible dimensions of
     optimization in the TB response. A number of other areas could be considered in strengthening
     the TB response. For example, infection control is an area, in which additional investments could
     be made, particularly considering the high prevalence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB in Belarus.
What Might Be Gained from Optimized Allocation of Currently Available Funding?                    47


However, as part of this study it was not possible to conduct a detailed situation analysis of
infection control measures, which would have been required to assess the extent of possible
efficiency gains in this area. There may also be potential to enhance tobacco control in the
population overall and supportive interventions to reduce smoking among TB patients.
However, a detailed analysis of the effect of tobacco interventions on TB was not carried out due
to limited availability of data to parametrize the model.

6.2     OPTIMIZED ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO MINIMIZE
        THE PREVALENCE OF MDR- AND XDR-TB
In addition to the overall optimization described in section 6.1, optimizations for specific
objectives were run to explore to what extent optimized allocations would differ for different
sets of objectives. This section summarizes findings from an optimization analysis to minimize
prevalence of active MDR- and XDR-TB.

Figure 6.6. shows optimized allocations to minimize MDR- and XDR-TB. Figure 6.7 shows the
effect of optimized allocations on the number of people with active MDR-TB.

     6.3     WILL OPTIMIZED ALLOCATIONS OF CURRENT
             RESOURCES ACHIEVE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL
             TARGETS?
     This section explores to what extent the optimized allocations shown in previous chapters will
     achieve national and global targets (Table 2.2) with the level of resources available in 2015
     (US$61.8 million).

     Optimized allocations across different objectives have consistent findings

     Figure 6.8 summarizes current allocations, overall optimized allocations (to minimize TB
     incidence, prevalence and deaths) and allocations to reduce prevalence of MDR-/XDR-TB. The
     comparison suggests that both optimized allocations require similar changes compared to
     current allocations. Optimized allocations to minimize MDR-/XDR TB require slightly higher
     levels of hospitalization than allocations to reduce all forms of TB. However, the difference is
     relatively minor and the core finding of this comparison is the similarity of investments required
     to maximize outcomes. This finding is not surprising, because given the high-level of drug
     resistant TB in Belarus, investments to reduce MDR-TB and XDR-TB are already reflected in the
     overall optimized budget to minimize all forms of TB.

Progress towards targets with currently available resources optimized

Figure 6.9 illustrates the effect of the overall optimized allocation on TB-related deaths. The year
2015 is considered the baseline year and therefore 100%. Different key targets and milestones
are represented by the dotted lines.

The Optima-TB analysis suggests that with current conditions, TB deaths would decline
moderately, but all milestones and targets would be missed. The target of a 35% reduction of TB
related deaths by 2020 will be missed, but a 35% reduction would be achieved by 2030. With
optimized allocations, the 2020 target would be reached and progress towards 2025 milestones
and 2035 End-TB targets would be made. By 2035, the optimized allocation of TB resources is
projected to reduce TB related deaths by more than 70%.

Figure 6.10 shows a comparison of TB deaths with the optimized allocation as shown in Figure
6.9 and the effect of parameter scenarios shown in chapter 5, namely the scenario to scale up
diagnosis and treatment to achieve 2020 targets and the scenarios to scale up to achieve 2035
End-TB targets. As expected, the optimized allocation of resources would achieve similar death
reductions as the scale up of diagnosis and treatment towards 2035 targets (scenario group 1
described in chapter 5 of this report).

     While major reductions in mortality are possible with optimized allocations and scale up
     scenarios, the Optima-TB analysis suggests that reductions in mortality beyond 75% would be
     difficult to achieve. This is due to a combination of factors. The finding that the End-TB target of
     a 95% reduction in TB deaths is difficult to achieve is partially explained by the high prevalence
     of drug resistant types of TB. As long as efficacy of treatment with existing drugs remains at
     current levels, it is unlikely that mortality can be reduced by 95%. Another reason why it will be
What Might Be Gained from Optimized Allocation of Currently Available Funding?                  51


difficult to end-TB by 2035 is the large number of people with latent TB infections, which under
a number of circumstances can get activated (including immune compromised states, old age,
malnutrition, diabetes, etc.). Diagnosis and treatment of latent TB were not modelled in detail
and would require a separate analysis.

Our projections suggest that also other global targets presented in Table 2.2. will be missed, even
with optimized allocations unless new technologies become available. Neither a TB incidence
reduction to below 10/100,000 by 2035, 90% treatment success for MDR treatment and a 75%
reduction in MDR-TB incidence were projected to achieve with optimized allocations under the
assumptions made in our model in relation to epidemic trends and treatment efficacy.
7.      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Optima-TB analyses identified and described a number of options to improve allocative
efficiency of Belarus’ TB response. The same budget available for TB-related activities in 2015
could, – if allocated differently – achieve the following changes by 2035:

    Reduce prevalence in the general adult population by up to 45%;
    Reduce the total number of TB deaths by up to 60%;
    Reduce TB incidence among PLHIV by up to 45% and TB prevalence among PLHIV by up to
     30%.

Additional effects might be achieved with the roll-out of new and repurposed TB drugs up to
2035. The current budget, allocated optimally could achieve NSP 2020 targets and Global 2020
Milestones. The current budget, even allocated optimally, may not be sufficient to achieve Global
End-TB Goals for 2035, with currently available technologies.

        Transition from hospital-focused to ambulatory treatment modalities could
        reduce the cost of TB treatment by up to 40% and free up resources for
        reallocation to high-impact interventions. High and long hospitalization is the
        primary cost driver of the TB response in Belarus. Available evidence suggests that
        hospital-based treatment does not have clinical benefits over ambulatory treatment.
        The duration of hospitalization could be reduced substantially in line with WHO
        recommendations. (WHO 2017). This recommendation should not be implemented as a
        stand-alone measure, but in connection with enhanced support to basic ambulatory
        directly observed treatment (DOT) as described in Recommendation 2.



2
        Strengthening ambulatory care through incentives for health worker outreach
        support and for patients’ adherence through a mix of delivery solutions is likely
        to improve treatment outcomes. Available evidence suggests that enhanced
        ambulatory care can improve treatment outcomes by approximately 16% as suggested
        in a recent WHO review (Nguyen 2016). Belarus is already providing food packages and
        transport support for patients receiving outpatient care and these client incentives
        should be sustained. Given the substantial investment implied in providing drugs,
        particularly for MDR- and XDR-TB, additional incentives to support adherence could
        play an important role in an optimized TB response. Incentives to support providers of
        outpatient care in facilities and at patients’ homes should be supported in line with the
        approach and lessons from the Mogilev pilot. The cost of video-observed treatment was
        estimated to be lower than the cost of incentivized outreach. Therefore video-observed
        treatment should be considered as an alternative for patients who were adherent in the
        initial phase of treatment and have the skills to use mobile technology (in line with
        WHO’s conditional recommendation in the 2017 guidelines on TB treatment and patient
        care).

        Enhanced ambulatory care requires a reform of TB care financing to replace bed-
        based payment modalities by results-based modalities and single-source
        financing. The current TB care financing system incentivizes facilities to sustain
        hospital beds and long hospitalization of patients, because financing is tied to beds. This
        implies that investments into ambulatory care are not made, because with a reduction
        of beds, units would lose their budgets. Based on the experiences from the Mogilev
        project and from other countries using results-based payment modalities, there is an
        opportunity for Belarus to explore applying a results-based financing system. Such a
        system might imply unifying all hospital and ambulatory TB services under a single TB
        budget code. In order to accelerate the expanded testing of the new financing system in
        Mogilev and Brest Oblasts, pragmatic choices may be required, such as the use of budget
        add-ons for incentivized ambulatory care based on the Mogilev pilot. National guidance
        for local authorities on how to operationalize changes in financing and delivery will be
        required. Since some patients will not be able to afford cost of care for co-morbidities
        related to TB, which are not provided for free in current out-patient services, there is
        need to ensure that care for such co-morbidities is taken into account in designing the
        financing model. Based on discussions during the Round Table on TB care held in May
        2017 in Minsk, there is need to conduct a review of the regulatory frameworks relevant
        to TB care in Belarus and identify required amendments to these regulatory
        frameworks.

        Since involuntary isolation department treatment is the most expensive modality
        for delivering treatment, reducing and over time phasing out this delivery
        modality, would free up resources for other high-impact interventions.
        Involuntary isolation department treatment absorbed 27% of TB response funding for
        6% of TB patients (US$ ~45,600 per person/year). There is need for policy dialogue on
        how to transition from the current system to other types of support to patients who are
        currently served under this modality. One approach for transition considered by
        national experts is to reduce from one involuntary isolation department per Oblast to
        one national department at national level.

        Mass screening and screening of obligatory groups are the treatment modalities
        with the lowest testing yield and reducing their coverage in favor of more targeted
        screening approaches could increase diagnostic yield. Although screening through
        fluorography absorbs an estimated 90% of TB related spending on diagnosis, it only
        contributed an estimated 12 % of all TB diagnoses, while the vast majority of new active
        TB was identified through passive case finding. Efforts to reduce mass screening require
        consideration of two specific challenges. Firstly, spending on screening is not part of TB
        program spending and therefore its reduction will not directly increase funding
        available for the TB response. Secondly, while yield of general population screening is
        low and cost per case identified high, simply abandoning it would increase the
        undiagnosed populations. Therefore the yield of scaling up alternative screening
        modalities (see following recommendations) should be continuously assessed. The
        reform of the TB screening and active case finding approach should be based on a
        detailed analysis of current TB testing yield (number needed to screen to identify one
        TB case) by sub-population and location to inform the new screening strategy.

        The contribution of contact tracing and active case finding among key populations
        to the total number of TB cases identified could be increased by introducing
        incentivized service delivery modalities. Data available for the Optima-TB analysis
54                                                      Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


         suggested that contact tracing currently accounts for less than 1% of new active TB cases
         identified. Since the yield of contact tracing is higher than for mass-screening, there is
         an opportunity to explore expanding contact tracing beyond current practice (and
         therefore improving compliance with global guidance on contact tracing of index cases).
         Providing provider-incentives per case identified and/or per person screened are one
         option to consider in expanding contact tracing. An expansion of contact tracing needs
         to be carefully monitored, and the ‘number needed to screen’ to identify one
         presumptive TB case and the cost per case identified need tracking. In addition, the
         undiagnosed population could be reduced by expanding active case finding among key
         populations (homeless, diabetics, alcohol, people who inject drugs, PLHIV) and
         exploring incentives for providers per TB case identified. Measuring yield of expanded
         active case finding in different sub-populations can inform decision-making on further
         expansion or reduction in active case finding in specific populations and locations.

         The scale up of rapid molecular diagnostics will be an important step towards
         reducing time from screening to treatment initiation and thereby reduce the
         infectious period. Optima-TB analysis suggests that expanding rapid molecular (Xpert)
         testing towards reaching 100% of presumptive TB cases would accelerate diagnosis of
         rifampicin resistance and thereby accelerate initiation on MDR-TB treatment (in South
         Africa, the country with the largest Xpert testing program, Xpert improved the detection
         of rifampicin resistant TB and contributed to a reduction in treatment delay from a
         median of 44 days to 22 days over two years (Cox H 2017).

         Reallocating savings from palliative care and involuntary isolation department
         treatment to new drug regimens is projected to improve treatment outcomes, in
         particular for XDR-TB. Current treatment success rates of 54% for MDR-TB and 38%
         for XDR-TB are below what has been achieved elsewhere with drug combinations
         involving new drugs. Optima-TB projections suggest that scaling-up XDR-treatment
         with current treatment success rates is not a viable pathway towards changing the
         trajectory of the XDR-TB epidemic. The use of drugs such as bedaquiline, clofazimine
         and linezolid for treatment of pre-XDR and XDR-TB patients would not only increase
         treatment success rates but was also projected to reduce future treatment need by more
         than half by 2035. Bedaquiline is currently procured through the Global Fund at no cost.
         The scale-up and sustained provision of effective treatment regimens will require
         financial and political commitment from the national government, in order to ensure
         that potential savings in other areas can be reallocated to treatment with more effective
         regimens.

         Introducing alcohol screening for all adult TB patients and provision of a brief
         alcohol intervention for TB patients with problematic alcohol use, are low-cost
         interventions with the potential to improve treatment adherence and outcomes.
         Problematic alcohol use is very high in Belarus in international comparison (WHO 2014)
         and alcohol addiction and problematic alcohol use are likely the most prevalent
         comorbidity of TB in Belarus. Due to limited data available, the effect of alcohol
         interventions could not be tested in the mathematical optimization, but the cost of the
         intervention was estimated to be fairly low, at approximately US$0.2 million for
         covering all TB patients with alcohol screening and providing the brief alcohol
         intervention to all TB patients with problematic alcohol use. Although not analyzed in
         detail as part of this study, it would be worth considering to also introduce enhanced
         and regular counselling on tobacco use among TB patients during drug collection visits.
Conclusions and Recommendations                                                                  55

        The number of TB notifications in prisons has declined substantially, but
        enhanced TB care and screening for prisoners post-release remains a priority.
        Optima-TB estimates suggest a more than five-fold reduction in TB prevalence in
        prisons in the past decade in line with a decline of a similar magnitude in TB notifications
        recorded in prisons. However, compared to the general population, the TB incidence
        rate in prisons remains high (>250/100,000 in 2015), which implies high testing yield,
        likely also after release. Retention of prisoners on TB treatment remain a priority post-
        release and should entail continued adherence support, which should be enhanced by
        incentivized ambulatory care.




11
        Considering the country’s growing HIV epidemic, there is need for strengthened
        linkages between HIV and TB services. While HIV testing for TB patients is near
        universal at 99% (WHO 2017b), ART coverage of 84% among TB patients could be
        further increased. There are major gaps in the HIV treatment cascade with less than half
        of the 35,000 estimated PLHIV diagnosed. Optima-HIV analysis recommended scaling
        up of ART and prevention programs for key populations. In addition to achieving 90-90-
        90 HIV testing and treatment targets, there is need to scale up IPT, which is currently
        only provided to 10% of PLHIV. Also, in addition to scaling up and linking clinical care,
        there is an opportunity in systematically integrating TB screening and IPT provision into
        routine care for PLHIV on ART, PLHIV pre-ART, and key population outreach services,
        in particular for people who inject drugs.



12
        Reaching the 2035 target of a reduction in TB incidence to less than 10/100,000
        will require addressing latent TB. Optima-TB analyses suggest that even very high
        coverage of active TB-treatment is unlikely to result in the targeted TB incidence
        reduction to less than 10/100,000. Interventions to reduce latent TB were not
        specifically analyzed as part of this study, however, the analysis did suggest a large
        number of latent TB infections in the general population as well as PLHIV. In order to
        inform future strategic planning processes post 2020, it will be useful to consider
        incorporating operational research needs on latent TB into the current national
        strategic plan.



13
        Closing strategic information gaps through operational research, will be essential
        in informing Belarus’ TB care reform. As Belarus’ engages in a process of TB care
        reform, continued generation of evidence to inform policy choices will be critical. The
        operational research agenda could include (but not be limited to) specific strategic
        information gaps that emerged as part of this allocative efficiency study such as
        enhanced understanding of TB transmission by sub-population, evolvement of
        antimicrobial resistance patterns, yield of different screening approaches and break
        points in the TB care cascades for different sub-populations.
APPENDIXES
APPENDIX A TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. The Optima mathematical modelling
suite was designed to support decision-makers in prioritization, resource allocation and
planning to maximize impact of health interventions. Optima-HIV was the most widely used
component of the Optima modelling suite. A more detailed summary of the model and methods
is provided elsewhere (Kerr 2016).

Optima-TB is a mathematical model of TB transmission and disease progression integrated with
an economic and program analysis framework. Optima uses TB epidemic modeling techniques
and incorporates evidence on biological transmission probabilities, detailed infection
progression and population mixing patterns. Optima-TB is a compartmental model, which
disaggregates populations into different model compartments including susceptible, vaccinated,
early latent, late latent, undiagnosed active TB, diagnosed active TB, on treatment and recovered
populations. In addition, compartments are further disaggregated by drug resistance type into
drug susceptible (DS), multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR).

Optima-TB is based on a dynamic, population-based TB model. Figure A.1 shows the basic
disease progression implemented in the model at the time it was applied in Belarus.

The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
people among health states. The overall population is partitioned in two ways: by population
group and by TB health state. TB infections occur through the interactions among different
populations.

Each compartment (Figure A.1, disks) corresponds to a single differential equation in the model,
and each rate (Figure A.1, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table A.1 lists
the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of infection. The
analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian terms as
previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior distributions of the
model parameter values so that the model generates accurate estimates of TB prevalence, the
number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that are available (such as
TB-related deaths). Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
consultation with governments in the countries, in which the model is being applied.

represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
“susceptible” and “vaccinated” represent individuals with either latent or active TB. Death can occur for any
compartment, but TB related mortality varies between compartments.

TB Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
address one or more TB-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s TB
national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform TB strategic planning and the
determination of program coverage levels.
58                                                                     Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


     The key assumptions of resource optimization are the relationships among (1) the cost of TB
     programs for specific target populations, (2) the resulting coverage levels of targeted
     populations with these TB programs, and (3) how these coverage levels of TB programs for
     targeted populations influence clinical outcomes. Such relationships are required to
     understand how incremental changes in spending (marginal costs) affect TB epidemics.2

     To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm, which is an
     adaptive stochastic descent algorithm. (Kerr C. 2017) The algorithm is similar to simulated
     annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an initial starting
     point. However, unlike simulated annealing, the algorithm chooses future step sizes and
     directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
     problems, the team has shown that the algorithm can determine optimized solutions with
     fewer function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent
     and simulated annealing.

     Uncertainty Analyses
     Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
     calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
     algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
     epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
     trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
     the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves.3




     2   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
         coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established treatment program that no
         longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for diagnostic programs.
         Most programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a more effective scale-up with increased funding.
         However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects because these high levels require increased incremental
         costs due to the difficulty of diagnosing more people as the yield of diagnostic interventions declines.
     3   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
         experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
         ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
         analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological, and
         biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty estimates.
APPENDIX B FITTING PROCESS FOR OPTIMA-TB IN
BELARUS
This appendix describes the fitting process during the application of Optima-TB to Belarus, and
specific modification that had to be included while fitting the model to the TB epidemic in
Belarus.

Demographics

Country demographics within the Optima-TB framework are calculated for each key population
within the model by considering:

   initial population size;
   annual birth rates or numbers;
   annual mortality rates;
   transfers in and out of population, due to aging;
   other transfers in and out of the population, due to non-aging effects such as migration or
    incarceration.

Population size, number of births and mortality rates are reported directly from the country,
while transfers between populations can either be at rates that are calculated using values
similarly specified following known data, or due to aging, where a proportion of a key population
is moved to the next population and assuming that there is a uniform distribution of ages within
a key population. As these values are directly reported by the country with considerable
confidence, the model output is usually consistent with the known data values for country
demographics and no modifications are required.

In the case of Belarus, it was found that the simulated population sizes using the reported values
did not follow the reported demographic values (Fig 1a). The discrepancy between the reported
and simulated population sizes was especially significant for two populations: the “0-4 Years”
and the “5-14 Years”, reaching differences in population sizes that were in the order of 10,000’s
and 100,000’s, respectively. These discrepancies were causing related challenges in fitting the
prevalence and incidence values for the disease.

It was found that the underlying cause for this discrepancy between known demographic data
and model output was due to an abrupt increase in the birth rate during the mid-2000s in
Belarus, following a change in its socioeconomic situation. (National Statistical Committee of the
Republic of Belarus 2012) This is reflected in the age proportions for each age as recorded for
2011. As a result, although aging transfers were applied as a proportional value (for example, in
the case of the “0-4 Years”, one fifth of the population was aged out to the “5 -14 Years” key
population), the actual aging structure should have assumed a non-uniform proportion.

This was able to be addressed in Optima-TB by including a non-linear aging transfer that
reflected the reality of the trends within each age bracket. The resulting fit when using this
updated term alone was able to reduce the discrepancies originally observed (Figure B1. B).
The inclusion of non-uniform aging was a new feature that had not been required for previous
country applications in other disease areas, such as HIV, malaria or nutrition.

Disease progression using epidemiological model

Progression rates for TB were obtained for natural progression of the disease and in response
to treatment for values such as disease duration and fatality. The model was setup to replicate


                                               59
60                                                          Optimizing investments in Belarus’ TB response


     these experiments by considering a population that all started in the same disease state, and
     examining how quickly people progressed into subsequent disease states or death.

     Using this process, we found generally a good agreement with the values for case fatality and
     disease duration, for both the natural progression of the disease and when on treatment (Table
     B.1; Figure B.2).

     Prevalence estimates from notified cases for total Active TB

     Data provided by Belarus included the yearly numbers of registered notified new TB cases, but
     not estimates in absolute numbers for TB prevalence. The most recent WHO Global Tuberculosis
     Report 2016 did not publish country-level prevalence estimates in the Global TB Database
     supplements and as a result, two options were suggested to estimate prevalence for Belarus.

     The first involved using the WHO report on TB Estimation (Glaziou 2016), and following the
     method outlined to calculate prevalence from the notified cases shared by the country. After
     consulting a TB expert however, we were advised to use WHO prevalence estimates, because
     trying to calculate prevalence from notified cases would almost always result in an
     underestimation compared to the widely recognized and accepted WHO prevalence estimates.
     Attempts using this method did result in underestimations (around 2000 cases lower than
     expected for a given year), partly because notified cases reported by the WHO differed slightly
     compared to those supplied by Belarus, and likely due to some additional assumptions made by
     the WHO that are not published within the WHO report (Glaziou 2016).

     Given the underestimation, the suggestion of using country-level prevalence rates published by
     the WHO 2015 Global TB Programme (sourced from supplement section of a journal article
     (Houben 2016)) was followed. The prevalence for a given year was multiplied by the total
     population of that year (reported in the country sheet provided by Belarus), in order to generate
     a prevalence estimate as a number for the total population.

     To disaggregate total TB prevalence by age, an assumption that 5-10% of the total TB-
     prevalence is accounted for by the 0-14 population was used. Using the assumption therefore
     apportioned 7.5% of the total prevalence to the 0-14 population and the remaining 92.5% to the
     rest (15+). There are however four age-groups in the model (0-4, 5-14, 15-64, and 65+), and the
     0-14/15+ estimates calculated were further split into these four groups by using proportions
     calculated from the notified cases reported by the country. For example to estimate prevalence
     in the 0-4 age-group, the proportion of 0-4 notified TB cases as a fraction of the total number of
     notified TB cases in the 0-4 and 5-14 age-groups combined, was multiplied by the prevalence
     number calculated for the 0-14 age grouping using the 7.5% assumption. Similarly, for the
     remaining 5-14 age-group, and in the cases of 15-64/65+ the denominator of proportions was
     the combined number of notified cases recorded for both groups 15+.

     The need to disaggregate prevalence according to smear-status or type of resistance was
     addressed by using proportions based on the numbers of notified cases reported by the country.
     The respective age-group estimates were multiplied by the proportions of smear+ and smear-
     out of the total number of recorded notified cases by age-group. Similarly, in order to
     disaggregate by resistance-type, the proportions of DS-TB, MDR-TB, or XDR-TB as fraction of the
     total notified cases of a given smear-status in an age-group, was multiplied by the smear-status
     prevalence estimates of their respective age group.

     The second method involved only the data provided by Belarus and three carefully selected
     assumptions. The prevalence of TB each year was calculated as an iterative process by adding
     incidence of new cases to the prevalence in the previous year and subtracting deaths and
     recoveries. The model was firstly built to study the value of prevalence for the whole TB
Appendix B                                                                                        61


population, results were compatible with estimates from WHO 2015 Global TB Programme.
Afterward we disaggregated the equations to study age-specific values for 0-4, 5-14, 15-64 and
65+ age groups. In the end we finally disaggregated for smear status and strain (i.e. drug
sensitive, drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB).

The assumptions used to initialize the model were: (i) the prevalence value describing the
starting year which came from the WHO 2015 Global TB Programme, (ii) the rate describing
children (0-14) cases selected accordingly to another report (Hovhannesyan 2015) and (iii)
incidence detection rate from WHO Surveillance Report 2014.

To study the data of notified cases, deaths and recovery cases polynomial regression analysis
was applied. The method also allows to infer prevalence of undiagnosed TB cases, both as a total
yearly values and also as disaggregated values by age, smear status and strain.

Disaggregation of by diagnosis and treatment status

Assumed values for diagnosis and treatment were taken from Global Fund reporting, with
diagnosis rate of 0.68 and treatment rate of 0.97 respectively. Assuming steady-state
equilibrium, this corresponds for a given population that 32% are undiagnosed, 2% are
diagnosed and 66% are in treatment. This was independently verified, using the case
notifications.

Progression from Latent to Active TB

To evaluate the outflow of people moving from the early latent compartment to both the late
latent and active TB compartments we based our analysis on a review paper. (Andrews 2012)
In this work, several studies from the pre-chemotherapy era were analysed where healthy
individuals got in contact with active infected individuals. Subjects were followed up for a
variable amount of time and the number of new active cases was recorded. After assuming, due
to the high level of exposure, that all people in contact with the active patients entered the latent
status, using statistical analysis (survival model) we were able to infer the probability of
developing active TB during the first five years after infection (early latent timeframe).

We applied the same methodology to devise the probability of not developing active TB after 5
years and, combining the two values, we were able to estimate the early latent progression rate.

APPENDIX E GLOSSARY
       Allocative   Within a defined resource envelope, AE of health or HIV-specific
 efficiency (AE)    interventions provides the right intervention to the right people at the
                    right place in the correct way to maximize targeted health outcomes.
  Effectiveness     Degree of achievement of a (health) outcome in a real-world
                    implementation setting.
      Efficiency    Achievement of an output with the lowest possible input without
                    compromising quality.
      Financial     Ability of government and its partners to continue spending on a health or
  sustainability    HIV outcome for the required duration and to meet any cost of borrowing
                    without compromising the government’s, household’s, or other funding
                    partner’s financial position.
  TB incidence      Estimated total number (or rate) of new (total number of diagnosed and
                    undiagnosed) HIV infections in a given period.
 TB prevalence      Percentage of people who are infected with HIV at a given point in time.
 Implementatio      Set of measures to ensure that programs are implemented in a way that
    n efficiency    achieves outputs with the lowest input of resources. In practical terms,
                    improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                    solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service
                    delivery models, and assessing and addressing service delivery
                    “roadblocks.” Implementation efficiency will improve the scale, coverage,
                    and quality of programs.
          Model     Computer system designed to demonstrate the probable effect of two or
                    more variables that might be brought to bear on an outcome. Such models
                    can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                    results in an accessible format.
      Program       Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
  effectiveness     and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating proven
                    practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
       Program      Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
  sustainability    service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                    response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over time
                    as intended by the strategy.
     Saturation     Maximum level of coverage that a program can achieve.
      Technical     Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
      efficiency    the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                    standards.
      Universal     Universal health coverage (UHC), is defined as ensuring that all people
         health     have access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and
      coverage      palliative health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be
         (UHC)      effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the
                    user to financial hardship.
