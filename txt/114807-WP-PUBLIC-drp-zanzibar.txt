The risk modeling undertaken through SWIO RAFI
focused on three perils: tropical cyclones, floods
produced by events other than tropical cyclones, and
earthquakes. Three hazards associated with tropical
cyclones, wind, flooding and storm surge were
considered in the risk assessment. In addition, as
