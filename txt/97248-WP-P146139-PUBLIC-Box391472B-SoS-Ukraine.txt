              XX Improving and clarifying the legal regulatory framework of the water sector. Ukraine is one the 10 most

                     energy-intensive economies in the world (IEA 2009). The National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities
                     Regulation, which regulates water operators, has only a limited political independence, which can jeopardize the
                     effectiveness of its regulatory mission. Moreover, utilities serving more than 20,000 customers are supervised by
                     various administrative bodies, which causes confusion and overlaps. From an economic development perspective,
                     the administrative structure in Ukraine and the numerous water operators are not facilitating efficiency gains
                     achievement (through economies of scale) and sustainability of water systems. Coordination between oblast,
                     rayon, and rural levels, on the one hand, and water companies operating in rural areas on the other hand, is weak.
              XX Ensuring tariff setting according to the cost recovery principle to improve overall efficiency. Water tariffs are

                     among the lowest in the region, and the affordability analysis shows that there would be space for increases
                     without generating an unacceptable burden on households. With water tariffs being kept low for political reasons,
                     water companies do not have enough financial resources to fund operations and capital investment. As a result,
                     the sector has suffered from underinvestment and poor maintenance for decades.
              XXImproving staff capacity and expertise. Education and training of staff at all levels of water utilities are key to

                     ensure long-lasting operational efficiency and sustainability of the water sector. Capacity and expertise of utility
                     staff and local governments regarding legal interpretation, contractual arrangements, interactions among utility
                     providers, tariff procedures, regulatory impact assessment, and external fund raising for infrastructure development
                     are weak (KPC 2009).

Economy. Ukraine’s economy is in crisis. Ukraine is the second-largest country of the Former Soviet Union, covering
603,549 km2, with almost 46 million inhabitants and an average population density of 75 people/km2. Sixty-nine
percent of the population lives in urban areas (World Bank 2015). Since 1994, there has been persistent population
decline, with an overall decrease of more than 13% (Ukrstat 2015). In 2013, GDP per capita was US$8,788 and real
GDP reached only 70% of its 1990 value (World Bank 2015). The country’s economy is import oriented, and its trade
deficit increases every year. The unemployment rate reached 7.2% in 2014 (Ukrstat 2015).

Governance. Ukraine is a republic combining presidential and parliamentary forms of government. The Ukrainian
constitution designates that the president is elected by direct voting and the prime minister and the cabinet of
ministers is appointed by the president in agreement with the Verkhovna rada (parliament). The country is divided
into 24 regions (oblasts) and the capital city of Kiev, which has a specific status. These regions are divided into 490
districts (rayons) and municipalities, with regional significance. State Administrations (oblast, rayon, municipalities,
and the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol) are the local bodies of state executive power. Oblast State Administrations
(Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and Kiev and Sevastopol City State Administrations)
issue licenses for water supply and sanitation, except for those utility companies that receive licenses directly from
the National Regulatory Commission (Verkhovna Rada 2015).

Water resources. Ukraine has uneven spatial distribution of water resources. In 2012, 3.1 billion m3 of water
were abstracted, 27% of which was from groundwater (Ukrstat 2013). The country has considerable groundwater
resources that can be used as a source of drinking water. However, these resources are unevenly distributed across
the territory, depending on structural, geological, physical, and geographic conditions of the Ukrainian regions.
Water resources formed within the country are estimated at 50 billion m3 per year, including 21 billion m3 forming
a strategic base for drinking water (NISS 2012). With 3,066 m3/capita/year, Ukraine faces an uneven spatial
distribution of water resources. Currently, reservoirs and ponds contain about 58 billion m3 of water, which exceeds
the local annual flow of all rivers throughout the country. In general, the regulation of the flow of most rivers
reached or even exceeded the upper margin of water and environmental destruction (more than 75% of the total
length of the channels at a maximum of 25% to 30%), which dramatically reduces and often completely destroys
their self-cleaning ability (MinRegion 2013c).

Water supply sources. Drinking water in Ukraine is extracted from surface water (65%) and groundwater resources
(35%). The majority of groundwater resources (over 60%) is located in the northern oblasts of Ukraine. The greatest
quantity of water (about 58%) is concentrated in the rivers of the Danube basin in the border regions of Ukraine,
where the demand for water is weak (no more than 5%). The areas with fewer water resources are the Donbass,
Kryvorizhzhya, Crimea, and southern Ukraine, where there are the largest number of consumers (AQUA PRO 2009).
Surface water resources used for various purposes are formed mainly in the basins of Dnipro, Dniester, Seversky
Donets, Southern and Western Bug, and the small rivers of Azov and the Black Sea region. Water supply for small
settlements comes from small rivers, lakes, and other water bodies. The current state of rural water supply systems
in Ukraine is critical. In most cases, groundwater quality is not satisfactory due to an important concentration of iron
and manganese. Thirty-nine percent of water abstracted is used for agriculture, 40% for industry, and 21% for drinking
water supply (Larive 2014). In urban areas, drinking water quality is threatened by old distribution pipes and outdated
treatment plants. In rural areas, pollution of rivers, water contamination, seasonal floods, and water shortages are the
main quality issues (NISS 2012).

water utilities can have different forms of ownership. They can be private companies (or individual entrepreneurs) operating
under private ownership, public utilities owned by municipalities, state utilities operating under the ownership of the state, or
utilities with mixed ownership. The most typical and commonly used form of organization for water supply and wastewater
utilities is the communal unitary enterprise fully owned by the local self-government (of a city, village, or residential
settlement). In many cases, these municipal utilities provide other local public services in addition to water.

Policy-making and sector institutions. The sector is controlled at the national level by several institutions. Several
ministries and agencies control the water sector at the national level, with no clear line ministry and mandate overlaps
(Figure 2). There is a lack of rational and optimal distribution of responsibilities among the administrative authority
levels, which include:

XXThe  Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing and Communal Services, which is responsible for the
  definition of the state policy on regional development, construction, housing, and communal services, including
  water and sanitation services. It sets technical standards, norms, and regulations (MinRegion 2013b).
XXThe Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, which is responsible for the policy on environmental protection and

  use of natural resources. The State Environmental Inspection and the State Agency for Water Resources are in charge
  of implementing this policy through controls and inspection (MENR 2014).
XXThe Ministry of Health, which is responsible for setting environmental norms for drinking water quality and for

  defining associated measurement methodologies. The State Sanitary and Epidemiological Service is in charge of
  implementing this policy (MOZ 2014).
XXThe State Executive Body in the Sphere of Standardization, under the Ministry of Economy Department of Technical

  Regulation, which is responsible for approving the state standards for drinking water. It also approves the
  measurement methodologies of drinking water quality (Verkhovna Rada 2010).
XXThe National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities Regulation, which is responsible for the regulation

  of local services, including centralized water supply and wastewater services, and heat energy production and
  transportation, as stipulated under Law 2479-VI dated July 9, 2010. It is a state collegial body established in August
  2014, and which was created as a result of the merging of the Energy Regulatory Commission and the Communal
  Services Regulatory Commission (NKREKP 2015).

Capacity and training. There is a severe lack of staff training and capacity building in the water sector in Ukraine.
Staff training has been mainly driven by donor-financed Institutional Strengthening Programs, which are largely
undocumented and “one-off.” The lack of well-trained technical and financial personnel in the water utilities has
led to inefficiency in technical operations and financial management. This problem is further compounded by a
relatively high turnover of management staff, who are political appointees with no specifically defined qualifications or
experience, and the lack of a single and broadly recognized professional association. As a result, there is considerable
room for improvement of staff training and for development of staff capacity in the water sector (KPC 2009).

Economic regulation. The water sector in Ukraine is regulated by different entities depending on the size and scale
of water and sanitation service providers. The National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities Regulation,
Ukraine formally regulates utilities serving more than 30,000 people, with an annual volume exceeding 300,000 m3
of water and 200,000 m3 of wastewater, with water and wastewater systems located in the territory of two or more
regions and/or receiving foreign investments. The commission licenses operators and sets tariffs according to a
“rate-of-return” methodology, which includes an investment program jointly approved by the commission and the
Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing and Communal Economy of Ukraine. All utilities that do
not meet the licensing criteria of the National Commission receive their operating license from one of 25 Oblast State
Administrations or the Kiev or Sevastopol State Administration. They apply for a tariff review to the executive body of
local self-government, which approves or rejects their request. The utility must then inform customers about future
tariff changes ( KPC 2009). As a result of this institutional setting, water utilities, depending on their size and scale, are
regulated by different entities using dissimilar price-setting processes.

Ongoing or planned reforms. In 2010–11, a new stage of the housing and utility services reform was launched.
Among other objectives, the reform targets regionalization of water supply and sanitation services provision. It intends
to promote cooperation among municipalities and create a platform for the sustainable development of both large
and small communities. The rationale of the 2010–11 reform is being revised with the goal of improving regulation of
water supply and sanitation utilities. However, when trying to merge utilities at the intermunicipal level, the National
Regulator faces major challenges solving ownership issues of water and sanitation systems for a large number of
communities with weak motivation for cooperation. As a result, the regionalization of the sector is progressing slowly.

Equity of access to services. Lack of information prevents establishing an accurate description of access to
services for marginalized groups. However, according to the Household Budget Survey, 41% of the poorest share
of the population (those living on less than $2.50 a day) has access to piped water and flush toilets (Authors’
elaboration). No study specifically about the service coverage of ethnic minorities and the marginalized population
has been performed.

Service infrastructure. The Ukrainian water and wastewater infrastructure needs upgrading. The majority of water
utilities are using outdated equipment and operate deteriorated, leaky pipeline networks. High losses and high energy
consumption are the main challenges of water companies. The total length of the water supply networks in Ukraine
in 2012 was 124,088 km. Thirty-eight percent needs to be replaced—it has outlived its product life—but only 1.9%
was replaced in 2012 due to lack of financing. Another major problem is old and deteriorated pumping equipment,
resulting in frequent breakdowns, downtime, and high energy costs. The average age of water pumps is around 30
years, and 80 to 85% are still old Soviet models. In Kiev, pumps from 1936 are still in operation. In 2012, there were
6,856 water-pumping plants in operation and 3,093 sewage treatment plants, of which about 87% need a complete
overhaul. In 2012, renovation was carried out on only 1.3% of the required replacements due to financial constraints.
There are 8,207 sewage pumping stations, 358 of which were replaced in 2012, and 2,849 of which need replacement.
The total length of the sewage network in 2012 increased to 44,832 km, of which 179 km was replaced in 2012 (1% of
the required length), and 17,187 km of which need to be replaced (38% more than in 2011) (Larive 2014).

Quality of service. The service quality is not yet satisfactory and needs to be improved. The average continuity of
water supply is 14 hours for rural settlements and 17 hours, on average, for the whole population. These indicators
increased by 44% and 9%, respectively, between 2005 and 2013 (MinRegion 2013c). In 2008, drinking water
compliance with physical-chemical parameters was 87%, and for bacteriological standards it was 96.5% (MinEnv
2010). Average water consumption by households ranges from 88 liters per person per day to 174 liters per person
per day (NKREKP 2013).

Customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of the Ukrainian population with the quality of water (per Gallup Poll) is

Overall efficiency. The efficiency of water and wastewater service providers is an issue in Ukraine. In 2013,
nonrevenue water reached 30%. The average collection rate was 98% in 2013, and the metering level was 70%, which
is below the average metering rate across the Danube region. Such a low metering level does not allow for consistent
measurement of all water consumption, and as a result, there may be a discrepancy between the volumes consumed
and billed (Ukrstat 2013).

Recent trends. Limited progress has been made in efficiency over the last 10 years. Nonrevenue water (expressed
in m3/km/day) increased by 24% between 2001 and 2013, reflecting poor network maintenance, underinvestment, and
improvement in metering level, which increased from 32% in 2004 to 70% in 2013. Nonrevenue water, expressed in
m3/customer/day, decreased by 26%, mainly due to water consumption reduction. On the positive side, the collection

Overall sector financing. The water sector in Ukraine is characterized by very low investments, and tariffs that
do not cover operating costs. Water and sanitation utilities suffered from underinvestment for more than a decade,
a situation that persists, since only 14% of the costs of the sector are dedicated to investments (Figure 5). Tariffs,
which are the major source of sector funding, do not cover operations costs. As a result, utilities are subsidized by
the national budget mainly according to priorities stated in the State Program for Drinking Water and in the State
Program for Development of Housing and Communal Economy. However, national funding is unpredictable, because
it almost never matches the plans approved. These financial fluctuations derive from political considerations and
administrative pressure. National funding also includes subsidies to low-income families and to several other specific

Investments. Investment programs are only partially implemented due to chronic underfunding from the state
budget. National and regional state programs, such as the State Drinking Water of Ukraine Program, the State
Program of Reforming and Developing Housing and Communal Economy, and the State Program for Ensuring Priority
Centralized Water Supply in Rural Settlements, are financed under general expenditures of the state budget. Local
budgets (e.g., oblast, district, or municipality level) and revenues from water tariffs provide only some complementary
funding. However, planned actions under the above-mentioned programs have not been implemented due to chronic
underfunding. As a result, only 20% of the targeted 2011 objective of the State Program was implemented. (Figure
7). An audit of the implementation of the State Program for Ensuring Priority Centralized Water Supply Services in
Rural Settlements suggests there was inadequate financing of the program during 2008–10. As a result, program
implementation reached only 25% of the planned level. Audit results of implementation of programs for reforms and

   development of the water supply and sanitation sector in Donetska and Luganska oblasts suggest that oblast-level
   state administration failed to ensure implementation of the planned actions due to insufficient management and lack
   of funding from the state budget. Moreover, a number of facilities planned under these programs were financed in a
   haphazard manner by other state target-specific programs on similar matters (i.e., national programs for development
   of the housing and utilities sectors for 2009–14, the Drinking Water of Ukraine Program). As a result, actual
   investment in the water and sanitation sector represents only €3 per capita per year (Verkhovna Rada 2005b).

   Cost recovery. The water sector lacks funds to ensure proper maintenance of assets and sufficient investments.
   With an operating ratio of 0.74, water utilities do not generate sufficient revenues to cover their operational costs, not
   to mention their capital expenditure. Cross-subsidies between commercial and residential customers are widely used.
   With water tariffs being kept low for social considerations, the sector has suffered from underinvestment and poor
   maintenance for decades. Moreover, water utility inefficiency translates into high energy consumption, resulting in an
   accumulated value of outstanding electricity bills of regional water companies of UAH 3.5 billion (approximately €300
   million) as of end-2013. Utilities remain one of the largest debtors of electricity supply companies (MinRegion 2013a).

Tariffs. Tariffs have been increasing and will continue to increase in the near future. Tariffs for residential
customers increased by 194% between 2001 and 2013 (Figure 8). Over the same period, the annual average inflation
rate was 9.3%. Nevertheless, water tariffs remain low and are a major limitation to the sustainability of utilities. They
are expected to continue increasing to reach compliance with the cost recovery principle (MinRegion 2013a).

Affordability. Tariff affordability is not an issue for the population. The potential average water and wastewater bill
represents 1.9% of average household income (Figure 9), indicating there is ample room for higher tariffs from a social
standpoint. For the poorest quintile, it represents more than 3% (Authors’ elaboration). The regulatory framework defines
a formal subsidy scheme to address affordability issues. A 2014 governmental decree introduced a national social
standard approach in the sphere of housing and utility services. According to this decree, subsidies are granted to
households for a specific period, and depending on the average income of the household. Subsidies for centralized cold
water supply and centralized wastewater service represent from 7 m3 to 9 m3 per person to 4 m3 per person per month,
and for centralized hot water supply from 3.5 m3 per person to 1.6 m3 per person per month (Verkhovna Rada 2005a).




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was done,
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to those best
performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to assess
sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water Program.
The outcomes of this assessment for the Ukraine water sector are shown in Figure 10, which also shows average and
best practices in the Danube region. The Ukrainian sector sustainability score is 54, which is below the Danube average
sustainability of 64. The assessment shows that, on average, the country performs well in terms of collection ratio and
affordability (Figure 10). The main deficiencies of the Ukraine water sector identified through the sector sustainability
assessment are investment level, wastewater treatment coverage, and nonrevenue water.

The main sector challenges are:

XXImproving                  and clarifying the legal regulatory framework of the water sector. Ukraine is one the 10 most energy-
                  intensive economies in the world (IEA 2009). The National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities
                  Regulation, which regulates water operators, has only limited political independence, which can jeopardize the

  effectiveness of its regulatory mission. Moreover, utilities serving more than 20,000 customers are supervised
  by different administrative bodies which brings confusion and overlaps. License and permit issuing authorities
  are located far from water supply operators, especially in rural areas. As a result, they lack local knowledge and
  expertise to efficiently perform their mission of water quality and quantity management (KPC 2009). From an
  economic development perspective, the administrative structure in Ukraine and the numerous water operators are
  not facilitating efficiency gains (through economies of scale) and sustainability of water systems. Coordination
  between oblast, rayon, and rural levels, on the one hand, and water companies operating in rural areas on the
  other hand, could be improved because there is currently no legal institutional body in charge of intergovernmental
  cooperation on regional issues of water supply and wastewater service provision. This situation prevents
  implementation of an integrated water management policy at the regional level, and the fragmentation of the
  sector is considered to be the key constraint of sector development. This has resulted in difficulties monitoring
  the sector and enforcing regulatory requirements for licensing and permits by the respective state authorities,
  difficulties in infrastructure financing due to the high number of projects with low levels of investment, low water
  system operational efficiency due to lack of economy of scale, and low attractiveness for the private sector to
  participate in the operations and financing of water supply systems (KPC 2009).

XXEnsuring  tariff setting according to the cost recovery principle to improve overall efficiency. Water tariffs are
  among the lowest in the region, and the affordability analysis shows that there would be space for increases
  without generating an unacceptable burden on households. With water tariffs being kept low for political
  considerations, water companies do not have enough financial resources to fund operations and capital
  investment. As a result, the sector has suffered from underinvestment and poor maintenance for decades.
  Moreover, the legal framework is not helping utilities raise funds because the law prohibits the pledging of
  infrastructure as collateral for utilities to to attract loans. Local tax and fee levels do not allow local governments to
  provide sustainable funding to water and sanitation utilities. Existing state budget financing of capital investment
  projects in water supply is unpredictable and unreliable, even for short-term planning (KPC 2009).

XXImproving   staff capacities and expertise. Education and training of staff at all levels of water utilities are key to
  ensure long-lasting operational efficiency and sustainability of the water sector. Capacities and expertise of utility
  staff and local governments regarding legal interpretation, contractual arrangements, interactions among utility
  providers, tariff procedures, regulatory impact assessment, external fund raising for infrastructure development are
  weak. There is also a deficit in equipment, training, and tools to monitor the efficiency of water systems (i.e.,
  leak- detection equipment), to maintain and rehabilitate water and sanitation assets (KPC 2009).
