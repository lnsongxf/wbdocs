PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIALOGUE

The introduction of a public-private dialogue (PPD) mechanism should include an effective
communications plan that targets stakeholders and the community and raises awareness about
the time and effort invested in dialogue and its expected outcomes.

The 10 “C”s of Communicating for Advocacy
When communicating with both external and internal audiences on the progress or results of the PPD, the message
should encompass these 10 attributes (Figure 3).

Strategies for Stakeholder Communications
Different stakeholders require different communications strategies (as shown in Figure 4), based on their perceptions
of the issues and attitudes about the PPD mechanism. The Stakeholder Mapping module (Quick Guide 2) will help
identify how to reach out to each group, targeting the communications plan accordingly.

Information is often held too tightly in developing markets. The success of a PPD mechanism relies on the dissemination
of information. Information allows involved parties to react accordingly. Any information created as a consequence of a

External communication

Engaging the media in PPD so that its expected and achieved
results are shared with the broader community needs to be driven
by substance. The concept of PPD, especially if apolitical, inclusive,
and transparent, is usually welcomed by civil society and the general      TIP

    countries may have limited experience in reporting economic and
    business news. To overcome this limitation, the PPD secretariat
    can provide background and context for journalists, to help them
    understand and capture the essence of the issues.
2.	 ONGOING BRIEFINGS: When the media are briefed and they
    report on PPD, maintaining interest depends on timely and
    informative updates. Over time, the capacity of the media will
    increase. Journalists will then become a part of the check and
