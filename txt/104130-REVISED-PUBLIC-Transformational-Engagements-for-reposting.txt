What Is a Transformational Engagement?
      Six million Kenyans gained access to electric power from the grid for the first time.
       Deep reforms also helped restore the Kenyan utility company to profitability and
       supported sector viability. A further 1.5 million Kenyans gained access to off-grid
       power while a private market for solar energy devices was created.

      750,000 Bangladeshi girls gained access to secondary education.

      More than 1.3 million poor Argentinians obtained health coverage and services
       through an innovative program that rewarded covering the vulnerable.

      More than 14 million Brazilians obtained social assistance through a new
       delivery mechanism that encouraged use of services by the poor.

      35,000 poor households in Colombia were able to pay for natural gas connections
       as a result of introducing an inclusive business model to a private operator.

      Sixteen Caribbean countries were able to protect themselves against catastrophic
       risks of earthquakes and hurricanes through a novel risk-pooling facility.

      Vietnam’s GDP grew at an average of 5.5 percent per capita over a generation,
       and its poverty rate plummeted—lifting 40 million people out of extreme
       poverty—through a sustained reform program involving continuous World
       Bank Group engagement.

These are some of the headlines drawn from engagements at the project, program,
sector, and country level that this report covers. They feature the results of interventions
to which the World Bank Group contributed, demonstrating the possibility of rapid
change toward poverty reduction and social progress. In this report, the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) reviews the Bank Group’s previous experience with such
interventions to enhance the knowledge about approaches associated with
transformational change.

“Transformational engagements” are expected to be a key part of the World Bank
Group’s move toward helping its clients accelerate development progress. As part of
the Bank Group’s objective to enhance its contributions to ending extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity, the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy identities seeking
transformational engagements as one of four key elements (World Bank 2013f). The

                                                                                       INTRODUCTION

World Bank Group has thereby determined to increase its emphasis on “engagements
that have the potential to have transformational effect.”

“Transformational engagements” are identified as those that “improve fundamentally the
lives of the poor and disadvantaged people.” Such engagements may “produce
demonstration effects that can be replicated or scaled up; generate spillover effects on
multiple sectors of the economy, including broader changes that increase government
effectiveness or stimulate private investment; result in far-reaching impacts; or help client
countries, regions, or even the entire developing world shift to a higher and/or more
sustainable development path” (World Bank 2013f, 23). Such engagements may originate
from outside the Bank Group, and the Bank may play a supporting or leading role in
them.

Transformational engagements are seen as involving more ambitious scope, higher
risks, longer time frames, and multiple instruments. Some characteristics of
transformational engagements identified by the Bank Group in the 2013 strategy are
that they are often multisector in design; involve a mix of knowledge, policy reform,
and investment services; and typically involve very strong client ownership.
Transformational engagements also “generally involve greater risks and require longer
time horizons to realize results.” These engagements, moreover, may not be identifiable
ex ante, as the transformation may not actually be apparent until after completion of the
activity. Moreover, transformation may be the result of a sequence of incremental steps
that in themselves may not appear to be transformational, but if carried out consistently
over time may lead to transformational effects.

Building on the intent of the Bank Group Strategy, IEG adopted a specific definition
of transformational engagements to help apply the concept of “transformation” to Bank
Group interventions and to enable it to derive evaluative insights. Beyond the 2013
strategy document, there is no generally accepted definition of a transformational
engagement or of how the concept applies to Bank Group operations. The strategy laid
out characteristics, conditions and expected outcomes of transformational engagements
as noted above. IEG used these to develop its specific definition to make the concept
applicable to Bank Group operations and to ensure the concept was evaluable. IEG’s
definition encompasses transformations for a purpose—addressing major developmental
challenges such as related to poverty or equity—to reflect the intention of the Bank Group
strategy to “improve fundamentally the lives of poor and disadvantaged people.”

Based on the Bank Group strategy, a review of relevant literature and Bank Group
interventions, and discussions with Bank Group staff, IEG adopted the following
definition for transformational engagements: an intervention or a series of interventions
that helps achieve deep, systemic, and sustainable change with large-scale impact in an area of a

INTRODUCTION

major developmental challenge. The “engagement” can encompass different forms,
approaches, intervention instruments (including knowledge, technical assistance, and
lending), and sizes; can occur in different contexts; and can be a project, program, or
series of interventions that address a common development objective.

IEG’s definition has four dimensions: relevance, depth of change, scale of change,
and sustainability (Table 1.1). These four dimensions permit a differentiation between
transformational engagements from interventions that are “merely” highly successful,
complex, or large in size.

Why Focus on Transformational Engagements?

The global community has set ambitious objectives to promote sustainable
development, end extreme poverty, and promote prosperity. The year 2015 marks an
important point in the potential for progress in development for the next 15 years as the
United Nations formally adopts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs
embody a transformational agenda intended to “shift the world onto a sustainable and
resilient path” (UN 2015). To meet the large financing needs of the SDGs, developing
countries and their partners would need to move from billions to trillions of dollars in
investments.1 To reach this level, domestic revenues in developing countries need to be
complemented by enhanced development aid flows and a more prominent role for
private finance. The ambitiousness of the development goals, scarcity of resources
available to meet them, and challenges resulting from slower growth prospects in the

                                                                                 INTRODUCTION

developing world imply a need for assistance programs from development partners that
support fundamental, deep change with the potential to reach large proportions of
population to accelerate progress. These aspects are at the core of transformational
engagements.

Development institutions are increasingly adopting the concept of accelerating
development through transformational change. A potential avenue for the Bank
Group is to enhance the impact and effectiveness of interventions by acting as a catalyst
or connector in partnership with others. The Bank Group’s development partners have
also begun to consider ways to enhance the effectiveness of their aid by emphasizing
concepts such as transformation, catalytic impact, and innovation. Although economic
transformation—that is, changing the structure of production from an agricultural base
to a more industrial/manufacturing and services base—has always been a critical part
of economic development and poverty reduction, it is now attracting renewed attention
in economic policy discussions and academia.2 Several development institutions have
begun to take a longer-term view of poverty reduction through economic
transformation to accelerate progress toward achieving development goals (AfDB 2013;
UNIDO 2013; UNCTAD 2013; European Union 2013). In addition, research has
identified the need for “transformational policies” for markedly raising growth rates in
countries or in improving the responsiveness of poverty reduction to growth through
greater inclusion of the poor as critical in helping achieve the twin goals (World Bank
2014d). These initiatives require new thinking in the global development community
about development processes and economic transformation.

In this context, the World Bank Group seeks to scale up its development impact by
helping its clients catalyze more fundamental or transformational changes. In doing
this, the Bank Group aims to encourage fundamental changes in client countries
through taking on a more transformational role. A key challenge is how to increase the
Bank Group’s impact, given the huge gap between the magnitude of the development
challenges and the resources available to finance and achieve the post-2015 agenda
objectives. This implies a need to enhance the impact and effectiveness of interventions,
to be more selective regarding the areas in which it intervenes, or to act as a catalyst or
connector for transformational change in partnership with others. Achieving
transformational impact will necessarily involve partnerships, knowledge generation
and sharing, and being a connector or catalyst for transformational activities, whether
they originate inside or outside the Bank Group.

In this report, IEG seeks to extract lessons from the Bank Group’s experience with
transformational engagements. The objective of this report is to inform Bank Group
management, its Board, and other development partners about characteristics,
mechanisms, and drivers of interventions in the Bank Group’s experience that have

INTRODUCTION

helped achieve transformational change in developing countries. Its purpose is to help
identify best practices and lessons that can be applied to future interventions to enhance
for potential for transformational change. The study focuses on learning and not on
accountability and derives its lessons primarily based on existing evaluative evidence.


Methodology
IEG identified a set of transformational engagements from the World Bank Group’s
experience by applying specific criteria. IEG distilled the findings of this report by
applying a “transformative lens” based on the criteria of IEG’s definition to purposively
selected cases across a range of sectors and themes of Bank Group strategic priorities
and operations.3

Transformational engagements were selected from candidates assembled from multiple
sources, including the list developed for the 2013 corporate strategy, interviews with
senior evaluators and (current and former) IEG and Bank Group staff, and analysis of
discontinuities in national development trajectories (across multiple indicators and
dimensions). IEG then screened possible engagements to ensure they were consistent
with the four dimensions of the definition (see Table 1.1). The screening exercise was
based on the ex post results of the engagements. The resulting purposive sample
reflects diverse sectors, themes, and engagements at the sector, program, and project
levels. It includes interventions involving both knowledge and financial support,
interventions involving all three major Bank Group institutions, and interventions of
different sizes. The sample comprises programs, projects, or series of projects or
interventions and includes those implemented with partners (Table 1.2).

IEG also selected comparator nontransformational engagements to contrast pairs of
transformational and nontransformational engagements. IEG paired engagements it
had confirmed as consistent with its definition of transformational with comparator
interventions that did not meet the criteria. Both the transformational and the
comparator engagement had broadly similar objectives, scope, and country context. IEG
reviewed a total of 37 interventions in 17 pairs or clusters.

IEG systematically captured information on differences and similarities among the pairs
along several dimensions related to country context, design, and implementation in
order to draw conclusions on enablers and constraints of transformation. The pairs
ranged from long-term sector development for improving access to infrastructure
services to programmatic approaches addressing human development, programs
introducing financial innovations to enhance risk mitigation, and efforts promoting
global standards and indicators. Many comparators to the transformational

engagements successfully achieved their development outcomes but did not attain the
higher standard of transformational impact and sustainability. This comparative
approach enabled IEG to identify differences in design, implementation, and contextual
factors within the pairs.

IEG used the four dimensions underpinning its definition to differentiate
transformational and comparator engagements. Among the pairs of interventions that
were broadly similar in scope and design, one engagement in the pair was assessed to
have sufficiently met the criteria of “transformational” along these four dimensions.
The comparators were often successful in achieving their more narrowly defined project
development outcomes, but did not meet the high bar of being transformational in one
or several criteria of IEG’s dimensions. Indeed, IEG’s earlier analysis indicated that only
a small fraction of operations met the high threshold of transformativeness. And having
received a “highly successful” rating for the achievement of development outcomes was
not a sufficient predictor of transformation: only about half of Bank Group projects
rated “highly successful” for their development outcomes (accounting for 2 percent of
Bank projects evaluated by IEG between fiscal 2008 and 2013) met IEG’s criteria of
transformational.4

INTRODUCTION

IEG also sought to assess the Bank Group’s role in broad transformational change at
the country level. IEG analyzed transformational change resulting in sustained economic
growth, poverty reduction, and social progress at the country level. IEG reviewed the
Bank’s experience in nine countries with transformational changes that resulted in
inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and social development.5 IEG compared the Bank’s
experience in these “transformational” countries against its experience in a comparator
group of countries with less or slower progress in these areas.

To facilitate and structure the review of country-level engagements, IEG defined four
types of initiatives deemed as transformational at the country level in the 1990-2013
period: transition from planned economies to market economies; poverty reduction
strategy initiatives; fragile and conflict affected states; and graduation of low or middle
income countries to middle and high income status through long term engagements
(see Table 1.3). Within each group, IEG selected a pair of countries from the
transformational and less transformational cases in which the Bank Group had an active
lending and nonlending program in order to draw appropriate lessons.6

The findings in the report are based on existing evaluation evidence and interviews
of World Bank Group staff. IEG synthesized existing evaluative knowledge in the
Bank Group and complemented that with insights from task managers and staff to
distill information on mechanisms of transformation and its enablers and constraints.
Evaluative evidence included project, sector, thematic, country, and global evaluations
produced or validated by IEG during FY00-14, including case studies prepared for these
evaluations. These were supplemented by a review of relevant literature and impact
evaluations, as well as an analysis of relevant development indicators.

IEG also reviewed evidence from its past evaluations on key dimensions of
transformations such as binding constraints, cross sectoral approaches, and innovation

and scaling up. Consistent with a learning product, the findings are thus not based on
new evaluations or feedback from clients and beneficiaries, but rather on new analysis
of existing evidence.

This paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents an illustrative sample of
transformational engagements and their comparators. Chapter 3 discusses the
mechanisms and factors enabling transformation based on IEG’s findings from the
analysis of projects, programs, and sector and country-wide interventions. Chapter 4
presents lessons and implications for the Bank Group to enhance its ability to support
transformation through its engagements.


1The Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa (July 2015) deliberated an ambitious and
comprehensive proposal to mobilize funding to help support the SDGs (see AfDB and others 2015).
2A number of recent studies have focused on economic transformation through industrial or
manufacturing development, industrial upgrading and diversification, and development of service
sectors (such as information technology services and tourism) as a basis for rapid and sustained economic
growth and development. Recent research in this area considers key variables such as comparative
advantage, factor endowments, information externalities, technology transfer, supply chains, and
globalization (see, for example, Lin 2012; Greenwald and Stiglitz 2012; and Rodrik 2003, 2013).
3Given the limited scope and budget for this learning product, IEG did not conduct a systematic review
of the entire Bank Group portfolios to differentiate transformational from non-transformational
interventions.
4An internal IEG discussion note concluded, based on a review of highly successful projects, that highly
successful projects are an exclusive category, accounting for 2 percent of all Bank projects closed during
FY08-13. IEG identified about half of the Bank projects rated highly successful for their development
outcome during this period as transformational.
5See Appendix B for a detailed description of the approach for the selection and analysis of country level
engagements.
6The country reviews were based on IEG country program evaluations, country strategy documents, and
Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report Reviews, and were supplemented by thematic or
corporate evaluations conducted for each of the four initiatives.

2. World Bank Group Transformational
Engagements: Patterns and Characteristics from
a Purposive Sample
Characteristics of Project and Program-Level Transformational Engagements

All the selected transformational engagements had several key characteristics in
common. Although the nature of transformations differed across the diverse sample
that IEG reviewed, common features emerged along the four dimensions of IEG’s
definition—relevance of the development challenge addressed, depth of change, scale
of change, and sustainability. This chapter summarizes the main elements of
transformational engagements and comparators in IEG’s sample.

Many pairs presented themselves on a continuum between clearly transformational
and clearly nontransformational, having aspects of both. The consistency of
engagements with criteria of IEG’s definition was assessed ex post, based on results
captured in evaluative evidence. IEG differentiated transformational from comparator

    engagements based on their achievement of depth and scale of change and their ability
    to sustain such effects. Figure 2.1 shows the extent to which the criteria for
    transformational engagements were met among the sample of engagements reviewed.
    IEG’s analysis of the pairs of engagements showed common features among the
    transformational versus comparator interventions along the four dimensions.
              Relevance of the development challenge being addressed: As the sample of
               transformational and comparator engagements was selected on the basis of
               similar scope, objectives, and design, all the engagements addressed issues of
               national or global importance. The most frequent challenges were poverty,
               equity, and access to infrastructure.
              Depth of change: Most of the reviewed engagements aimed to support
               fundamental change in a system or market, or in behavior. They differed in the
               degree to which engagements succeeded in attaining deep change or change in
               the trajectory of an important development indicator (Figure 2.2).

Source: IEG.
Note: Market change: market transformations that influence the supply and/or demand of good and services in a significant way and
contribute to country or sector wide development benefits (for example, a new industry or service introduced); systems change: changes
that influence the performance of the entire system by addressing different parts of a system (such as change considering the performance of
a sector, and entire supply chain); behavior change: change in the behavior of targeted groups (beneficiaries, government, private sector);
acceleration or discontinuity: an observed change in the trajectory of an indicator; root cause: change addressing the underlying causes
of a development issue.

              Scale of change: Most of the transformational engagements achieved impact
               (relative to the development issue being addressed) through scaling up of
               interventions and solutions—many of them innovative approaches or products.
               Impacts ranged from local to global. The review focused on several key
               characteristics (or mechanisms) associated with magnifying impact, such as

CHAPTER 2

         scaling up, replication, demonstration effects, and spillovers, which were often
         found in combination in the engagements. (Figure 2.3).

 Note: Scaling up refers to an increase in scope or coverage of a program or innovation. Replication or adaptation refers to
 a program being replicated or adapted in a different country, region, or sector. Demonstration effects refer to interventions
 demonstrating the feasibility or viability of a project, business model, or innovation, which are then copied by other players.
 Spillover effects occur when interventions in one part or sector create effects in a different sector not targeted by the
 intervention.


        Sustainability of results is a key dimension of transformational engagements. As
         the Bank Group strategy notes, “sustainability ensures that today’s development
         progress is not reversed tomorrow….” For this review, IEG assessed whether the
         outcomes of the engagements would likely be sustained beyond the duration of
         the intervention, based on available evaluative evidence—a high hurdle for any
         project. IEG considered aspects such as environmental, social, financial, and
         political sustainability. Whereas in 95 percent of transformational engagements
         in IEG’s sample outcomes were assessed as sustainable or partially sustainable,
         this was the case for only 35 percent of comparator engagements (Figure 2.4).

Sustainability was attained through comprehensive approaches considering entire
systems and targeting behavior change, building client capacity, and strengthening
client institutions. These factors are discussed in detail in chapter 3.

In most cases, IEG assessed transformational change based on intermediate outcomes
in specific areas. Linking results to changes in final outcomes was challenging because
results frameworks captured mainly outputs and intermediate outcomes (such as the
uptake of education or health services, rather than health or education outcomes) and
because of well-known limitations of attributing changes in development indicators to
specific interventions. Wherever possible, IEG used supplemental databases, and
evidence from impact evaluations to explore links to final outcomes, such as poverty,
equity, education, and health outcomes.

For investments in human development, the use of social services increased
significantly (see data presented in the following section), although the impact on
health or education outcomes can only be inferred through impacts on tracer indicators
(such as, well-child visits or attendance). In the land administration and tenure reform
project there was no evidence of an effect on poverty, but an impact evaluation reported
welfare gains: investment in home construction and improvement was greater in the
project areas than for the control group, indicating positive effects of land regularization
(PRODEP 2013). For one of the weather index insurance projects (in Kenya) where a
survey was conducted, there is evidence that the expansion of the insurance led to
increased farm investment. However, the study did not provide any evidence regarding
resilience or smoothing of incomes.

Research on efforts to improve investment climates suggests that simplifying business
registration may or may not have an appreciable impact on business formation and
investment, but some recent research using advanced analytical methods identifies a
stronger causal link between Doing Business indicators and economic outcomes, such as
investment and growth of private enterprises (Dethier, Hirn, and Straub 2010).

The ensuing sections provide background on the illustrative sample of the pairs of
engagements selected and reviewed by IEG. They show how the characteristics of
individual engagements compare to the dimensions of IEG’s definition of
transformational.


Access to Basic Infrastructure
ELECTRICITY ACCESS
Five engagements involving long-term power sector reform (in Kenya, Nigeria,
Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uganda) were similar in scope, aiming to address the lack
of access to electricity for a wide segment of the population. All five engagements
aimed to expand generation and transmission capacities; improve the performance of
national utilities; increase access to grid and off-grid electricity (including rural access);
achieve sector viability through reform of pricing; strengthen institutional and human
capacity; and attract significant private investments. The cases selected for comparison
shared similar initial conditions characterized by power supply shortfalls, unreliable
supply, system losses, and unviable utility companies, with attendant negative impacts
on economic growth, welfare, and social progress.

Three engagements that aimed to improve access to electricity by focusing on
underlying sector viability were identified as being transformational (Kenya, the
Philippines, and Uganda; see Table 2.1). Engagements related to access to basic
infrastructure services primarily targeted systems and market changes. In the
transformational cases, these were achieved by contributing to sector viability,
including a sound regulatory framework, financially viable utility companies, and
sustained increases in access to electricity services (World Bank 2015e). In its analysis,
IEG took into account country context and external factors, such as economic crises and
political changes, and natural disasters, which affected the pace of reforms in all five
countries.

In two low-income countries, Kenya and Uganda, support from the World Bank, the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) helped improve sector viability through a holistic approach and long-
term sector reform; their projects involved commercializing and strengthening the



                                                                                            13
                                                                                             CHAPTER 2
                            WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

capacity of electricity companies, tariff reform, reform of the regulatory regime, and
capacity building among regulators and other government officials. These reforms
improved the countries’ ability to create a favorable enabling environment and
institutional capacity for sustaining and growing supply; at the same time IFC and
MIGA played an important role in helping catalyze foreign investment in physical
infrastructure. National connection rates for electricity more than doubled during 1990 –
2014: they increased from 11 percent to 23 percent of households in Kenya, and from 6.8
percent to 18.2 percent in Uganda.

These countries also expanded customer and geographical area coverage, built
infrastructure that resulted in increased availability, and improved the reliability of
electricity supply. Indicators of sector performance and viability (including the financial
sustainability and capacity of utility companies) significantly improved in both
countries—as a result of their transformation, both the Kenyan and Ugandan companies
are now listed on the Nairobi stock exchange. World Bank Group financial, technical
and capacity building support helped improve the financial and operational
performance of utility companies, which had been seeing losses at the beginning of the
engagements. Overall, the deep and sustained sector reforms achieved a viable
electricity sector. These experiences also illustrate the potential of effective coordination
and careful sequencing of activities across the Bank Group for transformational impact
– where the three institutions have distinct roles to play to bring together public and
private sector actors.

In the Philippines, the World Bank and IFC helped transform the sector from loss-
making to viable through unbundling the national utility and reform of electricity
pricing. This eliminated large government subsidies to the sector, a major cause of fiscal
crisis. The World Bank and IFC supported system wide sector restructuring that
improved the viability and performance of the national utility, the reliability and
quality of supply through reduction in electricity losses and privatization of generation
and transmission. The World Bank helped the government shift successfully from a
bankrupt single utility model to competitive, wholesale electricity market—a significant
system change.

The two comparator cases also implemented elements of sector reform but these did
not lead to deep, fundamental change during the period of review. In Nigeria and
Pakistan, efforts in the period between 1990 and 2010 aiming to transform the sector to
sustainably enhance access to electricity in each country, and significant financial
assistance yielded some positive results and met some of the programs’ objectives but
did not realize deep, large-scale, or sustainable change to improve sector performance
or viability.1 In Pakistan, despite progress in improving reported access rates, during
the period of review the quality of supply and service remained poor and deteriorated

because of load shedding and blackouts.2 The sectors continued to be characterized by
weaknesses in governance, and financial losses resulting in weak sustainability.3 They
also rely heavily on government subsidies.4 This was largely as a result of issues with
continuity and commitment to reforms and weak institutional and technical capacity.5
Building on this experience, more recently, the Bank Group adopted programs in both
countries that aim to address structural issues in the power sector, such as the Pakistan
“Transformational Energy Program” initiated in fiscal 2013. These efforts are too recent
to be evaluated and are not covered in this review.6

OFF-GRID ACCESS SOLUTIONS
IEG reviewed two interventions related to off-grid access to electricity of the
unserved, both of which used different approaches and were identified as
transformational. The Lighting Africa Kenya project aimed to increase access of poor
households to better, cleaner, and safer off-grid lighting by mobilizing and providing
support to the private sector to supply quality, affordable, clean, and safe lighting for
1.5 million people in Kenya through the sale of 300,000 off-grid lighting units. Similarly,
the Mongolia Renewable Energy for Rural Areas Project aimed to increase access to
electricity and improve reliability and affordability of electricity services among herders
and in off-grid soum (district) centers, principally by developing a rural retail and


                                                                                                                 15
                                                                                            CHAPTER 2
                           WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

service network and providing subsidized financing for the acquisition of solar home
systems by 50,000 herder families.

Lighting Africa enabled transformation at two levels. From a market development
perspective, the project transformed the solar lamp market in Kenya by making
modern, good quality, and affordable lighting products available to the very poor. It
also demonstrated the commercial viability and sustainability of the approach to
address the lighting needs of the base of the pyramid, in contrast to donor subsidized
lending for the purchase of solar lamps. To achieve this, Lighting Africa considered
constraints along the entire supply chain (such as high taxes on solar imports, lack of
export financing, access to supplier credit, market analysis)—considering the entire
system. At project start in 2009, only 2 percent of Kenya’s population was using solar
lamps for their lighting needs; this number had grown to nearly 10 percent in 2014
(although growth cannot be attributed solely to the project). About 850,000 solar lamps
have been sold under the project from 2009 to 2014 (compared with an anticipated
300,000 units), benefitting an estimated 4.25 million people, mostly in poor areas of
Nairobi and in rural areas. Household members using these lamps no longer inhale
toxic fumes from kerosene lamps and paraffin. School children are able to study and do
their homework at night. Households and small businesses had savings by drastically
limiting their kerosene purchase.

Similarly, the Mongolia Renewable Energy for Rural Areas Project relaunched the
commercial solar home systems market by establishing a reliable supply chain and a
country-wide system of sales and service centers for maintenance and repair; it also
enabled underpinning of manufacturer warranties and partial subsidization of the sale
of solar home systems. The project transformed the market for solar lighting from a
subsidized to a fully commercial basis, accelerated its expansion from a baseline of 15
percent of the herder population in 2006 to 85 percent in 2014, and catalyzed its
expansion beyond lighting products to supply all kinds of appliances, such as television
sets and satellite receivers. By mid-2014, the market for solar home systems and
appliances had become established over the entire country.

TRANSPORTATION ACCESS
Infrastructure programs supporting rural roads addressed major development
challenges related to poverty in remote areas by creating road infrastructure in rural
areas where the poorer population is concentrated. The two engagements in Peru and
India had broadly similar objectives: provide a rural roads system to help alleviate rural
poverty through increased access to markets, income-generating opportunities, and
basic social services.




16
CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

The program in Peru was transformational. It supported systemic change by
developing the institutional capacity for rural road decentralization at several levels. It
also included specific pro-poor components, such as a mechanism to provide funds for
local development that helped small associations of rural producers to develop business
plans, obtain funding, and capitalize on the opportunities provided by the new
infrastructure.

The maintenance activities from the program created job opportunities for poor men
and women from rural communities living alongside the rehabilitated roads.7 This
concept was replicated in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. The
program in Peru was scaled up to eventually cover the entire country. An impact
evaluation for Peru shows large impact on reducing extreme poverty for rural roads
interventions (Macroconsult-Cuanto 2014). For the comparator program in India (2004-
2016), which is still ongoing, early evidence suggests increases in employment and
income in the three states covered by an assessment. However, despite this progress,
the sustainable maintenance of rural roads still faces challenges, and the mid-term
assessment also noted the need for complementary reforms to catalyze its goals of
inclusion and benefits sharing--including strengthening local market centers, skills
upgrading programs, support to microenterprises, and other measures to help people
exploit new opportunities.

INCLUSIVE BUSINESS MODELS
Among targeted interventions to enhance access of the poor to infrastructure services
through inclusive business models, the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
(GPOBA) grant for Promigas Colombia can be deemed transformational, whereas that for
Manila Water was incremental. The GPOBA Promigas project successfully transformed a
major utility company’s business model to be more socially inclusive by helping it
design and pilot a credit scheme that reached the poorer strata of the population (the
base of the pyramid) and allowed them to repay the connection fee in instalments.

Both the transformational and comparator interventions addressed a root cause, the
lack of affordability of access to basic infrastructure services by the poor. The GPOBA
Promigas project did so by demonstrating the ability of low income households to pay
for services, and the ability to recover the cost of service expansions through an
extended payment scheme. The objective was to connect about 35,000 families in the
lowest income strata to the natural gas distribution network and to demonstrate the
viability of this “base of pyramid” market by providing evidence with three months of
paid bills for gas consumption. Based on the excellent experience with this pilot (which
connected 34,000 poor residential customers, with a 98 percent repayment rate), since
2007 Promigas has vastly expanded the (non-Bank) credit scheme to finance the



                                                                                         17
                                                                                            CHAPTER 2
                           WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

purchase of construction materials, gas and electric appliances by about 800,000
residential customers; of these, about 30 percent, mostly the poor, had no previous
access to credit. This commercial approach proved to be sustainable following the end
of the GPOBA grant.

The comparator GPOBA project, Manila Water Company’s Water for the Community
program, represented an important change in the water utility’s approach to the
expansion of service to previously unserved poorer neighborhoods within its service
area. The project built on what the company had already achieved in terms of serving
the base of the pyramid and was incremental, but not transformational. The Manila
Water Company had already launched the Water for the Community program in 1998
and had reached 1.3 million people by 2007. From 2008 to 2013, a $2.8 million grant
from GPOBA helped extend its reach to the poorest households through the provision
of subsidies for reaching an additional 143,000 people. On this basis, the company’s
transformation into a more socially inclusive business appears to have occurred before
the GPOBA project, which incrementally supported its extension.


Access to Basic Social Services

Poverty reduction and social progress were also addressed through improving access
to (and use of) education, health care, and other basic social services. Equity of access
to adequate basic services, such as health and education, helps level the playing field
and open doors to fuller participation in economic growth, for example, by improving
the opportunity for women and historically excluded groups to enter the labor force.
Delivery of health and education produce mutually reinforcing effects—potentially
breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty. The interventions reviewed
aimed to address aspects of social progress and inclusion through a variety of
approaches and instruments, including support for female education, improved access
to health care, and improved access to social services through conditional cash transfers
(CCTs).

Four engagements expanding basic social services helped transform basic health and
education systems: Female Secondary School Stipend Program in Bangladesh, Plan Nacer in
Argentina, Bolsa Familia in Brazil, and Educo in El Salvador.

Fundamental change in the human development sector was generally achieved by
providing incentives to modify the behavior of individuals. In all of the human
development interventions, transformational and comparator alike, the primary means
by which outcomes were to be achieved was through innovative incentive mechanisms
to change the behavior of providers and/or users of services. The comparator cases



18
CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

used the same service delivery and incentives mechanisms but generally had
shortcomings in design and implementation. Frequently, they failed to consider specific
aspects of country context. Transformational interventions also fundamentally changed
the way service delivery was financed through innovative instruments such as results-
based financing or the way services were delivered, such as community school
management. In each case, individual behaviors were targeted to improve final
outcomes. In most cases, the rate of change in health and education indicators was
dramatic. By contrast, comparator engagements suffered from a lack of effective
targeting of behavior changes or of considering contextual factors in designing
interventions.

The Bangladesh Female Secondary Stipend Program project transformed access to
basic secondary education for girls by providing cash incentives for attendance, with
possible additional effects on other socioeconomic indicators for females. Before the
engagement, female attendance at the secondary level was low and lagged significantly
behind that of boys. The project helped increase female secondary school enrollment
from 462,000 in 1994 to 1.2 million in 2008. Although female enrollment increased
dramatically, school attendance was less than required by the project (75 percent) at 50–
60 percent. Aside from being among the first projects to incorporate monetary
incentives to support female secondary school enrollment, the program produced
unintended positive consequences. Community awareness surrounding the
opportunities and benefits of girls' participation in secondary education and
employment grew, marriage was postponed,8 more married women entered the labor
force, and women’s demand for access to banking services increased.

The comparator, Nigeria State Education, achieved its objectives in terms of girls’
education, but it was not transformational. Implementation issues delayed
disbursements of the Bank loan and reduced its effectiveness. The evidence suggests
that long term behavior change requires sustained and predictable payments over
multiple cohorts of students.

Argentina’s Plan Nacer transformed the health system by changing incentives to
provide coverage for the poor and vulnerable—which had not been covered by
comprehensive health insurance reform. Plan Nacer and its comparator, Brazil Federal
District Multisector Management, both addressed inequality and inefficiency in the public
health system. The objective of each intervention was to increase access and utilization
of health services.

Plan Nacer, supported through World Bank policy and investment lending, was the first
results-based financing operation in a Bank-supported health sector project. Policy
lending supported the government’s 10-year health sector reform program, which


                                                                                       19
                                                                                           CHAPTER 2
                          WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

emphasized health service delivery for the poor with special attention to the design of
an incentive framework to improve access to basic health care for uninsured mothers
and children. Phased investment lending supported implementation of the program.
Plan Nacer had strong and comprehensive incentives. Recognizing the central role of the
provinces in providing health services, federal funding to the provinces was increased.
Provincial governments received payments based on the number of individuals
enrolled in Plan Nacer. Additional funding was contingent on attaining health outcome
targets. Linking funding to outcomes increased competition among health services
providers, creating an incentive to increase the number of services provided and to
increase the number of individuals enrolled in the Plan. Patients benefited from
improved quality of services and a cash subsidy for enrollment (IEG 2011d).

Coverage under Plan Nacer increased rapidly. By 2010, the plan covered 84 percent of
the target population in Argentina’s poorest provinces in the north (558,000 members).
The plan was scaled up to the national level, covering 56 percent of the population in
the remaining provinces. The enrollment rate was 100 percent among eligible children
and 63 percent among eligible women at the end of the project. By 2010 more than 1.3
million individuals who previously had no health insurance were covered under Plan
Nacer. The program has since been scaled up to nonmembers.

This is in marked contrast to the comparator project, the Brazil Federal District
Multisectoral Project. The instrument was poorly chosen. The project was financed
through a Sector Wide Approach, which requires strong government commitment and
high quality staff, both of which were lacking in the project. Furthermore, the project
design relied on a weak incentive structure (disbursement linked indicators) that was
ultimately not introduced. The project did not record any measurable improvement in
health outputs.

Brazil’s Bolsa Familia CCT program transformed the country’s social assistance
program by providing adequate incentives for desired changes in behavior (for
example, vaccinations and school attendance) among targeted beneficiaries. The
program is addressing the significant gap in access of the poor to education and health
services compared with the national average. It was designed to cover 32 percent of the
population, including the poor and extremely poor. The program has been key to the
reduction in poverty and equity, accounting for about one-fifth of the reduction in the
Gini coefficient (Chioda, De Mello, and Soares 2012; Barros and others 2010). It ensures
that beneficiaries understand the expectations for changes in behavior. The conditions
under which cash transfers will be made have been widely publicized in Brazil. Under
Bolsa Familia, the number of beneficiaries increased from 3.6 million in 2003 to 17.7
million in 2009.

WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

By contrast, the Turkey Social Risk Mitigation project was only partially successful in
publicizing the Social Solidarity Fund Program; some eligible beneficiaries were
unaware of available support or of the “health facility use” condition. An impact
evaluation found that 90 percent of education beneficiaries and 87 percent of health
beneficiaries in Turkey did not know the conditions they needed to meet in order to
maintain their eligibility. As a result, although the project helped improve
immunization rates, health service use did not increase, and the project did not affect
the behavior of beneficiaries.

In El Salvador, the Bank helped institutionalize an innovative system of community-
established and -run schools in areas affected by civil war. Enrollment in Educo grew
from 3,072 pre-primary and 5,344 primary students in 1991, when the Educo program
was initiated, to 323,000 students by 2005; the program was managed by 2,122 school
committees. Educo enrollment figures represented 50 percent of the total public
enrollment at the preschool level and close to 37.5 percent at the primary level. Key
program features focusing on incentives such as school authority and accountability
strategies, as well as active parent involvement in school management, monitoring
student and teacher absenteeism, began to spread to the more traditional system, and
many of the policies piloted under Educo were mainstreamed, having demonstrated
their efficacy.

A comparator project for community based education (Madagascar Education Sector
Development Project) had limited impact as decentralization was imposed (top-down),
hiring and dismissal of teachers remained centralized (lacking a critical accountability
mechanism), and complex design resulted in low disbursement.


Global Indicators and Financial and Private Sector Development
Financial innovations aimed to mitigate and help manage climate and disaster risks.
The disaster risk management projects in the Caribbean and Guatemala addressed the
risk of adverse natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and excess rainfall. Both
projects aimed to provide immediate funds to allow governments to respond to a
natural disaster. Although both programs aimed to create or improve a system or
market, only the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was deemed
transformational, mainly because of the sustained nature of this engagement. It
introduced a pooled catastrophe risk insurance instrument that was not previously
available to small Caribbean countries. Thus it caused a change in the market for
catastrophe risk insurance. The project design had several innovative aspects that
lowered the cost of insurance and ensured that payouts were made quickly. CCRIF is
being scaled up by adding new insurance products, and the model is being replicated in



                                                                                           21
                                                                                            CHAPTER 2
                           WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

the Pacific. CCRIF appears to be financially sustainable, able to maintain current
operations without further donor support.

The comparator, the Guatemala Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO), was
potentially transformational in offering a new financial instrument that was recently
developed by the Bank. However, the almost immediate exercise of the drawdown
option by the government seemed to reduce its incentive to complete the loan’s policy
and institutional reforms. In addition, the CAT-DDO was a one-time financing
instrument.

Both the Doing Business indicators and World Bank Enterprise Surveys and
Investment Climate Assessments (ICAs) aimed to improve investment climates,
addressing a main bottleneck to economic activity. Both provided information on the
quality of the investment climate, reporting on costs to private firms. Enterprise Surveys
covered a wide range of investment climate issues, including access to infrastructure
and finance, whereas Doing Business was more narrowly focused on laws and
regulations affecting the opening and operation of a business.

Doing Business has been identified as transformational, as it fundamentally changed
the way the quality of the business environment is measured, and it catalyzed actions
to address constraints. It was the first global indicator project of its kind and scale to
offer an objective, non-perception-based, and quantifiable approach to measuring
business regulation on a microeconomic level across a very large number of countries.

In this sense, Doing Business indicators are considered a global public good. Its
methodology of using a prototypical firm facilitated cross-country comparability and
ranking of performance. The indicators provide actionable guidance to policy makers—
prompting changes in behavior. Thus, Doing Business has raised awareness of the
importance of laws and regulations affecting business activity, motivated reforms in a
number of countries, and been used in hundreds of research papers. Engagements with
clients through the global Doing Business appear to have found traction with clients far
more frequently than country engagements through ICAs. Thus, Doing Business has
been transformational in motivating governments to adopt reforms which have shown
improvements in investment climates, at least as measured by Doing Business
indicators.

However, as Doing Business does not measure all elements of the investment climate,
there is a less-than-complete linkage between Doing Business-motivated reforms and
actual improvements in the investment climate (Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett
2010); and the link with the final outcomes of investment and enterprise growth has




22
CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

been questioned -- some studies find evidence of plausible causality, whereas others
find little or no evidence.

Doing Business has been scaled up and replicated by the Bank Group in other areas (for
example, Investing Across Borders; Logistics Performance Index; and Women, Business and
the Law) on a grander scale than Enterprise Surveys, because Doing Business can
economically cover all countries annually through a unique delivery model. Both Doing
Business and Enterprise Survey data have been used in research on regulatory reform
and the impact of regulation on economic and social outcomes, but Doing Business
indicators have been used much more extensively. Doing Business is by far the most
searched database of all of the Bank Group’s global indicators. By contrast, although
almost all ICAs now have a matrix of recommendations to address constraints, an IEG
evaluation found that the reviewed ICAs had excessively generic, off-the-shelf
recommendations, mostly too general to be operationally useful (IEG 2011c).


Rural Development
Land tenure and administration projects aimed to address intractable issues around
land rights and tenure with a focus on equity and poverty. The reviewed programs in
Nicaragua and Panama helped develop a framework for the administration of property
rights to promote equitable access to land, including for indigenous peoples who lacked
land titles. The lack of proper land tenure rights is an impediment for economic
development. Land tenure issues have contributed to long-standing conflicts, with poor
farmers and indigenous people losing land in the process.

The Nicaragua Land Administration projects (PRODEP) transformed the country’s policy
and legal framework for land rights, strengthened the capacity of key institutions (land
agencies), and facilitated titling for indigenous people previously lacking land rights—
involving deep systemic change. An impact assessment (PRODEP 2013) found that the
key legal and procedural changes achieved under the project have established the
conditions to implement a countrywide land regularization program. The project
facilitated titling for indigenous peoples through a process of titling land under
traditional territorial councils that by project end were reported to be respected by all
government levels—a historic milestone with regard to the legal recognition of
indigenous people’s land rights.

A household survey (2012) found that investment in home construction and
improvement was greater in the titled project areas than in the control group, consistent
with the theory of the positive effects of land tenure regularization.9 Despite having
similar objectives, the comparator Panama Land Administration Project lacked the same

                                                                                             CHAPTER 2
                            WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

deep focus on issues of indigenous peoples and understanding of interests of different
groups.


Climate Change and Natural Resources Management

Engagements in the sample sought to address climate change and sustainability
through forest management programs and addressing externalities associated with
agriculture and extractive industries. Selected programs in Brazil and Indonesia (Pilot
Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forest, or PPG-7; Sustaining Indonesia’s
Forests) addressed the destruction of tropical forests and the attendant impacts on
biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Two other programs, the Biodiversity
and Agricultural Commodities Program (BACP) and the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), responded to the need for major economic sectors to address negative
externalities associated with their activities (agriculture and extractive industries,
respectively) by supporting the development and implementation of voluntary global
standards.

The PPG-7 program was transformational, but the program in Indonesia did not gain
traction. The Brazil and Indonesia forest management interventions shared the objective
of protecting global forest values through implementation of sustainable development
approaches. They combined behavioral, systemic, and market change aiming to change
the trajectory of sustainability of forest management. They both intended to change the
sectoral, enterprise, and individual behaviors that were driving deforestation from an
unsustainable to a sustainable trajectory, with traction in Brazil but little progress in
Indonesia. Although only partially attributable to the Bank–administered PPG-7
program (1994–2012), data show that the rate of deforestation in Brazil has slowed
significantly since the mid-2000s. Deforestation in Indonesia has continued to increase
in the last decade.

PPG-7 supported numerous scientific research activities, strategy studies, capacity
building, and piloting and demonstration projects, which prepared the necessary
knowledge base for the transformation of Brazil’s policy and institutional framework
for forest protection and management. It also helped prepare numerous follow-up
projects that helped strengthen Brazil’s protected areas framework and consolidate the
open agricultural frontier. All together, these interventions have helped to successfully
reverse the trajectory of Amazon deforestation from an unsustainable to a sustainable
trend. The program in Indonesia received only weak support at the national level; as a
result, little government capacity building could be undertaken and though some policy
reforms were enacted, they were not seriously implemented, and most sustainable

CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

forestry activities remain dependent on donor funding. As of 2012, the intended
transformation was still a work in progress.

BACP and EITI both aimed to promote global standards by supporting policy and
behavioral changes in individual firms and countries, respectively. The BACP’s
engagement to support more sustainable management practices in agricultural
production has been effective with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Since its
launch in 2004, Certified Sustainable Palm Oil sales have grown to 5.4 million tons,
about 18 percent of the global supply in 2014. As clearly stated in its objective
statement, the BACP was designed to fundamentally transform the agricultural
commodity market’s behavior towards biodiversity through the promotion of Better
Management Practices (that is, the development and adoption of a global standard for
biodiversity protection). The main driver of this transformation was the self-interest of
private companies to meet the consumer demand for sustainably produced oil, which
BACP helped demonstrate.

By contrast, the EITI has been effective in achieving its contracted outcomes, but
there has been far less evidence about its expected impacts. Thus, as of 2014,
extractive industries revenue transparency had improved in the 48 implementing
countries, including 18 of the 29 countries in the International Monetary Fund’s list of
“resource-rich developing countries.” By empowering civil society organizations to
participate as stakeholders, the EITI process catalyzed a fundamental change in the
relationship between governments and civil society. However, in terms of the expected
impacts on governance and accountability, a 2011 IEG review was inconclusive, and a
recent analysis by the Natural Resource Governance Institute found that countries
participating in EITI had experienced a reversal of key governance and accountability
indicators after their EITI accession (Kaufmann 2014). While there are countries where
EITI has helped improve accountability, the long-term sustainability of these
achievements remains uncertain; it depends on the government’s willingness to
continue the initiative, which in turn depends on local political dynamics and the
government’s perception of EITI’s influence on foreign investors.


Country-Level Transformational Engagements
IEG reviewed possible contributions to transformational engagements by the World
Bank Group related to sustainable and inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and
social progress at the country level. IEG’s review focuses on a subset of four strategic
initiatives10 and country programs implemented during the period 1990-2013 with an
active assistance program by the World Bank Group and its development partners. The
overarching goal of the four initiatives was to bring about a paradigm shift associated

with transformational change to support sustainable economic and social
transformation of Bank Group client countries. Each of these four initiatives was backed
up by an innovative strategy underpinned by Bank Group analytical work and
research, including a dedicated World Development Report. The country-level review
complements the review of engagements at the project, program, and sector levels,
applying the definition and criteria of transformation, and using a comparative analysis
of transformational and comparator cases. Within the four strategic initiatives, IEG
selected countries for this review based on an examination of their performance in
substantially reducing poverty, making sustained progress in their social sectors, and
achieving broad based and inclusive growth. The country reviews were based on
existing evaluative materials, country strategies, and analytical products informing
country engagements. (See Appendix B for the country selection and review
methodology.)

Only a modest number of countries experienced successful transformations over the
past 25 years. IEG found that out of more than 80 emerging and developing economies
for which there are sufficient economic and social data for the period 1990–2013 to
analyze, about two dozen economies experienced high, sustained, inclusive growth;
poverty reduction; and sustained social progress that over time led to transformational
and irreversible changes and welfare gains for a large majority of their population.11
The role of the Bank Group and the nature of its engagement differed across these
successful countries, based on the level of development, binding constraints, and pace
of change in each country.

The transformational country cases that IEG selected for this review on average had
much faster gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth than their comparator
countries for the entire review period, faster poverty reduction, as well as significantly
faster social progress and more equitable distribution of income (or larger declines in
income inequality) and sustained progress over a period of time compared to their
respective group average and or their respective comparator countries (Figure 2.5).

                             WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

The evaluative evidence provided by nine country case reviews and sector and thematic
evaluations related to the four initiatives (see Appendix C) yielded a rich and complex
picture of the World Bank Group’s support for developing countries through the four
strategic initiatives examined. Key factors that appear to explain much of the cross-
country differences in Bank Group performance, and the effectiveness of its support
to their observed transformative changes includes differences in:
        Client country’s implementation capacity
        Client government’s political commitment to deep and sustained reforms
        Political economy factors/political cycles,
        The nature of the Bank Group’s strategic initiatives
        The technical quality of the Bank Group’s financial and analytical products
        The quality of Bank Group staff and its skills mix12
        The appropriateness and relevance of World Bank Group products to clients’
         needs.
The global economic environment (including external shocks) has also played an
important role in determining the speed and nature of countries’ transformations.
The advent of hyperglobalization from the mid-1990s onward, combined with
economic, social, and political reforms in many emerging, developing, and transition
economies that started in the late 1980s, helped accelerate the pace of structural
transformations in many countries. Nevertheless, the speed, depth, scope, and
sustainability of the change varied widely across the nine countries (for a detailed
analysis see Appendix C).

The centrally planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe made rapid progress
toward transitioning to market economies during the 1990s, with the support of the
World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Union. By the
early 2000s, their transformation was incomplete, however, and profound economic,
social, and political consequences that accompanied transition posed strategic
challenges (IEG 2004). Nevertheless, in many countries, the key steps in moving to a
market economy were well advanced. Early optimisms yielded to a realization that the
Bank Group greatly underestimated the speed of transition and the impact of
corruption and the weakness of core institutions and public administrations in
managing the transition process. Poverty was also a far more serious problem than the
Bank expected in countries making the transition from centrally planned to market
economies. Despite these lapses, in a relatively short period (about a decade in most
cases), the transition countries, such as Poland, had transformed into competitive,
market-based economies; several moved from middle-income to high-income status.

CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

The contribution of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) initiative varied widely
across countries, depending mainly on the initial conditions in each country’s public
sector, government-partner relationships, and relations among donors. The PRS
initiative was a comprehensive approach underpinned by Bank Group analytical
work.13 The initiative added the most value in countries where government leadership
and aid management processes were already strong. It has had less effect in countries
with weak public sector capacity and donor-dominated aid relationships. Because the
initiative includes a uniform requirement (completion of an acceptable document), it
was not sufficiently tailored to match the full range of capabilities and public policy
priorities in low-income countries. Most PRS papers (PRSPs), for example, deal
primarily with the composition of public expenditure, giving inadequate treatment to
growth and other poverty-reducing actions. External partners supported the PRS
process during formulation but did not systematically adapt the content of their
assistance programs in a coordinated manner around the content of PRSPs, partly
because of shortcomings in the strategies themselves. Nonetheless, the PSR initiative
was a critical instrument in several transformational country engagements (for example,
in Vietnam).

Fragile and conflict-affected states represent some of the most intractable challenges
to development and human safety. Insecurity of people has become a primary
development challenge (World Bank 2011). Although the number of interstate and civil
wars has declined, many countries are experiencing new forms of violence and fragility,
including repeated cycles of violence, weak governance, and instability (World Bank
2011). The understanding and definition of fragility and conflict are also evolving. The
donor community has struggled to come to terms with how best to assist countries
affected by fragility and conflict (IEG 2006).

Informed by research, in 2002 the Bank suggested that the challenge of aid effectiveness
in poor countries with ineffective governments required different instruments,
supplemented by financial transfers, to promote change. This helped initiate a new
strategy (the 2002 Low-Income Countries under Stress initiative) for engaging with
fragile and conflict-affected countries to facilitate policy and institutional change and
improve basic social outcomes.

Two countries that have emerged from conflict (and have been identified as
transformative by this review)--Mozambique and Rwanda--performed much better in
terms of growth and poverty than the fragile and conflict-affected countries on average.
Their results and the World Bank Group’s role to help achieve them are nuanced and
need to be interpreted with caution. Mozambique has emerged from the end of a two-
decade long civil war as one of Africa’s best performing economies. Sound
macroeconomic management, large-scale foreign investments, political stability and

                               WORLD BANK GROUP TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS: PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS

significant aid flows contributed significantly to the country’s performance. However,
the impressive growth trajectory and gains in education and health have not resulted in
inclusive growth, job creation, and reduced income inequality, which prompts
questions about the current development model and the need for greater inclusiveness
and diversification of sources of growth.

In Rwanda, IDA lending was substantial, accounting for almost 6 percent of GDP in the
1990s. The Bank Group and its development partners played an important role in
Rwanda’s transformation as it sustained rapid growth, and reached truly impressive
human and social development milestones. However, poverty and inequality began to
fall only from 2009 onward – and remain very high.

In long-term strategic engagements, the Bank Group has been more effective and
relevant when it has applied its knowledge and evaluative evidence to the specific
development challenges of middle-income countries (MICs) and customized its
support to their development needs, which vastly differ from one country to another
and evolve over time. Based on IEG’s evaluations of the World Bank’s performance in
middle-income countries, the overall outcomes of the Bank’s country programs in MICs
were found to be moderately satisfactory in meeting country-specific development
objectives of promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. In fact, IEG found that
the outcomes in MICs were better than for the Bank’s work in low-income countries,
and indeed the outcomes in large MICs, such as Brazil and China, were assessed to
have been fully satisfactory—a high evaluative mark. Yet IEG also found that there was
significant pressure on the Bank Group to do better in an environment where MICs’
demands had begun to become more challenging and they were facing more choices of
support. IEG findings also highlighted the Bank Group’s role in the MIC context as
knowledge provider, broker, and facilitator of knowledge creation, where “AAA, not
lending, is often the best instrument to deal with more sensitive policy issues” (IEG
2008b).


1Findings are based on a review of Bank Group interventions evaluated during the 2000-2014 period,
corresponding to programs and projects approved during FY1991-2010.
2According to the latest World Bank Enterprise Survey (2013), about 45 percent of companies in Pakistan
identified access to electricity as a main obstacle—making it the most important constraint for private
companies operating in the country. The survey also indicates that the typical firm experiences about 70
power outages per month. In Nigeria, access to electricity was among the top two constraints of firms
surveyed (2014) and the top constraint among larger firms.
3Bank Group performance in Pakistan was assessed based on 6 ICR Reviews, 5 Project Performance
Assessment Reports, 3 IFC XPSRs, and 3 CAS Completion Reports and one Country Assistance
Evaluation (2006) completed during FY00-14. IEG complemented this with a review of relevant literature
related to the power sector in Pakistan.

4In Pakistan, this reached crisis levels during the period under review, in part because of the circular
debts emanating from the electricity sector.
5During the period under review, covering the 1990s and early 2000s, in Nigeria, the Bank Group was
also not successful in helping develop and reform the natural gas sector, which can provide the feedstock
for power generation.
6 The Pakistan Country Partnership Strategy (2015–19) focuses prominently on energy as one of four
areas to help the country tackle the most difficult but potentially transformational issues. In FY13, the
Bank adopted a “Transformational Energy Program” aiming to support power sector reform. In Nigeria,
formalized collaborative arrangements and senior management involvement helped foster greater Bank
Group synergy with the Joint Energy Business Plan and a Joint Implementation Plan (April 2014) (World
Bank 2015f). These programs and related operations are not covered in this review as its implementation
is too recent.
7According to the Implementation Completion and Results Reports ICRs), by the end of phase 3 of the
program, there were 857 microenterprises maintaining 16,867 km of roads in 143 provinces. The ICRs also
report the following number of jobs created: 32,300 seasonal unskilled jobs through roads rehabilitation
works and about 4,700 permanent jobs (phase 1); 10,000 one-year equivalent seasonal unskilled jobs and
5,500 one-year equivalent permanent unskilled jobs from road maintenance works (phase 2); and 3,250
additional one-year equivalent permanent unskilled jobs (phase 3). However, the 2013 impact evaluation
found mixed employment effects.
8The program has been associated with an increase in the age of marriage of women by 1.4 to 2.3 years
with some evidence suggesting that the age of marriage of men has also gone up (Hong and Sarr 2012).
9However, project and nonproject rural households did not differ substantially in their propensity to
undertake commercial activities.
10To facilitate and structure the review of country-level engagements, IEG selected four World Bank
Group strategic initiatives that were deemed transformational. All four were either initiated or strongly
supported by the Bank Group during the review period: transition countries from planned central
economies to market-based economies; (since 1990), poverty reduction strategy initiatives (PRS) (since
1998), fragile and conflict-affected states to graduate from fragility (since circa 2000) and long-term
engagements that helped low- and lower-middle-income countries graduate to middle- and high-income
status. See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion of the methodology.
11Although this approach, which is based mainly on economic and social transformations, does not deal
with political transformation explicitly, the quality of institutions and their improvements over time are
reflected/captured in some of the indicators that have been used in selecting countries and in preparing
country level reviews. These include: the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment scores, IEG
assessment of borrower performance, as well as governance- and institutional-related pillars in the
Country Assistance Strategies/Country Partnership Strategies. Recent World Bank research (for example,
Smets and Knack (2015) http://www-
wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/05/15/090224b082e8a940/1
_0/Rendered/PDF/World0Bank0pol0ic0sector0governance.pdf ) shows that the Bank’s policy lending for
improving public sector performance has a significant positive impact on the quality of public sector
governance in aid receiving countries. Going forward, this dimension is likely to become more prominent
and explicit in the context of the Post-2015 development agenda. For a list of the Sustainable
Development Goals, see:
https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/1579SDGs%20Proposal.pdf, and the
United Nation’s Secretary General’s Synthesis report which was adopted in September 2015:

12This is consistent with a study by Denizer, Kaufmann, and Kraay (2011) that finds that the quality of
the task team leader is positively and significantly correlated to IEG’s ratings of World Bank projects’
development outcome ratings.
13The World Development Report 2000/01: Attacking Poverty (World Bank 2000b) contributed to the
analytical foundation of the Bank Group’s strategy for development, recommending to address the needs
of poor people in three areas: (i) promoting economic opportunities for poor people through equitable
growth, better access to markets, and expanded assets; (ii) facilitating empowerment by making state
institutions more responsive to poor people and removing social barriers that exclude women, ethnic and
racial groups, and the socially disadvantaged; and (iii) enhancing security by preventing and managing
economy-wide shocks and providing mechanisms to reduce the sources of vulnerability that poor people
face. The report also formed the intellectual basis for the country-owned Poverty Reduction Strategy
Papers that were being initiated as the report was being written.

3. Mechanisms and Factors of Transformation
This chapter presents mechanisms of transformation and factors enabling or
constraining transformational impacts based on the comparative analysis of the sample
of project and program engagements, as well as the findings of the reviews of country-
level engagements. This chapter first synthesizes evidence related to mechanisms of
transformation based on the analysis of engagements presented in Chapter 2. It then
presents findings on factors enabling or constraining transformational engagements.

Mechanisms of Transformation
IEG identified four mechanisms of transformation, which can be present in
interventions either individually or in combination: (i) identifying and addressing
binding constraints; (ii) adopting systemic approaches that address constraints in
interrelated parts of the system through cross-sectoral approaches; (iii) scaling-up of
effective approaches and innovations (including technological, process, or Bank Group
instrument); and (iv) changing behaviors through modifying incentives. IEG finds that
these mechanisms can increase the likelihood of catalyzing transformational change in
favorable country environments, but that these mechanisms are not sufficient
conditions for transformation (Figure 3.1).

IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING BINDING CONSTRAINTS
IEG applied the concept of “binding constraints” to the project, program, and
country-level engagements it reviewed. Binding constraints in a country or system
refer to those constraints or distortions whose relaxation can generate the largest
welfare effects (Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco 2005)—that is, alleviating constraints
associated with the biggest “bang for the buck.” Applying this concept implies
uncovering the specific distortions behind the most severe of these constraints, and
pursuing reforms that focus on alleviating them.

In this report, IEG differentiates two distinct concepts. The first is “relevance of the
development challenge addressed,” an upstream assessment that was used to screen
transformational and comparator engagements to ensure a meaningful pair-wise
comparison (Figure 2.1). Second, in its in-depth review of engagements, IEG identified
whether interventions addressed a “binding constraint” underlying the development
challenge (Figure 3.2). To illustrate, although both Brazil’s Bolsa Familia and Turkey’s
CCT program aimed to address the same development challenges—the lack of access to
education and health services for segments of the population—only Bolsa Familia
systematically addressed the specific binding constraints relevant for Brazil: a lack of

information on services, opportunity cost, and necessary infrastructure. Only this
program had the right “fit” for the problem identified. Bolsa Familia was considered
transformational while the Turkey program was not.

A somewhat higher proportion of transformational engagements identified and
aimed to address binding constraints. The great majority of project- and program-level
transformational engagements and a significant percent of comparators in the sample of
project- and program-level interventions were designed to address such constraints
(Figure 3.2). Many engagements aimed to address binding constraints by focusing on
underlying issues that inhibit extending access to vital services such as electricity and
other infrastructure services. Electricity access is a critical enabler for poverty reduction,
facilitating access to education and health services, and fostering economic growth and
job creation.

Similarly, interventions in human development addressed binding constraints to equity
and poverty reduction by focusing on the lack of access to (and use of) education, health
care, and other basic social services. The underlying reasons for the lack of access
included lack of infrastructure, opportunity cost, and lack of information. Equity of
access to adequate basic services, such as health and education, helps level the playing
field and open doors to fuller participation in economic growth, for example, by

Transformational engagements were more likely to succeed in addressing a binding
constraint than their comparators. In assessing the results of the engagements ex post,
IEG used the concept of “addressing a root cause” as a proxy for the engagements’
ability to successfully address a binding constraint (Figure 2.2). IEG found that
transformational engagements in 60 percent of cases were successful in addressing a
binding constraint (or root cause), versus 35 percent of comparators.

In Kenya, the Bank Group focused on the need for power sector viability as a critical
component of sector development—pursuing a systems approach.1 Access to
electricity ranks among the top (World Bank 2007, 2013) four constraints faced by
enterprises in the country. The Bank’s series of analytical work identified the need to
address sector viability as one root cause of inadequate sector performance
characterized by below cost pricing, operational inefficiency, non-commercial sector
operation, and weak technical capacity and regulatory framework. Although efforts to
implement cost-recovery pricing for electricity gained traction only in 2004, its effects
on Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) were immediate. The utility began
generating net profits the same year. Electricity pricing policy was further strengthened
in 2008. The spillover effects of KPLC’s profitability on the electricity service supply
chain were profound, starting with its ability to make timely payments to Kenya

Generation Company, the government-owned generation company. The timely
payments minimized budgetary outlays to the generation company (IEG 2000, IEG
2004b, World Bank 2015g).

Profitability improved the viability of the utility and enhanced the readiness of KPLC
and KenGen for an initial public offering on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in 2010. KPLC
was operated as a commercial entity, with market discipline imposed by its listing.
Strengthening the viability of the utility enabled improvements in aspects of sector
performance such as private sector investment in electricity infrastructure, the number
of overall customers connected, the household electrification rate, and per capita
electricity consumption.

By contrast, Bank Group support to Pakistan during the period of review (1990-2010)
was characterized by short-term, ad hoc support reacting to power crises. Analytical
work and comprehensive sector reform lagged behind the implementation of
independent power producer programs, which had results in mounting government
debt. Thus, the assistance program did not systematically address binding constraints
related to sector viability.

More generally, in the electricity sector, severe power crises—representing most
binding constraints as opposed to chronic power shortages--made governments more
receptive to adopting and accepting World Bank-prescribed deep sector restructuring,
as in the case of Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda.2

Lack of knowledge or capacity was a binding constraint in several engagements. In
both forest management interventions reviewed by IEG, the Bank produced significant
knowledge work aimed at fostering a constituency for change towards more sustainable
forestry management practices. It succeeded in Brazil. In Indonesia, progress was
impeded by a secondary constraint, vested interests engaged in commercial use of
forestry resources. The lack of a constituency for support was at the root of lack of
traction in Indonesia.

Similarly, the private company Promigas Colombia lacked the knowledge that inclusive
business models could be profitable based on the good payment record of base of
pyramid customers. The GPOBA grant helped address this constraint. The lack of
systematic information was also at the core of the Doing Business indicators; although
investment climate issues had been identified as a main constraint for private sector-led
growth, the indicators enabled objective measurement, comparability of countries, and
allowed governments to formulate reforms. In Bank Group country-level engagements,
there was initially a knowledge gap about the depth of problems associated with the




36

transition from planned to market economies, which was closed over time through a
focus of learning from implementation and knowledge work.

The Kecamatan Development Program in Indonesia addressed a binding constraint to
alleviating rural poverty. One of the root causes of the poor coverage and quality of the
Indonesian government's antipoverty programs was that the projects were selected and
administered at the central government level, often ignoring the needs and wants of the
communities themselves. This project turned this system on its head, inventing a new
system whereby the design and implementation of subprojects was done at the village
level.

Country-level engagements also highlighted the importance of addressing critical
binding constraints related to growth and poverty reduction for an effective
development strategy. Removal of these constraints requires a highly committed and
skillful government and a proactive and technically strong World Bank Group that is
always ahead of the curve and combines deep local knowledge with relevant cross-
country knowledge and experience.

Each of the four strategic initiatives adopted by the Bank Group since the 1990s
reviewed by IEG aimed to address binding constraints specific to a group of countries.
These included stimulating private sector development in transition economies;
addressing poverty and social development issues in countries covered by poverty
reduction strategies; and strengthening institutional capacity to deliver basic services in
fragile and conflict affected states. In the case of long term country engagements
(mostly in MICs), binding constraints differed and evolved as countries developed. The
Bank’s strategies and support programs in successful transformers did focus on the
most binding constraints or main development challenges as identified by analytical
and advisory activities (AAA) and research.

Transformational countries were able to capitalize on AAA and managed to address
constraints through implementing reforms. The more successful transformers tackled
the most binding constraints first and in a more sustained and with greater political
commitment. They then moved on to tackle other critical constraints by undertaking
second- and third-generation reforms—institutional issues, labor markets, financial
markets, pension reforms, environmental issues —which are more complex and
difficult to deal with. Political economy factors stymied these reforms in many
countries; only the most persistent and committed governments were able to sustain
them (see Box 3.1).

 Box 3.1. The Bank Group’s Experience with Diagnosing and Helping Clients Address Binding
 Constraints in Country Programs – Evidence from Country Case Reviews
 To find out whether the World Bank Group’s approach actually helped its clients identify and
 remove the most binding constraints on their growth and poverty reduction, one would need
 to assess Bank Group performance in the context of each of the strategic initiatives.
 Transition to a Market Economy: The most common objectives of Bank Group assistance to
 these countries over two decades —achieving stabilization and growth, spurring private
 sector development, and creating social safety nets— were relevant and appeared in roughly
 half of the Country Assistance Strategies. However, the effectiveness of the early strategy was
 limited. In Poland, AAA covered the major binding constraints to growth and development,
 and the synergy between AAA and the lending program remained strong throughout this
 period. The Bank Group’s strategy in Romania evolved in the 2000s into more selective
 engagement in growth and job creation, private sector development (after some delay), public
 administration reform, and social inclusion, with a sharper focus on removing binding
 constraints such as bureaucratic management, soft budget constraints, difficulties for banks,
 and pervasive state ownership. Key binding constraints to faster growth in Bulgaria included
 fiscal problems, inadequate institutional capacity, and weak governance. The Bank Group
 addressed these in its strategies, but the effectiveness of its assistance has been hampered by
 the challenging political economy and the lack of government commitment to major reforms.
 Poverty Reduction Strategy: The key objective of the initiative has been to assist low-income
 countries develop and implement more effective strategies to fight poverty (that is,
 strengthening the poverty impact of public actions, including policies and spending) by
 supporting and sustaining a country-driven PRS process. Vietnam’s spectacular success in
 achieving rapid and inclusive growth and substantial poverty reduction in the 1990s and the
 2000s demonstrates that once the most binding constraints to growth and poverty reduction
 have been identified and removed, a very poor country can lift itself out of extreme poverty
 within only two decades. Longer-term growth remains subdued by second- and third-
 generation policy challenges in state-owned enterprises and the banking sector, policy
 distortions, and gaps in infrastructure and trade logistic services.
 Serious political economy and governance issues held back the pace of policy reform in
 Nigeria, where power and other infrastructure bottlenecks are major binding constraints to
 nonoil growth and poverty reduction. The Bank Group produced strong economic and sector
 work, but its efforts did not have impact. Overall, assistance did not achieve its objectives in
 important infrastructure subsectors such as roads, rail, and energy, which were identified as
 critical for inclusive growth and poverty reduction.
 Long-Term Strategic Interventions: Many MICs continue to face development challenges such
 as substantial levels of extreme poverty. They may also be getting stuck in the so-called “MIC
 trap,” where progress in their economic, social, and structural transformation reaches a
 plateau unless they undertake deeper set of “second-generation” reforms. The World Bank
 Group effectively helped the government of Peru implement a range of reforms to improve
 public expenditure efficiency, some rural infrastructure (especially rural roads), and
 environmental frameworks and regulations, as well as increased access to water, sanitation
 and electricity -- some of the key areas where binding constraints existed.

MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

 The economic and social transformation of the Philippines remains incomplete, in part as a
 result of poor governance and reduced fiscal space, and the country’s stop-go growth cycles,
 which need to be broken by focusing on consolidating past gains, attracting private
 investment, and addressing infrastructure supply constraints. In addition, more work needs
 to be done to understand labor income sources and dynamics, including farm productivity
 and incomes, as well as trends in non-income dimensions of poverty.

 reviewed by IEG.



In successfully transforming countries, governments and the Bank Group had a clear
understanding of the most binding constraints to each country’s growth and
development, based on careful economic and sector work or Bank Group research and
policy analysis (China, Mozambique, Peru, Poland, Rwanda, and Vietnam). In
transition economies, the Bank Group—through good quality AAA products--helped
countries identify the binding constraints in their transition to market-based, private-
sector led economies, including stabilizing the economy while taking key steps in
moving to a market economy. For the PRS countries, the Bank Group helped focus the
attention of policy makers and direct financial and technical assistance to the
measurement and analysis of key social indicators and poverty efforts.

The World Bank had real impact on building the reform momentum in China, for
instance, by providing the first in depth analysis of China’s development problems, as
well as studies of key sectors. Consistent government commitment and effective
management of the reform agenda were key factors underpinning positive Bank Group
contributions over the review period in Peru and Rwanda.

In addition, Bank Group support in transformational country engagements was based
on well-articulated and broad-based strategies that focused on removing the most
binding constraints to growth, poverty reduction, and social progress as they evolve
over time (China, Peru, Poland, and Vietnam). As countries evolved from low to
middle-income (and in some cases, high-income) status, the type of assistance evolved
consistent with their development stage. The nature of the Bank Group’s activities in
China changed significantly to meet the country’s rapidly evolving needs—focusing its
more recent assistance on areas such as education, health, transport and infrastructure,
and the environment, which have emerged as new challenges and constraints.

In the transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Bank Group
interventions evolved from early support to market reforms to focus more on changes
in social policies, poverty, public finance, and institutional reform, and to helping
countries in areas that were requirements for European Union accession. During the
long-term engagement with the Republic of Korea, the Bank’s work evolved to match


                                                                                                                        39

                                                         MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

the country’s changing needs—as the country developed from one of the poorest in the
world to manufacturing powerhouse—requiring more focus on skilled labor, research
and development, and social equity.

However, some evidence suggests that World Bank Group may not have
systematically focused its support on addressing the most binding constraints during
the review period. Although the relevance of Bank Group strategies was typically high
early in country engagements, particularly in fast transformers (such as in transition
countries, fragile and conflict-affected countries, and some PRS and long-term country
engagements), the focus on binding constraints and selectivity waned as the programs
matured. As the countries developed, the Bank Group support tended to become less
focused. In some cases, both the client and the Bank placed too much emphasis on
lending volumes while spreading resources among numerous projects covering (too)
many areas and sectors. With respect to the “lending culture”, a significant percentage
of staff (26 percent of all respondents and 40 percent of task team leaders) disagreed
that World Bank Group prioritizes development results over the number of volume of
transactions (World Bank 2015a, 18). Ravallion (2016) notes that “while the new Global
Practices are a promising step, all indications are that the lending culture thrives today,
and still with generally weak accountability to the Bank’s overall goals.” This may
indicate internal incentives within the Bank Group during the review period that were
not well aligned with a rigorous focus on addressing the most binding constraints to
country’s development.

Recent IEG sector and thematic evaluations also point to shortcomings in strategic
focus and selectivity to help address binding constraints, in part because of a lack of
adequate diagnostics and a lack of a holistic approach. A key conclusion of a recent
IEG evaluation (World Bank 2013a) was that although Bank strategies have been highly
relevant in the immediate aftermath of conflict and the early stages of post-conflict
reconstruction, they have generally not been designed well for medium- and long-term
development because they lack adequate strategic underpinning and focus. In many
cases, necessary economic and sector work to underpin Bank operations was not
undertaken. In addition, in several cases, the country strategies did not give sufficient
priority to the drivers and implications of conflict.

The relevance and effectiveness of country strategies was also undermined by a lack of
selectivity—as evidenced by a rush to do projects in every sector, often without the
relevant AAA, and insufficient consideration of limited state capacity, and a need for
strategic sequencing. For example, support to inclusive growth and jobs in fragile and
conflict-affected states has been constrained by the lack of a clearly prioritized and
sequenced support for a focused medium- to long-term strategy, and many such



40
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

countries lacked adequate analysis of the conflict and fragility drivers and of binding
constraints and opportunities for the private sector.

IEG’s evaluation of support to small and medium-sized enterprises (World Bank 2014a)
concluded that much of the support of the Bank Group institutions lacked a clear
understanding of how its assistance would remove the main constraints to these
enterprises and their ability to contribute to employment and growth. The Bank
Group’s support mainly addressed the financing needs of small and medium-size
enterprises, even though other constraints they faced may have been more important in
several country contexts. The evaluation concluded that greater selectivity would be
needed to enhance targeting and efficiency of support.

The major societal issues related to extreme poverty and shared prosperity are
complex, involving multiple interdependent facets. Identifying and diagnosing major
societal issues thus requires adopting and applying a systems approach to development
challenges. A systems approach views development challenges in a network of causes
and effects, looks at direct and indirect links, and combines an in depth analysis of the
issue with positioning the issue at hand in the broader context.

IEG evaluations emphasize the importance of holistic approaches—a closely related
concept--in addressing complex challenges related to issues such as early child
development, nutrition, and government effectiveness in service delivery (World Bank
2015f, IEG 2009, 2008b). However, holistic approaches should not be understood as
advocating for complexity in program or project design, but should rather provide a
framework for selectivity and prioritizing.

Identifying binding constraints is not an easy task, given the complexity and
interdependence of development challenges. But it is an area in which the Bank Group
can provide valuable service to its clients, leveraging in the process its knowledge and
technocratic independence. IEG evaluations reveal several challenges for the Bank
Group’s ability to identify and diagnose binding constraints.3 At the project and country
levels, linear and overly simplistic result chains and weak results frameworks have
been inimical to identifying binding constraints (World Bank 2015c). More complex and
realistic causality chains that take the local context into account need to be developed.

More important, however, are incentive and organizational issues that inhibit the
World Bank Group’s ability to identify, diagnose and address binding constraints.
For instance, incentives can support doing the easy things first, whereas “the
challenges of the sector require that the most pressing of them need to be addressed
first, even if the tasks involved are difficult” (IEG 2011e). The interplay of incentives
between sector and country teams, tends to result in low selectivity in country



                                                                                            41

strategies. The fact that sector strategies tend to be prepared independently from each
other results in “silo-ized” strategies. Aligning country strategies with sector strategies
is further complicated by the fact that individual sector strategies can sometimes act as
lobbying documents for devoting more resources to that sector. Thus, the aggregation
of these sector strategies does not provide good guidance for defining Bank priorities
(IEG 2011b), resulting in overall weak selectivity in Bank country strategies.

The Bank Group strategy and organizational change process seek to address some of
the issues related to identifying binding constraints at the country level. In particular,
the newly instituted Systematic Country Diagnostics tool aims to identify the main
policies and institutional reforms that could contribute most to the achievement of the
common goals, irrespective of whether the Bank Group will address them.
Prioritization of main policies and institutional reforms in the diagnostics is expected to
set the basis for an effective approach to selectivity at the level of country strategies
(World Bank 2015c), but this would need to be complemented by analyses of the most
binding constraints at the level of sectors and interventions.

ADDRESSING MULTIPLE CONSTRAINTS THROUGH CROSS-SECTORAL INTERVENTIONS
Many complex development challenges are multidimensional and require cross-
sectoral linkages. The relative low incidence of such engagements (identified in 30
percent of the transformational engagements in the sample) may be explained by IEG
findings that more complex projects tend to be less effective: they require more
coordination, more counterparts, involvement of individual specialists, and more
relationships. Given that the initial identification of transformational engagements for
this Learning Product was done ex post, this finding may not be all that surprising.

However, several engagements highlighted the importance and potential of
addressing multiple constraints through series of sequenced interventions. The
Mongolia Renewable Energy for Rural Access Project was linked to a coterminous Bank-
supported energy project, rural education project, sustainable livelihood project and
rural information and communication technology project; together these brought about
a dramatic transformation of the herders’ lives, greatly improving their living standards
and integrating their nomadic way of life into a modern, growing economy. This
combination of parallel interventions in several sectors was a rural development best
practice (IEG 2015).

Brazil’s Bolsa Familia took a comprehensive systems approach to social safety net reform
by addressing the lack of access to services in several sectors. In addition to aiming to
increase secondary school enrolment and attainment of girls, the Female Secondary School
Stipend Program in Bangladesh targeted several socio economic outcomes such as
delaying girls’ marriage, improving earnings and employment, and empowerment


42
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

through different program components. Lighting Africa Kenya also pursued a
comprehensive approach in that it involved activities along the entire supply chain of
solar home systems to address constraints related to the affordability of basic off grid
power supply for the very poor.

Most of the major development challenges—from road safety to malnutrition, jobs,
climate change, crisis management, and social protection—are inherently cross
sectoral. This is because interdependence and synergies exist between various sectoral
objectives that require instruments from different sectors in order for these synergies to
be realized. IEG evaluations have repeatedly brought out this message. Many Bank
Group engagements, even when apparently focused on one sector, were dependent on
a more integrated, multisector approach in order to succeed.

When the Bank Group succeeds in bringing multisectoral instruments and expertise
together in a client-focused solution, it contributes to the long-term transformation of
complex, integrated structures. For instance, the IEG evaluation on water and
development (IEG 2010) provides numerous examples of Bank experience showing not
only that the multisectoral approach is doable, but that its results are more lasting and
significant for more people than those of separate projects with shorter timelines. Too
often, however, the Bank Group has not been able to deliver on the promise of
multisectoral approaches. The 2009 Annual Review on Development Effectiveness (IEG
2010) finds that complex projects— such as multisectoral investment lending and sector
wide approaches— in low-capacity countries have been strongly associated with worse
results than less complex work.

IEG’s analysis of the experience with multisectoral approaches reveals common
problems: overly ambitious goals, too much emphasis on data collection at the expense
of implementation, imposition of new administrative structures, political naïveté about
the scope for genuine consensus, poor quality dialogue between donors and recipients,
and a lack of linkage between planning and implementation. Key challenges to cross-
sectoral work include lack of knowledge about the impacts of related sectors, structural
issues (such as institutional and sectoral administrative structures), staff time, budgets,
related (dis)incentives and accountabilities, and the political economy of cross-sectoral
work (World Bank 2013d). Similar if not more severe issues manifest themselves on the
borrower’s side in the public sectors of Bank Group borrowing countries. Although
PRSPs have helped policy makers link sector strategies with poverty reduction,
progress has depended on the capacity of the country’s public sector, partner
relationships with the government, and relations among donors (IEG 2004).

This analysis concludes that impediments to multisectoral approaches could be
addressed by starting small, building in a bias to action, avoiding complex new

bureaucracies, training staff in multidisciplinary work, and creating incentives for cross-
sectoral work, for instance, through results agreements for Bank Group task team
leaders and managers that reward cross-sectoral work and earmarked resources for
cross-sectoral products/operations. The key is to strike the right balance between
fostering a strategic understanding of key constraints in a sector or for a development
issue, and then pursue reforms through sequenced and focused interventions, which
limits complexity in project design and implementation. At the same this calls for taking
on the key issues, incentives, and capabilities impeding cross sectoral work between
and within institutions.

INNOVATIONS AND SCALING UP OF SOLUTIONS
Innovations and technological change provide a third mechanism of transformation.
The trajectory of development can be changed by introducing or adapting a technology
(physical, institutional or procedural) – fundamentally pushing out the production
possibility frontier. Introducing an innovation that makes the economy or a sector of the
economy fundamentally more productive represents the kind of discontinuous change
referred to by the term “transformational.” The mobile telephony “revolution” that has
enabled, in some contexts, leapfrogging of developing countries in adopting
technologies that can enable services (see M-Pesa) is a good example. Adoption of new
technologies can increase firm-level productivity, which helps accelerate economic
growth (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000; Stiroh 2002; Brynjolfsson 2007), but this may also
lead to reduced employment. Technological change can also increase the efficiency of
government functions and the delivery of services to citizens, such as in health and
education.

In transformational engagements, innovations--comprising technological
innovations, new approaches, (financing) instruments, and business models—helped
scale up the coverage of service delivery to the poor and/or the underserved within a
country or region. Projects and programs achieved this mainly by overcoming
constraints to the reach of interventions, enabling more efficient, better targeted and
cheaper service delivery, and by demonstrating the commercial viability of business
models. Most of the transformational engagements reviewed involved some innovative
aspects that contributed both to the success of the project and to external impacts
beyond the project itself.

Many transformational engagements that achieved substantial scaling up did so
through innovative approaches or products. Successful programs often evolved from
piloting approaches, building capacity, and sequenced reforms, which helped build
momentum and allowed the program to reach scale (Figure 3.3.).

Scaling up and replication occurred because the innovation addressed an
information-related market failure (such as in the case of credit bureaus), lowered the
cost of the delivery of a product or service including in remote areas (for example,
catastrophe risk insurance, weather index insurance, CCTs, and provision of
preventative health services, solar home systems), provided a new benchmarking tool
to motivate policy reform (Doing Business indicators) (see Box 3.2.) or demonstrated the
viability of business models (such as the expansion of access to services to poor in a
financially sustainable way). Projects produced demonstration effects, and learned from
implementation as they scaled up and adapted to local context.

Innovative Bank Group Instruments

Innovative Bank Group instruments helped catalyze systems as well as market and
behavior changes. These included innovative approaches such as results-based
financing, output-based aid, CCTs, innovations for risk mitigation, and—among
country-level transformations—the PRS initiative. Innovative financing mechanisms
such as results-based financing and CCTs affected behavior change to support
improved health and education outcomes.

Programs targeting access to social services involved the successful scaling up of
innovative approaches and instruments. Innovative instruments helped extend access
to social services to millions of poor people. The Bank supported innovative solutions to

address entrenched issues of inequitable service delivery such as introducing the first
stipend program for girls’ secondary education (Female Secondary School Stipend Program
in Bangladesh), taking a programmatic approach to health system reform through
results-based health financing reforms (Plan Nacer Argentina), or improving the breadth
and efficiency of government social protection services (Bolsa Familia in Brazil). These
programs involved new financing mechanisms and scaling up to larger groups of
beneficiaries, building on the experiences gained in early implementation.

Other projects incorporated innovative components targeting the poor or aiming to
ensure impact beyond the project, such as the Peru rural roads program, involving
support for local communities for maintenance of the infrastructure, and to
microenterprises, which contributed to their transformational impact.

Continuously exploring creative and innovative ways to expand product lines and
tools to address challenges and risks to meet the evolving demands of client
countries is key to transformation. In transformational country programs (Chile,
China, Korea, and Poland) the Bank Group’s work was proactive and identified
emerging issues and changing needs of the clients and adjusted its strategy accordingly.


 Box 3.2. World Bank Group Helps Launch and Scale Up Innovative Solutions and Products
 Doing Business, the global indicator program, is an example of an innovative benchmarking
 product with global reach. It catalyzed dialogue on investment climate issues in developing
 countries and motivated policy makers to undertake reforms by focusing their attention on
 these issues, and enabling transparency, accessibility of data, and cross-country
 comparisons—motivating a series policy reforms in many countries over the past 15 years.
 Although Enterprise Surveys and ICAs, the comparator engagements, also have been used to
 promote dialogue with governments on investment climate constraints, the Doing Business
 information is more specific and actionable.

Scaling Up Innovations

Strengthening innovation capacity is an important factor in countries that have
experienced rapid and sustained growth. IEG’s work identifies five principles that can
be useful in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship: (i) public investment in
research and development; (ii) build domestic science, technology and innovation
capabilities; (iii) strengthen linkages between public research and development and
private sector users of technology; (iv) build a strong enabling environment including
an effective use of information and communication technologies; and (v) provide
flexible financing arrangement to encourage innovative firms to take risks to develop


46

MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

new products, processes and services. While innovation is inherently risky, Bank Group
projects supporting innovation and entrepreneurship performed as well as other
projects; for IFC, this was true on a portfolio basis. Across the Bank Group, projects
were more likely to perform well where the Bank Group has operational experience: the
Bank in support to research and development; while IFC and MIGA projects
contributed to technology transfer and dissemination, upgrading of processes, and
introduction of new products and services (World Bank 2013h).

The Bank Group’s role is not necessarily that of an innovator, but it can help scale up
technologies that have the potential to be transformational. Many technological,
product, or process innovations and business models are developed by the private
sector, often in conjunction with some seed funding from a donor, such as the delivery
model for M-Pesa in Kenya. However, the Bank Group can help scale up technological
innovations by systematically considering their potential in its engagements. Lighting
Africa Kenya illustrates the role of the Bank Group in piloting and gradually scaling up
an approach and business model—based on a technological innovation--that helped
create a market (see Box 3.3). And the availability of a technology platform (mobile
telephony) underpinned the business model of weather index insurance in Kenya by
enabling the provider to lower the cost of the product, bundle it with other types of
coverage, and reach customers through mobile phones. However, the World Bank’s
record in effectively using information and communications technology applications in
projects for better service delivery to the poor or enhanced governance has been mixed;
evaluative evidence suggests that the Bank lacked sufficient expertise in this area (IEG
2011a).

IFC can contribute to transferring and adapting innovations in technology, finance,
and institutions, developing a portfolio of high-return options that can be scaled up
and more widely deployed. Innovation involves higher than normal risks and higher
than normal gaps between social and private risk-return ratios. Technology projects that
succeeded in transforming existing industries or launch new ones on a sustainable
growth path shared several key characteristics: First, they creatively used different
instruments to align social and private risks and returns (IEG 2010b). Second, successful
transformational engagements had a clear logical framework linking technology
adoption with demonstration and diffusion and integrating mechanisms for
demonstration and diffusion in project design. Conversely, technology transfer has
foundered in the absence of project design based on logical framework that links
interventions to technological diffusion, especially in the case of advanced technologies.

In general, projects that rely on demonstration effects for scaling up work best when it
is clear what is being demonstrated, how, and to whom. It is essential for these projects

to have good plans for monitoring their direct results. It has been a challenge to design
projects effectively for learning and diffusion (IEG 2010b).


 Box 3.3. Providing Affordable Lighting for the Poor by Scaling Up a Market-Based Approach
 The World Bank and IFC piloted and scaled up Lighting Africa, an innovative program to
 address the lighting needs of a large segment of the population not served by the power grid.
 The program has been expanded successfully from its pilot phase within Kenya and
 replicated in other countries in Africa and Asia. Earlier efforts to provide solar lamps to poor
 families funded by donor grants and distributed free have had limited uptake.
 The program design incorporated the entire supply chain and was informed by experience. IFC and
 the Bank initiated Lighting Africa in 2007 to accelerate the development of a sustainable
 commercial market for quality, clean, and safe solar lighting products that are affordable to
 very-low-income households and small businesses. The collaborative effort was based on
 each institution’s core competencies and has benefitted from frequent, regular
 communication between the two teams.
 The project design incorporated lessons from earlier IFC and donor grant-based solar lighting
 projects. Hence, the program focused on a market-based, commercially viable approach and
 aimed to address every aspect of the supply chain, including market intelligence, business
 development support to manufacturers and distributors, development of international
 quality standards in product design, product quality testing and certification, consumer
 education and financing, and training of women technicians. The program was designed as
 an experiment and given the flexibility to test market response, although the program
 designers determined at the outset not to subsidize solar lamps for end-users or consumers.
 By design, replication and roll-out of Lighting Africa to other Sub-Saharan African countries
 was gradual. The Kenya pilot met its objectives of increasing the availability of quality and
 affordable solar lanterns in the market; distribution channels were enhanced; and the number
 of Lighting Africa-certified products sold exceeded targets by 2.5 times (686,000 units sold as
 of 2014), which suggests the commercial viability of the product. The project facilitated
 development of off-grid lighting market in Kenya. The pilot programs provided valuable
 lessons (including from the negative results in Ghana) that were used to adapt design and
 implementation of the program in several other countries.

Interventions can have broader effects if they have demonstration effects that induce
other public and private agents to participate. Scaling up is particularly pertinent for
pilot interventions that seek higher impact through replication. Multiple examples show
even successful pilots may fail in having higher impact when scaling up mechanisms
have not been sorted out (World Bank 2015c).

A substantial number of innovative development projects are begun without evidence
that the anticipated benefits will be of the magnitude anticipated. Faced with this


48
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

uncertainty, a prudent approach would be to implement some projects on a modest
scale for a few years, test the benefits rigorously, and scale up the project if the benefits
prove worth the costs. This is one way to reduce the risk of large expenditures on
unsatisfactory projects.

However, it is rare for Bank-financed projects to be pilots in this sense. The term is
used loosely. Projects that claim to be pilots rarely contain midterm testing or
enumerate objective criteria that will trigger scaling up (or they do not have a scaling-
up plan within the life of the project), and they often do not collect baseline data. The
pilot projects need rigorous evaluations to inform future projects, but this rarely
happens. Lessons from experience in health, nutrition, and population suggest that for a
meaningful valuation to be completed, the evaluation must be planned in detail while
the project is being designed. When impact evaluations are undertaken, they usually
did not discuss or hypothesize the validity of their findings to scaling up and varying
contexts. Only 10 of 87 World Bank impact evaluations contained evidence that these
evaluation have contributed to decisions to scale up or continue or to inform policy
and/or project design (IEG 2012).

Then why are pilots not pursued more frequently? One possible answer is that they
are inherently riskier than run-of-the mill projects. . In addition, “faced with pressure to
meet short-term goals (lending and disbursement targets), Bank employees may feel
that they do not have the time to search widely for knowledge or to experiment with
new ideas and approaches” (World Bank 2015a). Staff also need support on how
country programs could contribute to improving practices in a country, support
innovation, or scale-up operations using non-Bank Group resources (World Bank
2015d).

CHANGING BEHAVIORS THROUGH INCENTIVES
Changing the behaviors of individuals, players, and entire systems is a powerful
mechanism to attain deep change. Behavioral change may be achieved through
monetary incentives to reward the desired behavior, through education campaigns, by
introducing market forces, or by increasing transparency and information about
program benefits—which can increase accountability and reduce the potential for
corruption. These approaches can be mutually reinforcing. IEG identified this
mechanism in transformational engagements across the sample, including in human
development, inclusive and commercially viable business models, global standards,
and approaches targeting sector viability.

Changing incentives (or conditionalities) with the objective of modifying behaviors
of beneficiaries and providers to support uptake of services has the potential for
long-term transformative impact. In all the human development interventions in the


                                                                                            49
                                                                                        CHAPTER 3
                                                         MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

sample, transformational and comparator alike, the primary means by which outcomes
were to be achieved was through innovative incentive schemes to change the behavior
and providers and/or users of services. In some cases, cash incentives were used to
reduce the barriers to service use—through direct payments to beneficiaries—or results-
based financing. In the transformational engagements, cash payments were reinforced
with information campaigns to raise awareness among beneficiaries about their
responsibilities. These approaches have been effective in changing behaviors and are
associated with enhancing human development outcomes.

Frequently, the comparator cases used the same service delivery and incentives
mechanisms but failed to consider specific aspects of country context or other barriers to
service delivery take-up. Turkey’s social safety net program deployed only cash
incentives, reducing its effectiveness. Comparator engagements generally had
shortcomings in design and implementation—informational or cultural barriers to
service utilization.

Ensuring that beneficiaries are aware of their responsibilities is a critical element in
CCTs to achieve intended changes in behavior and support desired outcomes. The
successful use of incentive frameworks requires clear and transparent rules to support
the distribution of benefits and application of sanctions, which was the case in Brazil’s
Bolsa Familia and Argentina’s Plan Nacer, and to a lesser extent, the Female Secondary
Stipend Program in Bangladesh. The Nigeria State Education projects and Turkey CTT
program fell short in this respect.

Argentina’s Plan Nacer had strong and comprehensive incentives for beneficiaries,
providers, and governments. As the country recognized the central role of the
provinces in providing health services, federal funding to the provinces was increased
based on the number of individuals enrolled. Additional funding was contingent on
attaining health outcome targets. Linking funding to outcomes increased competition
among services providers looking to contract health service delivery. Providers thus
had an incentive to increase the number of services provided to plan members and to
increase the number of individuals enrolled in Plan Nacer. Patients also benefitted from
increased competition among service providers through improved quality of services,
and from a cash subsidy for enrollment in Plan Nacer. Coverage increased rapidly. This
is in marked contrast to the comparator project, the Brazil Federal District Multisectoral
Project, which designed a weak incentive structure (disbursement-linked indicators)
that was ultimately not introduced.

Brazil’s Bolsa Familia ensured that program beneficiaries understood the
expectations for changes in behavior. Bolsa Familia cash transfers were conditioned on
all age-relevant family members complying with identified changes in behavior. The


50
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

conditions under which cash transfers were to be made were widely publicized in
Brazil, and given to each beneficiary family in a booklet. By contrast, the Turkey Social
Risk Mitigation project was only partially successful in publicizing the Social Solidarity
Fund Program. As a result, some eligible beneficiaries were unaware of available
support or of the health facility use condition. An impact evaluation (IFPRI and AGRIN
Co. Ltd. 2007) found that 90 percent of education beneficiaries and 87 percent of health
beneficiaries did not know the conditions they needed to meet to maintain their
eligibility.

In El Salvador, decentralized provision of education services increased a sense of
ownership by empowering the local community with new roles and responsibilities in
school management, changing the accountability route from the central government to
the community level. Parents were more active in their children’s education, for
example, monitoring teacher attendance, which subsequently improved.

Engagements supporting market-based approaches enhanced the sustainability of
business models to extend services to the underserved, or to implement more
sustainable business practices. The private companies participating in the BACP
initiative coalesced around the objective of voluntary global standards to address
concerns about negative externalities related to their operations. In the case of Promigas
Colombia, as well as for BACP, market forces and the buy-in from private entities was
critical to maintain momentum and sustain the transformations. Private sector buy-in
was also an important feature to ensure viability and sustainability of impacts in the
CCRIF, which helped introduce and subsequently expand the catastrophe risk
insurance market. Capitalizing on market-based solutions and a focus on the supply
chain enhanced the chances for sustaining Lighting Africa Kenya, which was among the
first commercially viable solar home systems, providing solar lamps to off-grid
households.

Interventions related to enhancing access to basic infrastructure services primarily
targeted behavioral change through systems and market changes. In the power sector,
systems and market changes were achieved in the transformational cases by
contributing to sector viability—changing incentives in the system--including a sound
regulatory framework, financially sound utility companies, and sustained increases in
access to electricity services. Sector structures varied among countries, but systemic and
market changes following sector restructuring was more evident in Kenya, Uganda, and
the Philippines. By contrast, in the comparator cases, comparable efforts during the
period of review did not result in the depth of change in ensuring sector viability. This
was because of frequent political changes, weak institutional and human capacity, and
the small size of Bank Group sector support relative to country needs.

The Indonesia KDP program paid careful attention to incentives. The village
facilitators were answerable to the communities, so they had an incentive to ensure that
the sub-projects were delivered on time and were of high quality. Similarly, local
nongovernment organizations and the media were used to spreading information about
the performance of subprojects, changing incentives to help avoid corruption.


Enabling Conditions for Transformational Engagements
MOTIVATION TO CHANGE
Transformational engagements tended to be motivated by a sense of urgency on the
part of the client of a need for change. Crisis situations, important political changes,
and increased awareness can create windows of opportunity; such situations revealed
preferences for the Bank Group and other donors to help clients pursue needed reforms.
Crisis situations revealed binding constraints to development while providing
development partners unique opportunities to help address them. Changes in
government or in political systems in some cases enabled engagements to tackle long-
standing issues. In other cases, global concerns raised awareness of negative impacts.

Several interventions in human development were responses to economic and
political crises, which revealed preferences of the population (such as strong demand
for health and education services). Plan Nacer in Argentina was motivated in part by the
deterioration of health outcomes among the poor and most vulnerable in the aftermath
of the country’s 2000–01 financial crisis. It also reflected increasing awareness of the
importance of providing guaranteed access to basic services for the most vulnerable.
Community-run schools emerged in El Salvador during the civil war, revealing a strong
inherent demand for education where no opportunities for government-provided
education existed. In 1991 the World Bank supported the expansion of the prototype
Community-Managed Schools Program (Educo El Salvador), which communities
themselves had developed.

A political transition from one party to another created “windows of opportunity.”
Bolsa Familia was supported by the new Brazilian government that came to office in
2002, which provided an opening for an alternative approach to address poverty and
exclusion.

The CCRIF project was motivated by an awareness in Caribbean countries of the
frequency of adverse natural events and, because of the small size of their economies,
the difficulty of financing recovery out of budgetary resources or reserves. Moreover,
the possibilities for risk transfer through international insurance and reinsurance
markets were limited. For these reasons, the governments of the Caribbean Community



52
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

saw an urgent need for a new disaster response financing instrument. In addition, the
devastation of Hurricane Ivan in 2007 was an immediate motivator. Although the
government of Guatemala was also interested in securing untied financing for disaster
relief and reconstruction, it was apparently less motivated to address the other policy
and institutional constraints to disaster relief.

In India, once the Andhra Pradesh microfinance crisis occurred in 2010, the Omidyar
India Microfinance Credit Reporting project catalyzed quick action on multiple fronts.
Over-indebtedness and high levels of non-performing loans in portfolios of
microfinance institutions created a sense of growing urgency, even before the onset of
the crisis. The fact that this critical need was widely recognized, and that IFC and the
World Bank were already engaged with key players and had done preparatory work,
created the right environment and made a quick response possible once conditions
became propitious.

The Doing Business program appears to have been successful in part because it
developed an approach that catalyzed demand from countries for investment climate
reform advice, reflecting a recognition of the need to address issues of the business
environment to improve competitiveness and growth. Doing Business used media and
public interest to catalyze action (fostering a sense of competition among governments
and raising awareness on the part of the private sector). Because of the globalization of
markets, the transition to market economies in the former Soviet Union, and the desire
of many Eastern European countries to join the European Union, many countries were
aware of the need to make it easier for the private sector to operate. Doing Business took
advantage of this window of opportunity derived from countries’ motivation to become
globally competitive, leading to demand for benchmarking information and
comparisons.

CLIENT ENGAGEMENT
Client ownership and political support are critical elements of transformations.
Transformational impacts are achieved by willing and able clients, with the Bank Group
and others providing knowledge and financial resources. Political consensus around a
vision or direction for a country and support from broader coalitions helped maintain
the momentum behind difficult reforms. Transformational engagements were typically
associated with alignment of the transformational goal with the interest or incentives of
a committed client counterpart, or champion.

Political economy factors strongly enabled transformational impact. These factors
were important determinants of successful transformational engagements in the power
sector, forestry sector, education, and health sectors. As transformational engagements
target deep and large-scale change, they tend to affect vested interests in a more


                                                                                           53
                                                                                           CHAPTER 3

significant way. Therefore, working to alignment of interests with the desired
transformational change becomes more important.

Embedding sector development within broader economic development objectives
provides sector policy coherence and a basis for consensus. This can strengthen
ownership, continuity, and impact – such as in the power sector reform in Kenya. In
Argentina, disbursements of policy-based lending under Plan Nacer were conditional on
meeting specific requirements. This helped increase the government’s attention to
politically difficult reforms in the health sector.

Relative political stability helps build political consensus and buy-in around a vision
or direction for the country and ensures policy continuity. Several successful
engagements built political consensus and engaged broader coalitions of different
actors and stakeholders, including the private sector and consumers. Some took
advantage or worked already committed clients. Changes in political leadership can be
overcome if other high-level stakeholders provide continuity.

In the power sector, reforms had stronger support in countries with relatively stable
political systems, such as in Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda. Aside from policy
consistency, relative political stability also allows the development of local sector
technocrats and experts who can continue and advance the sector dialog and agenda
despite changes in government leadership.

This technical expertise also strengthens the government’s ability to coordinate the
activities of the various development partners. In contrast, frequent changes in political
leadership and winner-take-all political systems in Nigeria and Pakistan resulted in
policy discontinuity, renegotiation, delays, and, more importantly, weakened technical
capacity. As a result, sector policy dialogue and commitment during the period of
review has been intermittent or absent. The client countries in CCRIF were members of
the Caribbean Community, which provided a forum for them to reach consensus on the
need for catastrophe risk insurance.

Most successful transformational engagements had strong alignment between the
interests of the client and the objectives of the transformational engagements. For
example, in the case of bus rapid urban transit, the role of a strong champion was
critical to help overcome resistance to change from entrenched interests, such as
traditional bus operators with inferior safety and environmental records.

The implementation of the PPG-7 forestry sector program in Brazil coincided with a
period of major environment-related policy and institutional reforms at all levels. The
relative success of the transformation of Brazil’s forest sector is at least partly a result of
the degree of education and political openness in Brazil, which allowed the emergence

of strong political support for a more sustainable development of forests—partly
informed and strengthened by the World Bank-administered PPG-7 program—from
environmentalists, forest dwellers (rubber tappers, or extrativistas and indigenous
peoples) and the more responsible business groups.

This is in contrast to Indonesia, where the dominance of the Ministry of Forests by
entrenched interests (pulp and paper, palm oil) limited the impact of the policy reforms.
Although in the early 2000s political changes in Indonesia brought about a
repositioning in attitudes and roles among government, business, and civil society that
opened up new opportunities for meaningful engagement, these efforts have not yet
succeeded in reversing the alarming acceleration of Indonesia’s deforestation trends.
The main constraints have been related to the political economy (as of late 2011),
specifically the limited interest of the Ministry of Forestry, which has the mandate to
manage the forest estate, and where the influence and importance of the production
objective (and the attendant vested interests) was far greater than that of the
conservation objective.

Understanding the local political economy and affected communities was a key
differentiating factor between the Nicaraguan and Panamanian land reform projects.
The manner through which the World Bank engaged the affected communities, and its
understanding and response to the local political economy, influenced the uptake and
potential for transformation. These aspects included inter- and intragroup dynamics,
incentives, and behaviors. Recognizing indigenous peoples’ land rights in Nicaragua
required a unique, innovative approach, taking into account traditional decision-
making and consultation structures, collective tenure arrangements, and communal use
of natural resources, as well as the culture and worldview of indigenous peoples. In
Panama, the project lacked a (project-specific) Indigenous Peoples Development Plan,
relying on a general regional analysis of indigenous peoples issues. It did not include an
analysis of relationships and roles within the indigenous peoples groups with which the
Bank was working.

At the country level, engagements between the country’s authorities and the World
Bank Group at the highest levels, underpinned by strong and sustained political
commitment on both sides (China, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, and Vietnam). The
positive contributions of Bank Group support in Peru reflected, among other things, its
long-standing policy dialogue, maintenance of its reputation as a high-quality service
provider, important intellectual contributions, and consistent dialogue with civil
society. Peru seems to have valued the convening role and know-how of the Bank
Group much more than its financing, which was relatively small compared with the
size of the economy and of technical assistance. In Vietnam, assistance was provided at
the right time and was responsive to country needs, sometimes expressed at the highest

level of government, for solutions to problems and constraints the country had
identified.

Early engagements and agreement among all stakeholders on common objectives
with a clear direction for reform favored transformational impacts. In most
transformational projects or programs reviewed, the Bank Group team was careful to
engage country partners in project design and implementation. For instance, in the
Omidyar India Microfinance Credit Reporting project, IFC engaged stakeholders from the
beginning in establishing the necessary tools and processes to build the credit reporting
system. Prior to the project, IFC had provided capacity-building technical assistance to
the Microfinance Institutions Network. The network was receptive to having a dialogue
with all stakeholders, and decisions were taken in an environment of trust and equity.

With World Bank support, IFC and the ministry also worked together on a code of
conduct for microfinance institutions. IFC organized a workshop that brought the
ministry together with the four existing credit bureaus—the first time the credit bureaus
had come together. With IFC acting as facilitator, the participants agreed on a credit
information collection model for microfinance institutions and a process for sharing
microfinance borrower data with the credit bureaus. IFC also collaborated with the
Reserve Bank of India. This early involvement of all key stakeholders was critical to
build ownership and trust in the reform process.

In contrast, in the comparator program in Ghana, IFC met resistance from the central
bank to the idea of cooperating with credit bureaus and other stakeholders. Similarly,
the success of the KDP program in Indonesia was in part credited to early and
substantive engagement of local government and local communities.


Design and Implementation Factors
DIAGNOSTIC AND STRATEGIC PREPARATORY WORK—READINESS
Good knowledge and analytical work are critical for properly diagnosing the binding
constraint(s) and opportunities faced by a country or sector; the Bank Group’s global
knowledge helps define a menu of interventions to help address the constraint.
Successful transformational engagements included a strategic understanding of all parts
of a complex system, which may be addressed by a series of interventions.

When trying to explain why some projects are more transformational than others, it is
easy to conclude that success was a result of “being in the right place at the right time,”
suggesting an element of luck. But in at least some of the projects reviewed, it appeared
that the Bank Group was ready to be in the right place at the right time—that
management and the task team were prepared by previous analytical work and


56
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

operational strategies to be able to move when an opportunity appeared. In many
transformational engagements, quality prior diagnostic or AAA/economic and sector
work was undertaken that sufficiently took account of local circumstances and
capabilities, which facilitated the Bank Group’s deployment of its expertise and
instruments.

Plan Nacer drew on the Bank’s analytical work from its long-term engagement,
which laid the groundwork for rolling out a program quickly. The Bank had
supported the health sector in Argentina for a decade prior to Plan Nacer. Lessons from
analytical and operational work shaped the development of the new program: reforms
of the national health insurance systems were not addressing the uninsured or reaching
the poorest provinces. Addressing the inequalities and inefficiencies in service
provision required a full range of Bank support including policy-based and investment
lending, and technical assistance, which was carried out to implement Plan Nacer.

For Brazil’s Bolsa Familia, programmatic analytical and advisory services and a
dedicated evaluation program supported the design and scaling up of the program. In
the cases of the CCRIF, weather index insurance, the Doing Business indicators, and
Indonesia KDP program, among others, World Bank analytical work and academic
research provided the intellectual underpinnings of project design.

By contrast, many comparator engagements lacked diagnostic or knowledge work
that could have informed the program design and helped make the interventions more
specific to the context (such as the Turkey Social Risk Mitigation, Madagascar Education
Sector, Nigeria State Education Project, and the Community Empowerment Projects in Timor-
Leste). The Bank Group’s power sector engagement in Pakistan, and to some extent in
Nigeria, lacked substantive diagnostic work during the period of review.

Because it is not possible to predict if and when analytical and strategic work will
pay off, and the Bank Group’s resources are finite, if it focuses its AAA work on
issues related to binding constraints it can ensure preparedness when circumstances
are right.

APPROPRIATE SCOPE AND DESIGN
Comprehensive versus Narrow Scope

Engagements in IEG’s sample included both comprehensive approaches, such as
sector-wide reforms, and targeted, individual interventions. IEG concluded that both
approaches can lead to transformational change—and the right balance may depend to
a significant degree on country capacity. It is important to have a strategic
understanding of the constraints related to a development challenge and a strategy to



                                                                                       57
                                                                                       CHAPTER 3
                                                        MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

address different parts in a system. Within an assistance program, interventions with
simple designs appear to be associated with better outcomes. Sustained engagements
through a series of interventions, rather than one-off projects, may enhance the
likelihood of transformational impact.

Engagements varied in the extent to which the objectives were narrowly focused or
whether they were more comprehensive. In some instances, starting from a basic
level and adding products or reform over time proved to be an effective approach.
For example, the CCRIF project team recognized that financing was only part of the
bigger system of disaster risk management, which also includes measures to reduce risk
(such as, through construction codes), improve risk information, integrate disaster risk
planning into sector strategies, build the capacity of institutions to respond to natural
disasters, and streamline budget allocation and purchasing processes during disaster
response. Yet the CCRIF team chose to focus on one financial tool and not burden it by
trying to address the other elements of the system. It has subsequently added more
products incrementally. At the same time, however, the Bank and other development
partners were working to solve other problems in the system. The Multi-Donor Trust
Fund allocated 3 to 4 percent of its funds for technical assistance to member finance
ministries to help with project execution, to ensure that the use of CCRIF payouts was
not delayed.

Similarly, the Doing Business indicators measured only some elements of the investment
climate and even then only the cost of regulations rather than both costs and benefits.
This focus seems to have helped Doing Business send a clear signal to policy makers that
the investment climate needed to be improved, but in many areas its indicators need to
be combined with other information to design optimal regulations. Doing Business also
started from a few indicators and increased the scope and coverage over time.

Transformational engagements in human development took a comprehensive
approach to reform. For instance, Plan Nacer included a comprehensive approach to
health insurance for the uninsured. Similarly, Bolsa Familia involved an integration of
social assistance programs to improve overall efficiency and to assist in the expansion of
social safety nets in health and education to the target population.

There was some evidence of greater impact in cases where the Bank Group tackled
multiple binding constraints in a series of operations. For instance, approaches in the
power sector that tackled sector viability and pricing reform as core issues rather than
focusing on unbundling and liberalization were more successful.

In sustainable forest management programs, the Bank engaged with different
stakeholders and coordinated a wide range of activities to address a variety of issues



58
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

related to sustainable forest management. Brazil’s PPG-7 program supported scientific
research, policy analyses, pilot and demonstration projects that addressed Amazon
deforestation from multiple parts and leverage points: policy reform, state and local
institutional capacity strengthening and reform, academic research, and indigenous
peoples and civil society organization capacity strengthening and participation. The
only missing element was private sector participation, which was subsequently covered
through two Development Policy Loans that rewarded the Ministry of Finance’s
issuance of a regulation requiring compliance with applicable sustainability standards
as a condition for any business financing.

Within a development assistance program, simple project design appears to be more
effective in achieving transformative objectives than complex multisector projects.
During the period of review, Nigeria and Pakistan had several multisectoral projects
with power being one of the critical components—including series of structural
adjustment loans and development policy loans approved in the 1990s and early 2000s
for Pakistan -- that did not achieve their transformational objectives in the power sector.
They did not help remove bottlenecks and resolve the structural indebtedness and weak
institutional capacity of the power sector. Crucially, conditionalities for the power
sector in multisector projects tended to lag behind those of other sectors. Similarly,
reform of service delivery in health was just one part of a multisector project in Brazil.
Poorly designed and implemented conditions for disbursement affected the success in
all sectors.

Tailoring Engagements to Country Context, Capacity, and Social Norms

Project design that was well tailored and adapted to local context and capacity were
critical for the success of innovative financing mechanisms. In Bangladesh, stipends
helped modify social customs in return for earnings and status. Award of the stipends
postponed marriages for young girls. The comparator program in Kano State (Nigeria),
a CCT, was successful in helping girls transition from primary to secondary school;
however, increases in attendance after the first payment diminished because of
disruptions in the program. Also, impacts were much stronger in urban areas than in
rural areas. This was hypothesized to be linked to the intensity of supply-side
constraints and also, possibly, cultural constraints.

In Argentina, Plan Nacer was preceded by technical assistance and policy-based
financing and long-term, flexible investment lending that had led to a deep
understanding of country conditions and facilitated the design of the program. The
Bank facilitated sustained policy reforms by following sectoral adjustment lending with
a 10-year adaptable program loan. A complex design resulted in low disbursement,
leading to low success in the case of the Madagascar Education Sector project. Programs

that transferred design features to different contexts without proper tailoring did not
achieve their transformational impacts (Turkey Social Risk Management Project).

The KDP program was successful in part because its design was based on extensive
surveying of local villages to understand how community investment decisions were
made and how people reacted to the current centralized decision-making system. By
contrast, the community empowerment programs in Timor-Leste mimicked some of the
design features of KDP but took limited account of local context. Project administration
was not well integrated with local administration, and projects may not have
consistently met community needs. The weather insurance projects were designed to use
the existing supply chains in the agricultural sector to deliver insurance products.
Similarly, Lighting Africa Kenya’s design aimed to address all aspects of the supply chain
and the supply and demand side – including market intelligence, business development
support to manufacturers and distributors, development of international quality
standards, quality testing and certification, consumer education and financing, and
training of technicians.

In some instances, the choice of instrument was inappropriate for the context and the
capacity of country counterparts. The Brazil Federal District Multisector Management
Project was financed through a sector-wide approach mechanism, which required
strong government commitment and highly qualified staff, both of which the project
lacked.

Creating and Strengthening Institutions

The role and quality of institutions is one of the main consensual factors underlined
in the literature on the determinants of sustained growth. Institutions are defined by
Douglass North (1990) as the “rules of the game” that shape incentives and
opportunities. In the recent literature, the use of the term often includes a focus on
private property rights protection, operation of the rule of law, and the extent of
corruption. Research indicates that determinants of sustained growth are not sufficient
without a good institutional environment.

As underlined by the Growth Commission (2008), economic growth is about more than
economics. It also requires highly committed, credible, and capable government.
Therefore, the economic literature increasingly emphasizes institutions as the
fundamental determinant of development and hence of sustained and transformative
economic growth (see, for instance, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; and
Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2003).

Innovating and strengthening institutions that underpin growth and employment in
countries and that mitigate risks have been central to country-level transformations


60

MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

and their sustainability. Working with and strengthening existing institutions was part
of deep, systemic reforms associated with successful transformations in forestry, human
development, financial and private sector development, power, land administration,
and rural roads infrastructure sectors. Bolsa Familia supported institutional innovations
in designing and implementing a CCT program linked to the provision of social
services to the poor, with Bank support focusing on strengthening the targeting
mechanisms, developing a monitoring and evaluation system, and strengthening the
institutional functioning of the program. El Salvador’s Educo helped establish a system
of community established and run schools; many of the policies and features piloted
under Educo were later mainstreamed in the country’s education system.

KDP aimed to institutionalize participatory processes in local government. In the rural
roads project in Peru, support to strengthen the institutional and management
structures for rural roads was an important aspect. The integration of transformational
elements in the country’s own system ensured the government’s ownership. In this
case, the Bank supported the creation of Provincial Road Institutes for province-wide
strategic roads planning. This helped avoid duplication of efforts by other stakeholders.
This model was replicated in other sectors in Peru. Sector reforms to improve the access
to electricity services were based on strengthening policies, capacity and institutions.

As developing countries often lack well-functioning market and regulatory
institutions, an important part of development is the creation or strengthening of
these institutionalized capabilities (Commission on Growth and Development 2008).
This is consistent with IEG findings from the nine country case reviews for this study.
For example, the average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment ratings of the
transformational cases (China, Chile, Korea, Peru, Poland, and Vietnam) over the
period 2000–10 were substantially higher than these countries’ respective comparators
(4.1 versus 3.4). Similar results hold with World Governance Indicators and its various
components, such as quality of government, corruption, the rule of law, and so forth.
Though the transformational countries and their comparators had similar World
Governance Indicator scores in the early 2000s, transformational countries moved ahead
of their comparators by substantial margins in terms of improved governance and
quality of institutions by 2014, which in turn appear to have helped sustain their
inclusive growth performance by encouraging domestic and foreign private investment.

Lessons from the Bank Group’s engagement in transition economies indicate that an
appropriate institutional and regulatory framework and a capable, transparent public
sector are central elements of an efficient, market-oriented private sector—after the
Bank Group initially underestimated the weaknesses of institutions in these countries.
Analytical work on governance and public sector management should precede large
amounts of Bank lending, particularly where obvious problems are likely to affect


                                                                                         61

assistance programs. The rationale of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) initiative
was to specifically make state institutions more responsive to the poor: the comparator
countries faced considerable challenges to governance and institutional capacity at
different levels of government. In countries affected by fragility and conflict, focusing
on building legitimate institutions is key to breaking cycles of violence (World Bank
2011). In the transformational countries reviewed, the Bank effectively contributed to
macro and fiscal stabilization, strengthening economic governance, and public financial
sector management, thereby strengthening country systems. An IEG evaluation, World
Bank Country-Level Engagements on Governance and Anti-Corruption (IEG 2011f) found
that the Bank has supported efforts to address deep-seated governance challenges such
as civil service dysfunction, capture of natural resource rents, and political-institutional
barriers to market entry and improved service delivery; but results have been limited.

Where its support was effective, the Bank was usually focused on specific governance
and anti-corruption entry points and realistic in its aims. Also important was the choice
of financial instruments and operational design, which were found to be associated
with the achievement of certain governance and anti-corruption objectives.

Many interventions were designed to include specific components targeting
inclusion objectives and fostering impact beyond the project. Among the sample, this
included the inclusive business models of Promigas and Manila Water, the Peru rural
roads program, Lighting Africa Kenya, Argentina’s Plan Nacer, Brazil’s Bolsa Familia, El
Salvador’s Educo, and the Nicaragua Land Administration project, among others. The
intervention in Peru was innovative for including community-formed enterprises for
routine maintenance of the roads. This led to job creation in poor areas, community
ownership, and sustainability of the assets. The use of a local development window
mechanism to fund productive activities in areas surrounding the rehabilitated roads
stimulated local economic development that went beyond the rural roads sector. The
comparator project in India lacked these features. Programs in human development all
targeted inclusion: Plan Nacer was designed to focus on the most vulnerable; Bolsa
Familia targeted dimensions of poverty; and Educo focused on provision of education
services in rural areas which lacked such services.

Maintaining Engagement Levels

Continuing, sustained engagements through a series of operations and supervision
are more conducive to attaining transformational engagements than one-off
interventions are. About two-thirds of transformational engagements reviewed in
IEG’s sample were part of a series of interventions or a program—significantly more
than for comparator engagements (Figure 3.4).




62
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

In several projects reviewed, transformational impact seemed to occur over the course
of sustained engagement by the Bank Group. Reforms took time to be fully
implemented. The forestry reform project in Brazil (PPG-7) was implemented over a
period of more than a decade, and follow-on engagements continue without Bank
Group involvement. Similarly, support programs to sector development in electricity in
the sample took a sustained, long-term approach in the more successful countries
(Kenya, Uganda, the Philippines)—encompassing a series of sequential interventions
from the World Bank, IFC, MIGA, and other development partners.

maintained continuity in the reform
agenda, both from the Bank Group and the client’s sides.

A contrasting example is the Guatemala CAT-DDO. Because it was designed as a single-
operation development policy operation, and because full disbursement happened so
quickly after approval, the Bank lost leverage. Many of the policy and institutional
reforms necessary to improve the country’s disaster risk management system were not
implemented.

BLENDING DIFFERENT BANK GROUP ROLES AND INSTRUMENTS
In supporting transformational change implemented by its clients, the Bank Group
played diverse roles, and the importance of its inputs to achieving the
transformational outcomes varied, depending on the nature of constraint being
addressed. In many cases, financing was not the most important component of Bank
Group assistance. It also offered technical assistance and advisory services, played a
convening role, and filled gaps in institutional capacity. The Bank Group played a

central role as convener, connector, and provider of global knowledge and also
commissioned local knowledge (PPG7)—indicating the importance of blending
different roles and instruments to achieve transformational impact.

Partnerships and the Bank Group’s role as a convener played an important role in
transformational engagements. Sixty percent of the transformational engagements
were implemented in partnerships with other donors, a stark contrast to the comparator
engagements in the sample (Figure 3.5). Partnerships with other donors were critical in
bringing in technical expertise and funding to complement the Bank Group’s suite of
instruments and supplement its limited financial resources. Partnerships can also
provide necessary political support to difficult reforms; and funding sources (such as in
the case of PPG-7) to add financial heft to the Bank Group’s convening role.

For example, the World Bank played a leading role among donors in the power
sectors in Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda. Its leadership role was largely a result
of the significant share of its lending and nonlending support relative to other financiers
in addition to its technical expertise. Consequently, the Bank has coordinated the donor
group and served as the convener in Kenya, the Philippines, and until 2013, Uganda. In
the Philippines, the Bank was co-chair with the government of the Development Forum,
the primary mechanism for facilitating substantive policy dialogue among donors on
the country’s development agenda.

CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

In comparator cases in the power sector, the Bank has not been able to assume the role
of a convener and sector coordinator. The small amount of IDA resources for power
sector projects may have constrained the Bank’s ability to select the type of project it can
finance and limited its leverage in influencing the direction of sector reforms.

Working in partnership at the country level was an important driver in land
administration reform projects. In Nicaragua, key partnerships appeared to have
played a strong role in building consensus around the reform agenda, piloting and
adopting technology from other Latin American countries, and in working in tandem
with the Bank on complementary technical components of the agenda. Other donors,
such as the Nordic Development Fund and the Millennium Challenge Corporation,
were aligned with the overall land reform objectives supported by the World Bank
project, and provided complementary financing.

IEG’s country-level reviews concluded that close coordination among development
partners, with each partner focusing on its area of comparative advantage, was a key
factor in transformational cases. Typically, the World Bank Group effectively used its
convening powers to coordinate the supportive efforts while taking a leading role on
poverty measurement and diagnostics (Mozambique, Peru, Poland, Rwanda, and
Vietnam). In Rwanda, the Bank Group and its development partners played an
important role (including through significant financing) in supporting the
transformation from conflict-affected to developing country. The Bank Group’s strategy
emphasized coordination with other partners – and in recent years the assistance
program has become more selective focusing on high priority sectors.

The nature of Bank Group support at the country level was often programmatic and
underpinned by a highly effective and often customized mix of project and budget
support financing, AAA, technical assistance, and its convening power (in China,
Mozambique, Peru, Poland, Rwanda, and Vietnam). The strength of the Bank Group
was its sustained support of an activity or program over many years. For example, as a
result of its long-term involvement in China, the Bank had a substantial cumulative
impact in a number of areas. Its views gained a respectful hearing and it was sometimes
well placed to take advantage of opportunities when China was looking for support for
change. In Vietnam, the Bank Group strategy consistently reflected the importance of
the private sector in generating inclusive growth and poverty reduction.

STAFF SKILLS AND BANK GROUP PROCESSES
Staff technical expertise and “entrepreneurial” attitude matters. Several projects were
led by entrepreneurial Bank Group staff with deep technical expertise and who had
strong senior management support. These characteristics helped overcome obstacles in
a highly bureaucratic environment. In the case of Doing Business, the leader of the

                                                                                       CHAPTER 3
                                                        MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

project combined technical expertise on enterprise restructuring and privatization with
an entrepreneurial nature and a willingness to take risks. Similarly, the CCRIF was
catalyzed by Bank staff with deep expertise in disaster risk management.

Sector and technical expertise of Bank Group staff were critical in designing and
implementing transformational engagements, including the KDP program in Indonesia,
and Omidyar India Microfinance Credit Reporting. In the Nicaragua Land Administration
Project, the Bank was in a unique position to support the country’s land reform efforts
given its extensive experience in land policy reform and land administration. In
particular, for more than 15 years, its global scope had permitted the Bank to develop a
deep understanding of effective models for cadaster and property registry systems as
well as for land regularization.

Highly skilled and competent teams familiar with the country’s binding constraints
and political and social setting and committed to working closely with the authorities
and in consultation with other development partners were key to transformational
engagements at the country level. The Bank deployed high-quality staff when it first
engaged with China, Vietnam, and several transition economies, according to country
program evaluations. Bank staff were perceived as technical experts and impartial
advisers – establishing a relationship based on trust. In Peru, the expertise of the Bank
team was critical given the innovative nature of the analytical work.

Continuity in Bank Group task team leaders may be a key factor to successful
outcomes. IEG finds that there is a negative correlation between the turnover of Bank
project task team leaders and project outcomes (World Bank 2016). In addition, much of
the Bank Group’s operational and technical knowledge is tacit and not necessarily
documented (World Bank 2015a). Given the longer-term, programmatic nature of many
transformational engagements, there is a premium on ensuring the quality and
continuity of staff.

In transformational cases, the World Bank Group strategy was flexible and evolved in
tandem with the country’s economic and social progress and changing needs over
time. The Bank was perceived as a reliable partner and trusted advisor, especially in
times of crisis (China, Peru, Poland, and Vietnam). IEG’s country-level reviews indicate
that the Bank Group showed flexibility in engaging with transition countries after it
realized that its initial approach had been overly optimistic and it had underestimated
the importance of institutions and governance. It subsequently customized its assistance
to existing initial conditions and country capacity. In other cases, the Bank found ways
to strengthen the private sector (through support to corporate governance and
enterprise reform, for instance), although in the case of China the government was not

MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

ready to engage on the reform of state owned enterprises – which remains a binding
constraint.

Flexibility in implementation and responsiveness to changes in the operating
environment. In at least two projects, transformational impacts resulted from actions
taken to modify project objectives and/or design to accommodate changing client needs
or to use information gathered during implementation. In the Omidyar India
Microfinance Credit Reporting project, IFC was able to adapt the project objective and
expand its scope in response to the microfinance crisis. As the crisis evolved, the project
scope was broadened to include preliminary implementation support. The revised
objective of the project was to facilitate the integration of microfinance institutions with
the licensed credit bureaus in India, going beyond the initial scoping, feasibility study,
and awareness-raising.

In the Nicaragua Land Administration Project the Bank demonstrated flexibility in its
approach and during implementation. It revised its implementation arrangements and
reallocated credit proceeds to support the demarcation and titling of indigenous
peoples’ lands, which required additional funding. The project involved four
extensions—and additional financing—to scale up project activities.

Communication with targeted beneficiaries or policy makers was critical for the
efficacy in several transformational engagements. Aggressive communication and
dissemination played an important role in Doing Business. Successful interventions in
human development provided sufficient information to targeted beneficiary groups. A
central element in the implementation of CCTs is to ensure that beneficiaries are aware
of their required co-responsibilities. In Argentina, Plan Nacer incorporated a
communication strategy to inform patients about the reforms. Information is often a
critical missing link.

For Bolsa Familia, communication figured prominently throughout implementation;
communication sustained the CCT program and promoted widespread buy-in. The
CCT in Turkey did not establish a structured communication strategy to ensure
dissemination of consistent and factually correct information on program benefits,
eligibility, and criteria for inclusion or compliance. As a result, there was limited
knowledge of the program’s health and education conditionalities, and neither health
utilization nor primary school attendance improved.

RISKS AND INTERNAL INCENTIVES
This section provides IEG’s observations on the risks of transformational engagements
based on the review of interventions and prior IEG evaluative work. This report, which
for analytical purposes focuses on comparison of broadly similar interventions,


                                                                                          67
                                                                                       CHAPTER 3
                                                        MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

designed to be transformational, is not structured to provide a systematic analysis of the
relative riskiness of transformational engagements, which would have required an
analysis of a control group of interventions designed as non-transformational.

As indicated earlier, Bank Group institutional incentives during the period of review
may not have been fully aligned with supporting transformational change. In addition,
IEG also finds that piloting of new approaches by the Bank Group is rare. These
patterns may reflect several factors: lending pressures, a perception that such
interventions are highly risky, and require additional resources for preparation and
implementation. Internal incentives may also not be fully conducive to undertaking
long-term, sustained engagements that are typical of many transformational
engagements. The experience with the Doing Business indicators shows that it takes
strong commitment from senior management and an entrepreneurial staff to support an
innovative product. It also shows that transformational engagements can be
controversial and politically difficult to implement.

Are transformational engagements on balance riskier than average projects in the
portfolio? IEG did not assess the issue of risk systematically, given its small sample
size. However, engagements aiming for deep, fundamental change, such as systems
change and institutional transformations that affect political economy aspects of a
country, or very large and complex projects (for example, large infrastructure), nearly
always entail higher risks and require major risk mitigation measures on the part of the
Bank Group and its partners than small, one-off projects. Moreover, innovations and
pilots are inherently more risky than “business as usual” projects.4 In addition, failure
or shortcomings in a high-profile transformational engagement can have negative
implications for the Bank Group’s and its clients’ reputation.

By contrast, successful transformational interventions can generate more “bang for the
buck” because of the accelerations in development trajectories they support, and in the
long run the stream of benefits would exceed costs by a large margin. Moreover, there
are important ways to mitigate potential or actual higher risks in transformational
engagements. IEG findings indicate that greater attention to design and supervision
quality can compensate for higher risks (World Bank 2014c).

Furthermore, technological innovations allow the scaling up of solutions in a more cost-
efficient manner. And gradual scaling up allows learning during implementation—
taking to scale those elements that are successful and adapting or dropping those that
are not-- while limiting financial exposure and risks (as in Lighting Africa Kenya).

In other cases, the Bank Group’s strategy was to support the scaling up of innovative
instruments developed and piloted by others (Bolsa Familia, KDP). The key is to mitigate



68
CHAPTER 3
MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

risks effectively such as through proper diagnostics including of political economy
aspects, alignment of interests between client and the Bank Group to ensure political
commitment of the client, the use of phased interventions, thorough analytical work on
the social, poverty and environmental impact of project, relevant and timely technical
assistance and capacity building built into the project, and flexibility and resources to
manage risks throughout the program cycle. Setting the right tone by Bank Group
management would be critical to encourage more informed risk taking and innovation.

MONITORING AND LEARNING FROM TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS
For many transformational engagements, a sound monitoring system was key to
project efficacy—especially those targeting behavior change through incentives.
Successful transformational engagements had strong monitoring systems in place to
track conditionalities and requirements of targeted beneficiaries and providers. Plan
Nacer’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is considered best practice. The M&E
system was simple, which limited administrative burden and increased the likelihood
of compliance. The robustness of the system, which included combining patient-level
data and feedback of results to individual providers and independent audits, improved
transparency and accountability.

The comparator Brazil Federal District Multisector Management Project lacked effective
M&E design and implementation, which reduced the validity of the data used for its
results-based disbursement mechanism. Lessons from the successful Female Secondary
School Stipend Program (Bangladesh) also support the use of simple, monitorable criteria
for participation, improved targeting, and greater program achievement. By contrast,
the Nigeria State Education project had an overly complex M&E system considering the
low-capacity environment.

Some transformational engagements proactively monitored and evaluated their
performance to learn from experience and adapt program design. The Nicaragua Land
Administration Project and Peru Rural Roads program had well-established M&E
frameworks that collected data related to outcomes and conducted impact evaluations.
The project in Nicaragua had a system that carried out validation and consultation
workshops with beneficiaries and conduct studies relevant to the measurement of the
project’s economic, environmental, social, and gender impacts.

However, current Bank Group M&E systems do not sufficiently capture
transformational engagements. As these engagements may encompass or cut across
multiple interventions and often involve long-term, sequential engagements to address
constraints, the combined impact or effectiveness in addressing binding constraints is
not captured in project M&E methodologies. For instance, individual lending or
investment projects do not typically capture sector or country-wide indicators.


                                                                                        69
                                                                                                  CHAPTER 3
                                                                   MECHANISMS AND FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION

Instruments aiming to capture programmatic results have shown methodological
shortcomings. Quite often, the transformational goals (and effects) differ from specific
project objectives measured by the M&E framework. External effects associated with
transformations, such as multiplier effects, spillovers, demonstration effects, and
replication are not systematically captured in the current M&E frameworks. As the
Bank Group moves to more programmatic support across different institutions and
interventions, it could explore the use of adapted M&E tools that seek to capture the
combined and multifaceted effects at the program level, based on a well-defined theory
of change and indicators for transformational change. This could also reinforce current
efforts on developing results frameworks for program and country level interventions,
and build on approaches capturing effects beyond projects.

Finally, successful transformative interventions at the country level appear to be under-
evaluated by IEG—perhaps because of the higher frequency of knowledge products
versus lending in some of these country cases; there is currently no monitoring or
evaluation system for World Bank knowledge products. Taken together, these issues
may prevent learning from transformational engagements and may in some cases lead
to mis-estimation of their full impact.

4.   Lessons and Implications for the World
Bank Group
The Bank Group supported several successful transformational engagements over
the 2000–14 period. These engagements were difficult to do, require a long time
commitment and sustained effort, and constitute a small proportion of the Bank
Group’s portfolio. They vary in form, size, and the development challenges they
address. Applying its definition of transformational engagements, IEG’s review
developed lessons that can help inform the Bank Group and its partners as they seek to
help developing countries accelerate progress toward sustainable development.

Rapid and sustained transformations are possible. Deep changes, the potential to scale
up solutions, and sustainability of impact of transformational engagements are
apparent prerequisites for the Bank Group, other donors, and development country
governments to attain ambitious goals for eliminating extreme poverty and promoting
shared prosperity. But they require selective, strong, and sustained political
commitment to deep and broad-based reforms. This has to be coupled with a strong
commitment by Bank Group management (and key development partners) to apply its
services effectively and selectively and to provide high-quality, customized advice. The
range of development challenges—persistent poverty, rising inequality and exclusion,
governance and institutional decay, lack of access to basic services, environmental
degradation and climate change—require nuanced and customized development
strategies.

Looking across the projects that achieved transformational change, it is evident that
there is no single policy prescription for success. Economic and social development is
not a mechanistic, linear process. It involves complex and multidimensional
socioeconomic and political processes and interventions in systems that require
contextualized and tailored solutions, adaptation, and active management of change
processes. Therefore, it may be difficult--even impossible--to identify transformational
engagements ex ante. However, in this report IEG provides insights into mechanisms
and factors that can increase the likelihood of transformational impact for interventions
implemented by Bank Group clients (and supported by its development partners).

The sample of 20 projects revealed some key characteristics of transformational
engagements. Most of the engagements supported fundamental change in a market,
system, or behavior. Projects achieved large-scale impact through scaling up,
replication, and demonstration effects of interventions and solutions (including
innovations). Successful transformations were differentiated most clearly from non-


                                                                                        71
                                                                                           CHAPTER 4
                                                   LESSONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP

transformational engagements by the extent to which the effects of the intervention
were sustained, often because they involved comprehensive approaches considering
entire systems, and targeting behavior change.


Emerging Lessons

IEG’s review identifies four mechanisms with the potential to support deep and
large-scale transformation: (i) binding constraints, (ii) cross-sectoral approaches; (iii)
scale up of effective approaches and innovations; and (iv) behavioral change. These four
mechanisms have the potential to support deep and large-scale change in critical
development challenges:

(1)   Identifying and addressing the most binding constraint in a country, sector, or
      entity is a key mechanism for transformational change. Nearly all
      transformational engagements in IEG’s sample tackled a relevant binding
      constraint related to a major development challenge. The review of country-level
      interventions showed that the more successful transformers tackled the most
      binding constraints first and then moved on to address other constraints, and Bank
      Group support evolved with the needs of the country. However, overall the record
      of the Bank Group in diagnosing and addressing the most binding constraint has
      been mixed.

(2)   Several successful transformational interventions addressed multiple binding
      constraints through cross-sector approaches to affect changes in interrelated
      parts of a system. Most major development challenges are inherently
      multidimensional, requiring interventions with cross-sectoral linkages. Prior IEG
      evaluation findings point to the need to avoid overly complex project design in a
      single intervention. Findings from IEG’s sample differed as to whether
      comprehensive reforms or a more focused and incremental approach were more
      effective to address binding constraints. What matters most is to have a strategic
      understanding of the main constraints and a strategic plan to address different
      parts in a system through multiple interventions. The key is to strike the right
      balance between fostering a strategic understanding of key constraints in a sector
      or for a development issue, and then pursue reforms through sequenced and
      focused interventions, which limits complexity in project design and
      implementation. At the same this calls for taking on the key issues, incentives, and
      capabilities impeding cross sectoral work between and within institutions.

(3)   Innovations can catalyze transformational change because of their potential for
      scaling up, reducing cost, mitigating risks, and providing new channels for



72
CHAPTER 4
LESSONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP

          increasing coverage of target population, all if which can magnify the impact of
          interventions. Most of the transformational engagements involved some form of
          innovation related to technologies (such as digital technology), products,
          processes, and/or financing mechanisms. Such innovations introduced or
          contributed to expansion of services to the underserved, mainly by reducing cost,
          using new delivery platforms to increase the reach or utilization of services, and
          addressing information asymmetries and incentives for beneficiaries. The Bank
          Group’s role has been mainly to support scaling up innovations; rather than in
          developing them. Innovative Bank Group instruments have catalyzed changes in
          systems, markets, and behaviors. Continuously exploring creative and innovative
          ways to expand product lines and tools to address challenges and risks to meet the
          evolving demands of client countries is key to transformation. These included
          innovative approaches such as results-based finance and output-based aid. When
          designed properly, innovative approaches were scaled up successfully to help
          extend services to the underserved.

(4)       Transformational engagements frequently changed the behaviors of
          individuals, players, and entire systems. Behavioral change may be achieved
          through monetary incentives, by introducing market forces, and by increasing
          transparency and informational flows among actors and beneficiaries. Changing
          incentives is an important driver for modifying behaviors to support improved
          outcomes. Several successful engagements focused on commercially viable
          approaches, taking advantage of market mechanisms and private enterprises as
          vehicles to reach scale and extend services to the poor and underserved. Several
          engagements used alternative mechanisms to create incentives, such as
          empowering beneficiaries or removing affordability constraints.

IEG also identified lessons related to factors that can enable or constrain
transformational engagements. These are related to the enabling context for
transformational engagements, client commitment, and the quality of design and
implementation of interventions.
          Alignment of the interest of the client with the transformational objectives
           significantly enhances the chance of success for deep changes and difficult
           reforms. In this context, assessing and managing political economy dimensions
           of difficult and complex reforms to help remove binding constraints are key to
           successful transformations.
          A rigorous diagnosis and clear understanding of the most binding constraints
           is key to designing an intervention or series of interventions with the potential
           to address the context-specific constraint. As constraints vary across different
           entities, rigorous diagnosis will help identify the most binding constraints to the


                                                                                             73
                                                                                            CHAPTER 4
                                                    LESSONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP

         development challenge being addressed and is the basis for designing an
         effective assistance program. Transformational engagements can be motivated by
         political transitions, crises, or the recognition of an urgency to act, providing
         windows of opportunity. In the successful cases reviewed by IEG, the Bank
         Group showed readiness to support clients that wished to undertake difficult
         reforms.
        Early and broad engagement with stakeholders to forge agreement on common
         objectives enhanced the chance of successful transformation. Building broad
         coalitions and political consensus—beyond the immediate client counterparts—
         around reforms early on in the process was effective in broadening support and
         maintaining momentum behind reforms in some cases. Successful
         transformations often were implemented in partnership with other donors,
         underlining the importance of the Bank Group’s convening role.
        Adapting interventions to local context and capabilities and social norms is
         critical in successful transformational engagements. Appropriate analytical and
         diagnostic work can help adapt and tailor program design to local context, and
         identify the need for complementary capacity building.
        Continuing, sustained engagements and series of interventions are conducive
         to attaining transformational engagements. One-off projects are less likely to be
         transformational. Ongoing support to clients facilitated the deep reforms
         associated with transformations by helping build capacity and address several
         parts of a system through sequential interventions.
        Transforming institutions is at the core of transformational engagements.
         Building and strengthening local institutions contributed to the sustainability of
         transformational impacts.
        Communicating with key stakeholders and policy makers is critical to
         achieving impact. Communicating the program benefits, eligibility, and
         requirements was critical for the efficacy of programs and buy-in from
         beneficiaries, and critical to foster behavioral change.
        The quality of Bank Group staff and appropriate blending of different
         instruments and roles is critical for successful transformations. The quality and
         technical skills and, in some cases, entrepreneurial attitude of Bank Group staff
         was important to developing and implementing transformational engagements.
         However, some evaluations also indicate that the Bank Group’s institutional
         incentives may not have been fully aligned with helping address the most
         binding constraints.




74
CHAPTER 4
LESSONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP

       Despite a perception that such interventions are riskier and require additional
        resources, this report shows that successful transformational engagements can
        generate high returns in terms of development impact. . While engagements
        seeking to address the most challenging development issues and constraints,
        often using innovative instruments, entail higher risks, careful scaling up and
        adapting of approaches informed by rigorous evidence and learning from
        implementation can mitigate such risks.
       Finally, robust monitoring and reporting systems ensure proper targeting of
        beneficiaries and facilitate learning, as well as adjustments to the project or
        program during implementation. However, current monitoring systems are not
        well equipped to capture transformational impacts.


Implications
The operational implications of the Bank Group’s experience suggest the following
elements in supporting transformational change:

       Identifying the most binding constraints in a country, sector, or development
        theme by consistently implementing rigorous diagnostic work. The new
        Systematic Country Diagnostics has the potential to be an important instrument
        to facilitate a rigorous understanding of binding constraints at the country level,
        but this would need to be complemented by diagnostics at the level of sectors
        and interventions.

       Focusing on binding constraints to development challenges by enhancing the
        selectivity of assistance programs. Based on a strategic understanding of the
        main constraints in a country, sector, or entity, the Bank Group can develop a
        strategic plan to address them through multiple interventions in the same sector
        or different sectors. From the interventions that can address the most binding
        constraints to the development in a country, sector, or entity, the Bank Group
        should select those where it has the greatest potential to address a binding
        constraint given its comparative advantage, and where it has a chance to help
        affect deep, fundamental, and sustainable change by working through a
        committed client counterpart.
       Building on mechanisms of transformation in program and project design.
        This includes shaping incentives to affect sustained behavioral change and
        strengthening institutions to support transformational impact and harnessing
        competitive market mechanisms and the private sector as vehicles of deep
        change and long-term sustainability. Improve the capacity to identify and help

                                                                                            CHAPTER 4
                                                    LESSONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP

         scale up innovations with the potential to overcome traditional barriers to basic
         service access by the poor, and deploy instruments with the potential to deliver
         its assistance more effectively and efficiently.
        Building broad coalitions to enable transformational change through early and
         broad engagements with all stakeholders. This may include involving targeted
         beneficiaries in the design and implementation of the intervention. An increased
         focus on transformational engagements will also involve exploring new
         partnerships and managing them effectively and efficiently to ensure alignments
         of interests.
        Staying the course by undertaking more selective, longer-term, sustained, and
         programmatic engagements. This may require reinforcing the Bank Group’s
         capacity to undertake longer-term, sustained, and programmatic engagements
         associated with deeper and more fundamental change and institution building.
         This would involve, at the country level, to be more selective and engage in
         fewer, more long term, and focused interventions. Adapting programs to the
         local context, based on sound diagnosis, enhances their chance for success.
         Sound reporting and monitoring systems for transformational engagements
         enhance program efficacy, and facilitate learning and adapting the program
         during implementation. Pursuing transformational engagements will require a
         focus on the quality of the Bank Group’s work and the technical expertise of its
         staff and has implications for its human resource policies and practices.
         Institutional incentives would need to be adapted to support a more systematic
         focus of assistance programs on binding constraints—including potentially more
         complex, longer term, and higher risk engagements. The Bank Group could
         develop and apply lessons on risk mitigation to address perceptions of higher
         risk associated with transformational engagements.
In this review of the experience with transformational engagements, IEG concludes
there are ways in which the Bank Group can enhance the likelihood that interventions
catalyze faster development progress by taking a programmatic approach addressing
systemic change and behavioral change based on sound diagnosis of binding
constraints. This need not mean more complexity in individual interventions, but it
does mean developing a thorough understanding of the main constraints and issues.
Doing so would facilitate a plan of selective and sequenced interventions that can help
address the constraints to the development of a country or sector.

In conclusion, there is scope for the Bank Group and its partners to enhance their focus
and capacity to undertake transformational engagements, but these interventions are
only one step to help clients accelerate their progress toward sustainable development.

Appendix B
Methodology for Assessing Country-Level
Transformational Engagements
This appendix describes the approach and methodology used for screening and
selecting developing countries for an evaluation-based review of their economic and
social performance since 1990, with a greater focus on the 2000–13 period. The
objective of this review was to identify country cases that were considered to have
succeeded in being transformational in terms of inclusive and sustainable growth,
poverty reduction, and rapid social progress partly as a result of significant lending
and non-lending activities by the World Bank Group and other development
partners.

General Criteria for Transformation
The main criteria used for assessing countries’ performance with regard to
transformation was whether the country substantially reduced poverty, making
sustained and significant progress in its social sectors, and achieved broad-based
and inclusive economic growth over an extended period of time during the review
period.

The approach used compared the performance of a set of relatively more successful
countries with respect to these criteria against the performance of a set of countries
that were deemed less successful and assessed the Bank Group’s role and
contribution with respect to each subgroup, either as the lead development
institution or in partnership with other development agencies. On identification of
the more successful and less successful countries, a sample of countries (from both
groups) was selected in which the Bank Group had active lending and non-lending
programs during the period covered by this study. The ultimate objective of this
segment of the study was to draw lessons concerning the Bank Group’s faster
“transformational” as well as slower or non “transformational” country-level
engagements and to identify some common determinants of success and lack of
success.

Country-Level Transformations
Taking the above definition of country-level transformational engagements, key
Bank Group strategic initiatives were reviewed over the last two decades that were
deemed as transformational in nature. Nearly all of them entailed partnerships in
which the World Bank Group played either a leading or a significant supporting
role.



                                                                                     85
APPENDIX B
METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY LEVEL TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS




The First Lens
For the purpose of this study, evaluative evidence was reviewed on the impact and
effectiveness of the Bank Group’s role in three major and (by their very nature)
transformative initiatives:

     • Transition from centrally planned to market-based economies (transition
     initiative): 1989-present

     • Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) Initiative: 1998-present

     • Fragile and conflicted-affected states initiative (focusing on countries that
     graduated from this status): 2002-present

In addition, the analysis considered member countries in which the Bank Group has
been actively engaged as a development partner over a long period, often stretching
over several decades. Examination of long-term strategic engagements (mostly in
countries that had achieved middle-income status starting in the 1990s) would begin
in the 1960s or 1970s and continue to the present. This category included client
countries that transitioned from the low-income to the upper-middle or even high-
income category with the assistance or active involvement of the Bank Group.

The Second Lens
An analytical/statistical framework was developed to screen selected countries’
growth and development performance and identify relatively more successful and
less successful economies using objective and quantitative criteria. To develop the
simple and transparent framework, around 85 developing countries were selected
for which the following data were available for the period 1990-2013: gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita (in real terms); headcount poverty (both national and
$2/day using purchasing power parity); the Human Development Index and its key
nonincome components (that is, life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling);
income inequality (the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio of the share of the top 10
percent to the share of the bottom 40 percent).

In addition, the following indicators were examined to differentiate among the
selected countries in terms of environmental sustainability, social inclusion, as well
as the Bank Group lending and extent of engagement by the private sector:
greenhouse emissions (in metric tons per unit of GDP) and other relevant indicators,
such as the Eco-system Sustainability Index of the Social Progress Index ; World
Bank/IDA lending (as a percent of the recipient country’s GDP and as a percent of
the World Bank/IDA total commitment); and foreign direct investment inflows (as a
percent of the recipient country’s GDP). Countries with incomplete data, including

                                                                                             APPENDIX B
                                  METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY LEVEL TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS

most of those countries with relatively long-periods of internal and external conflict
were excluded from the sample.

The overarching goal was to come up with a list of countries that may have been
able to achieve sustainable and inclusive development over the last 25 years. A
simple and statistical method of ranking each country’s sustained progress relative
to the other countries was used in the sample (83 countries) across five indicators:
average annual per capita GDP growth, average annual rate of poverty reduction,
average annual rate of increase in life expectancy, average annual rate of increase in
years of schooling, and average change (and its direction) in measures of income
inequality over the entire period of evaluation (1990-2013), though with a particular
focus on the most recent 13 years.

Following this procedure, countries were ranked by their pace of transformation as
measured by their sustained rate of progress across the five indicators, each of
which were normalized using the min-max procedure,1 and then combined into a
single index for each country, using geometric aggregation (using equal weights).
Following this method, the average rank for each country i was calculated by the
following transformation:

Ri, t to t+n = [ Пj Xi,t to t+n, j ]1/5, where i = 1, 2, ….,83; j=1, 2, …, 5; and t=1990 or 2000.

According to this geometric aggregation method, if a country ranks first across all of
the five categories, its average rank would be first as well, but it would penalized
heavily in its overall ranking if it does poorly in one or two areas, such as in
education or equity, even if it performed exceptionally well in terms of economic
growth and poverty reduction. Using this method, the 83 countries were divided
into three groups: the top 25 percent of countries by ranking, the middle 50 percent,
and the bottom 25 percent.

This second lens essentially provides the most critical screening tool for country-
level assessment, which is presented in Table B.2, and it is consistent with the
screening criteria identified and applied for analysis of transformational
engagements (since the five country-level indicators chosen for this review measure
the key dimensions of sustainable and inclusive transformation and its pace across
countries and time):

    • Importance: Addresses a major developmental challenge: Substantial economic
    growth combined with poverty reduction and or social progress.

    • Depth of change: Causes or supports fundamental change in system or market;
    addresses root causes (a change in trajectory). This element is captured by the
    proposed buckets (categories): Transition from Plan to Market (for example,
    Bulgaria and Romania versus Poland); Poverty Reduction Strategy Initiative (for


                                                                                                    87

     example, Nigeria versus Vietnam); fragile and conflict-affected state graduates
     (for example, Mozambique and Rwanda versus fragile and conflict-affected state
     nongraduates); and long-term strategic engagements that have proven
     transformative (for example, the Philippines versus Peru, along with Chile,
     Korea, and China). This element is also implicit in the country rankings (for each
     indicator, higher-ranked countries are associated with fundamental changes).
     The methodology also implicitly identifies “inflection points”— discontinuities
     in development indicators related to poverty, social progress, and inclusive
     growth -- by basing the country rankings on the speed of change for each
     indicator.

     • Scale of change: Causes or has the potential to cause large-scale impact at the
     national level. By definition all country-level transformations are large (national)
     in scale.

     • Sustainability: Has impact or potential impact that is economically, financially,
     environmentally, and socially sustainable in the long term. This element,
     evaluated over an extended period of time (1990-2013), facilitates the
     identification of country cases with sustained transformational change in
     indicators related to poverty, social progress, inclusive growth and
     environmental sustainability (which in this version of the report is not included
     in the rankings but assessed ex post instead).

The Third Lens
The third lens consists of each country’s average Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) score (which varies between 1 and 6, with 6 indicating
exceptionally sound or effective policies) over the period 2000-10 and whether the
country graduated from low-income to middle-income and eventually to high-
income classification over the review period 1990-2013. This lens attempts to identify
those countries that had achieved a substantial progress in improving their social
indicators, raising their standard of living and reducing their extreme poverty in the
1980s and 1990s (for example, Chile, the Republic of Korea, and Poland), that is prior
to the period of review for this review. In this context, all those countries that had
moved from low-income status to high-income status (according to the World Bank
classification) while maintaining a superior CPIA rating for an extended period (for
example, average of 4 over the 2000s) were included among rapidly transforming
countries. In fact, countries, such as Chile, Korea, and Poland consistently rank high
among all countries in the sample in terms of level of development.

Selection of Case Studies
All three lenses were used to come up with a proposed list of potentially
transformed countries. A-list (transformed or rapidly transforming) countries are in

                             METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY LEVEL TRANSFORMATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS

the top 25 percent of rankings, have high CPIA scores (4 or more over a 10-year
period), and in most cases moved up the income classification ladder. B-list
(partially transformed or slowly transforming) countries are in the middle 50
percent of rankings, have modest CPIA scores, and may or may not have moved up
the income classification ladder. C-list countries failed to sustain the pace of
development despite having received assistance from the Bank Group and other
donors. These countries are in the bottom third of rankings (except for countries that
achieved sustained development and growth in the earlier decades), have low CPIA
scores, and failed to move up the income classification ladder (see Table B.1).
Country performances were also differentiated within each of proposed country
groups by analyzing the change in the average level of CPIA between the first and
the second half of the review period.

Using this methodology and taking account of the evaluative evidence available
(that is, relevant thematic IEG evaluations, such as evaluations of transition
economies, Poverty Reduction Strategy Initiatives of PRSCs, and middle-income
countries; the country case studies for IEG’s recent poverty evaluation, including
Peru, the Philippines, and Nigeria, as well as relevant Country Assistance
Evaluations/Country Partnership Evaluations, relevant Country Assistance Strategy
Completion Report Reviews and Project Performance Assessment Reports, and so
forth), a list of potential country-level transformational and nontransformational
engagements by the Bank Group was prepared.

The review was based on comparison of at least two country experiences in which
the Bank Group actively engaged through any one of the four initiatives. It used a
calibrated/modified version (to fit the country-level review) of the “In-Depth
Review of Transformational Engagements” template for this study. Within the
fourth category (long-term strategic initiatives), a light review of important
transformative engagements by the World Bank Group over the past 30–40 years
was conducted (in countries such as Chile, China, and Korea). Based on the
methodology, the following country cases were selected for review:

      Transition from plan to market: Bulgaria and Romania versus Poland
      PRS Initiative: Nigeria versus Vietnam
      Fragile and conflict-affected state graduates: Mozambique and Rwanda
       versus nongraduates
      Long-term strategic engagements: the Philippines versus Peru, along with
       Chile, Korea and China (light review).

A synthesis of these reviews as well as a brief summary of each country review is
presented in Appendix C.

Appendix C
Selected Strategic Interventions to Support
Countries in Achieving Transformational Changes
This appendix summarizes the findings of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
from its comparative review of the experience of country cases for the four strategic
initiatives, transition from plan to market, poverty reduction strategies, fragile and
conflict affected countries, and long term engagements, covering the period 1990-2013.
The performance of countries reviewed by IEG in key indicators of inclusive growth
and poverty reduction is in Table C.1.
Transition from Central Planning to a Market-Based Economy (Central and Eastern
Europe)
The centrally planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe made rapid progress
toward transitioning to market economies during the 1990s, with the support of the
World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Union. By the
early 2000s, their transformation was incomplete, however, and profound economic,
social, and political consequences that accompanied transition posed strategic
challenges (IEG 2004). Nevertheless, in many countries, the key steps in moving to a
market economy—liberalizing markets and trade, creating new businesses, achieving
price stability, and moving toward clear property rights—are well advanced and
provide important lessons for late reformers.
The World Development Report 1996: From Plan to Market (World Bank 1996) concluded
that even where the institutional underpinnings of a market system were weak,
consistent policies could achieve a great deal. Sustained and consistent reform was
needed, with a critical mass of support. The report emphasized the need for clear
property rights, a prerequisite for market processes that would eventually require
widespread private ownership. It pointed out that major changes in social policies were
needed to complement the move to the market—a focus on relieving poverty, coping
with increased labor mobility, and addressing the effects of reforms on the very young
and elderly. The report also stressed the importance of reform of legal and financial
institutions, as well as of government itself.

The Bank Group shared the optimism of many early reformers and Western observers
about the speed with which economic liberalization and legal and policy changes
would produce robust supply responses in the transition economies—particularly
countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States—and consequently about the
depth and duration of the initial declines in output and employment and the related
social costs and political turbulence. In large part, this optimism was related to the



                                                                                         93

expectation that the rapid shift of control over resources to private hands, along with
the liberalization of prices and trade, would quickly lead to more rational resource use
under market discipline. In the event, these changes did not occur in many countries.
Along with other donors, the Bank Group also greatly underestimated the impact of
corruption and the weakness of core institutions and public administrations in
managing the transition process. It did not address these areas adequately in its
assistance programs. It now understands that an appropriate institutional and
regulatory framework and a capable, transparent public sector are central elements of
an efficient, market-oriented private sector. Analytical work on governance and public
sector management should precede large amounts of Bank lending, particularly where
obvious problems are likely to affect assistance programs.
Poverty has also been a far more serious problem than the Bank expected in countries
making the transition from plan to market, most notably in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.1 In the future, the Bank should be much better prepared to identify
and address rapidly growing poverty by monitoring poverty levels from the very
beginning of its involvement in a country.

The transition from a centrally planned economy requires a vast web of interrelated
changes in attitudes and concepts, as well as laws, policies, and institutions. One of the
key generic lessons that emerges from evaluations of the transition experience is that a
carefully crafted external assistance program can help policy makers design and
implement these changes and ameliorate their social costs but that however well
designed a program of reform may be, it is the government’s ownership of it and the
degree of consensus it is able to mobilize in society at large that will largely determine
the rate of progress. A well-informed civil society can be a major driver for change.
Stakeholder analysis is an important input to understanding the political and social
processes at work in a country that can have a major impact on the outcome of
assistance.
A related theme that emerges from assessments by IEG of Bank Group assistance to
transition economies during 1990-2003 is the limited capacity of most borrowing
governments to design and implement complex and difficult programs and legal
structures and the tendency of the Bank to underestimate the duration and intensity of
the assistance needed. Rehabilitation and other projects with short-term objectives
should be designed to minimize delays (using negative lists rather than trying to
identify critical imports, for example); do without project implementation units; and
forgo long-term reform objectives. Beyond the short term, capacity building should be
central to any country strategy.
Despite these lapses, in a relatively short period (about a decade in most cases), the
transition economies increased the share of the private sector in the economy from
about zero in the late 1980s to about 70 percent by the early 2000s. By 2013, several
countries in Central and Eastern Europe—led by Poland, the Czech Republic, and the

Baltic states—had transformed their economies into competitive market-based
economies and moved from the Bank’s lower-middle- or upper-middle-income
categories to its high-income group.
To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms at work that link policies, initial
conditions, the internal political economy environment, and external factors in the
transition economies of the Central and Eastern Europe to their development outcomes,
IEG selected three countries: Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania. These reviews are
summarized below.
POLAND, BULGARIA, AND ROMANIA

Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania received substantial financial and nonfinancial
assistance from the World Bank Group (as well as the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund) in support of their transition from centrally planned
economies to market-based and private sector–led economies, staring in the early 1990s.
In all three countries, the quality of lending and non-lending support, as evaluated by
IEG, was mostly moderately satisfactory or better. In all three countries (albeit with a
significant degree of variation in terms of quality and timeliness of the outcome), Bank
Group support through good-quality analytical and advisory products helped countries
identify their binding constraints to growth and development and to focus on
transitioning their centrally planned economies to market-based, private sector–led
ones.

Among these economies, Poland was the fastest transformer. It moved more quickly in
developing a credible and dynamic private sector and building on its institutional and
human capital strength as well as its sizable domestic market and relatively large
workforce. Over the past 25 years and following painful reforms, Poland underwent
massive economic and political transformations. It was the fastest growing country
within this group with average annual growth of GDP per capita of 3.6 percent
compared with 3.1 percent for all transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe
and only around 2.1 percent for Bulgaria and Romania (1990-2013). Poland was also
more successful than either Bulgaria or Romania in reducing poverty. Between 1990
and 2013 nearly 2.3 million people were lifted out of poverty ($2/day) in Poland
compared to an increase of 0.2 to 0.3 million in the number of poor people in Bulgaria
and Romania and a reduction of only 0.2 million people for Central and Easter Europe
transition countries as a group. Poland also had superior achievements in the social
sectors and in terms of environmental sustainability and was able to maintain a
relatively equitable distribution during the same period.

As a result of these transformations, the Polish economy emerged from decades of
socialist state control of the economy. Much of its industry has been privatized, and its
economy has become increasingly market based and competitive. Per capita GDP has
more than doubled, and millions of people have been lifted out of extreme poverty,
despite the sharp rise in both unemployment and poverty in the initial years of


                                                                                                          95

transition. Poland is one of very few countries that moved up in the Bank Group’s
income classification from lower-middle to high-income status in just two decades.
Despite its progress, Poland has not completed its transformation. It must close the
productivity gap with Western Europe, by reining in its public sector, investing in
growth industries and becoming more global.

Both Bulgaria and Romania made significant progress on the economic and social fronts
and in transitioning toward a market-based, private sector–led economy. But they have
gone through a difficult and prolonged adjustment period. They lag far behind Poland
in private sector development and in the degree of their integration with the Euro area
and the global economy. Both countries have a challenging reform agenda ahead in
order to speed up their transition to market-based and competitive economies.

Poverty Reduction Strategies
The World Development Report 2000/01: Attacking Poverty drew on a large body of
research to conclude that major reductions in poverty were possible despite the
mammoth proportions of the problem.2 To reduce poverty, the report recommended a
more comprehensive approach that directly addresses the needs of poor people in three
complementary areas: (i) promoting economic opportunities for poor people through
equitable growth, better access to markets, and expanded assets; (ii) facilitating
empowerment by making state institutions more responsive to poor people and
removing social barriers that exclude women, ethnic and racial groups, and the socially
disadvantaged; and (iii) enhancing security by preventing and managing economy-
wide shocks and providing mechanisms to reduce the sources of vulnerability that poor
people face. It noted that actions by countries and communities would not be enough:
global actions needed to complement national and local initiatives to achieve maximum
benefit for poor people throughout the world.

The report contributed to the analytical foundation of the Bank Group’s institutional
strategy for development, as articulated in the following years. It formed the intellectual
basis for the country-owned PRS Papers (PRSPs) that were being initiated as the report
was being written. It also served an important informational role in quantifying and
describing the evolution of poverty since the previous poverty-oriented World
Development Report (World Bank 1990).
The contribution of the PSRP varied widely across countries, depending mainly on the
initial conditions in each country’s public sector, government-partner relationships, and
relations among donors. The initiative added the most value in countries where
government leadership and aid management processes were already strong. It has had
less effect in countries with weak public sector capacity and donor-dominated aid
relationships. Because the initiative includes a uniform requirement (completion of an
acceptable document), it has not been sufficiently tailored to match the full range of
capabilities and public policy priorities in low-income countries. Most PRSPs, for

example, deal primarily with the composition of public expenditure; they give
inadequate treatment to growth and other poverty-reducing actions.
External partners have supported the PRS process during formulation but have not
systematically adapted the content of their assistance programs in a coordinated
manner around the content of PRSPs, partly because of shortcomings in the strategies
themselves. The PRS initiative is an improvement over the Policy Framework Papers of
the 1990s, but it remains a work in progress. It had not yet fulfilled its potential to
enhance poverty-reduction efforts in low-income countries at the time of the IEG
evaluation (IEG 2004c). To gain a better understanding of the key drivers of
transformation (and the World Bank Group’s role) within the PRS approach, IEG
selected two countries—Nigeria and Vietnam.
NIGERIA AND VIETNAM

In Vietnam and Nigeria, the PRS process seems to have played an important role in
improving growth performance and moving forward on the social front, particularly
given relatively weak local capacity. It did so by focusing the attention of policy makers
and the donor community and directing their financial and technical assistance toward
the meaningful measurement and analysis of key social indicators and poverty efforts.
Key targets and instruments underpinned an actionable overall poverty reduction
strategy in a programmatic fashion. Vietnam has been significantly more successful
than Nigeria in transforming its economy, raising the standard of living in a more
inclusive manner, and moving to middle-income status.

Vietnam was one of the fastest growing economies in the past 25 years, and the fastest
growing within the PRSP group with average annual growth of GDP per capita of 5.5
percent (compared with 1.9 percent for PRSP countries and 2.6 percent for Nigeria).
Vietnam was very successful in translating its rapid growth into a very rapid poverty
reduction as nearly 45 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty ($2/day)
during 1990-2013 compared to a reduction of just 0.8 million people for the entire PRSP
group during the same period. Vietnam also succeeded in improving its average social
indicators and in maintaining a relatively equitable distribution of income compared
with the PRSP group as a whole.

Overall, Vietnam has made substantial progress in transforming its economy and
society into a dynamic market-based economy with sustained rapid growth, relatively
low poverty, and high social indicators. Along with other donors, the Bank Group made
substantial contribution to these achievements, through its policy advice; the policy
conditionality of its lending operations, especially the budget support instrument PRSC;
and its high-quality analytic and advisory activities. A key feature of these interventions
was that they provided assistance at the right time and were responsive to country
needs, sometimes expressed by the highest level of government, for solutions to
problems the country had already identified. Its assistance contributed significantly to a
much improved policy environment over time.

APPENDIX C
SELECTED STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES IN ACHIEVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES

In contrast, although Nigeria has accelerated its GDP growth since 1999, its impact on
reducing poverty has been very limited. In a sharp contrast to Vietnam, the number of
people in extreme poverty ($1.25/day) in Nigeria rose by more 38 million between 1990
and 2013 compared with a sharp reduction in Vietnam during the same period. Nigeria
will not meet most of the Millennium Development Goals. The low growth elasticity of
poverty reduction in Nigeria reflects a growing inequality which remains quite high
despite some decline in recent years. The Bank Group’s role in terms of financing is not
large and has been declining relative to Nigeria’s economy. It could have influence
through policy advice and analytic and advisory activities, as well innovative projects
that could be scaled up (there are a few good examples). If implemented in a
satisfactory manner, the current country strategy could contribute to more sustainable
and inclusive growth and a more meaningful poverty reduction than the previous one.
Fragile and Conflicted-Affected States
Fragile and conflict-affected states represent some of the most intractable challenges to
development and human safety. Insecurity has become a primary development
challenge, according to the World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and
Development.
As of 2016 the World Bank classifies 35 countries as fragile or conflict affected, up from
25 countries classified as low-income countries under stress in 2005. Extreme poverty is
becoming increasingly concentrated in FCS countries, the group of countries where
progress toward inclusive growth and poverty reduction has been most difficult to
achieve. Some 1.2 billion of about 5.8 billion people in developing countries are
estimated to live in countries affected by fragility. Economic growth in these countries is
very low, and poverty and social indicators are substantially worse than the averages
for developing countries. More than half (51 percent) of the half a billion people living
in these countries live on less than $1.25 a day. Addressing fragility and conflict will
therefore be central to attaining the twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
achieving shared prosperity.
Conflict and fragility manifest themselves in different forms and have evolved over the
past quarter century. Although the number of interstate and civil wars has declined,
many countries are experiencing new forms of violence and fragility, including
repeated cycles of violence, weak governance, and instability (World Bank 2011). The
understanding and definition of fragility and conflict are also evolving. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently proposed
a new multidimensional framework of fragility comprising five dimensions: violence,
justice, institutions, economic foundations, and resilience.
The donor community has struggled to come to terms with how best to assist countries
affected by fragility and conflict (IEG 2006). Informed by research, in 2002 the Bank
suggested that the challenge of aid effectiveness in poor countries with ineffective
governments required different instruments, supplemented by financial transfers, to

                 SELECTED STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES IN ACHIEVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES

promote change. The poor performance of these countries had led to an increasing
concentration of (performance-based) assistance in low-income countries with
reasonable policies, institutions, and governance. At the same time, it was recognized
that disengagement from fragile countries carried with it regional and global risks (such
as risks related to failed states). This work helped initiate a new strategy (the 2002 low-
income countries under stress initiative) for engaging with fragile and conflict-affected
countries to facilitate policy and institutional change and improve basic social
outcomes.
Donor coordination, which is generally satisfactory at the level of the country strategy
formulation, is often inadequate at the operational level and during the implementation
phase. In the fragile and conflict-affected countries, where capacity to coordinate,
prioritize and manage aid flows tends to be weak, lack of adequate donor coordination
among donors may substantially reduce the effectiveness of aid.
There is a startling relationship between fragility and poverty (Collier 2007), and
chronic insecurity is a main threat to development (World Bank 2013a). Repeated cycles
of conflict and violence exact human, social, and economic costs that can last
generations, wiping out development progress. Bank research on conflict, security, and
development indicates that the average cost of civil war is equivalent to 30 years of
GDP growth for a medium-size developing country (World Bank 2011). Addressing
these cycles of violence and helping build legitimate institutions are therefore central to
the Bank Group’s mission of alleviating poverty (World Bank 2013a). The selection of
countries for review (Mozambique and Rwanda, having graduated from fragile and
conflict-affected state status) was based on IEG’s evaluative work.
MOZAMBIQUE AND RWANDA

Among the FCS reviewed for this study, two graduates, Mozambique and Rwanda,
performed much better in terms of growth and poverty reduction than the average
performance by FCS countries. Their results and the Bank Group’s role to help both
countries achieve them are nuanced, however, and need to be interpreted carefully.

Since the end of the bloody two decade long civil war that left the country in ruin,
Mozambique has emerged as one of Africa’s best-performing economies. Annual GDP
per capita growth averaged 3.7 percent over the past two decades. Sound
macroeconomic management, large-scale foreign investments, political stability, and
significant donor support contributed significantly to the country’s solid performance.
Mozambique also succeeded in making substantial progress in social sectors (for
example, increase in average years of schooling was more than twice the average gain
by the fragile and conflict-affected group). However, the impressive trajectory of
growth and gains in education and health have not resulted in poverty reduction, job
creation, and reduced income inequality as had been hoped for, prompting questions
about the current development model and the need for greater inclusiveness and
diversification of sources of growth.

IDA lending to Mozambique was substantial in the 1990s, accounting for almost 6
percent of the country’s GDP; it remained significant, at 2.5 percent of GDP, over the
past decade. IDA was Mozambique’s largest development partner, providing more
than $1.3 billion in funds. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) also played active roles, supporting several
megaprojects. Going forward, the challenge is to translate the sizable level of aid and
the resulting economic growth into deeper poverty reduction and more sustainable
development outcomes.

The Bank Group and its developmental partners played an important role in Rwanda’s
transformation in the areas of sustainable economic growth and rapid social progress.
IDA made constructive contributions to Rwanda’s substantial progress in the past 20
years. Rwanda graduated from fragile and conflict-affected status, sustained rapid
economic growth, and reached truly impressive human and social development
milestones since the end of the civil war in 1994. However, as of 2013, the poverty level
was still higher than what it was before the start of the civil war, in 1990. Its growth,
however, has not been as equitable or its poverty reduction as rapid as it could have
been. Only since 2009 have poverty and inequality, which remain very high, begun to
decline significantly.

Recent positive trends in poverty reduction and economic equality are encouraging
signs that highly successful social sector development paired with strong economic
growth are crucial in the process of transformation. It is still too early to make a call on
the fiscal and environmental sustainability of Rwanda’s achievements. However,
stronger country ownership and a very selective Bank Group program since the mid-
2000s contributed to the observed development shift. These lessons can be applied in
other fragile and conflict-affected states, even if Rwanda’s dependence on aid creates a
sense of uncertainty about the sustainability of its impressive progress.

In sum, both Rwanda and Mozambique have succeeded in sustaining economic growth
and social progress over an extended period and in initiating their respective
transformations into less fragile and more dynamic economies compared with the
fragile and conflict-affected states as a group, though they both face difficult
development challenges and will continue to require sustained technical and financial
assistance to ensure their future growth is more inclusive and environmentally and
socially sustainable than has been the case in the last decade.

Long-Term Strategic Interventions (Mostly in Middle-Income Countries)
Although the global rate of extreme poverty has fallen by half since 1990, progress in
the developing world has been uneven. Extreme poverty remains widespread in most
low-income countries, roughly half of which are classified as fragile and conflict
affected. In addition, many middle-income countries continue to have substantial levels
of extreme poverty, and many people who escaped extreme poverty remain poor and

                 SELECTED STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES IN ACHIEVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES

vulnerable to slipping back into it. Progress in sharing prosperity is decidedly mixed,
with inequality accompanying growth in many countries as they move up the national
income ladder and extreme poverty declines. Indeed, in many upper-middle-income
countries, the share of population living on $2-$4 (PPP) a day often increases sharply.
The Bank Group has been more effective and relevant in cases where it has applied its
knowledge and evaluative evidence to the specific development challenges of middle-
income countries and customize its support to their development needs, which vastly
differ from one country to another and evolve over time. This is clearly supported by
recent evaluative evidence. Based on IEG’s recent evaluations of the World Bank’s
performance in middle-income countries for the periods what overlap with this
review’s evaluative period, the overall outcomes of the Bank’s country programs in
middle-income countries (MICs) were found to be moderately satisfactory, on average,
in meeting country-specific development objectives of promoting economic growth and
reducing poverty. In fact, IEG found that the outcomes in MICs were better than for the
Bank’s work in low-income countries, and indeed the then (the first of the 2000s) recent
outcomes in large MICs, such as Brazil and China, were assessed to have been fully
satisfactory—that is, at least a notch higher on the rating scale than moderately
satisfactory.
Yet IEG found that there was significant pressure on the Bank Group to do better in an
environment where MICs’ demands had begun to become more challenging and they
were facing more choices of support. In addition, other indications, ranging from client
surveys, to in-country consultations, and reviews of projects and programs, suggested
that for the World Bank’s “work to have a more pivotal demonstration effect, a greater
proportion of it must reach the highest standards of effectiveness” (IEG 2007).

IEG’s evaluative findings from a subsequent evaluation of the Bank’s support for
earning growth and employment creation in three middle-income countries (Colombia,
Tunisia and Turkey) reinforced the finding of the earlier evaluation that from a more
general cross-cutting perspective, the World Bank could usefully strengthen its role as
knowledge provider, broker, and facilitator of knowledge creation. The Bank is in a
good position, IEG argued, to exercise leadership on employment issues as it has
demonstrated capacity to use research for developing operationally relevant policy. In
this regard, IEG recommended that “[analytic and advisory activity], not lending, is
often the best instrument to deal with more sensitive policy issues” (IEG 2008a). The
outcome of the Bank support was evaluated to have been mixed. Despite notable
progress in economic growth, earnings, and poverty reduction in the countries
reviewed, unemployment rates remained high, which was assessed to have been at least
partly due to the lack of sufficient focus of the support programs on the main binding
constraints on the functioning of the labor markets and lack of attention to related
political economy issues.

SELECTED STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES IN ACHIEVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES

World Bank Group assistance to support transformational changes in its clients through
long-term engagements with them range from those who have recently graduated from
IDA to those who have recently been moved to the high-income category. IEG
conducted country reviews based on the IEG’s existing evaluative for Peru and the
Philippines.3
PERU AND THE PHILIPPINES

Peru and Philippines are two countries with which the Bank Group has maintained
long-term strategic engagements. Peru experienced strong growth and development
outcomes over the last 25 years. In the Philippines, transformation was more modest,
but it, too, made good progress, particularly over the last decade.

Peru experienced average annual GDP per capita growth of 3.4 percent during 1990-
2013 compared with only 2.1 percent for MICs as a group, and 3.2 million people were
lifted out of extreme poverty ($1.25/day) during this period. Peru’s pace of progress in
social sectors was significantly faster than the average for middle-income countries.
Consistent government commitment and effective management of the reform agenda
were key factors underpinning positive Bank Group contributions over the review
period. Positive outcomes of Bank Group support also reflected, among other things, its
long-standing policy dialogue, maintenance of its reputation as a high-quality service
provider, important intellectual contributions, and consistent dialogue with civil
society. Peru seems to have valued the convening role and know-how of the Bank
Group much more than its financing. The team working with the Peruvian authorities
had a high level of expertise and commitment to the Bank’s program of support for
Peru. Their skill was critical given the innovative nature of the analytical work; it raised
the quality of the dialogue and the level of trust.

Moving forward, a stronger push in growth-promoting reforms, combined with
continuation of sound macroeconomic policies, will be needed to bring Peru to a higher
income level. Peru will also need to continue strengthening the links between growth
and equity. A large share of the Peruvian population remains vulnerable to shocks and
could fall back into poverty, reversing the progress achieved over the course of the past
decade. The government has identified priority areas to prevent slippage from
occurring, including increasing the quality of basic services, such as education and
health; expanding access to markets for the poor and vulnerable segments of the
population; and closing infrastructure gaps in rural and peri-urban areas, increasing
access to markets and services.

The Philippines has maintained a wide-ranging engagement with the Bank for almost
60 years. But despite strong economic growth, extreme poverty did not significantly
decline since the early 1990s. Its real per capita GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2
percent in 1990-2013, and the number of persons in extreme poverty ($2/day) actually
increased by 2.2 million people (of a total population of about 100 million) during the

                 SELECTED STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES IN ACHIEVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES

same period while its income inequality remained among the highest in East Asia. In
addition, data and methodological issues raise questions about the reliability of poverty
statistics. Beyond data issues, the limited poverty reduction experienced over the past
two decades can be explained by high population growth among the poor; low factor
productivity; frequent and severe natural disasters; persistent conflicts in parts of the
country; and the resilient dominance of various families, who deter necessary reforms
for deepening democracy and creating a sustainable social market economy.

The Philippines’ engagement with the Bank Group is ongoing and adapting to the
country’s immediate and long-term needs. Since the 1980s, the Bank Group has tried to
help the authorities improve governance and increase fiscal space issues, but efforts
have not been successful. The country has been constrained by stop and go cycles in
reforms.
Moving forward, the Bank Group’s role, according to the latest Country Assistance
Strategy, will need to focus on improvements in governance. Analytical and advisory
activity will likely remain at the heart of the program, because as the economy
continues to grow, lending will be less significant and advisory work more relevant.
The Bank Group is expected to be more selective and strategic, in order to avoid overly
ambitious programs that may be difficult to implement.
Broad Conclusions
World Bank Group support for transformative country-level changes depended to a
large extent on countries’ own initiatives and political commitment to transformative
growth and development and the quality of the Bank Group’s policy advice and
analytical work on identification and removal of the major binding constraints to
growth and development.

The reviews suggest that World Bank Group support for growth, poverty reduction,
and social progress made positive contributions but to varying degrees in these
countries. Except for a small number of cases, client countries generally responded
positively to World Bank Group efforts, which largely focused on inclusive growth and
poverty reduction, taking advantage of the institution’s technical expertise and cross-
country experience where relevant. That said, only the successful transformational cases
(in this study, Mozambique, Peru, Poland, Rwanda, and Vietnam, as well as a few other
successful long-term strategic clients, such as Chile, China, and Korea, whose
experiences are briefly reviewed in this study) appear to have truly benefited from the
Bank Group’s lending and nonlending services. A key to the Bank Group’s success in
these countries was being ahead of the curve and changing its support and the mix of
the services it provided in line with these countries’ changing needs. Getting stuck in a
business as usual mode could inadvertently contribute to countries falling into the so-
called middle-income trap.

In this context, important lessons could also be drawn from the Bank’s transformational
engagements in highly successful clients of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, such as Chile,
China, and Korea. In each of these countries, the Bank’s support contributed to far-
reaching changes or help client countries shift to a higher and/or more sustainable
development path. The assistance programs entailed partnerships in which the Bank
Group played a leading or supporting role. In all three countries, Bank assistance has
evolved to meet their changing economic circumstances and development needs. The
Bank often made critical initial contributions in these successful transformation cases
through research and technical assistance to introduce basic economic reforms, modern
project management methodologies, new technologies, international procurement and
competitive bidding, and then later shifted its assistance to help with institutional
reforms and knowledge transfer.

provided substantial support in recent years.

 In 2000 (when the World Development Report was published), about half of the world’s 6 billion people
were living on less than $2 (PPP) a day, with limited access to education and health care; lack of political
power and voice; and extreme vulnerability to ill health, economic dislocation, personal violence, and
natural disasters.
3In addition, brief reviews were conducted for three of the Bank Group’s clients with long-term
engagements that have had highly successful and transformative development outcomes over the last
three decades, Chile and Korea (Republic of), which have achieved high-income status in recent years,
and China, which has had one of the most successful growth and poverty reduction strategies among all
developing countries in the last three decades, moving from the low-income category to the upper-
middle-income category.
