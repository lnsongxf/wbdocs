THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
                                                               Region: East Asia & Pacific

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 52,772

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 137*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the

        Submit application to Marshalls Energy Company and await
        estimate

        The owner of the building and the land owner submit an application to
        the Marshalls Energy Company. There are no documents to be attached
        to the application. The customer does not have to include any particular
        document to identify the location of the warehouse. He just has to
        provide a general description.

        The application for the connection includes the supply contract details so
        it is all in one form and the supply contract is not signed separately.

        The utility is in charge of designing the external connection works.

        Once the application is submitted the customer has to wait for an
        estimate of connection fees which takes approximately one week. There
        is no legal time limit associated with the wait period for the estimate.
        The connection contract is signed upon payment of the estimate.

      * Receive external site inspection by utility for preparing estimate

      Marshalls Energy Company inspects the site before it issues an estimate.
      Someone from the applicant’s party is required to be present during the
      inspection.

      Await completion of external works by utility

      If material is available the works take 5 calendar days. If material is not
      available the works take 6-8 months. The materials are not available in
      more than 50% of the cases. Usually transformers are not available and
      if out of stock there is a 16 week lead time then another 6 to 8 weeks in
      shipping and receiving.

      The utility is in charge of the works from its grid and for the installation
      of the transformer and a meter. An electrical contractor is in charge of
      the works from the meter to the warehouse. The utility would also take
      charge of ordering the transformer.

      From pole to transformer with meter on the transformer is free for the
      customer. So transformer is not paid by the customer but by the utility. 52 calendar days             USD 30,000
3
      Sometimes customer can purchase the transformer if they can afford it.
      The trade off is if the customer can afford a transformer they can get it
      much faster but if they want to get it for free from the utility they have to
      wait for a long for it to be ordered. In this procedure the option when
      the customer pays for the materials and hence waits less time is
      recorded.

      From the meter to the building is at customer’s expense.

      The utility installs the meter during the connection works. Meter
      installation cost is included in the application fee.

        The utility will do some basic inspection and tests of the completed
        wiring and if it fails these tests, power connection will be refused until it
        passes those tests. The utility will do grounding checks and MEGA the
        system then do a general walk through. Anything considered unsafe
        must be repaired.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
