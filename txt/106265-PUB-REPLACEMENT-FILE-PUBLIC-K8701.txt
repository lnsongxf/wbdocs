  Actions in “nutrition-sensitive”         Protection Programs, convened by SecureNutrition
 sectors will be additional critical       and the Russian Federation, brought together 150
components of any global strategy          donors, implementers, and country leaders to identify

   to eliminate undernutrition             tion agendas. This background paper served as a
   (Ruel and Alderman 2013).               springboard for discussion at the Global Forum, and
                                           represents a synthesis of evidence from nearly 120 ref-
                                           erences with a heavy focus on program evaluations.
               Other documents from the Global Forum include a compendium of 21 case
               studies, and a conference report that identifies key learnings and gaps in the
               nutrition-sensitive social protection agenda. Each of these resources will be
               available on http://www.securenutrition.org by summer of 2016.
                  The reach of social protection programs has grown extensively since the
               1980s. Recent World Bank estimates show 64 countries running conditional
               cash transfers as opposed to only two in 1997 and the rapid doubling of coun-
               tries in Africa implementing unconditional cash transfers—from 20 to 40 in
               just the last five years. In total, nearly 2 billion people were enrolled in safety
               net programs as of 2015.
                  These numbers indicate not just the reach of social protection program-
               ming but also their continued expansion over a relatively short period.
               Collectively, such programs show an evolution toward increasing opportunity
               and resilience among low-income households, striving for impacts on con-
               sumption, acquisition of human capital, participation in economic growth,
               and social equity.
                  The net result is a common platform across nearly all countries that includes
               a suite of well-defined instruments, up to 33 percent of low- and middle-­
               income country development budgets, and an orientation toward targeting
               and reaching vulnerable households. Of particular interest in this paper is the
               subset of investments that look to enhance human capital through nutrition.
               These investments capitalize in different ways on the instruments, budgeting,
               and targeting not available through nutrition-specific programs alone.
                  The focus on vulnerable families in particular lends social protection
               ­
               programs a natural nutrition-sensitive lens. Several conceptual pathways link
               these two sectors, including:
               ➤➤ Increasing income through cash transfers and labor programs
               ➤➤ Providing subsidies and price supports
               ➤➤ Addressing preferences and behaviors.
                 These pathways are laid out in figure 1, providing a unified view of targeting,
               social protection program types, intermediate steps, and general nutrition
               outcomes.
                 This paper finds that social protection transfers tend to increase household
               budget devoted to food—often more than other income sources—and

highlights evidence that transfers can change diet composition and quality.
At the same time, the overall effects of income on nutrition outcomes are not
clear and vary by country experience and across studies. In general, it appears
that both conditional and unconditional cash transfers have not delivered
improvements in nutrition commensurate with their success in addressing
poverty.
   Price subsidies and in-kind assistance have complex interactions on both
markets and on purchasing decisions. However, many governments have explicit
goals to encourage food expenditures, and therefore these approaches remain
attractive in such settings. Evidence reviewed in this paper indicates that subsi-
dies on fortified foods can have positive nutritional effects, and that in-kind
transfers may limit food deficits during periods of currency or price volatility.
   The merits of conditional cash transfers (CCT) versus unconditional cash
transfers (UCT) on nutrition are difficult to determine because few direct
comparisons exist outside of the education sector. This paper does find that
UCTs as well as CCTs virtually always augment household food consump-
tion, diet diversity, and participation in preventive health care. CCTs may
have a greater effect on health seeking but the quality of services implicated in
conditionalities must be considered, and service use does not always translate
into health or nutrition outcomes.
   School feedings are widespread in-kind programs that can be viewed as
conditional on school attendance, estimated to reach 375 million children
annually at a cost of $75 billion. The evidence reviewed indicates weight gain
is a common outcome, with some programs seeing positive effects on house-
hold food security, sibling nutrition, and student attendance and/or learning.
But many opportunities remain to increase nutrition sensitivity, such as more
widespread micronutrient fortification with iron and folate and consistent
links to school curricula and national messaging on diets.

  Finally, behavior change and social marketing are avenues to more
nutrition-sensitive programming. In the context of social protection these
­
appear most often in transfer programs and to a lesser extent in public
works programs. Evidence indicates that knowledge of proper hygiene and
feeding practices does not necessarily increase alongside purchasing power,
hence the rationale to specifically encourage or program behavioral change
communication.
  As SecureNutrition continues to focus on the operational links between
nutrition and social protection, this paper will serve as a key reference point in
conjunction with seminars on the same topic. More information and resources

The Case for Nutrition-
Sensitive Social Protection
A recent review by the Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimated
that scaling up 10 proven effective nutrition-specific interventions1 to cover
90 percent of children in the world’s most malnourished countries would
diminish stunting globally only by 20 percent and decrease child deaths in
those countries by 15 percent—that is, program expansion could reduce
all child deaths attributed to malnutrition by a third
(Bhutta et al. 2013). Although this result is apprecia-
ble and appreciated, it does not go far enough.                  Social protection is a key

food security, adequate caregiving resources at the
maternal, household, and community levels, access to
health services, and a safe and hygienic environment—
and that incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Social protection is a
key element of any nutrition-sensitive investment as it is inherently nutrition-
sensitive through its targeting to families at risk of malnutrition. This feature,
along with the scale of social protection budgets, fosters the potential for
addressing underlying determinants of malnutrition.
   Taking many of these aspects into account, this paper includes an indicative
conceptual pathway that links targeting, social protection program types, inter-
mediate steps, and general nutrition outcomes (figure 1). Before elaborating
this point, however, it is important to understand the social protection land-
scape created by country governments.

                                              Social protection programs are dynamic components of the budgets of most
                                              countries. As depicted in figure 2, the share of government expenditures

                                              people were enrolled in social safety net programs in 136 countries (World
                                              Bank n.d). Cash transfers alone have been credited as supporting between
                                              0.75 billion and 1.0 billion people in low- and middle-income countries at the
                                              end of the first decade in this century (DFID 2011). More than a quarter of
                                              the rural poor and roughly a fifth of the poor in urban areas received some
                                              cash assistance. Two countries had introduced conditional cash programs in

                                              programs were run as pilots or otherwise localized projects. The number of
                                              countries in Africa with unconditional cash transfers doubled from 20 to 40
                                              between 2010 and 2015 (World Bank 2015a).

                                              of policies and programs to increase opportunity and enhance resilience to
                                              economic and natural shocks. Noncontributory transfers or safety nets—also
                                              termed social assistance in many settings—are a subset of the larger set of

programs that can be classified as social insurance, including contributory
pensions and unemployment assistance. Both of these categories can be eval-
uated in terms of their role in increasing current consumption of low-income
households and others facing economic setbacks. In so doing they contribute
to poverty reduction and improve social equity. They can also be appraised in
regard to their contribution to facilitating the poor in
acquiring the capital necessary to move beyond pov-
erty and thereby participate in economic growth. A           . . . the principal motivation

this study looks at the larger set of objectives of social
protection.


How Much Is Spent and for Whom?
Although the focus of this paper is the relationship between social protection
and nutrition, it is important to keep in mind that although often a govern-
ment or donor seeks to achieve a greater impact on nutrition from these
investments in social protection, the principal motivation for most transfer
programs is poverty reduction. Thus, before addressing nutrition sensitivity it
is useful to first review the effectiveness of transfers on poverty alleviation.
   Globally, social protection spending increases at a rate faster than an econ-
omy grows. Low-income countries devote 1.5 percent of gross national product
(GNP) to safety net programs, middle-income countries spend 1.6 percent of
their somewhat larger economies, and high-income countries spend 1.9 percent
(World Bank 2015a). While there are a range of program redundancies as well
as lacunas in coverage, the net impact of such spending on poverty reduction is

6	            Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary
                       appreciable. One study concludes that by 2013 between 136 million and
                       165 ­million people were lifted out of extreme poverty—defined as consumption
                       of less than $1.25 per person per day—with the assistance of transfer programs
                       (Fiszbein, Kanbur and Yemtsov 2014). This finding, however, masks an impor-
                       tant heterogeneity. With smaller shares of their smaller resources and larger
                       numbers of poor households, low-income countries are hard pressed to achieve
                       substantial reductions in poverty through social protection programs.


                       The Poverty Gap
                       As indicated in tables 1 and 2, low-income countries are not able to mobilize
                       enough resources—both in terms of cash and in the capacity to deliver assis-
                       tance to the poorest families—to close the gap between existing consumption
                       patterns and the poverty line at $1.25 per person per day. Middle-income
                       countries, even countries in the less prosperous subcategory of this group are,
                       however, often capable to make progress in this area. Targeted transfers are
                       more successful in reducing poverty than are elements of social insurance.

Moreover, in 23 countries, even in some comparatively well-off nations, social
insurance payments are regressive. That is, pensions and unemployment
insurance increase the Gini index of inequality, even though these payments
also reduce poverty in many countries.
   South Africa has achieved the largest proportional reduction in poverty
with social assistance. Their combination of noncontributory pensions and
child grants as well as the resources that an upper-middle-income country
with a high priority to social assistance can bring to bear leads to more than a
70 percent reduction in the poverty gap in 2005. Countries in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia also manage sizable reductions in poverty—often above
50  percent—as well as reductions in inequality through social insurance.
Many of these countries are former socialist economies, but Turkey has also
reduced poverty appreciably; the proportional reduction in poverty in that
country rose from 48 percent in 2004 to 55 percent in 2012.
   Overall, with a combination of social assistance and social insurance, low-­
income countries manage to close 18 percent of the poverty gap, and lower-­
middle-income countries achieve a 36 percent reduction. Upper-middle and
upper-income countries manage to close their poverty gaps by 53 percent and
79 percent, respectively (World Bank n.d.). Reducing the poverty gap, how-
ever, is not the same as reducing the number of poor, that is, headcount p­ overty.
The former values transfers to any recipient below the poverty line while the
latter—focusing on facilitating crossing the poverty line—emphasizes only
those immediately below the line. Africa is at a particular disadvantage with
regard to poverty reduction; less than 1 percent of Africans move beyond pov-
erty as a result of transfers while more than 10 percent of the population in
Eastern Europe does.2 Moreover, low- and lower-middle-income countries do
not reduce inequality appreciably with these programs; on average they reduce
the Gini measure of income inequality only by 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent,
respectively. In ­contrast, upper-middle and upper-income countries are more
successful in reducing the measure of inequality. For the former the reduction
is 7.3 percent, and for the latter it is 24.9 percent.
   As illustrated in figure 4, however, there is not a close relationship between
safety net spending and success in poverty reduction. The figure ranks countries
in order of the share of GNP allocated to social assistance and illustrates that
some countries—for example, South Africa—can make significant reduction in
headcount poverty with a relatively modest allocation of national resources
while others devote far more of GNP and have little to show in terms of poverty
reduction. The absence of a clear relationship between spending and poverty
reduction points to the importance of how resources are spent as much as how
much is expended.
   At all levels of national income, transfers achieve larger proportional reduc-
tion in poverty gaps in urban areas than in rural. For example, the gap is
reduced by 16.9 percent in urban areas of low-income countries but only
by 7.2 percent among the rural population.3 The corresponding averages are
35.9 and 18.1 for lower-middle-income countries and 49.6 and 35.5 for
upper-middle-income countries. In all groups of countries the per capita
transfers in urban areas exceed that in rural areas. In both groups of

              middle-­ income countries the share of the poorest quintile receiving transfers
              in rural areas exceeds the share in urban. The opposite is the case in the poor-
              est countries. Thus, by this criteria, poor countries are somewhat more likely
              to address errors of exclusion.
                 Two additional points are important to conclude this section. First, the
              relatively modest impact of transfers on poverty reduction in low-income
              ­
              countries is not due to poor identification of households in need. Indeed,
              Fiszbein, Kanbur and Yemtsov (2014) find that low-income countries are
              more effective at targeting than lower-middle-income countries, which are, in
              turn, more effective than upper-income countries.4 Thus, the primary con-
              straint to greater impact on poverty in low-income countries appears to be
                                        the budget that can be mobilized. This  observation
                                        can be viewed as a tautology: Poor countries would

                                           A standard economic model of the production of health can illustrate how
                                           social protection can address the underlying determinants of malnutrition.
                                              Figure 5 shows indicative pathways whereby nutritionally vulnerable pop-
                                           ulations can be targeted through social protection programs. The programs’
                                           effects on factors such as income, prices, and household behaviors change the
                                           degree to which families choose to invest in health and how they do it. Broader
                                           social norms and values will influence this decision making, as will available
                                           technology and services that promote health and the skills of households in
                                           applying them. This model is fully compatible with another useful heuristic
                                           view of nutrition that presents it as an outcome of food security, health, sani-
                                           tation, and care, with the role of income and prices serving to determine the
                                           level of food and health that is obtained (appendix A).
                                              This paper will first discuss the evidence on the impact of transfers on
                                           nutrition via the income pathway. Subsequent sections will discuss pathways
                                           mediated by price changes and by influences and behavior at the household
                                           level.

                                           A household that receives one dollar in transfers should increase consumption
                                           plus savings by virtually the same amount. Indeed, to a fair degree this is merely
                                           an accounting exercise, and it is surprising that many impact evaluations report
                                           this as a key finding. There is a possibility, however, that the availability of

  Box 1  Social Protection and Obesity
  The programs reviewed in this paper are designed to transfer income to low-income families and
  generally are expected to contribute to reductions in undernutrition by increasing purchasing
  power, either through increasing income or decreasing food prices. But, in fact, the poor are also
  at risk of overweight/obesity, and low birth weight and stunting are associated with increased
  body mass indices (BMI) and chronic illness. Indeed, a recent review of obesity poses the ­question
  as to whether the problem is “overweight or underheight?” (Lobstein et al. 2015).

  In the short run, however, transfer programs can exacerbate overnutrition while aiming to reduce
  undernutrition. For example, Fernald, Gertler, and Hou (2009) found that Oportunidades, the
  successor to PROGRESA, led to higher BMI as well as higher blood pressure. Forde et al. (2012)
  found a similar risk for BMI in Colombia’s transfer program. The one study that assessed whether
  in-kind distribution had a different impact on obesity than cash—in this case, in a study of
  women in the same Mexican program studied by Cunha, de Giorgi, and Jayachandran (2011)—
  found that both forms of support led to increased weight gain relative to the control group with
  no significant difference (Leroy et al. 2013).



a transfer will reduce nontransfer income due to either changes in remittances
or changes in labor allocation. Regarding the former, a number of studies doc-
ument that public transfers partially crowd out private transfers (Jensen 2004;
Cox, Hansen, and Jimenez 2004). Factors that influence private transfers
include migration of family members as well as the timing of transitory shocks.
Clearly, only elderly who receive remittances from children can have these par-
tially crowded out by a social pension. This association can be incorporated
into targeting criteria.
   The converse—the possibility that an individual receiving a transfer may
pass some of the assistance to other family members or to neighbors—is
also potentially important for policy. In both cases, the indirect effect of
transfers on the linked household may be a second-round effect of the
transfer on poverty reduction if the linked household is also poor or has
malnourished members. This pass-through has been an issue in the design
of transfers to caregivers of orphans, who are often—albeit not always—at
heightened risk of undernutrition. In principal coresidency is not necessary
for a transfer to one individual to be shared with
another. In practice shared custody strengthens                  While this result clearly

and middle-­  income countries such a priority may

crowd out funds for younger children, which is an important consideration—
given 1,000 days window of opportunity—if long-term health and develop-
ment outcomes are a priority. Duflo found that pensions only received by
women had a significant impact on the nutritional status of their grandchil-
dren, and no impact was found for relatives of male pensioners. This result
clearly supports the view that women and men have different patterns of
investment, but it does not imply that a pension transfer is necessarily a good
vehicle for improving child nutrition.
   In fact, only 46 percent of pensioners—either male or female—lived with
their grandchildren, and the positive nutritional impact was observed only if
the woman’s grandchild was a girl. Thus, a child grant will have a different
impact on income growth than old age pensions. An old age pension will
support consumption, but a child grant will also support investment at a
greater rate. South Africa has proven to be able to afford both transfer pro-
grams at meaningful levels; other countries, however, may have to confront
the difficult choice of prioritization of recipient groups head-on.
   Evidence on the impact of transfers on labor supply is also often misap-
plied and taken out of context. While economists generally consider welfare
to include both the consumption of leisure and goods, governments gener-
ally are uncomfortable with increases in the former prompted by transfer
programs. This discomfort may be due to political economy reasons for sup-
port for programs, which may be greater if the poor increase rather than
reduce their effort. Often the concern is about withdrawal from the active
labor force rather than a marginal increase in leisure by individuals working
nearly full time.
   Reductions in overall adult labor supply attributable to safety nets are
minor (Alderman and Yemtsov 2014; Grosh et al. 2008).5 The mispercep-
tion that social assistance has an appreciable effect on labor earnings may
reflect the fact that unemployment insurance programs sometimes do
increase the duration of unemployment and of search efforts by recipients
(Sanchez-Parramo 2002; van Ours and Vodopivec 2006). However, extrap-
olation of this evidence on social insurance to noncontributory transfer
programs is not generally warranted. Social insurance programs are often
relatively generous compared to social assistance. For example, social insur-
ance programs, such as those common in Eastern Europe in transition to
market economies, have provided support up to 100 percent of formal sec-
tor wages over long periods of time, years in some cases. In contrast, other
transfer programs are generally less than half of a poverty line income—
often far less—and thus not capable of supporting a family without addi-
tional employment.
   Labor may, however, be reallocated as an indirect consequence of the tar-
geting criteria for a safety net. De Brauw et al. (2015) note that even though
Brazil’s cash transfer, Bolsa Familia, had no disincentive effects on aggregate
labor supply, it did prompt a reallocation from formal sector employment to
informal activities, presumably as the latter were not a focus of means testing.
How this affects long-term poverty alleviation and growth depends on the
relative productivity in the sectors.

   To summarize the evidence of the net impact of transfers on expenditures:
there may be a small and localized reduction in income due to transfers, but
few reductions in income due to labor reallocation. Set against these modest
potential reductions, there are often increases in income, particularly in agri-
culture, due to relaxing credit constraints (Sadoulet, de Janvry, and Davis
2001) and, over a longer term, increased capital investments (Hoddinott et al.
2012) and protection from disinvestments due to shocks.6 Therefore, although
heterogeneous effects need to be monitored, there is little worry that safety
nets are generally a disincentive on earnings.
   Assuming, then, an increase of overall expenditures—earned plus unearned
income—proportional to the transfer, what is the expected impact of the
added resources on nutrition? Society often does not value all consumption
equally. Public statements on transfer programs often indicate that govern-
ments implicitly or explicitly value certain forms of household consumption
by their recipients differently than they do other choices. In particular, from
the perspective of nutrition-sensitive safety nets, there is an interest in pro-
moting the consumption of high-quality food and in investments in health.
   Given the plethora of household data sets to which can be applied more
than 50 years of research on measuring income elasticities, the impact of a
cash transfer on expenditures can be well estimated even in the absence of a
formal controlled study. But the question of interest
is not whether food consumption goes up; that is cer-           [T]he question of interest
tain. Rather, the question of interest for food and
nutrition policy is whether the increased purchases
                                                              for food and nutrition policy
after receiving a transfer are greater than the expected         is whether the increased
increase of purchases at that income level based on            purchases after receiving a
general income.7
                                                              transfer are greater than the
   This question is often answered with a yes. That is,
in many programs the availability of a food-oriented         expected increase of purchases
transfer—even one that provides cash but is per-              at that income level based on
ceived as linked to food security—nudges consumers                   general income.
to increase the share of their additional budget
devoted to food. For example, cash transfers in
Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Nicaragua led to more expenditures on food
and health than was observed with increases in general sources of income
even when the programs were only indirectly linked to nutrition and health
(Attanasio, Battistin, and Mesnard 2012). Similar findings have been noted in
studies of the food stamp program in the United States (Breunig and Dasgupta
2005), indicative of how developed countries make use of nutrition-oriented
social protection programs; in the United States, these include the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC).
   This heightened impact may be an example of labeling (Kooreman 2000) by
which participation in a program influences households’ spending patterns
either latently or explicitly with social marketing. Other studies attribute
changes in expenditure patterns to a combination of gender ­     control—many
transfer programs earmark women as recipients (Haddad, Hoddinott, and

14	       Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary
             Alderman 1997; Duflo 2003). For example, Angelucci and Attanasio (2013)
             conclude that handing transfers to women likely accounts for the observed
             changes in food consumption.
                Increases in expenditures on food are generally larger than the propor-
             tional increase in quantities of food. Most studies find that the proportional
             increase in calories with respect to income (calorie elasticity) to be smaller
             than the elasticity of total food expenditures (Behrman and Deolalikar 1987;
             Subramanian and Deaton 1996). A rough rule of thumb is that in low-income
             settings, food expenditure elasticities are approximately twice the calorie elas-
             ticity. The difference between these two measurements is an indication of
             both changes in diet composition and in quality.
                However, food security is not identical to nutrition security, and neither
             food expenditures nor calorie elasticities are sufficient indicators of changes
             in inputs to nutrition mediated by income. Other factors that contribute to
             nutrition status, such as access to care as well as water and sanitation, may
             also respond to changes in household income or expenditures. Therefore, it is
             instructive to look at the degree to which anthropometric indicators of nutri-
             tional status respond to changes expenditures.
                For example, Ruel and Alderman (2013) indicate that a 10 percent
             growth of GNP results in nearly a 10 percent decline in poverty but only a
             5.9 percent decline in stunting, an estimate close to the 6.3 percent reported
             in Smith and Haddad (2015). Similar cross-country estimates indicate that
             severe anemia among children, defined as hemoglobin below 7 g/dL, declines
             at 9 percent with 10 percent income growth although the decline for mother
             was smaller at 6.5 percent (Alderman and Linnemayr 2009). Anemia defined
             as hemoglobin levels below 10.9 grams per deciliter (g/dL) declines at a
             slower rate; improving income by 10 percent would decrease child anemia by
             only 2.4 percent (and maternal anemia by 1.8 percent). These results can be
             triangulated using household data. Haddad et al. (2003) found that the
             Millennium Development Goals indicator of rates of underweight children
             less than five years old declined at half the rate that GDP grew based on the
             average of 12 household surveys, all of which were collected in the 1990s.
             The household data, then, show a nutritional response to income similar to
             the data across countries.
                These and similar results have been used to argue that countries should not
             expect income growth alone to solve malnutrition in a generation (Alderman
             2010).8 New results are consistent with that conclusion; indeed,  such data
             seem to point to reductions in stunting of 6 percent with a 10 percent increase
                                       in income as an upper range of expectations for the
                                       impact of transfer programs. The motivation for

 countries should not expect           results. Smith and Haddad (2015) indicate that when

decline in stunting. They point out that these smaller elasticities are in keep-
ing with some other estimates in the literature and ­suggest that the differences
reflect long- and short-term response.
   Furthermore, while South Asia has had robust income growth in recent
years, the region has not been able to translate that growth into reduction in
stunting consistent with the estimates from data across countries. For exam-
ple, India with the largest number of malnourished children in the world and
a rapidly growing economy, appears to have a smaller than average improve-
ment in nutrition with its growth. Even Bangladesh, which has one of the most
rapid reductions in stunting in recent years, might have expected greater than
the 20 percent reduction between 1997 and 2011,
a period when income per capita roughly doubled.9
                                                                    …both conditional cash
   More central to this review is that studies of both

and to encourage increased utilization of health ser-
vices (Ranganathan and Lagarde 2012; Haines and
Palmer 2007; Gaarder, Glassman, and Palmer 2010), on average the impact of
CCTs and UCTs on anthropometric measures of nutritional status is small
(Ruel and Alderman 2013; Manley, Gitter and Slavchevska 2013). Similarly, a
significant reduction in anemia was found in only one of the three country
programs reviewed by Leroy, Ruel, and Verhofstadt (2009). De Groot et al.
(2015), using a less restrictive filter to review cash transfers than Manley,
Gitter and Slavchevska or Ruel and Alderman, do find some limited success
in improving nutrition with transfer programs but reach similar conclusions
as to the limitations and the reasons for them as in the current review.
   There are various possible reasons for the limited path from social assis-
tance to nutritional outcomes. Foremost among them is that poverty target-
ing does not necessarily have a nutrition focus. Much of the research on CCTs
has been from countries in Latin America where the prevalence of stunting is
far less than in Africa or South Asia. Moreover, a share of social assistance is
targeted to poor households with few if any young children, for example, old
age pensions as well as support to school-age children.
   Even when social assistance programs have a young child orientation, the
transfers are not necessarily targeted to households with children in the most
vulnerable 1,000 day period from conception to a child’s second birthday;
that is, eligibility does not always align with the time of greatest growth veloc-
ity. This may dilute the actual response and, further, mask measured results.
For example, Linnemayr and Alderman (2011) find an insignificant impact of
a randomized trial—albeit not a cash transfer—when children 0 to 5 years are
measured but a statistically significant impact when one focuses on the
younger children only.10 In addition, as mentioned, estimated elasticities from

               cross-country or cross-sectional household data may obscure the time frame
               and provide an overly optimistic expectation for the impact of the increased
               household resources.



               Subsidies, Quotas, Prices, and Conditions
               Until relatively recently, governments were as—or more—likely to support
               consumption by low-income households through price supports and in-kind
               transfers than through cash assistance. A range of motives coincided in this
               policy preference (Pinstrup-Andersen 1988). For example, subsidies and
               in-kind transfers can be a practical means to offset producer price subsidies
               and procurement policies or—as in past years—to recycle food aid.11
                  More central to the issue of nutrition-sensitive social protection is that
               despite the well-known economic argument favoring income transfers as
               less distortive of preferences than price subsidies or in-kind assistance, many
               governments actually have explicit goals of encouraging increased expendi-
               tures on food. However, to have a price subsidy influence the amount of
               subsidized food that is purchased, it is necessary that (1) there is no restric-
               tion on the amount purchased, or (2) any quota on subsidized allowance is
               greater than the amount that would have been purchased in the absence of
               the program.
                  If the subsidized quota is smaller than what the consumer would have pur-
               chased at unsubsidized prices, the subsidy acts only as an income transfer;
               the open market price, not the lower subsidized price, determines the house-
               hold’s decision of how much to purchase. This restricted transfer is referred
               to as an inframarginal support. The value to the consumer is equal to the
               quota multiplied the difference between the subsidized price and the open
               market price.
                  There are natural barriers to the nutritional impacts of a price subsidy. Even
               if there is no quota on the amount a household can purchase the income sup-
               port provided via a price subsidy is based on budget share to the subsidized
               commodity. Commodities with relatively large shares of a household budget
               tend to be price inelastic; that is, they are commodities for which a lower price
               does not induce a major change in the commodity consumed.12 When there
               are close substitutes for a subsidized commodity, the net impact on diet is
               complex. Although a lower price on a good can lead to increased consump-
               tion of that item, it may also induce a partially compensating reduction in
               another good. Thus, the net impact of a subsidy on total energy, protein, or
               vitamin consumption is indeterminate (Pitt 1983).
                  Lower prices on basic grains in China and India have been shown to have
                                         little impact on net energy consumption, in the latter

maize in South Africa increased calories from that grain as well as bread and
beans (Alderman and del Ninno 1999).
   Until recent improvements in the technology for cash transfers became
widespread (and for the targeting that is necessary in any cash-based sup-
port), price subsidies had some administrative advantages. Generalized price
subsidies could in some circumstances be applied at the point of import
through dual exchange rates or indirectly financed through taxes on produc-
ers by means of mandatory procurement quotas. The incidence of transfers
on generalized untargeted food subsidies, however, is often regressive.13 Even
consumption of staples such as grains and pulses generally increase as incomes
go up so that the total expenditure on subsides is higher in upper-income
groups in absolute terms even if the support is higher as a share of the expen-
ditures of the poor. For commodities such as milk and oil, the share relative to
the income of the rich may even be higher than the corresponding share for
the poor. Only a few commodities—such as maize flour in South Africa or
certain grades of flour in the Arab Republic of Egypt—are self-­   targeted such
that a subsidy on that good is progressive, and these subsidies generally trans-
fer only a small amount of purchasing power (Alderman and Lindert 1998)
and thus provide little direct impact on food nutrition through an income
pathway.
   Often there are quotas on the amount of a commodity that can be pur-
chased at a subsidized price. In contrast to generalized subsidies marketed
extensively, quotas are often distributed through specialized shops, either
government administered outlets or privately owned licensed retailers.
Generally when quotas are in place there is a legal open market from which a
consumer can obtain additional amounts of the food at a higher price.
This two-tier market sets up an incentive for diverting grain from the quota to
the higher priced open market (Alderman 1988; Mehta and Jha 2014).
Although such sales are sometimes termed “back door sales,” they may occur
at the wholesale or warehouse level as well as from retail outlets. Clearly, such
diversion of subsidies will result in large share of the budget allocated to
subsidies having no impact on the poor.

Cash versus In-Kind Transfers
There is little conceptual difference between the marketing of subsidized
goods on quota and free distribution in-kind. The motivation for either mode
of delivery is often similar, and the need for government involvement in trans-
port and storage, at least at the wholesale level, is similar. With the expansion
of cash transfers, there has been a renewed interest in comparing this mode of
assistance to the alternative of in-kind support in order to ascertain both the
difference in consumer behavior and in the costs of different programs.
   One general difference between administering cash transfers and in-kind
support is that the former is less costly to deliver than food. For example, four
randomized trials supported by the World Food Program found that it cost
roughly $3 per cash transfer, while the cost per food transfer of equivalent value
was two to four times as large (Gentilini 2016; Margolies and Hoddinott 2015;

                                       Hidrobo et al. 2014). Moreover, increasing the value of

 and in-kind support is that           markedly with value.14 This is not the case with food.

      deliver than food.               could have been reached if the food transfers were in
                                       cash instead. Additionally, Margolies and Hoddinott
                                       (2015) note that depending on the location of the dis-
            tribution sites, some costs are shifted from the government to consumers for
            waiting and for transport.
               The impact of market performance has been a perennial theme of studies of
            food assistance. If markets are well connected, targeted in-kind assistance is
            unlikely to affect the price of traded commodities, nor would additional cash
            put pressure on local market prices. This is an issue for producers as well as
            consumers; farm gate prices are less likely to be depressed with food transfers
            when markets are integrated.
               Similarly, market integration and inexpensive transportation implies that
            local purchases have little impact on the revenue that a producer receives at
            the farm gate; in such cases prices are determined by a wider market than the
            local catchment. The converse is also true: tertiary markets may be sensitive
            to changes in local demand. For example, in a randomized trial in communi-
            ties in Mexico that were too remote to be included in the national cash trans-
            fer program, PROGRESA, Cunha, de Giorgi, and Jayachandran (2011) found
            that cash transfers led to higher prices locally and a purchasing power loss for
            program participants amounting to 11 percent relative to those who received
            an in-kind transfer of similar value. In this case the commodities offered were
            largely processed food items and, perhaps, less competitively marketed in
            these communities than basic grains.15 Other randomized trials such as that
            of Aker et al. (2011) have not found cash transfers to inflate grain prices.16
               Studies already noted (Gentilini 2015; Margolies and Hoddinott 2015;
            Hidrobo et al. 2014) also collectively point to a few differences in the response
            of consumers with cash generally leading to greater diet diversity but not nec-
            essarily more calories consumed. These differences were highly dependent on
            context, including the availability of seasonal storage and the degree of mar-
            ket integration. Regarding the former, although in general, cash allows for
            greater diet diversification, in Niger during a seasonal hunger gap households
            receiving food resorted to fewer harmful coping strategies and had higher
            measures of food security and dietary diversity compared to households
            receiving cash. In this particular example, households receiving cash spent
            significantly more on purchases of bulk grains (in part to protect against sea-
            sonal price increases) and on repairing their households as well as on agricul-
            tural inputs (Hoddinott, Sandstrom, and Upton 2014).
               Cunha (2014) observes that most of the 10 commodities in the in-kind
            distribution program in Mexico substituted for similar goods that would
            otherwise have been purchased. Nevertheless, the i

increase costs appreciably. For example, in Gujarat,
India, iron fortified flour was substituted for wheat
grain in the public distribution system with marked improvement in iron
intakes at an incremental cost of only $0.48 per ton (Fiedler et al. 2012).
School feeding programs also have this capacity.
   Another logistical advantage of in-kind programs is that the items distrib-
uted retain their real value in the face of price fluctuations and inflation. To be
sure, cash transfers can be adjusted administratively, as Brazil did when prices
rose rapidly in 2008, but doing so depends on an executive decision—one that
is awkward to reverse if food prices retreat. In contrast, in-kind transfers are
intrinsically protected from devaluation. Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux
(2010) documented the extensive temporal and spatial differences in the
value of cash and in-kind public-work wages in Ethiopia between 2006 and
2008, a period of extensive food price volatility. Although the authors did not
track these differences on their impact on nutrition, they did show that par-
ticipants who received wages wholly or partially as food reduced their food
deficits more than those who received wages in cash, despite an increase in
nominal cash wages in 2008.

Giles and Satriawan (2015) illustrate a potential for in-kind distribution in a financial emergency.
They showed that supplementary feeding provided to children 6 to 60 months old by the govern-

old but did not improve stunting for either younger or older children. This finding reflects both

               more retinol and zinc. The study, however, did not analyze the reasons that
               one group of participants consumed the supplements and another did not.
               Similarly, Meller and Litschig (2014) found that a conditional in-kind
               supplement in Ecuador reduced mortality.
               ­
                 It is debatable whether this type of program can be considered a nutrition-
               sensitive safety net or a nutrition-specific intervention. Nevertheless, a range
               of nutrition-specific supplementation programs have been shown to affect
               nutritional outcomes (see, for example, Hoddinott et al. 2013).


               Emergency Settings
               The core issue determining the role of in-kind distribution in a nutrition-­
               sensitive emergency response is quite similar to the central consideration in a
               nonemergency setting—much revolves around how well markets are function-
               ing. When grain can flow to areas of shortfall unhindered, famines can often be
               viewed as the consequence of limited purchasing power, rather than food
               shortages per se (Sen 1981). Still, until relatively recently, logistics as well as the
               availability of food aid favored in-kind distribution in response to a range of
               natural disasters and conflict situations. However, as with programs designed
               to address chronic poverty, the recent trend has been to respond to emergencies
               with cash assistance (Harvey 2007; Pelham, Clay, and Braunholz 2011).17
                  Whether cash or in-kind, the primary objective in emergency response is to
               provide resources to affected families, often with a broader targeting criteria
               than used for social assistance designed for chronically poor. Programs also
               seek to prevent the nonpoor from losing assets and falling into a poverty trap
               (Sumarto, Suryahadi, and Pritchett 2003). Nevertheless, it is also the case that
               short-term crises influence both mortality of children and the long-term
               health and economic prospects of survivors (Alderman, Hoddinott, and
               Kinsey 2006).
                  As emergency relief is generally designed to meet the needs of households
               rather than to meet the dietary needs of the most vulnerable children, efforts
               have been made to enhance the nutritional impacts by including: (1) micro-
               nutrient fortification of grains and fortification of vegetable oil; (2) iodized
               salt in general food deliveries; and (3) specialized nutritious products for vul-
               nerable individuals (Webb et al. 2014).

               Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary	                   21
   By including fortified blended foods, micronutrient powders, and lipid-­
based nutrient supplements (LNS)18 in the package of assistance to families,
such programs in effect use an emergency social protection response as a
platform for a nutrition-specific intervention, in keeping with one recom-
­
mendation for enhancing nutrition sensitivity (Ruel and Alderman 2013).
Evidence on the effectiveness of these various additions to standard emer-
gency response is often indirect. For example, randomized trials have been
employed to assess the cost effectiveness of LNS for treatment of acute malnu-
trition, but much of the evidence on LNS on the prevention of malnutrition
comes from seasonal shortfalls and slow onset scarcity (Webb et al. 2015;
Grellety et al. 2012; Huybregts et al. 2012).


Conditional Cash Transfers
Just as price subsidies change the cost of goods, the goal of increasing invest-
ments in human capital is often fostered by adding a requirement that the
beneficiary household participate in designated health care activities to be
eligible to receive program benefits (Fiszbein and Schady 2009). In effect, the
requirements necessary to qualify for these CCTs change the relative price of
investments while at the same time increase the overall budget envelope for
recipients. This is motivated, in part, by the assumption that poor households
underinvest relative to a social optimum (Das, Do, Özler 2005).
   Critics of CCTs sometimes argue that poor households know what they
need and if they have not made the investments it is because they are cash
constrained. From this perspective, adding conditions is an unnecessary bur-
den and one that may restrict transfers to poor households that do not have
members that qualify for the educational or early nutritional requirements.
This latter concern places the equity motive of the transfer in contrast to the
investment goal (Alderman and Yemtsov 2014). Conditional transfers,
however, may address market failures including differences in voice within
­
the household of children or women who benefit from the investments or
imperfect information on the benefits of these investments (Baird et al. 2014).
Moreover, if there are positive externalities for health investments, then the
socially optimal level of participation exceeds what the household would
choose without additional incentives.19
   The evidence indicates that CCTs virtually always

22	       Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary
              One of the few such direct comparisons concerning health care in Burkina
           Faso found that CCTs—but not UCTs—increased visits to preventive health
           services (Akresh, De Walque and Kazianga 2012). Another comparison
           from Zimbabwe also found few differences other than greater registrations
           of births with a CCT, (Robertson et al. 2013) but did not track nutritional
           outcomes. In contrast, Attanasio et al. (2015) found that conditions make a
           large difference in health facility attendance and on child health. A full pol-
           icy relevant comparison of programs should also study costs of delivery,
           including the resource costs (e.g., time allocation) that households need to
           invest to meet conditions. Thus, evidence that CCTs increase health service
           utilization at a higher rate than UCTs does not necessarily imply that they
           are a more cost-effective approach for meeting this objective. Actually, it is
           unlikely that UCTs have no element of soft conditions; that is, few transfers
           are devoid of any beliefs held by the recipient of what is expected of them in
           return for receiving the ­ transfer. Thus, most UCTs have an element of what
           has been termed labeling (Kooreman 2000) or more recently, a  nudge
           (Benhassine et al. 2013).

                                     financial resources provided to the clinics but rather

                                     to the empowerment of the recipient women, who
           demanded better services. The issue of service quality is a generic concern
           covering basic a range of health services for children as well as being relevant
           in regards to increased access to education. If, in the case of CCTs for young
           children, a household is required to have their offspring weighed and mea-
           sured, the family benefits little if this information is not then used to inform
           growth promotion and counseling.
              Service quality is, however, often the Achilles heel of CCT programs. One
           of the most common coresponsibility in CCT programs is attendance in
           growth monitoring and promotion sessions. However, it is not clear that
           growth promotion is regularly practiced at the community level. This is cru-
           cial. A comprehensive review of global experience concluded that growth
           monitoring has little or no effect on nutritional status in large-scale programs
           with weak nutrition counseling (Ashworth, Shrimpton, and Jamil 2008,
           86–117). The tendency to measure results in terms of easily quantifiable
           weighing sessions rather than in terms of counseling sessions creates risk for
           incentive structures for both the households and for the training and staffing
           of health care personnel.
              As noted, the increase service utilization observed in both CCT and UCT
           programs does not always translate to measured improvements in

nutritional outcomes. However, Rasella et al. (2013) linked CCT coverage in
Brazil with municipal mortality data using fixed-effects regression analysis
and observed that as coverage increased, under-five mortality declined.
Similarly, a drop in deaths attributed to malnutrition was associated with
the program’s availability. The analysis also accounted for the rollout of a
program to provide free community-based health care and found that the
reduction in overall mortality was greatest where both programs had wide-
spread coverage.
   In a similar study using municipal data, Barham (2011) found that
PROGRESA reduced infant mortality as program coverage increased; mor-
tality declined by 17 percent in rural areas with full coverage and by 8 percent
overall. Moreover, the subset of deaths attributed to nutritional deficiencies
was found to decline significantly even though this trend contributed less to
overall reductions in infant mortality than did the changes in intestinal infec-
tions or respiratory diseases. The study, however, did not find a statistically
significant reduction in neonatal mortality.20
   Tracking another nutritional outcome, Amarante et al. (2012) found a
15  percent to 17 percent reduction in low birth weight attributable to an
unconditional transfer program implemented in Uruguay between April 2005
and December 2007 in response to a contraction in GNP of 10 percent. The
study used administrative microdata matched to longitudinal vital statistics
on the universe of births. The authors also indicated that the transfer increased
household income by at least 25 percent, implying an income elasticity for
low birth weight of approximately −0.6. This is nearly three times the magni-
tude of the elasticity for the reduction in low birth weight (−0.228) reported
in the online appendix to Ruel and Alderman (2013). The study did not report
the attendant changes in purchases financed by this transfer or in health ser-
vices demanded, although they ruled out the possibility that the improvement
in birth weight was due to significant changes in health-seeking behavior.
They flagged both reduced stress and reduced labor supply as possible con-
tributors to the outcomes measured, implying a role of the transfer beyond
that of earned income.
   In addition, vouchers and CCTs have been used to promote utilization of
antenatal care and improve basic obstetric care (Bhutta et al. 2014). While the
principal objective of such programs is to reduce maternal and neonatal mor-
tality, they have the potential to affect birth weight via distribution of multiple
micronutrient supplementation and, in some cases, balanced protein supple-
mentation at clinics (Bhutta et al. 2014). Institutional deliveries also can affect
nutrition through the promotion of breastfeeding immediately after delivery.
However, the limited research on CCTs for antenatal care and institutional
delivery—mainly studying India’s Janani Suraksha Yojana program (trans-
lated as safe motherhood scheme)—have focused on maternal mortality
rather than birth weight or subsequent child development (Randive, Diwan,
and De Costa 2013; Lim et al. 2010).
   The available evidence indicates that the financial support encourages
­utilization of obstetric services, but such care is associated with only a modest
 reduction in perinatal and neonatal mortality, possibly because the quality of

              full range of antenatal care.

               under-utilized.
                  Meta-analyses of school feeding programs for schoolchildren aged 5 to 19
               find that these programs generally increase weight gain (Kristjansson et al.
               2007). This result is not an unambiguous benefit because in many countries,
               particularly in Latin America, school feeding programs aim to address obe-
               sity. This goal has had some level of success, particularly when integrated with
               appropriate curricula and with programs to promote activity (Verstraeten et
               al. 2012). Although improvements in stature are less common in school feed-
               ing programs, Singh, Park, and Dercon (2014) found that school feeding in
               India apparently reversed the impact on stunting due to a severe drought. Bóo
               and Canon (2013) also noted that this gain was attended by an improvement
               in cognitive scores that could close a quarter of the gap between low and high
               caste students.
                  Standard household models would predict that a student’s food intake

   Improved cognitive ability is one way by which school meals may influence
learning. Additionally the availability of school meals may influence learning
outcomes through their influence on classroom attendance. Moreover,
reduced hunger may have a short-term impact on attention in the classroom,
which may also mediate between school meals and learning outcomes. All
three channels have been shown to contribute to school outcome in various
settings (Adelman, Gilligan, and Lehrer 2008).
   As with health, the impact of a school meal program hinges, in part, on the
quality of the educational services; in Jamaica, classroom behavior improved
in the better organized classroom and deteriorated elsewhere (Grantham-
McGregor, Chang, and Walker 1998). The impact also depends on the timing;
school breakfasts may have a very different impact on hunger and thus on
classroom performance than do lunches.
   Unlike the case of balanced protein and energy supplementation for which
the benefits are most apparent in the 1,000-day window from conception to a
child’s second birthday, benefits of micronutrient supplementation are well
documented for school age children. Numerous studies have confirmed that
school meals can improve micronutrient status (Best et al. 2011). One
meta-analysis concluded that iron supplementation was particularly effective
in regard to intelligence tests for children between 7 and 15 years of age (the
upper limit of the ages in the review) and for children who were initially ane-
mic or iron-deficient anemic (Sachdev, Gera, and Nestel 2005). More recently,
Luo et al. (2012) recorded increased math scores in a randomize trial of iron
supplementation in schools in China.
   Additional benefits of improved micronutrient status are likely for adoles-
cent girls. It is increasingly apparent that reaching
young women with iron and folate prior to preg-
nancy can have public health benefits (Bhutta et al.             Unlike the case of balanced
2013). With girls’ schooling grows, school meals offer                protein and energy

fortified with iron and iodine were found to reduce
absenteeism as well as to improve some dimensions
of cognitive function relative to a similar snack without fortification (van
Stuijvenberg et al. 1999). As the control group also received a snack, the
impact of the fortification was additional to the unmeasured impact of the
provision of food at the start of the school day. A trial in Uganda revealed that
there may be little difference between school meals and take home rations as

               a vehicle for fortification. Both delivery mechanisms contributed to a 20 per-
               centage points decline in anemia prevalence for treated adolescent girls rela-
               tive to the control group (Adelman et al. 2015).
                  The underutilized nutrition potential of school feeding varies, however.
               Not all programs include fortification with iron, and even fewer fortify with
               folate, although this could be achieved even with snacks, and anemia could be
               addressed with concurrent supplementation programs (Luo et al. 2012).
               Breakfasts or even snacks may also achieve the goal of increasing attention in
               the classroom and may prove suitable in programs where the school day is
               short. Another approach to increasing the nutritional effectiveness is the use
               of THR or a combination of targeted THR and meals.

                                          needs assessment at scale. While it may be particu-

               It also imposes challenges for food fortification—often undertaken at central-

               ration even with locally sourced commodities.



              Preferences and Behavior
              Many of the elements of a CCT that could be linked to improved nutritional
              outcomes are not direct results of the conditions themselves—and thus can be
              achieved by a nutrition-sensitive UCT as well. This transfer would include the
              labeling achieved via social mobilization and by addressing more entrenched
              norms and values, as part of behavioral change communication (BCC).
              Although participation in communication events is occasionally a condition
              for eligibility, as it is in Oportunidades, BCC can be linked to other transfers
              as well. For example, the public works program in Djibouti, which prioritizes
              women, also includes regular BCC sessions on nutrition.
                The potential for linking BCC and transfers was shown in a trial that com-
              pared cash and in-kind transfers as well as each transfer modality combined

knowledge and behaviors.    22

   In a very different context, Ruel (2001) maintains
that increases in the  availability of nutritious foods—including through
increased home p   ­ roduction—has limited impact on nutrition without con-
current nutritional messaging. This was shown in one of the earliest ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the joint impact of food pricing
and BCC on ­    nutrition (Garcia and Pinstrup-Andersen 1987). The trial
found that the positive and significant impact of a subsidy on rice and cook-
ing oil on household food expenditures and preschool weight gain in the
Philippines was enhanced when nutrition education was also included.
   The role of behavior change may also be illustrated by yet another form of
transfers linked to an underlying risk factor of malnutrition: open defecation
(Spears 2013). A study of supply vouchers plus behavioral change communi-
cation also in Bangladesh found this approach had a greater impact on
latrine  ownership or utilization than either motivation campaign alone or
a  supply-side intervention at the market level (Guiteras, Levinsohn, and
Mobarak 2015). In addition, there was a spillover effect; nonsubsided house-
holds also responded to the decisions of their neighbors.23 The study, how-
ever, did not explore subsidies alone as previous research indicated that this
was not a valid strategy.
   While arguably demand-side interventions to encourage utilization of
health service (as in fee waivers and price supports) are not strictly social
protection activities, one conclusion of the Spears study is pertinent to a
broader social protection portfolio. The researcher concluded that due to the
spillover effects, smaller subsidies targeted to multiple households in a net-
work can generate more investment than large subsidies deployed to a few in
an uncoordinated manner.
   An emerging field of study examines the efficiency at which households use
information to combine inputs for health production as well as other deci-
sions. This field of behavioral economics looks at how stress affects decision
making, and it has accumulated a body of evidence on the barrier that stress
places on economic choices (World Bank 2015b). There is less evidence on
the degree to which safety nets can alleviate this form of a poverty trap and
foster more practical decisions by reducing stress.
   A few studies, however, offer insights on the interaction of social assistance
and stress. For example, women receiving transfers in Mexico were found to

28	       Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary
have lower cortisol (Fernald and Gunnar 2009), and cash transfers in Malawi
and Kenya were found to reduce psychological stress (Baird, de Hoop, and
Özler 2013; Haushofer and Shapiro 2013). The long-term impact of this con-
ceivable pathway is yet to be traced.
   While still in the realm of a hypothesis, it is plausible that reducing stress
can improve nutrition. For example, maternal depression is associated with
malnutrition (Patel et al. 2004); it is also considered a factor in child cognitive
and socioemotional development (Wachs, Black, and Engle 2009; Walker
et al. 2011). The association is as strong in high-income countries as it is in
low-income Asia, likely reflecting reduced maternal sensitivity to her child’s
needs, an issue more about care than food access. Although there are few
interventions that focus on reversing the pernicious effect of this risk on child
growth per se, a few trials show that there are effective means to improve birth
outcomes through community mobilization (Tripathy et al. 2010). The main
outcome tracked in this particular study was neonatal mortality, but depres-
sion was also significantly reduced. Prost et al. (2013) indicate that this
approach, using women’s groups to improve maternal and child health has
been effective in a range of settings. Whether similar results can be achieved
at scale and within the context of social protection assistance and behavioral
change is an area worth inquiry.




Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary	          29
Conclusions
Given the scale and coverage of safety nets in many countries with a high
burden of malnutrition, there is a vast potential for such programs to
contribute to improvements in health and development, a potential that is
­
not yet fully realized. To reach this potential, social protection programs
need to:
➤➤ Target activities to the most nutritionally vulnerable populations.
➤➤ Include educational activities within social protection interventions to
   increase household awareness of health and nutrition caregiving and
   health-seeking behaviors.
➤➤ Enhance the quality of nutrition services (e.g., growth promotion
   and  interventions for improved diet quality) into social protection
   interventions—particularly transfer programs.
   ­
➤➤ Use school feeding programs as vehicles for micronutrient supplementa-
   tion and deworming, including links with nutrition education.
➤➤ Scale up in times of crisis to reduce the long-term negative impacts of
   external financial, price, and weather shocks.
    The ability of a household to purchase or grow adequate nutritious food
on a regular basis is at the heart of food security. Increased coverage of
low-income families in social protection programs addresses this underly-
ing determinant of nutrition. Although beneficiaries of safety nets regularly
allocate a substantial share of the funds they receive to food—often at higher
rates than they do from other income sources—the impact of safety nets on
undernutrition is often less than desired. In part, this result shows that food
security is only one determinant of good nutrition. Moreover, the poverty
alleviation goals of many programs are broader than nutrition objectives;
families with children in the most vulnerable ages are only one target popu-
lation among many.
    Many countries choose to spread safety nets widely; budget limitations
then imply that these nets are also shallow. As shown by many studies of early
child development, the returns on human capital investments are greatest
among youngest children, consistent with the 1,000-day focus in nutrition
(Alderman, Behrman and Glewwe 2015). This evidence could assist in the
policy choice of how much of the national social protection budget to allocate
for different age categories.
    Prioritization of beneficiaries in accord with nutritional needs is one
­feature of a nutrition-sensitive social protection program, and another is rec-
 ognition that increased food purchases address only part of the set of con-
 straints to good nutrition. A family can purchase food if they have funds, but
 they cannot as readily purchase proper sanitation; nor do the funds received
 from a transfer program guarantee easy access to quality health care. The
 most effective transfer programs, then, are those that address both the
 demand for public health services as well invest in the supply and quality of
 such services.

30	        Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary
                                           Similarly, programs can recognize that demand for
   The most effective transfer           health services in addition to nutritious food is influ-
 programs, then, are those that          enced by preferences as well as by disposable income.
  address both the demand for            Knowledge of proper hygiene and of appropriate
                                         feeding practices contribute to good nutrition yet do
  public health services as well         not automatically improve with increased purchas-
invest in the supply and quality         ing power. Accompanying transfer programs with
        of such services.                community-based behavioral change and social
                                         marketing can enhance the impact of transfers.
                                         ­
                                         Indeed, one indication of the quality of health ser-
             vices is their ability to counsel households that are at risk of under—or over—
             nutrition or both.
                There are encouraging examples of social protection programs that have
             begun with strong emphasis on service quality and BCC—or added these
             benefits during scale up. For example, Peru reformed its Juntos CCT program
             to stress training and service provision, particularly for children less than
             36 months. Recent results from that program point to a significant improve-
             ment in the height of boys enrolled in the program (Andersen et al. 2015).24
                CCTs and UCTs are not the only safety net programs that can be designed
             to be nutrition-sensitive. Public works, for example, are an important compo-
             nent of many social protection strategies because they can create community
             assets such as roads and improved watersheds while addressing chronic—and
             occasionally acute—poverty. They are often neutral in regard to consider-
             ations of nutrition, but this need not always be the case. For example, Djibouti
             has scaled up a nutrition-sensitive public works program in which participa-
             tion of women in community BCC is a prerequisite for a household member
             to be eligible for participation in public works. Moreover, these activities are
             designed to be light so that pregnant and lactating women can take up the
             opportunity for employment.
                Similarly, Ethiopia has added an explicit nutrition objective to its mature
             productive safety nets program. The public works program now promotes
             soft conditionalities that include utilization of community-based nutrition
             and BCC for improved infant and young child feeding practices as well as
             antenatal care (ANC) services, primarily targeted to children under two years
             and pregnant women.




             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Summary	           31
Notes
	  1.	 Interventions or programs that address the immediate determinants of fetal and
       child nutrition and development—adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding,
       caregiving, and parenting practices, and low burden of infectious diseases. (Ruel
       and Alderman 2013).
	  2.	 This estimate, from Fiszbein, Kanbur, and Yemtsov (2014), includes social insur-
       ance as well as noncontributory transfers. Some of the data employed in this
       study differ—and are generally more sanguine—than that in World Bank (n.d.).
	  3.	 Calculated from World Bank (n.d.). The set of countries with a rural-urban break-
       down differ slightly from the full set, so averages are not strictly comparable.
	  4.	 Fiszbein, Kanbur, and Yemtsov (2014) however, refers to this finding in terms of
       cost-benefit ratios. This is a misleading choice of terminology as it differs from
       the concept that is conventionally implied by benefit-cost ratios.
	  5.	 In some contexts transfers may actually increase labor supply. Several studies
       from South Africa find that workers in households receiving social grants look
       for work more intensely and find employment more successfully than do work-
       ers in comparably poor households that do not receive the grants (Samson and
       Williams 2007; Ardington, Case, and Hosegood 2009). The grants appear to
       help finance the migration and job search of family members who then provide
       remittances.
	  6.	 For a review of the impact of transfers on income generation and investment,
       see Alderman and Yemtsov (2014).
	  7.	 Similarly, it is not an open policy question as to the tendency of households to use
       a portion of their increased income on alcohol or tobacco; there is no convincing
       evidence that transfer income influences the propensity to spend on such pur-
       chases, the occasional anecdote notwithstanding (Evans and Popova 2014).
	  8.	 An additional reason for not relying solely on income growth as the main pillar
       of a national nutrition strategy is that obesity rates increase at 7 percent for every
       10 percent increase in national income.
	  9.	 Moreover, a recent study finds that increases in household wealth accounts for
       only a quarter of the improvement in this period (Headey et al. 2015).
10.	 King and Behrman (2009) also point out that because nutritional status is cumu-
	
       lative, short-term impact measurement may underestimate impacts. For exam-
       ple Fernald, Gertler and Neufeld (2009) found larger impacts of PROGRESA on
       children who participated in the program for 18 additional months compared to
       a control group.
11.	 Additionally, governments often did not trust markets, claiming hoarding as a con-
	
       tribution to price increases. This view—along with a view that one-­     dimensional
       equity in food access trumped overall equity in resources—contributed to war-
       time rationing, which can be viewed as an ancestor to some food distribution
       systems that still prevail.
12.	 The converse is also the case: a price increase of an inelastic commodity would
	
       not lead to a large change in the amount purchased, but would lead to a reduc-
       tion in real income, which is one reason why governments often seek to stabilize
       commodity price movements.
       ­
13.	 Whether a subsidy is regressive or proportionally larger as a share of expen-
	
       ditures for low-income consumers is a function of the income elasticity and is
       relatively easy to determine in a household survey.
       ­
	
14.	 Aker (2014) compares cash and vouchers in the Democratic Republic of the
       Congo and also finds cash less costly to implement than vouchers. In addi-
       tion, vouchers imposed costs on the consumers in terms of the inflexibility for
       redemption.

15.	Moreover, the value (in local terms) and the frequency of delivery differed
	
     between the two program modes.
16.	 This result has a bearing on the design of local sourcing as discussed in the con-
	
     text of homegrown school feeding.
17.	Fenn et al. (2015) also present evidence on the use of cash in emergencies.
	
     However, the emergency addressed is a predictable seasonal food shortage.
     Although there is an obvious need for programs designed to address such peri-
     odic food security issues, the role of social protection in these circumstances is
     likely very different than in sudden onset disasters.
18.	 These products have ample shelf life and can be specially formulated for nutri-
	
     tionally at-risk children (Chaparro and Dewey 2010).
	
19.	 Additionally, governments may find greater political support when conditions
     are a design feature. Moreover, some beneficiaries may prefer conditions either
     because coresponsibilities are a matter of perceived dignity or because the con-
     ditions provide parents an element of monitoring of their children’s behavior
     (Bursztyn and Coffman 2012).
20.	 This was tentatively attributed to underreporting, although plausibly it could
	
     reflect that CCTs have a smaller effect on behaviors that influence neonatal
     mortality than on those associated with subsequent health risks.
     ­

     John Hoddinott, Wahid Quabili, Shalini Roy, and Esha Sraboni. Personal com-
     munication cited with permission of the research team.
22.	 The improvement in the in-kind plus BCC arm was not significantly different
	
     from zero. A side result of this study was that each arm expressed a preference for
     the modality of transfer that they were receiving.
23.	 This would be in addition to the positive externalities that comes for a cleaner
	
     environment as latrine use increases.
24.	 This study has not yet been included in the various meta-analyses of CCTs.
