Group, this report consolidates the findings and

  a viable approach for resilience programs. The

  accountable for its own performance.

   to enable more robust M&E. These refinements
   could include defining a limited number of SMART
   (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant,

   that are logically tied to the results framework;
   developing indicator definitions and measurement
   protocols, and identifying data sources to improve
   the reliability and validity of reporting; better
   aligning the M&E framework with the Sendai

   improve relevance; developing approaches and
   tools to measure gender outcomes within GFDRR
   activities; and defining where and how evaluation
   can help address the questions and needs of
   GFDRR constituents.
 Address operational aspects of monitoring and
   reporting. Making improvements to GFDRR’s M&E
   system as described above may also require some
   operational changes to improve efficiency and
   ease of implementation. Systems or tools might be
   developed or improved, roles and responsibilities
   might be clarified, and different staff or resources
   might be required. In addition, clearly stating how
   monitoring information will be used is important—
   for example, how the information could be
   integrated into the Annual Report, and what other
   reports and learning products might be produced.

                                  Overview of Challenges for Monitoring and Evaluating Resilience
    Resilience monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is notoriously challenging due to a number of factors such as
    complexity, lack of predictability, and long time horizons. Widely recognized challenges for resilience M&E
    include the following:	

     Given that disasters are unpredictable and their effects highly uncertain, traditional M&E systems that have
       predictable pre/post “testing points” to understand impact generally do not apply.
     Resilience itself is non-linear and rapidly changing, influenced by social, economic, climactic, and other
       factors. This further renders most linear dose-response types of M&E approaches as non-applicable.
     Resilience is particularly context specific, requiring specific M&E for each context. This in turn prevents
       higher-level M&E frameworks from being broadly applicable, posing additional challenges to consistency
       across portfolios and the ability to scale up context-specific indicators and results.



	 These indicators were defined in Annex I to an update on the implementation of the M&E framework, as given at the 15th meeting of the Consultative Group, and are based on the World
8

  Bank’s standard indicators for analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) work.




ICF International                                                                                                                                                                 [ 13 ]
                  Overview of Challenges for Monitoring and Evaluating Resilience (continued)
     There are no widely agreed upon indicators to determine the effectiveness of resilience interventions. Even
       the most advanced indicators are being refined with field experience.
     Setting baselines and targets is often complicated due to the rapidly changing and complex nature of
       vulnerability and uncertainties about the future.
     Most resilience M&E currently focuses on immediate or near-term outputs, which are more readily
       identifiable, rather than outcomes and impacts, which can only be realized in the indeterminate future.
       Thus, for practical reasons, the ultimate impacts of resilience interventions are both unknown and
       unknowable. Proxies such as interim outcomes indicative of longer-term results may be the best measures
       available.
     For all the above reasons, with few exceptions, resilience M&E requires approaches that are typically
       more systems-oriented, qualitative, mixed method, and innovative. Findings from these most-suitable
       approaches tend to be more qualitative and nuanced, reflecting evidence of shifts in a system related to
       resilience rather than a “concrete” result.
     Related to this, it is often difficult or impossible to attribute a particular change or outcome to a specific
       intervention. Identifying contribution to a change/outcome is often more realistic, but is not considered
       satisfactory to some audiences, particularly when a quantitative results finding or “value for money”
       conclusion is sought.

                                   What do comparator organizations do?
  A 2011 evaluation of the World Bank’s trust fund portfolio found a frequent lack of results frameworks with
  clear outcome objectives and indicators for monitoring progress. The majority of the 36 randomly selected
  trust fund programs lack outcome-level evidence; most had defined objectives in terms of inputs or outputs.
  A parallel evaluation of the World Bank’s global and regional partnership programs similarly found that few
  programs have generated systematic evidence about achievements at the outcome level, owing to generally
  poor monitoring and evaluation.

  Those that do monitor and report against indicators at the outcome level typically do so for intermediate, or
  lower-order, outcomes. For example, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) tracks and
  monitors outputs and intermediate outcomes, as defined by the AAA indicators. This approach was recently
  recognized by the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) as being well-designed to track and
  report on the entire results chain of each activity.

Note: Additional World Bank operations may have been informed by GFDRR in Vietnam, but they were not able to be
confirmed for this synthesis report. In particular, the 2014 evaluation reported that GFDRR had “facilitated the clearance”
of the Road Asset Management Project, Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation project, Irrigated Agricultural Improvement
Project, and Ho Chi Minh Environmental Sanitation project. However, because these projects were not mentioned in DARA’s
back-to-office report for the Vietnam fieldwork and because GFDRR was not mentioned in World Bank’s project appraisal
documents, these projects were not included in this table as being World Bank operations “informed.”

                             coordinators, and task team leaders. The M&E plan will
                             address the following:

                              How to revise GFDRR’s results framework to incorporate
                                relevant and measurable intermediate outcomes to bridge
                                the gap between outputs and outcomes; to capture
                                the effects of GFDRR on larger lending operations;
                                and to better align the M&E framework with the Sendai
                                Framework indicators, which are still under development,
                                focusing on a few core indicators.
                              Development of indicators to be monitored that are
                                logically tied to the results framework, and their definitions
                                and data sources.
                              Approaches and tools to measure the effect of GFDRR’s
                                activities on gender.
                              Specifications of how the monitoring information will be
                                used (e.g., how the information could be integrated into
                                the Annual Report, and what other reports and learning
                                products might be produced).
                              Operational aspects of monitoring and reporting (e.g.,
                                systems or tools that need to be developed or improved,
                                roles and responsibilities, staff or resources potentially
                                required).
                              If, where, and how evaluation can help address the
                                questions and needs identified in Step 1.
