This Botswana Report is a product of The Mining Investment and Governance Review for Botswana, which was under-
taken between October 15-30, 2015 and then in May 2016 by a team led by Lois Hooge and consisting of Christianna
Pangalos, Michael Baxter, Anne Claire Howard, Julia Baxter, Yann Lebrat, David Mihalyi and Antoniya Mihaylova. A wide
range of stakeholders was interviewed during the review and the team wishes to thank all participants for their time and
valuable comments.

This report presents data on mining investment and governance indicators for Botswana that are current as of October
30, 2015. Scores for any of the indicators in the review may have changed since that time.

3	   There is some dispute as to whether Botswana has in fact managed to avoid the resource curse, given the economy’s high dependence on one commodity
     – diamond production and trading. A full discussion of this issue goes beyond the purview of this assessment although it is discussed briefly under a later
     section describing how diamonds have been used for development.


4	   To diversify the industry’s products and export markets as well as encouraging downstream cutting and polishing activities, Botswana launched its own
     diamond trading company, Diamond Trading Company Botswana (DTCB), in September 2013. The creation of the DTCB, a joint venture between De Beers
     and the Botswana Government is bringing to an end the practice of sending rough diamonds to De Beers’ London-based main Diamond Trading Company
     for sorting and marketing.

      average of the three topics within that stage (which are shown in this figure). The score against the topic is the average of the scores of the underlying
      indicator scores; the indicator scores are the average of the scores of their underlying questions. The color coding is the same as in the matrix (Figure 2).
      Intervals for scoring performance are as follows: n Very low (1.0-1.75); n Low (>1.75-2.50); n High (>2.50-3.25); and n Very high (>3.25-4.0), where a

Note: The score for each theme is the average of scores of the five value chain stages in that theme (see Figure 2). The score for the value chain stage is the
      average of the three topics within that stage (which are shown in this figure). The score against the topic is the average of the scores of the underlying
      indicator scores; the indicator scores are the average of the scores of their underlying questions. The color coding is the same as in the matrix (Figure 2).
      Intervals for scoring performance are as follows: n Very low (1.0-1.75); n Low (>1.75-2.50); n High (>2.50-3.25); and n Very high (>3.25-4.0), where a

      themes do not have indicators). The topic score is the average of the scores of questions that comprise the topic. The color coding is the same as in the
