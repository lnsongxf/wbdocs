This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        Request and obtain cadastre certificate

        To request the cadastre certificate, a form must be picked up at
        the Municipality (where stamps must be purchased) for a fee of
        BOB 70.00. The form must be completed by an architect
        recognized by the Municipality (the architect is assumed to be a
        BuildCo employee). Typically, such an architect would charge
        about BOB 200.00 to BOB 500.00. Finally, a topographic plot plan
        must be acquired and attached to the form. Such a plan costs
   1    about BOB 1,620.00.                                                       60 days              BOB 1,690

        Thus, the fees to be paid at the Municipality amount to BOB

      Request and obtain a zoning permit (traso vial) from
      Municipality

      To obtain a zoning permit (traso vial) a special form must be
      completed by a professional licensed by the College of
      Architects of La Paz. It is assumed in this case that the
      professional is a BuildCo staff member. La Paz does not have
      updated, comprehensive maps of some zones (particularly
      industrial zones). The current maps date back to 1986. This
      document defines the construction impact on adjacent zones.
3     Documents to be presented are:                                       45 days        BOB 96

      Association

      The actual cost is based on a table of fees determined by the
      Architects Association. Given the characteristics of the
      warehouse, the following cost formula applies: A * B * C = R,
      where
      A = Area of the terrain (expressed in square meters).
      B = USD 2.76 (may vary, depending on the actual area of the
      terrain).
      C = 0.055 (a percentage given by the Architects Association).
      R = The real cost (assumed to be USD 197.43 or its equivalent in
      BOB).

      To request a construction permit, BuildCo must submit the
      following documentation:
      • Written letter to the Municipality
4     • Single registration form (formulario único de administración       30 days      BOB 1,522
      predial) (downloadable on the Municipality's website)
      • Cadastre certificate (Procedure 1)
      • Property title (copy)
      • Royal folio (Procedure 2)
      • Zoning permit (traso vial) (Procedure 3)
      • Receipt of last five property tax payments
      • Identification card (copy)
      • Plans (original and copy)

      The municipality reviews the documents and enters the
      application data into the electronic system SITR@M. After 5
      business days, the architect in charge returns to the Municipality
      to arrange a date for the on-site inspection (preferably
      scheduled more than 2 business days later). In case of objections
      or observations, all documents are returned to the architect, and
      the rejection is documented on the single form (FUAP). After the
      inspection, the Municipality informs BuildCo of the fee assessed

     meter road (such as by excavation or overhead
     lines) but are all carried out on public land. There
     is no crossing of other owners’ private property

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                      After 10 working days following Mirage’s inability to pay its debt, BizBank
                                        would enforce its security interest over Mirage's assets by filing for a
                                   foreclosure proceeding. BizBank would enforce its security interest through the
                                     sale of the assets used as collateral in satisfaction of secured loan (Code of

                                   establishes the possibility for a stay in proceedings) is temporarily postponed.
                                       Therefore, in situations such as the one describe in the case study, the
                                   foreclosure proceeding would continue until the assets used as collateral are

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
