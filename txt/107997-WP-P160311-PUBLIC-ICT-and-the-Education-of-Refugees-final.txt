Abstract
More than 10 million school-age children have been forced out of school in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) due to armed conflict in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya and other countries. Most are displaced
internally but others have fled across borders to seek refuge. The numbers are staggering: an estimated 2
million Syrian children are out of school in Syria and 700,000 are out of school in host countries; 3 million
Iraqi children are out of school, 2 million Libyan and 2.9 million Yemeni children remain out of school
(UNICEF, 2015).

Displacement may have become a constant, perhaps permanent feature of the 21st century; if so, it is
important to be prepared and develop a lasting capacity to deal with displacement wherever it occurs and
enact policies that support and enable new ways to learn.

As governments and international agencies struggle to ensure these children a safe learning environment
and a good quality education, many look to information and communications technology (ICT) to provide
at least part of the solution. The use of smartphones and other mobile devices, ubiquitous even among
impoverished refugees, can provide a platform that educators can leverage to reach marginalized children
and youth.

The purpose of this note is to provide a clear and concise snapshot of the role ICT has played, the promise
it holds, the projects that are currently under preparation, and what more might be done. This is in no way
a comprehensive assessment but rather an attempt to promote dialogue and inform programs.

Among the main points are the following:

           The situation of refugees in MENA is highly diverse and ICT-supported interventions can be and
            must be correspondingly diverse: indeed, each intervention should be tailored to particular
            needs of particular groups and be integrated with an appropriate pedagogy.
           Technology can also aid parents and relief organizations, not only students and teachers.
           While UN agencies strive to integrate refugees into local school systems, the potential of small-
            scale private schooling, assisted by technology, should be explored.
           ICT can replace teachers and organized learning only in rare instances; but it can provide
            effective support to education, especially when supplemented with teacher training.

Many seek evidence that technology-assisted approaches are effective, but little has been gathered with
respect to ICT in education generally, let alone in emergency situations. The current situation provides
numerous opportunities to build the evidence base, even carry out randomized control trials, and thereby
improve ICT interventions and bring them to scale. In the meantime, lacking a robust evidence base,
researchers and practitioners have formulated design principles that can provide guidance. These are given
in Annex 2, though the following main principles recur often:

           The purpose and context of each ICT-based intervention must be clearly understood.
           Technology is a toolset, not the solution: start with the problem, not the technology.
           Exploit open-source cost-free materials.
           Focus on teacher training and development.
           Evaluate interventions and build the evidence base.

Introduction
This note aims to inform discussion on the role information and communications technology (ICT) can play
in the educational response to the refugee crisis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). It provides a
clear and concise snapshot of the role ICT has played, the promise it holds, the projects that are currently
under preparation and what more might be done.

Education and the Refugee Crisis in

The Middle East and North Africa as a region is
currently beset by widespread instability and Yemen
armed conflict, giving rise to ongoing
humanitarian crises. The effect on education in    Libya
MENA has been devastating: according to UNICEF
(2015a), more than 13 million children have been
forced from their schools due to conflict, and      Iraq
more than 8,850 schools can no longer be used at
all.1 Primary and secondary education, performing

With respect to primary and secondary education, refugee children and youth run the gamut of
circumstances:

       Refugee children living in organized camps;     Syria. More than 4.8 million Syrian refugees have
        refugee children living in cities and towns     registered with UNHCR in five host countries (Turkey,
       Children completely out of school due to        Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt), and these reported
        displacement, employment, or for reasons        figures may well be below the actual numbers (UNICEF
        of safety                                       2015b). More than half of the refugees are under age 18,
                                                        including more than 1.6 million school-age children and

                                                        youth. Of these, as many as 53 percent are out of school

                                                        local children as well (No Lost Generation Initiative

The context of the refugee crisis in MENA is thus highly complex—requiring a response that recognizes that
complexity and that does not turn solely to conventional approaches. With many refugees living outside of
organized refugee camps, it is very difficult for aid providers, whether governments, United Nations (UN)
organizations, or NGOs, to reach families and children in need. Many educators, technologists, and others
hope that ICT may be a way to provide help to widely dispersed families and that smart innovations and
investments might provide rapid, effective solutions for education. Not one approach is needed, but many,
corresponding to the widely varying situations and circumstances of displaced learners. If ICT is to benefit
displaced children and youth, it must be tailored to the needs and circumstances of specific groups of
refugees. Above all, it must serve as a set of tools for teachers.

The Potential and Promise of ICT for Refugee Education
As with all children, the goal with respect to educating displaced children is to provide access to a good
education in a safe, healthy, and effective learning environment, with instruction delivered in accordance
with good pedagogical practice and progress and achievement documented and reliably certified. The
nature of displacement and conflict requires that special attention also be paid to psychosocial and health
needs and the effects of prolonged interruption of schooling.

Currently, refugees face many barriers to schooling, including shortages of available space at school,
language barriers, registration requirements, the direct and associated costs, discrimination at school,

                                                                                                                      4
inability to travel to school (Culbertson and Constant 2015). Other barriers include the need to work and
early marriage.2

On the face of it, ICT would seem to hold great promise for responding to unmet education needs within
the broader humanitarian crises in MENA. Given basic infrastructure, technology has the potential to
deliver educational content at very low cost virtually anywhere, provide a curriculum and records system
that can follow children on the move, reach those unable to attend school, link digital content to the
national curricula of students’ home country or their country of refuge, and certify educational
achievement. Technology can also provide a means for teachers and other adults to receive pedagogical
training, share materials and advice, and assess and document learning. It can even provide a means for
relief organizations to rapidly assess and map the educational situation and provide basic educational
information to parents in real time.

One important reason ICT stands as an alluring solution is its penetration. In the Arab countries as a whole,
digital penetration, standing at 52.2%, exceeds the world average of 46.4%, and only six countries (Iran,
Syria, Libya, Yemen, Algeria, and Iraq) currently fall below that average.3 Internet penetration extends to
refugees as well, in spite of their loss of wealth and income. Mobile phones are now seen as a basic survival
tool (Janbek 2015) and the chief way in which the displaced can remain connected to their families and
home communities. In the Za’atari Refugee Camp in Jordan, for example, a survey conducted in January
2015 found that 86 percent of youth own mobile handsets and 83 percent own SIM cards (Maitland and
Xu 2015). Most of the mobile handsets in Za’atari are smartphones (Creative Associates International 2016).
In other words, there is a relatively extensive digital infrastructure already in place, which educators could
leverage to support new ways of learning.

The international community has taken note and is beginning to take action and coordinate efforts. One
indicator of current interest in ICT for the education of displaced children and youth—as well as the urgency
of the Syrian crisis in particular—is the large number of recent high-level meetings on the topic. Moreover,
several organizations have established “innovation labs”—physical or virtual spaces dedicated to
identifying and applying new technologies to address existing problems or serve unmet needs. As shown in
Annex 1, not only have the not-for-profit and tech communities organized innovation labs to address the
MENA refugee crisis, but also large public international organizations, such as UNHCR and UNICEF.

The Peril and Pitfalls.
Education technology, even in stable and secure environments, has often fallen short of its promise. A
recent report taking stock of current practice in countries of the OECD (Avvisati, 2015), documents that
technology is increasingly present in schools. However, it may not be used much (certainly less than outside
of school), it may not be used effectively, and it is difficult to discern its impact. For one, this is because the
use of computers by students often correlates with many different things -- distraction, lower performance,
increased absenteeism – out of which it is difficult to disentangle actual learning. On balance, the
technology is not making a difference on student learning (at least as we measure learning today). This
should not be surprising: simple access to technology makes little impact. Education technology in and of
itself does not teach students, teachers do (of course, others do as well, including peers, students
themselves, parents; etc.). So one key challenge highlighted by the report is how education systems must

learn to use technology effectively, safely and equitably.

These challenges are all the greater in the context of the widely varying and typically unstable situations in
which refugee children find themselves.

Education technology is certainly not a complete answer to the education crisis arising from conflict in the
MENA region, but it has promise. There is a swirl of new activity among humanitarian and development
agencies, NGOs, and the tech sector, searching for ways to apply ICT to the educational needs of displaced
persons in the MENA region. It would be wrong to think of education technology as a single answer to a
single problem, or even as a ready intervention. Rather, critical to each intervention is putting the right
tools in the hands of the right people to meet the specific needs in a given environment. While this note
emphasizes how important specific contexts are, there are also cross-cutting or foundational issues to
which ICT could be applied, notably, mapping of populations and needs, training and collaboration of
teachers, certification of student learning, and cost and availability of teaching materials (textbooks, lesson
plans, and so on).

A Closer Look at Specific Needs
There are five main ways in which technology can provide educational solutions: 1) providing digital
learning content; 2) delivering such content; 3) training and mentoring teachers; 4) facilitating school
reentry; and, 5) improving management of education information.

Annex 1 contains an extensive, though not exhaustive, catalogue of initiatives currently underway or in
preparation. It reveals that, on the one hand, there are many organizations involved—UN organizations,
governments, NGOs large and small, and the technology sector -- though, on the other, that most of these
projects are pilots or even mere ideas at very early stages of realization. The plethora of projects addresses
a wide range of educational issues relevant to displaced children and youth—basic literacy and numeracy,
including online games and readers; digital content for all levels of learning; life skills and vocational
training; even psychosocial interventions. Yet, so far, with the exception of a few platforms such as Nafham
that were created for learners in general, rather than displaced children, none have been implemented at
scale. In some cases, resource repositories have already been created to house digital content at scale, for
example, the Edraak massive open online courses (MOOC) platform and the OER Commons Arabic and
Rumie LearnCloud repositories. However, these remain for the moment underutilized

Digital Content
There exists a growing cache of online educational resources in Arabic, from such sources as Nafham, Tahrir
Academy, and the UNICEF-UNRWA Joint Education Program. In addition, some materials originally
produced in English in North America and Europe, like the Khan Academy, have been translated and
contextualized for use by Arabic speakers. Alternatively, MENA content providers, such as Nafham, have
followed the Khan model in both format and pedagogical style, while others4 have created materials in
English and French for general educational purposes. All these are for general use rather than in response
to the needs of displaced persons.

 instruction or for independent study.                                  differently, and so on.

 several million subscribers. It has published findings from the City   The advantage of such Open Education

 Syrian refugees to enter school in Turkey.
 (Note: the World Bank does not endorse Duolingo)            Precisely because they are ‘open’, Arabic-
                                                             language OERs could be incorporated into any

The creation of additional materials by Arab educators should be strongly encouraged. The most
appropriate existing materials, in English or any other language could be translated or subtitled with some
effort by a dedicated team or through such low-cost service providers as Amara (amara.org) or Taghreedat
(taghreedat.com). These materials would be available not only for immediate use but also as a model for
Arab educators.

Annex 1, in the section devoted to Digital Content, catalogues Arabic-language materials that are already
available, whether produced by regional content providers or translated and adapted from other sources.
It reveals, however, that, generally speaking, Arabic-language materials have not been curated, catalogued,
and aligned to national curricula or teaching standards. A very small number of large collections exist
(notably, Nafham and Arabic versions of Khan Academy), but teachers do not have simple, comprehensive
access to available materials. Repositories of open educational resources would be invaluable, as such sites
have the capacity to collect and curate content that is in the public domain or released under an intellectual
property license that permits their free use and re-purposing. Open-access repositories have been built to
accommodate Arabic-language materials (two in North America, one under development in Saudi Arabia);
however, the amount of content housed in these sites so far is quite limited.
Content Delivery
Digital content can be delivered in many formats and in many educational contexts, whether formal, non-
formal, or informal. Given the range and complexity of displacement in MENA, content delivery via ICT may
make great sense. Two main avenues for the delivery of digital educational content are personal handheld
electronic devices, such as a smartphones, and “connected classrooms.” Some believe that combining
some form of connected classroom with basic teacher training and scripted lessons could greatly expand

                                                                                                                       7
the supply of credible private and non-formal education.

Mobile learning “Mobile learning” is learning of any type designed to take place via a personal handheld
electronic device, such as a smartphone. Such learning is mobile because it is not confined to the classroom
or home but can take place anywhere. Since it is not school-based, it can also take place at any time. In
many cases, mobile learning also permits synchronous or asynchronous interaction with teachers and other
learners. Mobile learning may be the preferred technology for informal and non-formal learning, which
might take place individually, through social media, or in community centers.

Smartphones are widespread in the MENA region, even among refugees who have lost their homes and
possessions. Mobile learning is, that said, constrained by the cost of cell phone subscriptions and mobile
Internet. For that reason, many providers emphasize content that can be downloaded for offline use.

The “anytime, anywhere” capability of mobile learning is especially important for young people who are
not able to leave home for safety or other reasons or who may be working. Moreover, access is easy and
does not require much parental effort. This is important, because parents suffering from depression and
post-traumatic apathy may not do much to advance their children’s education, even if they are convinced
of its importance. In many cases, refugee households comprise a single adult (usually the mother) and many
children. In Turkey, for example, where the largest number of Syrians have sought refuge, 70 percent of
refugee households are headed by the mother alone (Liv Nordhaug, Norad, telephone interview). This
makes it difficult for the mother to attend to any but the most basic needs. Interestingly, for this very reason,
the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) has directly aimed at households rather than
schools in its recent ‘EduApp4Syria’ tender, which emphasizes an engaging ‘gamified’ approach to teaching
children ages 5–10 to read.

As shown in the mobile learning section of Annex 1, the promise of mobile learning has attracted a wide
range of actors: from large-scale public and private funders, such as Norad and the Maktoum Foundation,
to very small NGOs, such as Aliim. Other NGOs with existing ICT resources and capacities originally
developed for other parts of the world are also putting themselves forward as potential partners for the
region. Though mobile learning holds much promise, the mobile learning projects identified in Annex 1 are
very early in their development, typically in the planning or pilot stage. Moreover, little of the Arabic-
language educational content mentioned in the previous section has yet been adapted for mobile use.

Connected Classroom Infrastructure ICT can of course be used for educational purposes within classrooms
as well. In the refugee context, that may require special infrastructure, such as rapidly-deployable packaged
hardware for education in emergencies. Such hardware generally features pre-loaded academic content,
and sometimes connectivity solutions.

As described in Annex 1, UNHCR and UNICEF have developed kits, such as UNICEF’s “Digital School in a Box,”
to respond to emergency situations in various world regions, including MENA. In addition, the not-for-profit
education sector is developing connected classroom infrastructure specifically for MENA. Approaches such
as that of the LearnSyria project, which provides low-cost computer tablets with pre-loaded academic
content, hold promise as an efficient and flexible content-delivery mechanism.

Other technology solutions, such as the Open Learning Exchange’s Open Learning Kit (see:
http://ole.org/mena/) and Ushahidi’s BRCK technology and Kio Kit (see: http://education.brck.com/) have
been deployed in other regions but not yet in MENA.



                                                                                                              8
Expanded private and non-formal education Another modality of computer-assisted learning that has been
suggested is hyperlocal, small-scale, low-cost schools. This might be seen as an extension of the connected
classroom concept, combining it with teacher training and mentoring, digital content, and possibly even
scripted lessons. These schools might be led by refugee teachers or by community teachers (educated
volunteers who do not have formal training as teachers), who would get some initial training, ongoing
support, and a kit consisting of a projector, curated digital content, and basic classroom supplies.

Similar community- or home-based schools (without the technology) have been used effectively for Afghan
refugees in Pakistan, South Sudanese refugees in Kenya, and Rohingya refugees in Malaysia (Dryden-
Peterson 2011; UNHCR 2015b), and the practice is widespread in some developing countries, outside of
the refugee context. Similar community-based schools with an added technology component have shown
improved learning outcomes in developing countries (Power et al. 2014).

It is also worth considering how to effectively engage the broader set of ICT communities in finding ways
to address the education and skills crisis faced by refugees. Some of the host countries (as well as the
countries of origin, as in the case of Syria) are home to a burgeoning tech-entrepreneurial ecosystem. These
companies could draw on rapid technical skills training that can quickly upskill the refugee population.
There is an emerging trend in such rapid training focused on web development, web design and data
analytics etc., which are now expanding to emerging markets as well as the refugee contexts. Some of these
are called “coding bootcamps” that offer full-time training over 2-4 months at various skill and educational
levels.
Teacher Training and Mentoring
Although ICT has many capabilities for supporting learning, it is not a complete solution to the educational
needs of displaced children and youth. Moreover, none of the digital solutions described above are likely
to be effective in the absence of dedicated and trained teachers. Teachers are central to learning,
particularly in the case of refugee education. To use ICT effectively, teachers – whomever they may be,
formally recognized teachers, informal teachers, untrained volunteers -- need special training, and to
manage the special circumstances of refugee education, even experienced teachers can benefit from
training in psychosocial counseling, differentiated instruction, and management of large classrooms with
pupils of different ages.

A recent global review of ICT for refugee education (Creative Associates International 2016) noted two
important points: first, ICT program designers can work with local authorities to strengthen teacher
training; second, ICT can serve teachers in a variety of other ways, helping them track students and manage
and monitor learning; connect with their peers via SMS or social networks to share knowledge and offer
support; and access psychological services to aid students who are suffering from post-traumatic stress and
trauma.

Only rudimentary steps have been taken so far in teacher training and mentoring. For the most part, ICT-
enabled teacher training has been a component of a few tightly targeted projects related, for example, to
entrepreneurship or computer programming. A single more robust ICT-enabled teacher training approach
is seen in UNICEF’s Raspberry Pi for Learning Initiative (Pi4L). This program is built around four learning
tracks delivered both offline and via small computer labs. Three of the tracks are optimized for students
and one is focused on teachers and teacher-trainers. These teacher training courses, together with
training kits for community teachers and teacher-trainers, are delivered by the International Education
Association with oversight and accreditation by The College of Teachers in London.


                                                                                                          9
Experience in other world regions demonstrates that ICT has much more to offer to teachers in refugee
situations. Dahya (2016), for example, documents three promising examples of using ICT to train teachers
of refugees—one from Iraq and two from Kenya.

    1. In the Kurdish region of Iraq, the International Rescue Committee has launched ‘Connect to Learn’
       in ten schools in the Domiz refugee camp. The project engages 160 Syrian teachers in professional
       development via a cloud-based server, with a particular focus on psychosocial training. The ICT
       system provides access to training materials, including YouTube videos, to support children
       affected by conflict. Technology also enables the ‘Connect to Learn’ teachers to form learning
       circles and share information and experience (peer-to-peer learning).
    2. In addition, technology can enable ongoing expert mentoring. As part of the global Refugee
       Teacher Working Group initiated by UNHCR, Teachers College is leading an effort to develop a new
       teacher training pack for previously untrained refugee teachers recruited to provide education to
       the children living in the camps. The training, piloted with twenty teachers in the Kakuma Refugee
       Camp in Kenya, involves a ‘mobile mentoring’ prototype. Good teaching practice among the novice
       refugee teachers is captured on low-tech cameras and smartphones to demonstrate what is
       possible, even in spite of challenging classroom environments. Ongoing SMS messaging engages
       the teachers and reinforces training, and allows teachers to ask questions and request help and
       advice.
    3. Another example of even greater computer-enabled teacher training comes from the Dadaab
       Refugee Camp in Kenya. Borderless Higher Education for Refugees (BHER), a consortium of Kenyan
       and Canadian universities, provides technology-enabled training to teachers there. Approximately
       60 per year complete the program and receive an accredited Certificate in Educational Studies from
       York University in Toronto.
Facilitating Formal Schooling
In addition to delivering educational content to students and teachers, ICT can facilitate the re-integration
of displaced children and youth into formal schooling in their country of refuge. In part, this is simply a
matter of refreshing lost knowledge, re-establishing study habits, and so forth. But education technology
can improve the efficient use of school facilities, provide new ways to document learning, and improve
administration.

Bridging: supporting the movement back to formal schooling. The displaced—adults and children alike—are
subject to post-traumatic stress. Many children who have lived through trauma find it difficult to return to
schooling or even to concentrate. ICT may be able to play a role in easing the return to formal schooling.
This could take the form of accelerated ‘catch-up’ programs, refreshing pupils’ knowledge, helping them
revive the habits of study and ability to concentrate, guiding them and their parents in regard to enrollment
procedures and preparing for placement examinations.

In this regard, there have been calls to provide better information to parents on how to enroll their children
in the national school system. One approach is to facilitate communication among parents via social media.

Reducing pressure on school facilities. While public schooling in the Arab countries, both rich and poor, has
not produced strong learning outcomes, as shown in a review of PISA, TIMSS, and PIRLS5 data for thirteen
Arab countries (Steer, Ghanem, and Jalbout 2014), school performance is likely to decrease even further

5PISA stands for Program for International Student Assessment; TIMSS stands for Trends in Mathematics and Science Survey;
PIRLS stands for Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.

                                                                                                                        10
when it has to move to double-shifting to meet the needs of refugee populations. Aside from overcrowding
and other problems, double-shifting often entails reduced classroom hours. Since ICT can enable off-site
learning, it is possible that it can compensate for lost classroom time and relieve pressure on school facilities
(provided the necessary, complementary support eco-system for out-of-school learning with ICTs is in
place). The ‘Learn Syria’ initiative piloted by Rumie already claims this as an outcome.

Documentation/certification of learning and achievement. Diplomas and certificates are seen as an
indispensable link between schooling and employment in the MENA region and provide major incentive to
school attendance. Hence, the difficulty that refugee students have in obtaining certification of their
learning is a major hindrance to schooling. Without a clear path to a diploma or other certification, the
motivation of Syrian school pupils and their families, already facing profound uncertainty, may flag. Children,
already facing substantial difficulties (unsafe walk to school, bullying, and so on), may drop out. Moreover,
inasmuch as refugee families, especially those in urban areas, are frequently on the move, trying to improve
their situation (e.g., relocating to cheaper housing or to reunite with relatives or neighbors), the issue of
certification is doubly complicated. It would thus seem sensible to address the issue of documentation of
learning, perhaps creating a standard basic (3 R’s) curriculum for emergency situations, which could be
adapted to specific crises. A competency-based approach to certification would be ideal, especially if
mapped to national curricula. A RAND report on the Syrian crisis made a similar observation in regard to
Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey (Culbertson and Constant 2015, 25–26).

Since the introduction of such a major addition to global education would likely take many years, if it is
possible at all, a more realistic step in the nearer term would be to develop a list of simple competencies
available to parents and students stating what they should be able to do at different ages, supplemented
with simple assessments and links to online learning. The simplified age-based benchmarks (perhaps in the
form of ‘I can’ statements) might be based on internationally recognized systems, such as TIMSS/PIRLS,
PISA, or others.

Information Management Systems. Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) store system-wide
education data, aid policy and planning, and monitor indicators and outcomes; Learning Management
Systems (LMS) may be used to deliver a course, communicate with students, monitor their performance,
and maintain records. Clearly, this software could play a central role in refugee contexts and, indeed, efforts
are now underway to improve systems in this way to support provision of educational services to refugees.
One example is YOBIS (https://yobis.meb.gov.tr/), a data management system, created by Turkey’s Ministry
of National Education and UNICEF, which documents demographic data of non-Turkish students and tracks
their education records (and health records). This appears to be a supplement to the ministry’s existing
national EMIS. In the context of the refugee crisis, national information management systems could also
benefit from innovative data collection technologies. The RAND study, for example, makes an interesting
recommendation to develop a plan to make strategic use of more available school spaces, using geographic
information systems (GIS) to map where the school-age refugees are in relation to available school spaces
in the host countries. (Culbertson and Constant 2015). Some additional technologies described in Annex 1,
such as Tangerine, Open EMIS Refugee, and sQuidcard, could contribute to these efforts.

Evidence of Effectiveness and Guidelines for ICT for Refugee Education
Currently, there is a significant lack of evidence on the effectiveness of ICT in refugee education, which
should not in fact be surprising given the context. While a number of studies have shown some
effectiveness, they cannot yet constitute a robust body of knowledge such that agencies, humanitarian


                                                                                                              11
organizations, and NGOs would know which computer-based learning interventions would be most
effective.

Several recent reviews exist (Dahya 2016, Burde et al. 2015; Carlson 2013), though all warn that the
available literature is quite limited and that the studies and information sources reviewed generally fall far
short of the ‘gold standard’ of independent, peer-reviewed evaluations with carefully randomized
experimental trial designs. Much of the information comes instead from the implementers themselves,
which inevitably implies conscious or unconscious bias.

Establishing annual independent sample testing of refugee learners using a variety of student assessment
tools is needed. Indeed, Dahya (2016) calls for randomized control trials and quasi-experimental designs,
like in any other field of research. In addition, theory related to education and technology in conflict and
crisis, as well as qualitative research documenting meaningful participation and outcomes for target groups,
are also needed. These, it must be pointed out, are expensive however. Perhaps a combination of rapidly
prototyped pilots combined with more effective forms of M&E could offer a golden medium?

In the meantime, lacking a robust evidence base, leading researchers and practioners6 have formulated
design principles that can provide guidance. These are given in Annex 2, though the following main
principles recur often:

Objectives
 Have clarity of purpose before adopting ICT
 Ensure that the technology will add value to existing solutions
 If a lower-cost technology is available to solve a particular problem, use it instead
Context-specific, fit for purpose design
 Start with a strong contextual analysis that looks at access, quality, and protection
 Design with the user in mind
 Learners need content that meets their academic, linguistic, and skill needs. Use a human-centered
    design process with users.
 Support a diversity of approaches to supplement traditional education access
 Design for scale; Build for sustainability
 Be data-driven
 Work with the policy and economic constraints of the host labor market
 Mobilize predictable medium- to long-term financing that flows through an agreed coordination
    structure
 Identify accreditation and certification mechanisms
Technology
 Optimize programs for smart mobile devices (phones and tablets)
 Ensure programs work without Internet, but are Internet-ready when the time comes
 Ensure reliability and sustainability of technology
Content
 Take advantage of the growth of open/free content7 movement by finding ways to support its use by
    teachers in the field

Conclusion
ICT is no “silver bullet” solution to the conflict-related education crisis in MENA, though it could potentially
be part of ‘solutions’ to various aspects of the question. As we have seen, it holds promise in improving
what is delivered (through digital resources), how it is delivered (via content delivery), in teacher training,
and in facilitating formal schooling. In the absence of an evidence base on the effectiveness of ICT in refugee
education, however, much depends on how wisely it is adopted following currently emerging guiding
principles.

Annex 1: Projects under Development or Underway
 The following is a list of projects currently underway or under development, using digital technology
 for education in the MENA region, including those specifically aimed at assisting children and youth
 displaced by conflict. The project descriptions have largely been taken from the websites of the
 organizations and projects and not always checked for accuracy.
 The projects are divided into the following categories:
      Mobile Learning;
      Content Providers/Open Educational Resources;
      Tablets/Connected Classroom Infrastructure;
      Innovation Labs;
      Learning Management Systems; and
      Curricula.

Mobile Learning
Aliim
Smartphone Schools Program (Lebanon and Jordan)
http://aliim.org/
Aliim leverages technology and mentorship to provide greater access to safe, quality, and
relevant educational opportunities for refugees and marginalized youth affected by conflict or living in
post-conflict settings.

Aliim’s Smartphone Schools Program is the first mobile learning program that aims to empower Syrian
refugee girls aged 12–16 living in the Levant or migrating to other regions of the world, to continue their
education and access better economic opportunities through technology and a global network of mentors.
Aliim follows a theoretical framework to contextualize its curriculum so as to better address the specific
needs of Syrian refugees—with a focus on girls—and adapt to the resources available in a particular
conflict-affected setting.

This new program emphasizes conflict resilience and life skills, including basic literacy, numeracy, English
language, and entrepreneurial skills. Aliim believes that these skills will serve as the building blocks for
reconstructing individual lives, helping communities get back on their feet, and paving the way for new
economic activity to flourish after war.

The project is still in its early stages, but it has developed curriculum in partnership with Syrians, created the pilot
program plan, and developed the app wireframe and user experience design.

Creative Associates International & Et4d
Iqra
http://www.et4d.com/
A smartphone app for early-grade reading and learning, Iqra will have three key components: learning to
read in Arabic, practicing with activities, and reading stories.




                                                                                                                     22
Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation (Dubai)
A pilot project will load the best coursework on offer—in mathematics, science, foreign languages, and
literature—onto a mobile phone and place it in a student’s hand. The Maktoum Foundation’s project is
based on ‘Ustad Mobile’, a project originally piloted in Afghanistan (https://www.ustadmobile.com/). The
new project for Syrian refugees will be designed for low-end smartphones rather than feature phones, the
most basic mobile phone. The Ustad Mobile system works without requiring a mobile signal while in use,
which makes it suitable for even the most difficult regional situations. Ustad Mobile allows not only for
access to existing educational content but also for content creation using a downloadable editor. Ustad
also has the ability to track usage and progress among students and teachers, allowing for remote analysis
of the usage data.

This is evidently a new program under development, as the only information available on the web is a
mention in an editorial by Gordon Brown, UN Special Envoy on Global Education.

Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)
EduApp4Syria Competition
http://www.norad.no/en/front/thematic-areas/education/innovation/eduapp4syria/
Norway is leading an initiative to develop a smartphone application that can help Syrian children learn how
to read and improve their psychosocial wellbeing. This is taking the form of an international innovation
competition in cooperation with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), All Children
Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development, the mobile network operator Orange, and the INEE.

The innovation competition required bidders to submit an app prototype as well as a YouTube video in
addition to traditional tender documents. Moreover, bidders were expected to created open-source
products and license them under Creative Commons license (CC-BY). In spite of the unusual requirements,
Norad received 79 bids from 31 countries, including MENA countries.

Norad will fund 1–2 apps, not only their initial launch but through several iterations and improvements
based on user testing and feedback. The apps are aimed for homes rather than classrooms and are not tied
to any particular curriculum. They are to be dowloadable for offline use. The design goals are that the
games be seen by parents as appropriate and relevant, and by children as engaging and immersive, with
game qualities, rapid feedback, and clear goals.

This project has evidently not been launched yet, as the MENA page on Olé’s website includes the following
statement: “We are seeking a partner with whom we can join forces, share our knowledge and resources,
and thereby improve the quality and access of critical learning resources for all of the children.”

Kiron University
https://kiron.ngo/
Founded on the belief that the future of higher education is blended learning, a combination of offline and
online education, the study program at Kiron has two component parts.

First, students participate in two years of online study, from anywhere in the world and according to their
own schedule. Kiron’s innovative online platform offers rigorous and interactive courses, with five study
tracks to choose from. The university works with NGOs to provide internet access and study hubs in many
countries worldwide, and sponsors the purchase of laptops and other hardware for studying.

After completing the online study phase, and once their residence status has been finalized, students then
complete their degree with a year at one of our partner universities, with a choice of 23 universities in
diverse locations. These partner universities award credit points for many of Kiron's online courses,
meaning that they count towards the final degree.

The Kiron vision is not just to overcome the obstacles that refugees face in accessing university but to build
a better, more human-centered university that fosters personal growth. Our students benefit from access
to psychological counseling, mentoring programs, and student support services. We collaborate with
corporate organizations in host countries to provide internships and trainee programs for our students, to
help them make a seamless transition into work.

Education Media Company (Morocco)
Secondary school students in Morocco often struggle to find relevant information about the different
career options they have, procedures they have to follow after high school, and exams they need to take
to enter a certain school or university, among others. Education Media Company (EMC) was created in
2008 by a group of high school students to fill the information gap through online services. Today, it aims
to become the first online career guide in Morocco.

Education Media Company mainly operates through three websites:

       9rayti.com is EMC’s first website. Launched in 2008, its main objective was to provide course notes

International Rescue Committee
Innovative education: Mainstream school systems in neighboring countries cannot cope with the refugee
influx; and, with more than 80 percent of refugees living in urban areas rather than in camps, there is little
point to focusing on camp-based models of teaching. Instead, a more informal system, supported by
networks of local and refugee teachers—a model that was successfully pioneered in Congo and
Afghanistan—can provide accredited learning.

Exploiting technology: Syrians are generally literate, numerate, and technologically sophisticated. A
pioneering social-networking platform called Tawasul (‘Connection’), established by the International Red
Cross and the nonprofit news organization Internews, has been set up to help refugees help one another
through the exchange of information and advice.

Rumie
Learn Syria
https://www.rumie.org/learnsyria/
Rumie is a nonprofit organization that refines technology solutions for global NGO partners to make
education cheaper, better, and faster than existing alternatives. Rumie was founded in 2013. Its affordable
tablets are now being used by partners in thirteen countries around the world with plans underway in more.

Learn Syria is a project which provides teachers with a set of curated learning resources, including online
textbooks from the Syrian Education Commission, video lessons from Nafham and Tahrir Academy, Arabic
encyclopedias and dictionaries, and so forth, for students aged 8–14.

The materials have been curated by volunteer educators and vetted by Rumie. From the crowdsourced
library, local teachers select the final set of materials, which are mapped to curriculum standards of the
Syrian Education Commission. The materials are preloaded onto low-cost (US$50) Rumie tablets, backed
by Rumie’s LearnCloud (http://learncloud.rumie.org/), a repository of free educational resources.

Although the tablets are capable of connecting to WiFi, Rumie does not depend on connectivity. WiFi
remains expensive and unreliable in many places, but computer memory has become an inexpensive
commodity. Accordingly, memory capacity and battery life are emphasized. Preloading allows Rumie to
provide a library of materials for less than the cost of a single hard-copy textbook. Rumie does require that
local partners connect the devices to the Internet periodically, so that Rumie can collect data on usage and
other analytics.

                                                                                                          35
The project is being piloted with local partners. The partners are responsible for on-the-ground leadership
and classroom issues (pedagogical integration and curriculum mapping). Rumie focuses on software,
content, best practices. They are best at building the tool; local partners are best able to implement it. Even
though, Learn Syria takes place on Rumie tablets, they are low-cost. Rume is working with the Syrian Kids
Foundation to pilot the project at a school for Syrian refugees in Turkey. Rumie is working with Theirworld
to launch the project in Syria, and hopes to pilot soon in Jordan.

The tablets also allow teachers to track student performance and include content relevant to Syrians:

    •   e-textbooks from the Syrian Education Commission
    •   Video lessons from Nafham and Tahrir Academy
    •   Offline encyclopedia and dictionaries in Arabic
    •   Tons of other science, math, and other resources
    •   Space to load or create local content

Rwanda, it has now been used in a dozen back-to-school operations around the world, including in Lebanon
and Libya. The kit contains supplies and materials for a teacher and up to 40 students. The purpose of the
kit is to ensure the continuation of children's education by the first 72 hours of an emergency.

In addition to the basic school supplies, such as exercise books, pencils, erasers and scissors, the kit also
includes a wooden teaching clock, wooden cubes for counting, a wind-op/solar radio and a set of three
laminated posters (alphabet, multiplication and number tables). The kit is supplied in a locked aluminium
box, the lid of which can double as a blackboard when coated with the special paint included in the kit.
Using a locally developed teaching guide and curriculum, teachers can establish makeshift classrooms
almost anywhere.

The contents of the kit are culturally neutral, can be used anywhere in the world, and are often
supplemented by locally purchased products, such as books in local languages, toys, games and musical
instruments. Exercise books are printed without margins, so that children who write from left to right or
from right to left can use them. Another version of the kit, without the lockable metal box, the School-in-
a-Carton, is also available, as is a replenishment kit.
