8      Closing the Health Gaps for the Elderly: Promoting Health Equity and Social Inclusion in Thailand
                                              Executive Summary

Thailand’s health insurance and health protection schemes cover all Thai citizens and provide relatively comprehensive
benefits coverage. The universal health coverage (UC) scheme, in particular, offers good practices to other countries
that experience rapidly aging and NCDs transition, notably its provider payment mechanisms as well as drug and
medical technology assessment and prioritization mechanism that can help slow down rapidly rising costs, contributing
to sustainability of the scheme. However, there are still significant gaps with regard to non-medical costs and social
support to facilitate access to and utilization of health care services, e.g. the lack of caretakers, lack of affordable
transportation options to access health facilities. These gaps particularly affect poor elderly individuals and the elderly
in the oldest old group (over 80 years of age). This is supported by recent data that shows declining health utilization
rates among the members of the UC scheme in the oldest old group.

A key reason that contributes to the drop in utilization of health services among the oldest old group appears to be the
dependence on availability of caretakers and relatives to bring the elderly patients to a health facility. Other reasons
include the change of health-seeking behaviors after having been living and receiving treatments for NCDs for 10-15
years and the unwillingness to bother relatives to bring them to health facilities.

Lack of public and affordable transportation is the most important barrier to accessing health services among the
elderly in rural areas. These affect particularly the elderly poor, and the elderly who do not live nearby major highways
and roads on which public buses operate. The cost of renting private cars to take them to hospitals is simply not
affordable by many elderly households, even those who live above the poverty line. The elderly poor who live on
allowances from universal pension alone is the most vulnerable, as they need to use all of the monthly allowance to
pay for room rent and food, and these people do not have extra resources to travel to health facilities in time of sickness.

Special attention and support should be given to poor bed-ridden elderly and poor elderly with mobility constraints.
These elderly poor tend to suffer from chronic diseases that need intensive care and support but often they are not
able to travel to health facilities frequently due to difficulties to move, dependence on availability of caretakers to take
them to health facilities, and transportation costs. Hence, regular home visits by relevant health facility staff and village
health volunteers targeting these bed-ridden and poor elderly should be promoted, and support for transportation from
health centers or from LAOs should be provided to this group of the elderly to travel to health facilities as needed. More
balanced policy options to promote outreach and home visit services by health professionals and to facilitate travel to
health facilities when needed for the elderly should be considered.

Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs) can play an instrumental role in promoting access to health services for the
elderly, including providing health emergency vans for the community and arrange transportation for elderly poor to
access health facilities, as necessary. Furthermore, Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) are instrumental to the provision
of health-related support to the elderly in communities, particularly through home visits as well as organizing physical
exercise and health education sessions. Nevertheless, performance of LAOs and VHVs in providing social support
to improve access to health services for the elderly vary from communities to communities, depending on the local
leadership and their interests. Hence, efforts should be made for good practices from LAOs and VHVs to be shared
and promoted, as well as to utilize non-financial and financial incentives to encourage the replication of these good
practices in all communities across the country.

Key research questions are:

1. Why does out-patient utilization drop after the age of 75 for all health care schemes in Thailand?
2. Why does in-patient utilization of patients on the Universal Healthcare Coverage drop after age of
   82 while it continues to rise for patients with the Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme?
3. What are the causes of high out-of-pocket among the poor elderly?
4. What is the level of transportation cost paid by poor elderly to access health services?
5. To what extent have the transportation costs posed burdens to poor elderly to access health
   services? Is transportation a barrier to access health services by elderly patients?
6. What are key diseases that are not adequately covered by the current UC coverage, that require
   out-of-pocket expenditures?

                                Closing the Health Gaps for the Elderly: Promoting Health Equity and Social Inclusion in Thailand           13
To provide a big picture on utilization of health care services at the national level, the team analyzed Socio-Economic Survey
(SES) 2011, which is the national household survey in Thailand that collected information on household income as well as health
expenditures. However, it must be cautioned that there is no direct health care utilization information available at the individual level
in SES, and hence the analysis indicates the health utilization based on the health expenditures on in-patient or out-patient services
of households with elderly members (aged 60 years and over), and not exactly health utilization of elderly individuals. In other
words, the information presented here is the share of the elderly who are living in a household with any health service utilization.
Similarly, analyses on incidence of catastrophic health expenditures among the Elderly (60+) show the share of the elderly (60+)
living in households with catastrophic payment.

Key findings on utilization of health services
1. According to SES 2011, there are gaps in                           utilization of out-patient care services, with the

SES 2011 also indicates that co-residence with                        care services among the elderly with higher
adult children played a significant factor in the                     incomes (top two quintiles), as illustrated in
level of utilization of out-patient and in-patient                    Figure 5. This might partly be attributed to the
care services among poorer households with                            ability of the richer elderly who do not live with

  This figure was prepared by Yang Huang. For SES, there is no health care utilization information at individual level, which
means the team could not disaggregate the figures by gender. The team plotted household in-patient admission rates and
household out-patient visit rates against household expenditure per capita quintiles for people aged 60 and above. In other words,
the team shows here the share of the elderly who are living in a household with any health service utilization. The team ranked
expenditure per capita at household level to define quintiles.

  Non-elderly UC members are expected to contribute THB 30 per each visit to a health facility, but they have an option to sign a
declaration that they are not willing/able to contribute THB 30 per each visit at the health facility.

  Catastrophic health expenditures in the study are defined as having health expenditures higher than 10% of total expenditures.
6 This figure was prepared by Yang Huang. Due to the limitation of SES as mentioned earlier, the figures show the share of the
elderly (60+) living in households with catastrophic health payment, which is taken as a proxy for incidence of catastrophic health
expenditures among elderly people.

  The team analyzed Socio-Economic Survey (SES) 2011, which is the only national household survey in Thailand that collected
information on household income as well as health expenditures. However, it must be cautioned that there is no direct health care
utilization information available at the individual level in SES, and hence the analysis indicates the health utilization based on the
health expenditures on in-patient or out-patient services of households with elderly members (aged 60 years and over), and not
exactly health utilization of the elderly individuals. In other words, the information presented here is the share of the elderly who
are living in a household with any health service utilization. Hence, the information on health utilization of elderly individuals will be
provided in the qualitative assessment results presented below.
