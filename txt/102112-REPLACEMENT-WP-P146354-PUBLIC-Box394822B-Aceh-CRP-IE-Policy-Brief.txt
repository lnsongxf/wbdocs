Financial and other material support for the Community Rangers Program
(CRP) Impact Evaluation came from the World Bank Consolidating Peaceful
Development in Aceh Trust Fund, the World Bank Office in Indonesia, and
World Bank Development Economics-Operations and Strategy/ Development
Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME).
Laura Paler (Department of Political Science, University of Pittsburgh), Cyrus
Samii (Department of Political Science, New York University), Matthew Lisiecki
(consulting analyst for the project) and Adrian Morel (Social Development
Program, World Bank, Indonesia) prepared this report. Larry Chavis (Kenan
Flagler School of Business, University of North Carolina) was part of the team
that, along with Paler and Samii, designed and led the implementation of the
evaluation since its inception in 2010 through endline data collection in 2013.
Paler and Samii developed the analysis plan, which was circulated publicly in
2013-14 prior to receipt of the endline data in 2014. Paler, Samii, and Lisiecki
carried out the data analysis and drafting of this report in 2014.
Suci Landon served admirably as the CRP Impact Evaluation Field Coordinator.
We received field support from the World Bank staff in the Banda Aceh office,
including Muslahuddin Daud and Didit Setiawan. Erin Lin (Department of
Politics, Princeton University) worked as field coordinator during the pilot
phase of the impact evaluation. Ryan Knox (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) developed the satellite forest imagery for use in our analysis.
The evaluation was carried out in close cooperation with Fauna and Flora
International (FFl), the lead implementing organization for the CRP. We are
grateful to the FFI team, led by Matthew Linkie, for working with us through
every stage of the evaluation. Baseline and endline surveys were conducted
by JRI Research, Indonesia, under the direction of Rita Maria. Endline
environmental assessments were carried out by Perkumpulan Rincong under
the direction of Helene Barnes.
We received helpful feedback on the evaluation design and analysis plan
from Peter Aronow, Radu Ban, Grant Gordon, Macartan Humphreys, Arianna
Legovini, Jacob Shapiro, Johannes Urplainen, and seminar participants at
the DIME Development Impact Evaluation in Fragile States workshop (Dubai,
2010), Columbia University Seminar on the Study of Development Strategies
(New York, 2011), Columbia University Workshop on Field Experiments in
Environment and Energy (New York, 2013), and Experiments in Governance
and Politics at University of California, Berkeley (2014). We received excellent
comments on the report from Tim Brown, Pablo Cuevas, and Audrey Sacks.
The findings and interpretations in this report are entirely those of the
authors. They do not necessarily reflect the views of any of the above-named
organizations, affiliated entities, or other individuals.

management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries". It is a mechanism that has been under negotiation by the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2005, with the objective of mitigating climate change through reducing net emissions of
greenhouse gases through enhanced forest management in developing countries.

3The Multi-Stakeholder Review (MSR) of Post-conflict Programming in Aceh was undertaken by the Aceh Peace-Reintegration Board (BRA), the National
Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), AusAID, DFID, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, UNDP, the USAID-SERASI Program and the World
Bank between May 2008 and December 2009 with IOM contributing in the initial phase. Four years on from the Helsinki MoU, it provides a framework for future
policies and programs to consolidate peace and development in Aceh. The MSR employs a comprehensive framework to identify post-conflict needs and issues
in Aceh and ways to most effectively respond to them. It considers issues relating to livelihoods and the economy, politics, security and social cohesion, and
governance and institutions. This allows for a consideration of the policies and programs that can build the foundations for sustainable peace and development
in post-conflict Aceh. The MSR final report was published and disseminated in July 2010.

CRP IMPLEMENTATION


﻿CRP IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we discuss the implementation of the CRP.
First, we assess whether people in non-CRP localities
had exposure to the program, which allows us to discuss
possible spillover effects. Second, we examine attitudes
towards the program within treated localities and among
youths selected to become rangers. Supporting this is a
brief summary of the results of analysis of implementation,
while a more detailed discussion with tables and figures
can be found in Annex 4.19
4.1 Reported exposure to the CRP
We have used data from three sources, namely village
head, household head and youth surveys, to investigate:
(1) the extent to which CRP activities were actually

which they were confined to CRP locations or whether
they spill over into neighboring areas. We compare data
from various indicators to ascertain differences between
the treatment group and the two non-CRP control groups
(consisting of mukim in Ulu Masen and Leuser) for
household heads and village heads. In general, we find
that the program was highly visible in treated communities
and that spillovers were very limited, although the survey
data suggest that spillovers may have occurred to a limited
degree among village elites.
For example, in a survey of household heads, answers to
the CRP awareness questions differed sharply between
the treatment group and the control group. Household
heads in CRP villages were far more likely to have heard of
the CRP, while household heads in non-CRP villages in Ulu
Masen were only slightly more likely to have heard of the
CRP than their counterparts in Leuser. In other words, there
was a little spillover in knowledge of the CRP program in
control villages in Ulu Masen compared with pure control
villages in Leuser. The question on seeing CRP patrols
shows similar differences between villages in different
treatment conditions.

OUTCOMES AND
IMPACT ESTIMATES


﻿OUTCOMES AND IMPACT ESTIMATES
The following sections report estimated impacts of the
program on social and environmental outcomes. We
begin by presenting summary statistics for the outcomes
of interest and then follow with the impact estimates. The
presentation of results follows the listing of outcomes in
Table 1 and Table 2-that is, we first present results with
respect to social and economic outcomes before turning
to environmental outcomes.
5.1 Social Outcomes
We begin with economic and social impacts, namely
impacts on a youth's economic outcomes; roots in the
community; relations with family and friends, future
outlook and self-esteem; acceptance by the community;
Female rangers in Pidie.                             engagement in risky or illegal behavior; and other facets
of integration into the community.
5.1.1 Summary Statistics
The summary statistics on social outcomes provide a
backdrop against which we can interpret impact estimates.
For the most part, youths' relations with their communities
appear to be quite positive. Economic circumstances
were seen as limited both by youths themselves and by
their community members, but youths tended to express
optimism for the future.
5.1.1.1 Youth survey
Table 3 shows summary statistics for the outcome variables
measured in the post-CRP implementation youth surveys
(which includes responses from both rangers and non-
rangers). With regard to economic circumstances, there
are mixed indicators on the poverty level of ranger
candidates. About half of respondents do not have access
to water from a protected source or cook with gas or
electricity (as opposed to wood or coal), which suggests a
substantial share of relatively poor participants, although
the high rates of high quality floor and wall materials mean
that few respondents are from extremely poor households.
