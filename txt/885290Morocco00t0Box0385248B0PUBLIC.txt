I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Morocco
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Morocco regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Morocco;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Morocco;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Morocco; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Morocco.

       Use data to help inform the Morocco country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In June thru August 2012, 310 stakeholders of the World Bank in Morocco were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the Prime Minister; the
office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
departments, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 96 stakeholders
participated in the country survey (31%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Morocco, their overall attitudes toward the
Bank, the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, the Bank’s knowledge, working with the
World Bank, the Bank’s future role in Morocco, and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Morocco.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Morocco: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Morocco was
   headed in the right or wrong direction, the three most important development priorities, and
   which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generate economic growth.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Morocco, Bank staff preparedness,
   the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Morocco, with which groups the Bank should
   work more in Morocco, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Morocco, the extent to
   which the Bank meets Morocco’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and
   the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-one development areas, such as economic
   growth. Respondents were also asked to indicate the greatest obstacles to more effective
   governance and greater job creation in Morocco, the areas related to governance and job
   creation that the Bank should spend greater attention on, and whether respondents would like
   to see more or less World Bank involvement in job creation in Morocco.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Morocco: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Morocco in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Morocco.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate whether the
   government is doing enough to increase civil society participation in Morocco, the greatest
   obstacles to greater civil society participation, where they get information about economic
   and social development issues, how they prefer to receive information from the Bank, their
   access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website and PICs.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the
   Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Morocco, and their geographic location.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in five of these thirty-one development areas. For the most part, employees
        of ministries and respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies had the highest
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas whereas respondents from the
        media, academia/research institutes, and other organizations tended to have significantly
        lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in these areas. Those areas for which there
        were significant stakeholder group differences were:
                 Domestic private sector development;
                 Equality of opportunity;
                 Health;
                 Rural/agriculture development; and
                 Education.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Morocco, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Morocco. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at energy;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at financial markets; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Morocco, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at financial markets;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural/agricultural development.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in MOROCCO or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The
following survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in MOROCCO, greater insight into
how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical
stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in MOROCCO. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in MOROCCO. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
