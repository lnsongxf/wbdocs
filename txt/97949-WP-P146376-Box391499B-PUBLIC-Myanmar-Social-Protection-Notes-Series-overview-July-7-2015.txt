       the population. This is well below the global average: on average, low-income coun-
       tries spend 1.1 percent, while African countries spend 1.7 percent. To date, develop-
       ment partners (DPs) have largely been responsible for social assistance provision.
       This is slowly changing with the recent introduction of government pilot programs
       to ensure equitable and affordable access to health and education. Preliminary evi-
       dence indicates these are meeting the desired objectives.

    •	 Government spending on social security provisions for workers in the formal sector
       is about 0.6 percent of GDP, reaching just about 3 percent of the population. While
       coverage and benefit levels are low, the proposed reforms raise concerns of fiscal sus-
       tainability. The proposed provisions carry the risk of crowding out social assistance
       spending while further straining developing delivery systems.

    In the short to medium term, it will be important to start putting in place the core
    building blocks of an effective, responsive, and sustainable social protection system for
    Myanmar. These include the following:

    •	 A high-level policy coordination mechanism for policy coherence and sustainable
       financing. This is critical to avoid the risk of costly and unsustainable parallel systems
       being developed for social security provision. It is also important to support social
       assistance expansion by pooling government and DP resources, and by strengthening
       the link between social protection and poverty reduction.

    •	 A substantial ‘social assistance block’, with the progressive expansion of social as-
       sistance coverage transitioning from DP-led to government-led social assistance
       provision. This would include scaling up recently introduced pilot programs (such as
       stipends), as well as the introduction of new pilot programs that can address unmet
       needs. The most likely candidate for the latter is a PWP, given its dual objectives of
       employment generation and asset creation, and the positive experience of DPs in
       implementing PWPs in Myanmar.

    •	 A modest ‘social security block’ in the short to medium term, as the demographic
       outlook in Myanmar provides the space for a gradual expansion of social security
       coverage. A gradual transition will also allow the space to build systems and capac-
       ity for managing and investing funds well, to avoid compromising the longer-term
       finances of the system (especially pensions). In the long term, gradual integration and
       coverage expansion in a sustainable manner.

    Developing a social protection system can bring important payoffs to Myanmar’s de-
    velopment agenda. An effective social protection system will provide adequate coverage
    of beneficiaries in need of assistance, improve responsiveness of programs to accommo-
    date those made newly vulnerable because of systemic shocks, and effectively connect
    beneficiaries of social protection programs to additional productive opportunities.

2.	A profile of risk and vulnerability in Myanmar:
	 identifying policy priorities2
     Myanmar is a country in transition with great regional diversity. It is still a relatively young
     country, with the highest share of its population at active working age. Its more pressing
     needs are the following: a) reducing the incidence of poverty and improving human devel-
     opment outcomes, with a particular emphasis on reaching the poor and vulnerable. The
     poor fare worse when it comes to health, nutrition, and education outcomes; and b) ad-
     dressing the insecurity of incomes and developing mechanisms to reduce exposure to risks
     and ability to cope with ill-health, disasters, and other shocks.

Despite improvements, child malnutrition in
Myanmar remains high; young children from
poorer households fare worse. In 2009/10, 23
percent of children were underweight, 35 per-
cent were stunted, and 8 percent wasted (UNI-
CEF and MNPED, 2010).4 As many as 33 per-
cent of children from households in the poorest
wealth quintile were underweight compared
with only 14 percent of children from the rich-
est quintile (see Figure 1). There are also signifi-
cant differences in access to health care before
and during delivery.

Most children in Myanmar are enrolled in pri-
mary school, but many children, especially
those from poorer families, drop out of school
in the transition between primary and second-
ary school (see Figure 1). Only 29 percent of
children from households in the poorest quin-
tile were enrolled in secondary school, com-
pared with 80 percent of those from the richest
quintile. Financial constraints play an impor-
tant role (Enlightened Myanmar Research and

     Social protection policies and programs can play an important role in Myanmar’s
     strategy for poverty reduction and people-centered development. Many countries
     have used a broad range of social protection programs to achieve their develop-
     ment goals, particularly on poverty reduction and inclusive growth. These include
     cash transfers (CTs), school-feeding, public works programs (PWPs), social secu-

   Box 1: Promoting resilience, equity, and opportunity through social protection

   Resilience to risks and shocks can be built through social security and social assistance programs that
   minimize the negative impact of economic shocks on individuals and families. Examples of these pro-
   grams include old-age pensions, unemployment and disability insurance, and scalable PWPs.

   Equity for the poor and vulnerable can be achieved through social assistance programs such as CTs,
   food transfers, and welfare services that help protect against destitution, promote equality of oppor-
   tunity, and address chronic poverty.

   Opportunity for all is achieved by promoting equitable and affordable access to nutrition, health, and
   education services for all, including the poor and vulnerable, and by helping men and women access

4.	Myanmar’s current social protection system


  Core building blocks of Myanmar’s social protection system need to be further developed in
  order to address the following main challenges: providing adequate coverage of beneficiaries
  in need of assistance, improving responsiveness of programs to accommodate those made
  newly vulnerable because of systemic shocks, and effectively connecting beneficiaries of so-
  cial protection programs to productive opportunities.

  Social protection policies have recently been formulated, emphasizing the role of social pro-
  tection in achieving Myanmar’s goals of poverty reduction and inclusive growth. However,
  the process is fragmented across ministries and the social protection system does not yet fully
  address the priorities identified in the previous sections.

  Despite recent increases, government spending on social assistance is only 0.02 percent of
  GDP – well below the global and regional average. Social assistance programs reach only
  0.1 percent of the population. The government has recently introduced CT pilots to promote
  equitable and affordable access to education and health services. Preliminary evidence indi-
  cates these are meeting the desired objectives. In addition, DPs have extensive experience of
  implementing social assistance programs in Myanmar. These can provide valuable insights to
  the government in building the ‘social assistance block’ of the social protection system.

  The ‘social security block’ of the social protection system is comparatively more developed,
  but faces the challenge of low coverage and benefit adequacy, while the proposed reforms
  raise further concerns of fiscal sustainability. Government spending on social security provi-
  sions workers in the formal sector is about 0.6 percent of GDP, reaching just about 3 percent
  of the population. Multiple and generous provisions carry the risk of crowding out social as-
  sistance spending while further straining developing delivery systems.

     million grade 1-11 students were to be provided stipends at the current level of benefits, an estimated budget of MMK500 billion
     would be required. The budget in 2014 was MMK3 billion; even with the doubling to MMK7 billion in 2015, the current outlay is
     only about 1.5 percent of the estimated budget required for categorical targeting of all school-age children.

     country. There are some circumstances where food-based benefits are more appropriate, such as in remote areas or areas with
     insecurity and/or social tensions. It is important for new programs to assess local contexts to determine which transfer modality is
     the most appropriate. See Notes on ‘The experience of cash transfers in Myanmar’ and ‘Developing scalable and transparent ben-

5.	Opportunities and challenges in building an effective 		
	 social protection system for Myanmar

  Developing a social protection system can bring important payoffs to a country's develop-
  ment agenda. For Myanmar, this will mean putting the core building blocks in place to ad-
  dress the risks and vulnerabilities facing its people.

  At the program level, this would imply the following: a) In the short to medium term, pro-
  gressive development and expansion of social assistance coverage through government sys-
  tems. This would include scaling up recently introduced pilot programs (such as stipends), as
  well as the introduction of new pilot programs that can address unmet needs. The most likely
  candidate for the latter is a PWP, given its dual objectives of employment generation and
  asset creation, and the positive experience of DPs in implementing PWPs in Myanmar; b) in
  the long term, gradual integration and coverage expansion of the pension and SSB schemes
  in a sustainable manner.

  Taking this system-oriented approach in Myanmar will need the involvement of several insti-
  tutions and require coordination within government, rather than introducing several unco-
  ordinated programs supported by DPs.

  For pensions and SSB schemes, the main priority in the short to medium term would be to build on existing initiatives to fur-
  ther simplify and automate processes. In the long run, these delivery systems need gradually to become more client-centered
  through further simplification, with greater transparency, and with minimal compliance burden.

  Conversely, some of the reforms under consideration cannot be implemented without the right processes and systems. In the
  medium to long term, substantial improvements will be required. For example, introducing a new DC scheme rests on the abil-
  ity to track individual civil servants’ salaries, contributions, and pensions, so that contributions and accumulated benefits can
  be tied to individual accounts. As a result, investments will be required to upgrade the human resource MIS, an activity that
  has implications beyond pensions. Capacity for managing and regulating pensions and SSB funds will also need to be gradually
  developed.
