Executive Summary

Lighting Africa has undertaken a small pilot project in the Nigerian Healthcare Sector where
thirty-six Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) across the three participating states of
Adamawa, Nasarawa and Ondo, received solar lanterns that have met Lighting Global’s
Minimum Quality Standards. The project was implemented under the Nigerian State Health
Investment Project (P120798).

The pilot project aims at changing perceptions and raising awareness among users that solar
technology is robust and works properly, and to build confidence among users in the health
centers. The pilot project was implemented with the premise that the deployment of off-
grid lighting products could improve the lighting situation in health centers and enhance 24-
hour service.

The pilot project involved: (i) the procurement and distribution of solar lanterns to 36 health
centers 1; (ii) training Ministry of Health staff, including the midwives and primary health
care staff from 36 health centers, as well as staff at the Transmission Company of Nigeria,
Project Management Unit (PMU) in Abuja on the off-grid lighting products selected for
deployment; (iii) monitoring the deployment and use of solar lanterns in the selected states.
This report is a summary of feedback on the outcome of the deployment of solar lanterns in
health centers, the benefits and impact created, as well as lessons learnt.

The findings reveal that the number of working hours for midwives increased by up to 30%
with the introduction of the quality-verified solar lanterns. The solar lanterns replaced the
previously used inefficient and unreliable options such as wax candles, flashlights, and fossil
fuel kerosene lanterns. These options were often not bright enough and emit unhealthy
fumes. The use of the quality-verified lanterns allowed for efficient use and turn-around
time for patient examination, evaluation and treatment.

  118 solar lanterns that meet Lighting Global Minimum Quality Standards were deployed to the 36
participating health care centers. The four products deployed were: 1) Barefoot PowaPack 5W; 2) Schneider
Electric In-Diya Solar Home Lighting System, 3) d.light S300 and 4) Greenlight Planet’s Sun King Pro. Each of the
participating centers received one micro solar home system and 2 portable lanterns for the midwives.



                                                                                                                2
The demand for the quality-verified lamps increased significantly amongst the user
participants of the pilot project. This included midwives, patients, and healthcare
administrators across the participating health care agencies.

It has also become evident that access to reliable electricity plays a major role in
development. The findings of the pilot survey suggest that quality affordable solar lanterns
would lead to considerable service improvement within the Nigerian Healthcare sector.

Following the success of the Pilot program, the Lighting Africa team recommends scaling up
the activity to cover primary healthcare centers across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria.
This would not only increase awareness of the products, but would also increase the
demand of the products in the public and private healthcare sectors.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
1.1    Background

Lighting Africa, a joint IFC and World Bank program, seeks to accelerate the development of
the commercial off-grid lighting market in Sub-Saharan Africa as part of the World Bank
Group’s wider effort to improve access to energy. Lighting Africa is helping to mobilize the
private sector to build sustainable markets to provide the rural and urban poor in Sub-
Saharan Africa with safe, affordable, and modern off-grid lighting. The longer-term goal is to
eliminate market barriers for the private sector in order to reach 250 million people in Africa
by 2030 with off-grid lighting solutions, who are currently without electricity, using fuel-
based lighting.

The Nigerian Energy Policy Report of 2003 estimates that less than 40% of the country’s
total population (approximately 170 million people) is connected to the national electricity
grid. Furthermore, only 10% of rural households have access to electricity. Electricity supply
across the country remains unstable with prolonged periods of power outage.

Lighting Africa is undertaking a pilot project in the Nigeria health sector, deploying modern
off-grid lighting products in 36 health centers to raise awareness and change the perception
among the users by demonstrating that the technology is ready, robust and offers
significant benefit in the provision of 24-hour service in the rural primary health care sector
in Nigeria.

1.2    Justification for the pilot intervention

The pilot intervention focuses on driving innovation in the provision of lighting needs in the
rural health sector in Nigeria by using environmentally friendly technology, in line with the
current strategic transformation of the energy sector in Nigeria, a key component of the
government’s Green growth socio-economic agenda (Nigerian Vision 20: 2020 Initiative).
The health and energy sectors are crucial to the Nigerian economic development agenda.
One of the major challenges facing rural healthcare service provision in Nigeria is the need
for adequate lighting – after dark.

Lighting Africa has undertaken a small pilot project in the health sector impacting 36 health
centers across 3 states in Nigeria. The 36 participating Primary Healthcare Centers in rural
areas received quality-verified solar lanterns and are used as a test bed to try innovative
approaches under the Nigeria State Health Investment Project (P120798).

The pilot project could demonstrate a key way to address some of the major barriers to the
uptake of solar lighting technology, such as low-level awareness, lack of trust and
confidence in the products, and low market penetration. This strategy is intended to
stimulate demand and have a sustainable catalytic effect on the market.

1.3    Scope and approach


Each centre received one micro solar home system (SHS) and 2 portable lanterns for the
midwives. The 4 products deployed were: Barefoot PowaPack 5W, Schneider Electric In-Diya
Solar Home Lighting System, d.light S300 and the Greenlight Planet Sun King Pro.

End user training was provided to the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Transmission
Company of Nigeria (TCN) and to the 36 participating health care centres at the respective
state primary health care agencies. After three weeks of deploying the solar lanterns, a
monitoring visit was held to verify correct usage of the products.

Following the completion of deployment of the products in 36 centers, a survey was
undertaken targeting staff and patients to obtain their feedback on the usage and
performance of products. This report discusses the findings of the product feedback survey,
providing an evaluation of the lessons learnt, challenges faced, and key issues to be
addressed. This report draws conclusions on the usefulness and benefits of the Lighting

health care sector.


2.0     Training and Deployment

Training on the products was provided to the staff of the Project Management Unit of the
TCN, staff of the participating State Health Care Agencies, as well as staff and midwives
across the 36 participating health care centers in Adamawa, Nasarawa, and Ondo States in
Nigeria 2.

The PMU currently manages all World Bank Energy Sector Projects in Nigeria. The PMU and
the State Ministries of Health in collaboration with World Bank Consultants carried out the
deployment logistics, distribution and hand-over of the products to the 36 heath centers
across Nigeria.

The selected products for the pilot intervention lent themselves to the end-user
requirements of the rural health sector in Nigeria in terms of brightness, runtime, quality
and durability, and the capacity to charge phones, The four (4) products deployed to the 36
health care centers were: Barefoot PowaPack 5W, Schneider Electric In-Diya Solar Home
Lighting System, d.light S300, and Greenlight Planet’s Sun King Pro. Midwives and other
health care staff were trained and instructed on how to use the above products in an
appropriate and effective way.

 The state primary healthcare staff in consultation with the individual healthcare centers identified
key potential end-user health staff, such as (i) Midwives that work in delivery units; (ii) Nurses that
attend to patients in the outpatient treatment unit; (iii) Nurses and Midwives that work the night
shifts.

2.1        Nigerian Energy Project Management Unit (PMU) Abuja

A formal training of trainers (TOT) workshop was held at the PMU office in Abuja targeting
twelve engineers and three Procurement officers as part of this initiative. The training was
very successful and the participants had no difficulty in appreciating the proper use of all
four products.

2.2       Adamawa State Primary Health Care Agency

Nineteen midwives and six other health care staff participated in a formal training workshop
held at the Adamawa Primary Health Care Agency in Yola, Nigeria. Due to the relatively large
number of interested participants, two workshop sessions were held. The training was
generally successful; the participants were mainly female midwives.

The participants were impressed with all the products and wanted to purchase them,
although they had difficulty connecting one of the products. A focus group discussion was
held after the training session. Participants could immediately see how these solar lanterns
could be of benefit to their health centers. Primary Health Care (PHC) Staff were of the
opinion that the lanterns could provide lighting for health centers, enabling the
performance of major tasks at night. The products could be beneficial to their lifestyles,
both at work and at home through provision of light and charging mobile phones. The ability
to communicate by mobile phone was crucial in the health care sector round-the-clock
service provision. The lanterns offer clean light, and are thus effective for children and users
with respiratory difficulties. Figure 5 and 6 show participants, during the training exercise
described above.

2.3       Ondo State Primary Health Care Agency


Forty midwives and three healthcare administrators were trained in a formal workshop
session held at the Ondo Primary Health Care Agency in Akure Nigeria. Four workshop
sessions were held due to the large number of participants who were mainly female
midwives (thirty five female and five male midwives). The midwives had no difficulty with
the understanding of the operation and use of the four products, although they had
challenges connecting one of them.

The participants liked all the products and were interested in purchasing the samples. A
focus group session held with the trainees indicates that the lanterns could benefit the PHCs
in offering effective round-the-clock services by providing clean lighting. As in the other
states, the trainees envisaged the beneficial role of lanterns to their lifestyles both at work
and at home. They particularly liked that these products had the capability to charge their
phones. The midwives argued that the ability to communicate with patients was a plus in
meeting their overall objectives in Ondo State Primary Healthcare Agency.

2.4       Nasarawa State Health Care Agency

Nineteen midwives and four other health care staff were trained in a formal workshop
session held at the Nasarawa Primary Health Care Agency in Lafia Nigeria. Two workshop
sessions were held due to the large number of participants. The training was generally
successful; the participants were mainly female midwives. The midwives had no difficulty
with the operation and understanding of the proper use of three of the four products, but
had difficulty configuring one of them.

The PHC staff were pleased with the quality-approved solar lanterns. Participants could
envisage how the products could be of benefit to the health care sector in providing lighting


                                                                                                     11
at night to enable them perform key tasks and procedures more efficiently and effectively.
At maximum, the lamps are able to provide over 10 hours of light. The participants
expressed how these lanterns could be beneficial to their lifestyles both at work and at
home. They were particularly impressed with the capability of these products to charge
mobile phones. The ability to communicate by phone is crucial in the health care sector.

3.0      Monitoring and Evaluation
3.1      Overview
The World Bank consultant conducted structured baseline interviews with midwives,
patients and other Primary Health care staff before implementation. Preliminary interviews
were carried out during the training and deployment phase. This was aimed at obtaining
baseline opinions and attitudes and awareness of the 4 products. Focus group meetings
were also carried out as part of this study.

After the products had been deployed for four weeks, visits were made to 12 health care
centers to monitor the usage of the solar lanterns. Interviews were carried out with
midwives and patients.

3.2      Result of Baseline Evaluation Studies

The training, deployment and use of the products at the health care centers raised
awareness of and exposure to the 4 products among the Primary Healthcare staff and
patients. The solar lighting products deployed in the 36 PHCs provided an adequate level of
lighting/ illumination for the PHC staff to perform their activities more accurately and also
more quickly.

3.2.1 Outcome of the intervention

•     Awareness creation: The training, deployment and use of the products at the health
      care centers raised awareness of and exposure to these 4 products among the Primary
      Healthcare staff and patients.

•     Replacement of unreliable lighting options: The deployed solar lighting products
      replaced the inefficient and unreliable alternatives, such as wax candles, flashlights and
      kerosene lanterns, that were previously used by PHCs. These unreliable lighting
      alternatives, which are carbon emitters, also provided poor quality lighting. This sort of
      lighting slowed down the pace and quality of the midwives’ work in tasks such as:
      childbirth, suturing, incision and drainage, and other minor surgical procedures.

•     Increase in Efficiency: The PHC see an average of ten patients after nightfall every day.
      The bigger centres attended an average of 15-20 patients after nightfall each day, whilst
      the smaller PHC tend to see between 5-10 patients after nightfall per day. These
      numbers have largely remained the same before and after the intervention. All the
      Primary Health Care centers (PHCs) that took part in the survey already provided a 24-
      hour round-the-clock service. However, the quality-verified products improved the
      efficiency with which midwives attended to patients after dark in the health centers.
      This was highlighted in exit interviews and focus group discussions across the
      participating centers.


                                                                                             13
3.2.2 Overall Product performance:

(a)    General satisfaction with products

PHCs that took part in this study were generally satisfied with the products surveyed.
However, they did indicate some concerns with one of the products. In particular it was
noted that one product was more complex to set up than the others. Furthermore, this
product took longer to charge, and yet discharged in less time than the others.

(b)    The adequacy of the lighting levels for task performance:

All four products were evaluated and found to be generally satisfactory. The brightness/
adequacy of the lighting levels were sufficient to examine and evaluate patients after sunset
/ at night at all the PHCs that took part in this study. All four products were said to be bright
enough to assist with childbirth and other tasks performed at the PHCs after sunset. This
observation is consistent across the 36 PHCs that took part in the survey.

(c).   Battery charging and discharge

The average length of time taken to fully charge batteries for the deployed lanterns was
evaluated. The products took, on average, between 8 – 10.5 hours to charge, although one
product took relatively longer, needing 12 – 14 hours for a full charge.

On average, it took the products relatively fewer hours to recharge the batteries in
Nasarawa and Adamawa State as compared to Ondo state. The reason for this may be
attributed to the fact that Nasarawa and Adamawa have more sun hours per day –
approximately 5 - 5.5 hours a day – than in Ondo state, which has 3.5 – 4 sun hours per day.
Ondo state is also characterized by cloud-cover, particularly during rainy seasons. The
northern states of Adamawa and Nasarawa mainly have clear skies in most parts of the year.

The four products were used for an average of between 10 – 12 hours daily in grid
connected PHCs and slightly longer in off-grid locations. However, one product can go for up
to 100 hours on the “bed light” setting, and another could only be used for approximately 7
– 8 hours once the battery was fully charged, even though this product took nearly twice as
long as the other systems to fully recharge its battery in the same locations

This was the experience amongst the user groups in most of the PHCs across the
participating state primary health care agencies. The State Primary Healthcare Agencies that
took part in an exit interview indicated that they would like to use the product for an
average of 12 hours daily, as did the PHCs.

(d)    Phone charging




                                                                                              14
The phone charging capacity was found to be very useful and innovative. The products were
used by staff and patients to recharge their phones, therefore enabling effective
communication between PHC staff as well as patients, particularly in off-grid locations. The
lanterns provided the opportunity to charge their phones at work. Some staff who live in
off-grid locations previously charged their phones with commercial phone charging vendors.
However, with the introduction of these products they can now charge their phones at
work, saving both time and money.

Grid-connected PHCs in the rural areas experience several hours, sometimes several days of
mains power outage. In the rainy season the power outage in grid-connected PHCs tends to
be more frequent and last for longer periods. Therefore, the phone charging facilities of the
lantern was very useful in 33 of the 36 PHCs that took part in this pilot.

(d)     Levels of satisfaction with products

Levels of satisfaction with the products for both lighting a mobile charging were recorded.
The overall performance was scored by the 36 PHCs that took part in this study on a scale of
1-5, where 1= Not Satisfactory; 3= Satisfactory; and 5 = Very Satisfactory.

In general, the levels of satisfaction were high, with 3 products receiving ratings above
“Satisfactory.” Thirty-one (31) out of the thirty-six (36) respondents rated two of the products as
very satisfactory (5 on the scale), whilst 5 of the respondents scored them a 4. This was attributed to
the relatively short time it takes to fully recharge the batteries, the duration it takes for the batteries
to completely discharge while the lamp is in continuous use, the adequacy of the lighting level, and
the user friendliness of these products.



(e)     Product design, durability, affordability and aftersales support

A qualitative survey was carried out as part of this study regarding overall performance and product
quality. The respondent generally scored ‘After Sale Support’ very low because they were not aware
of any after sale support services offered by the suppliers of these or similar products. However, a
few of the respondents where made to understand by word-of-mouth that two of the companies
offered support services in Abuja and Lagos.

The Health Care Agencies were provided with the contact details of the suppliers of these products,
and advice was given to them on how they might get support with regards to these products.

3.4     Impact of Products on PHCs Service Delivery
There was no evidence to suggest that a higher number of patients were seen after nightfall
following the introduction of the quality-verified solar lanterns. The PHCs essentially offer a
round-the-clock service.

However, the task and activities across the 36 PHCs were now performed much more
efficiently and effectively following the introduction of the quality-verified solar lanterns in



                                                                                                        15
this pilot activity. The activities that recorded significant benefits following the introduction
of these products after dusk, include the following:

      •   Childbirth
      •   Suturing
      •   I&D
      •   Circumcision
      •   Minor surgical procedures
      •   Patient clerking
      •   Examination and Evaluation of patients
      •   Drug dispensing.

The use of the lanterns allowed for efficient turn-around time for patient examination,
evaluation and treatment. This experience was widely observed by midwives across the 36
participating health centers in Nigeria. The main drivers for the success of the lanterns in
this study was mainly attributed (by the users) to the brightness of the products, and the
duration it takes the battery to completely discharge. The energy-use of the lanterns is free
and renewable, this came across as a significant economic and environmental benefit – as
indicated by 93% of users in a survey carried out as part of this study (midwives, patients
and healthcare administrators).

3.5       Increased demand of products/ private sales

There is anecdotal evidence of increased demand. The demand created during training and
demonstration of products led to the state coordinators to compile names of people
interested in purchasing solar lanterns. Orders for quality-verified products were placed
with vendors whose details were provided by trainers at the request of state coordinators.
About 100 products were sold by vendors to health staff in the first 6 weeks. Total petrol
stations in participating states confirmed an increase in demand of quality-verified products
such as the Sunking Pro, but were not able to provide numbers of products sold.


4.0       Conclusions and recommendations

The pilot project has been successful in demonstrating and raising awareness among the
health service providers and users that modern off-grid lighting technology is robust and
works properly, and in building confidence of users in the health centers. When healthcare
facilities invest in better lighting, patients and staff not only see better, they feel better too.
Good lighting can do far more than just improve visibility—it can actually improve caregiver
performance. Installing the proper lighting products can help patients relax, nurses become
more efficient, and doctors focus more easily on the tasks at hand.




                                                                                                16
The use of off-grid solar lighting systems by the health centers has demonstrated the role of
modern lighting products in increasing the quality of health care provided; improving
patient diagnoses through brighter task lighting.

Following the success of the Pilot program, the Lighting Africa team recommends scaling up
of the activity to cover primary healthcare centers across the six geopolitical zones of
Nigeria. This would not only increase awareness of the products, but also increase the
demand of the products in the public and private healthcare sectors.

In designing a scale-up program, there would be a need to quantify all PHCs in the 6 regions;
evaluate the lighting energy demand for the health care centers; evaluate and select off-grid
lighting products/options to be deployed, based on their suitability to perform different
tasks, resource availability and geographic location.

The scale-up program should highlight procurement and logistical procedures to reach all
the relevant PHCs. Institutional aspects of policy, planning, management, financing,
community participation, private sector participation and user interface would be critical to
the successful use of any chosen off-grid lighting product.

To ensure long term sustainability and reliability of off-grid lighting solutions, the proposed
scale-up should be a coordinated strategy between the federal ministry of health and the
state ministry of health. A policy framework to integrate solar off-grid modern lighting into
public health care should be supported with political will and commitment.
