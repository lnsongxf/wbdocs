           access to safe water or adequate sanitation,
           including more than half the population of
           Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these families
live beyond the reach of piped water and sewerage
networks, forcing them to rely on self-funded, household
solutions. While this pressing challenge is often viewed
as a development issue to be addressed by the public
sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the
yawning gap between need and service delivery persists.
But this demand for improved services also presents a
market opportunity for the private sector. In 2010, the IFC

likely to be exacerbated by increased demand caused
by rapid urbanization as a result of population and
