Preface

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now widely recognized as engines of economic growth and key contributors to sustainable
gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries, including those in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. These businesses
predominantly operate in the manufacturing and service sectors and create employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled persons.
However, market conditions and regulatory environments are not always supportive of the growth of SMEs and access to formal finance
is one of the main obstacles they face.

IFC’s Financial Institutions Group (FIG) in MENA provides investment and advisory services to the region’s banks and other financial
institutions to build their capacity in SME banking so that they can profitably and sustainably reach out to the SME sector. This is achieved
through providing equity finance, lines of credit, risk sharing facilities, trade finance, disseminating best practices, improving processes and
products, and streamlining delivery channels. Ultimately, IFC’s goal is to increase the number of banks and financial institutions that offer
financial and banking services to SMEs in a profitable and sustainable manner. IFC is recognized globally as an SME finance market leader
owing to its global expertise and knowledge.

There is a huge demand for Islamic products by SMEs in the MENA region and, according to this study, approximately 32 percent of such
businesses remain excluded from the formal banking sector because of a lack of Shariah-compliant products.

In order to reach out to SMEs demanding Islamic products, and as part of IFC’s initiative to enhance its SME investment and advisory services
offerings to Islamic financial institutions, we needed to better understand the market from both the demand and supply sides in order to identify any
gaps or niches where IFC could assist and add value. With this objective, IFC commissioned a study in nine countries of the MENA region, which
includes Pakistan, to better understand the demand and supply for Islamic banking products (both asset and liability products and other banking
services) in the SME sector. The countries chosen for this study are: (1) Iraq, (2) Pakistan, (3) Yemen, (4) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (5) Egypt, (6)
Lebanon, (7) Morocco, (8) Tunisia, and (9) Jordan.

The scope of the study was to: (i) identify the countries in the MENA region facing gaps in financing and banking needs of SMEs in the Islamic
products space; (ii) conduct a supply side benchmarking to review current capacity of financial institutions to offer Islamic products to this sector;
(iii) conduct a demand side benchmarking to identify key SME customer needs for Islamic products and see how well they are currently being served;
and (iv) review the current enabling environment and readiness levels of banks in terms of the regulatory framework and Shariah compliance.

The study reiterates several of the now well researched and documented reasons for the lack of access to finance for SMEs. However, more
importantly, the study reveals that, there is a potential gap of $8.63 billion to $13.20 billion for Islamic SME financing within un-served and
underserved SMEs categories, with a corresponding deposit potential of $9.71 billion to $15.05 billion across these countries. This is due to the
fact these un-served and underserved SMEs do not borrow from conventional banks, only owing to religious reasons. This potential is a “new to
bank” funding opportunity, which is still untapped, as banks and other financial institutions lack adequate strategic focus on this segment to offer
Shariah-compliant products.

This Regional Executive Summary provides a comparative analysis of the SME potential across these countries and the opportunities
available to Islamic institutions to tap this potential. The nine individual country reports provide a deeper insight into the SME landscape and
potential opportunities for Islamic banks in each country. The reports also highlight the measures that banks may need to take to successfully
target the Islamic banking potential of SMEs.

IFC acknowledges the commitment and cooperation of Israa Capital Management Consultants, Dubai, who carried out this study on our
behalf. IFC thanks them for their dedicated efforts and contribution in compiling the individual country reports and the comparative analysis
contained in this executive summary.

8     Executive Summary
02.
SME Sector Overview
   The SME sector forms the backbone of economic development, private
   sector employment, capital investments, and GDP growth. Despite their
   importance to economic output, SMEs still have inadequate access to
   finance and other banking services. As a result, most of the SMEs tend
   to be concentrated in less capital intensive sectors, such as retail and
   wholesale trade. This scenario not only restricts the development of smaller
   enterprises, but also retards economic activity in these countries.

   Government initiatives and assistance from multilateral institutions like IFC
   have been instrumental in these countries to enable the SME sector to grow
   by providing business and technical expertise to enhance access to finance.




SME Definition and Classification

There is no standard definition for classifying small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across various countries. The most commonly used
criteria by government agencies (central banks and government departments) and commercial banks are based on employee size, asset
size, and annual turnover. However, application of the same classification criteria across countries results in disparities due to different
classification thresholds. These disparities exist because of the differences in economic structure, size of the economy, and the degree of
development in each country. The following definitions used for the target countries are derived from definitions used by the commercial
banks, central banks, and/or the statistic or trade departments of the respective countries.

The lack of a standard definition makes it difficult to compare the SME sector across countries. A standard definition would enable a
meaningful comparison, leading to the replication and implementation of effective policies and programs (such as credit guarantee programs,
skill development programs, etc.) for SME development across countries.

multilateral agencies need to play an active role in the development of a standard definition for SMEs on the basis of annual turnover or any
other suitable parameter.



SME Universe

The enterprise population across each country is usually divided into two distinct segments:

     •	 SMEs that operate in the formal sector, and
     •	 Very small (or micro) enterprises that operate in the informal/parallel economy.



SMEs operate in high economic impact sectors such as manufacturing and construction. As a result, they are able to generate employment
and significant economic value. Very small enterprises on the other hand generally operate in the trade and commerce sectors, which have
low economic potential, as they serve local markets and do not add significant value to final products.

The current enterprise population in the target countries is dominated by very small enterprises that do not offer the same economic
advantages as SMEs. The composition of very small enterprises in the enterprise population is as high as 91 percent (Tunisia) to about 40
percent to 60 percent (Yemen and Saudi Arabia). Therefore, there is a need for the government and multilateral institutions to assist these
very small enterprises to develop into SMEs. In order to achieve this, governments are looking at:

A.	Developing very small (micro) enterprises capabilities through training on various facets (financial knowledge, business planning,
     management, product quality)

B.	 Creating an enabling environment for the SMEs (easy access to basic infrastructure, smooth approval process in governmentdepartments, and
     prudent regulation)

C.	Providing access to finance (special government bodies to channel finance to the sector, guarantee schemes and incentives to banks for targeting
     very small enterprises)

SME Sector Overview
SMEs contribute significantly to GDP growth, private sector employment, and capital investments

SMEs form an important component of a country’s economy. They play a significant role in generating private sector employment, driving
gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and domestic capital investments.

Note: (--) signifies data is unavailable; (*) Includes contribution of microenterprises as well



In Egypt and Lebanon, SMEs are important contributors to GDP (accounting for 80 percent and 99 percent of GDP, respectively). In
Pakistan, Morocco, and Tunisia, the SME contribution is lower, but significant (38 percent to 51 percent of GDP).

In addition to their GDP contribution, SMEs are the largest job creators in the formal and informal sectors. Except for Saudi Arabia, SMEs
employ more than 50 percent of the working population across the countries. In Egypt, for example, they account for almost 99 percent
of the employment in the non-agricultural sector and 75 percent of private sector employment. As SMEs are less capital intensive and
high employment generators, they can play an important role in the economic development of Middle Eastern countries such as Morocco,
Lebanon, and Tunisia, which have a sizable unemployed youth population. This is also true for vulnerable countries such as Yemen and Iraq.

Note: Statistics on the contribution of SMEs to the economies of Yemen and Iraq are unavailable


Besides contributing to GDP and employment, SMEs are instrumental in promoting investments (in Morocco), increasing per capita income
(in Iraq), and ensuring economic diversification (in Yemen). Given their important role in economic development, governments in the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) and Pakistan should work to identify and promote various factors/enablers for the development of the SME
sector. Policies targeting these factors/enablers need to be formulated for the long-term development of the SME sector.

In most countries, SMEs are concentrated in the trading sector, which primarily comprises retail and wholesale establishments, and the services
sector. The main reason for this concentration pattern is the low capital intensity, limited skill requirements, and the ease of establishment
of these enterprises. Other sectors with a high representation of SMEs include the manufacturing and construction sectors, in countries like
Egypt, Pakistan and Tunisia, primarily due to cottage industry. However, in most cases, the concentration of SMEs in these sectors is low due
to the high capital intensity and complexity of operations.

Financial, regulatory, and infrastructural factors prevent SMEs from entering and operating effectively in these complex, capital-intensive
sectors. Thus, there is a need for cooperation among government, private, and multilateral agencies to frame and execute strategies that
would ensure growing SME participation in these sectors. Greater SME participation in these sectors would help combat poverty, low per
capita income, and unemployment, which these countries suffer from.

12     Executive Summary
Key Enablers for SME Growth
As already outlined in several IFC studies, there are a number of key enablers that contribute to the development of a country’s SME sector. These
enablers are macro-level factors related to political and economic stability, sound infrastructure, a transparent governance structure, and access
to finance. The development of a country’s SME sector would be limited in the absence of any of these factors, as each has a unique role to play.
Governments should, therefore, recognize such linkages and take measures to develop these factors.

The table below provides an overview of the current state of the enabling factors across countries. Most of the countries lack a conducive,
enabling environment for SME growth owing to which the sector is unable to emerge from its low growth spiral.

Politically, Yemen and Iraq will continue to be impacted by factors that will affect SME prospects. In the case of other countries, the SME
sector is expected to be well insulated from such factors. Economically, SMEs in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia can expect a
stable economic environment; while there will be risks to the economy in Lebanon, Pakistan, and Egypt in the short term.

With the exception of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Tunisia, corruption and poor infrastructure will be key problems facing SME operations
across the remainder of the countries. The regulatory environment across Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt is weak and likely to affect long-
term growth prospects of the SME sector. Thus, there are significant lessons that these countries could learn and emulate from their neighbors
such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, and Jordan. In terms of access to finance, apart from Yemen and Tunisia, other countries have a
long way to go to ensure financial inclusiveness among SMEs.



Key Challenges for SMEs

SMEs in general face a number of challenges despite the assistance provided by government and multilateral agencies. These challenges are
faced during each phase of development and generally are internal (lack of managerial expertise among proprietors) and external (inadequate
access to finance, government inefficiencies, and infrastructural concerns).

Challenges faced by SMEs vary across countries due to differences in the level of development, degree of human development, efficiency
of governance, and the political situation in the respective countries. There exist several common challenges, such as lack of a well-trained
workforce, poor infrastructure, corruption, and bureaucratic hurdles.

The biggest challenge, however, is access to finance. SMEs at various stages of development face severe challenges when accessing finance.
Concerns include prohibitive interest rates, high collateral rates, and procedural hurdles in applying for a loan. This is despite the fact that
there are government-supported finance schemes, incubators, and venture capital funds to finance SMEs across various countries.

14    Executive Summary
The chart below (Fig.7) outlines the major constraints facing SMEs across the various countries. SMEs in Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq
are facing numerous challenges with respect to political factors, economic conditions, the regulatory environment, and infrastructure. Unless
these constraints are remedied, it is unlikely that the SME sector will witness strong growth in these countries.

In the countries of Pakistan, Morocco, and Tunisia, the operating environment is less challenging with SMEs operating more efficiently.
However, there does exist infrastructural and transparency issues in these countries that must be addressed if the SME sector is to reach its
full potential.

Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are relatively well placed as they have sound infrastructure, a strong regulatory environment,
and low levels of corruption. But SMEs operating in these countries have issues accessing finance, which is a very critical growth component.

Government Initiatives to Support SME Growth

A country’s government has a very important role to play in the development of its SME sector by providing both financial and non-financial
support to promote SMEs. Financial support generally includes credit guarantee schemes, collateral waivers or reduction policies, and
provisions of seed capital. Non-financial support includes capacity building through training programs, improvement in competitiveness
through quality improvement initiatives, business incubation centers, and business development assistance through export development
programs.

03.
Financial Sector Overview
   The commercial banking sector across most countries witnessed
   strong growth despite the 2007-2008 financial crises. The Islamic
   banking sector has, however, been more resilient due to prudent
   practices and the rising preferences for Islamic banking services
   among the resident population. The growth in Islamic banking
   has also been supported by government initiatives aimed at
   enhancing the penetration of banking services. Overall SME
   lending by banks has been gradually rising across most countries
   in recent years, but the situation is still far from perfect.




Banking Penetration

The banking sector across the countries is in different stages of market maturity. Although countries such as Lebanon have a well-established,
competitive banking structure, nations such as Iraq have a small, underdeveloped banking system that would mature only in the long term.

In developed countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Morocco, the evolution of banking began early. Jordan’s banking sector emerged in
1925, while the Moroccan banking system dates back to the 18th century. Lebanon was a late entrant; the country emerged as a financial
hub during 1950–1975. In these countries, the common factor aiding the banking sector’s growth was the government’s liberalization of the
sector, which led to competition and the gradual sophistication within the sector.

In countries such as Tunisia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, the banking sector’s inception and growth has been relatively late. Additionally, the
banking sector’s development in these countries has been affected periodically by unhealthy competition (Pakistan), economic turmoil (Saudi
Arabia), and political interference (Tunisia).

Countries such as Yemen and Iraq have underdeveloped banking sectors characterized by low branch penetration and lack of a credit culture
among the population. Historically, the banking sector in Yemen and Iraq has been underdeveloped as the poor regulatory framework and
limited competition has stunted its growth. Political turmoil added to the woes, limiting the sector’s development.

Commercial Banking Sector

The commercial banking sector across the countries is generally concentrated with the largest players accounting for most assets and
deposits. However, despite high concentration, the commercial banking sector is competitive with large players making consistent efforts to
increase market share. This has led to product innovation, expansion of branch networks, and greater financial inclusion.

20    Executive Summary
After the global economic downturn, most Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries initiated regulatory reforms to strengthen the
banking sector. This resulted in a strong growth in depository base and financing activity within banks in MENA countries.

Most countries in the region witnessed strong growth in the banking system in recent years. Iraq witnessed the highest growth in the region
(loans grew 104 percent and deposits increased 24 percent during 2010-2012), along with Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Other
countries in the region witnessed high single-digit growth in the banking sector. However, the Arab Spring and the resulting political and
economic uncertainties have impacted the short-term growth of the region’s banking sector.

Islamic Banking Sector

Islamic banking has not developed uniformly across MENA countries, as its inception and development across the countries occurred at
different points of time in history. For example, Egypt was the birthplace of Islamic banking, with the first Islamic bank beginning operations
in 1960. On the other hand, in Morocco and Lebanon, Islamic banking has just begun to emerge, with the recent government authorization
of Islamic banking operations.

Egypt’s first-mover advantage, however, did not lead to the sector’s rapid growth and development. Despite an early introduction of Islamic
banking, Egypt has witnessed muted growth over the years. In contrast, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which introduced Islamic banking later,
witnessed strong growth over the years. Jordan, Yemen, Iraq, and Tunisia introduced Islamic banking in the 1970s and 1980s; however, the
lack of government support in the past to promote Islamic banking has affected growth prospects.

In recent years, most countries in the region saw the establishment of new Islamic banks. Morocco and Tunisia have initiated steps to
establish and expand Islamic banking activities. In addition to government support, the growth of Islamic banking in these countries has been
aided by strong positive perception for Shariah-compliant banking among the people of MENA and Pakistan.

In the last few years, most MENA countries (including Pakistan) have witnessed an expansion in Islamic banking activity. All countries in the
region witnessed strong growth in Islamic deposits and financing activities, except Yemen, which was impacted by political instability and a
deteriorating economic environment, especially after the Arab Spring.

SME Sector

The banking sector (Islamic and conventional) has been able to meet some of the needs of the SME sector. Despite the expansion in banking
operations and the corresponding growth of loans and deposits, SMEs still remain underfunded. The lack of penetration of the SME sector
is due to demand- and supply-side factors (explained later in the report).

The ability of banks to meet the financing needs of the SME sector represents a mixed picture. While Morocco, Lebanon, Egypt, and Saudi
Arabia have witnessed a strong increase in lending to the SME sector, in the case of other countries (Jordan, Tunisia, and Iraq) SME lending
has been more muted due to a number of reasons (lack of focus, a weak banking system, and a fragile political environment respectively).

 Egypt              Rising       •	 Lending to SMEs by Egyptian banks has increased at a CAGR of 10.4% over 2009-2012. Yet, the
                                    proportion of SME loans to the total outstanding loans by banks has remained in the range of 7-8%
                                    during this period.
                                 •	 Of the 26 banks operating in the country, 17 operate a separate SME business unit. However, of these
                                    only 9 banks offer adequate SME products.

 Pakistan          Declining     •	 Lending by banks to the SME sector has declined at a compounded rate of 8.5% over 2009-2012 largely
                                    due to an increase in the non-performing loan (NPL) rate for the sector.
                                 •	 As a result, banks have become more cautious in financing SMEs, instead diverting funds to safer
                                    investment opportunities. Thus, the SME lending penetration rate also declined from 10.3% in 2009 to
                                    6.8% in 2012.

24    Executive Summary
 Saudi              Rising     •	 Although the SME lending penetration rate in the KSA is only ~2%, there is greater impetus on SME
 Arabia                           financing by banks, supported by the Shariah-compliant Kafalah program (a financing guarantee
                                  program for SMEs).
                               •	 Hence, SME financing by banks has increased at a CAGR of 23% during the period of 2009-2012.
                                  A large part of this growth has been driven by Shariah-compliant financing (backed by the Kafalah
                                  program), which has increased at a CAGR of 28.4% during this period.

 Jordan            Stagnant    •	 Although lending by banks to the private sector has increased over the years, disbursements to the SME
                                  sector has remained conservative, with 12.5% of the total loans being directed toward this sector.
                               •	 This is mainly due to less risky and more profitable investment avenues available to banks in the form
                                  of corporate or government lending.

 Morocco            Rising     •	 Although credit disbursements by banks to the SME sector has only increased at a CAGR of 7.7% for
                                  the period of 2009-2012, the SME penetration rate in the country stands at 24%, much higher than the
                                  MENA average of 7.6%.
                               •	 The higher penetration rate has been on account of proactive measures implemented by the government
                                  through the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ANPME) that not only encourage
                                  SMEs but also facilitates financial access to these enterprises.

 Tunisia           Stagnant    •	 The SME lending rate in Tunisia, which is 15.3%, is comparatively higher than the MENA average of
                                  7.6%. Yet, growth of lending to the sector has been slow, increasing at a CAGR of 6.5% during the
                                  period of 2010-2012.
                               •	 However, this slow growth is largely a result of problems plaguing the banking sector as a whole, such
                                  as weak corporate governance and efficiency standards and a high NPL rate.

 Yemen            Declining    •	 Yemen’s private sector predominantly consists of SMEs. As a result, any increase in lending to the
                                  private sector positively impacts financial access to SMEs.
                               •	 However, credit disbursements to private enterprises have been declining over the years, from 43% in
                                  2009 to 30% in 2012.

 Iraq*             Stagnant    •	 SME lending penetration in Iraq has been stagnant at around 5% in the last few years.
                               •	 Although there has been a lot of activity in terms of providing financial access to SMEs, the banking
                                  institutions in Iraq have been reluctant to advance financing to them because this sector is considered
                                  to be highly risky.

                               •	 This is expected to increase as banks reduce exposure to government debts and instead divert these

Non-performing Loans

Financial institutions in MENA have always adopted a cautious lending approach. Therefore, asset quality of conventional and Islamic
banks has remained strong. Although countries such as Egypt, Yemen, and Tunisia have a NPL ratio of 11 percent to 18 percent, it has been
declining over the last few years due to the adoption of better risk management policies and improved banking infrastructure.

The rise in banking sector NPLs resulted from the Arab Spring and the effects of the 2007–2008 financial crises. Both factors affected the
repayment capacities of the private sector, leading to a high rate of NPLs. The problem was exacerbated by the existing weak economic and
political conditions in Egypt, Jordan, and Yemen. In addition to political and economic factors, a poor regulatory (Tunisia) and business
environment (Pakistan) contributed to the rise in NPLs. There is a disparity between the NPLs of the conventional and Islamic banking
sectors. The NPLs of Islamic banks have traditionally been lower than those of conventional banks as they are more prudent with regard to
lending to various sectors.

The growth of NPLs in the financial sector presents an opportunity to establish credit bureaus in such countries for capturing and disseminating
credit-related data to financial institutions and other lenders.



Islamic Financial Sector Regulations and Enabling Environment

Although central banks in MENA have proactively regulated the banking sector following the global financial crisis, great disparity exists
across the countries in terms of quality and implementation of reforms.

Regulatory authorities in these countries have initiated reforms and amended existing banking laws to include specific regulations for Islamic
banks. However, most of these countries, such as Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, and Iraq, are still developing separate laws on Islamic
banking.

In addition to prudent regulations, government initiatives across countries have been instrumental in promoting Islamic banking. Initiatives
include the issue of guidelines, instructions, and bonds, among others, to enhance the depth and ensure faster maturity and development of
the Islamic banking sector.

SME Access to Islamic Finance
     Access to finance for SMEs is hindered because of their informal
     nature and poorly structured operations. Another factor for this
     lack of access is the limited capacity of banks to capture this
     opportunity through an appropriate product proposition and
     process framework.




SME Penetration

Despite the existence of a reasonably well-developed banking (conventional and Islamic) sector, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have
typically remained underfunded. The low penetration is due to demand- and supply-side factors that prevent SMEs from accessing financing
through formal channels.

SMEs across the region cite high interest rates, cumbersome procedures and collateral requirements, as the primary impediments to accessing
financing from formal institutions. Furthermore, many of the financial institutions do not have products customized to meet the needs of the
SME sector.

28     Executive Summary
Obstacles Faced By Banks in Sme Financing

•	   SMEs lack managerial capabilities to manage businesses effectively. This leads to an inefficient operations structure, weak financial
     reporting, and unviable operations (high debt). In addition, SMEs mostly operate in the informal sector. Hence, banks are reluctant to
     lend to SMEs and perceive them as risky investments.

     Although already highlighted in several IFC studies, it is still worth noting significant factors that affect the supply of finance to the SME
     sector. Factors include SME-specific problems (lack of a proper business structure), as well as issues faced by banks in servicing the SME
     sector (lack of capacity to lend to SMEs). Problems restricting access to finance are unique to each country, but several common themes
     underline these problems.

     Multilateral agencies should, therefore, partner with government and private stakeholders to train SMEs on efficient management of
     businesses (e.g., IFC Business Edge). This would increase their viability in the long run and make them more palatable for bank lending.

•	   Most banks lack capabilities to lend to the SME sector. This could include inadequate processes, lack of SME-specific products (especially
     Islamic products), untrained staff, and insufficient outreach. The significant risks involved together with high costs of transactions/
     servicing the SME customer also deter banks from targeting the SME sector. Because of these institutional gaps, banks tend to focus
     on emerging and medium-sized businesses and corporations, which are safer investments than SMEs and banks already, possess the
     capabilities to lend to these businesses effectively.

•	   Multilateral institutions and other agencies need to assist banks to enhance institutional capabilities through staff training and introducing
     SME-specific products. Banks would then be able to screen SMEs better for lending, thus increasing credit flow to them.

•	   Lack of information on SMEs is another problem faced by banks across countries. The lack of a credit bureau with adequate information
     on SMEs is a significant hurdle preventing banks from lending to them. The problem presents a significant opportunity to develop an
     exhaustive database on SMEs, which would plug information gaps and lead to increased supply of finance to the SME sector.

A comprehensive survey of more than 160 banks (out of the total +270 banks) in MENA reveals that they are currently ill equipped to
handle the SME business. The survey revealed that, on overall basis, only 36 percent of the surveyed banks demonstrated readiness for an
effective SME proposition, that is built on sound branding and marketing strategies along with a product range availability and overall
portfolio concentration suited to meet the needs of the SME sector. The survey revealed that, on overall basis, only 17 percent banks have the
marketing, product and operational capabilities to effectively serve the requirements of the Islamic SME banking sector.

advisory) to SMEs, in other countries, this is still lacking.

As the SME sector develops across the countries, the needs are likely to evolve. Expansion and development of SME operations would lead to
the demand for more long-term and financially sophisticated products. Banks should recognize these issues and look to enhance and develop
their Islamic product offerings to meet the needs of the SME sector. Please refer to the Appendix (Annexure 2) for a recommended list of
products across countries.




32    Executive Summary
05.
Opportunities for Islamic SME Banking
  There is a cumulative SME funding potential opportunity of
  between $8.63 billion to $13.20 billion across countries in the
  MENA region. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Egypt are the countries
  with the largest potential for SME financing. The sector with
  the most potential is manufacturing due to its capital intensity,
  high degree of value added, significant export potential, and the
  capacity to generate employment.




Funding Opportunity

In terms of funding opportunity, the countries can be classified into three segments:

•	 High potential countries – Islamic banking is well-established, relatively high preference for Shariah-compliant products exists, and
  presence of a favorable regulatory structure

•	 Medium potential countries – Islamic banking is at a nascent stage, with a fair share of the population having preference for Shariah-
  compliant products, and existence of a developing regulatory structure

•	 Low potential countries – Where the perception is strong but an unfavorable economic and political environment have prevented the
  development of Islamic banking

The funding opportunity for each country was calculated using a combination of three factors.

•	 Average perception towards Islamic banking – Measures the perception of the SME in a country towards Islamic banking. This factor
  would be influenced by the population of the country as well as the degree of religious consciousness. For example, in Saudi Arabia the
  level of religious consciousness would be higher (90 percent) than Lebanon (4 percent), which has a smaller population and lower level
  of religious consciousness. The higher the level of perception in a country, the more favorable the chances of Islamic banking flourishing
  in that country.

SMEs in Morocco and Jordan also have a strong preference for Islamic banking (54 percent and 25 percent respectively), which can translate
into a substantial funding opportunity. There also exists a pronounced preference for Islamic banking among SMEs in other countries
(ranging between 18 percent to 37 percent).

Figure 17: Preference for Shariah-compliant Products Percentagewise




Please note all the figures in the above chart are denoted in percentage of SMEs.
*This number is derived through the summation of the weighted average of all the nine countries.



•	 Potential penetration of Islamic banking within the SME sector – Reflects the potential adoption of Islamic banking by SMEs in the formal
     and informal sector enterprises. This would be determined by the overall penetration of banking services in a country, the level of business
     sophistication in a country, and the SME share of bank lending. The higher the presence of the above factors, the greater the potential
     penetration of Islamic banking within the SME sector. Thus, countries such as Pakistan (10 percent to 20 percent) and Jordan (10 percent
     to 25 percent), which have a high degree of banking penetration, would have a greater potential than Yemen (3 percent to 5 percent) where
     the level of banking penetration is poor.

34      Executive Summary
•	 Enabling environment – Refers to the presence of a favorable political, economic, and regulatory environment to promote Islamic banking
  within a country. Greater economic and political stability alongside regulatory clarity would ensure a larger funding opportunity. Countries
  such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Jordan, and Morocco have a positive enabling environment to promote Islamic banking when compared
  to countries such as Iraq and Yemen where the enabling environment is fragile.

•	 Supply side capabilities – In addition to economic and political stability, the SME focus and the capabilities of banks to service the SME
  sector was also taken into account. Factors that were used to gauge the capabilities of banks and their focus included the availability of a
  SME proposition, Islamic SME offerings, SME portfolio penetration, SME product branding, and presence of a separate business division
  among other related metrics.

The funding opportunity comprises “new to bank” enterprises among the un-served and underserved SME population. Pakistan and the KSA
have large numbers of SMEs without financial access, which amounts to large “new to bank” opportunities in these countries.

Jordan is the most viable among the medium-potential countries as it is more developed than Tunisia and Morocco. In addition, it has a well-
developed financial system to complement growth of the sector. Morocco and Tunisia are nascent markets; although they have the necessary
conditions in place (government support, strong domestic demand), they are likely to realize their potential only in the long term. Yemen,
Iraq, and Lebanon are low-potential markets and their prospects will continue to be affected by the uncertain political environment.

In terms of depository potential, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan are the leading countries with significant depository potential
that could be tapped by Islamic banks.

Conversion / Cannibalization of the existing conventional SME portfolio to Islamic also poses a potential for the banks

In addition to the “new to bank” funding opportunity, there is significant potential for conversion / cannibalization of the existing well served
SMEs portfolio that avail of finance from formal conventional banking channels. This conversion / cannibalization opportunity is worth an
estimated $4.2 billion (9 percent of the existing conventional SME lending of $46.5 billion) and varies widely from 2 percent to 4 percent in
Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, and Jordan, to as high as 82 percent in the Pakistan.

Sectors to be Targeted

Manufacturing is the most attractive sector for funding in the countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. . This is due to its
capital intensity, high degree of value added, significant export potential, and the capacity to generate employment. Since these countries,
especially Pakistan and Yemen, are affected by high levels of unemployment, funding the manufacturing sector can be an effective way to
ensure inclusive growth and reduction in unemployment.

The trade and commerce sector, which comprises wholesale and retail establishments, is also a viable funding alternative. However, the value
addition to economy, employee size, and operational scope of these enterprises is limited. Due to these characteristics, funding requirements
of these enterprises are likely to be small and sporadic.

Factors Affecting Growth of Islamic SME Banking

There are a number of fundamental factors that will play a key role in the development of the Islamic banking sector across countries in
the MENA region. These factors are: presence of a favorable regulatory environment, people’s perception toward Islamic banking, and the
efforts by multilateral institutions to complement the efforts of the governments. The presence or absence of a single factor can play an
important role in influencing the trajectory of the market. Countries will have to effectively balance these factors if the Islamic banking sector
is to reach its full potential in each country so that the segment of the SME sector that remains excluded from formal banking services owing
to religious reasons can then be focused on.

Note: Regulatory challenges refer to the efforts by the government and the central bank to promote Islamic banking, also including the existing
legal framework to promote Islamic banking.
Perceptions toward Islamic banking capture the perception of a country’s population toward Islamic banking.
Efforts by multilateral agencies signify the efforts made by these agencies to promote Islamic banking in the country.



The regulatory environment is an important factor that will impact Islamic banking. Pakistan is the only country with a well-defined
regulatory framework for promoting Islamic banking. A well-developed regulatory framework results in clarity and enhances competition
and innovation. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen are still in a transition phase and are yet to have a well-developed
regulatory framework in place to regulate Islamic banking. The absence of affirmative steps to develop the structure further would affect
the prospects of the Islamic banking sector in these countries. On the other hand, countries such as Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt
are in the process of framing regulations. Moreover, the development of the sector in the medium and long term would be contingent on the
effectiveness of regulations framed.

Lebanon is the only country where a high degree of religious heterogeneity has led to low perceptions toward Islamic banking. In other
MENA countries, the perception of Islamic banking is positive as its principles are consistent with their religious beliefs. The ethical and
religious principles underlying Islamic banking have led to a strong demand for Islamic banking across countries in the Middle East. Efforts
by multilateral institutions, such as IFC, could have a strong impact on the sector.




40      Executive Summary
06.
Conclusion
   There is a strong demand for Islamic banking in MENA (including Pakistan) with 32 percent of the
   overall SME population expressing a strong demand for Islamic finance. However, the current supply
   scenario is far from ideal with just 17 percent of the banks surveyed in the region having an Islamic SME
   offering, (whereas, of total, only 36 percent banks that have an SME offering).

   However, a strong enabling environment across most countries coupled with high penetration rates
   ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent (Egypt) to 10 percent to 25 percent (Pakistan and Jordan), and a
   high demand from SMEs for Islamic finance promises strong growth for SME funding in the short to
   medium term.




Currently, an estimated 32 percent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the nine countries are totally excluded from access to
finance, mainly because of a lack of Shariah-compliant products. The “risk averse” approach of banks has led to a narrow product range on
offer for SMEs in these countries.

Several SMEs are seeking exclusively Islamic banking products to meet their financing needs and would not opt for conventional banking
products due to the lack of Shariah-compliance. There is a great degree of variation across these nine countries with respect to the proportion
of SMEs looking for Shariah-compliant products (it is as high as 90 percent in Saudi Arabia, moderating to ~25 percent in Jordan, and
decreasing to 4 percent in Lebanon).

However, banks are currently unprepared to capitalize on this latent demand as, aggregate , SME offerings by banks stands at 36 percent
while aggregate Islamic SME offerings stands at 17 percent. This gap indicates that some banks are not considering offering Islamic SME
products either due to the high risks involved or an unclear business strategy. Furthermore, only 47 percent of banks have adequate products,
whereas, overall SME portfolio penetration is only at 37 percent. There are also lapses with respect to branding or marketing of SME
products, as most SMEs are unaware of the availability of such products from their banks. As a result, banks have been unable to service the
SME sector effectively in these countries.

If proper products are developed and introduced there exists an estimated potential “new to bank” gap of $8.63 billion to $13.20 billion for
Islamic SME financing, with a corresponding depository potential of $9.71 billion to $15.05 billion across these nine countries. However, to
tap the underlying potential, Islamic banks need to build capacity and develop Shariah-compliant products to cater to this emerging sector.



Strategic Operational Adjustments can Help Islamic Banks Target SMEs More Eff ectively

In order to capitalize on funding and depository potential, Islamic banks need to look beyond the conventional ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach
and provide SMEs with customized value additions, much like what many conventional banks are now increasingly offering. The required
competency framework is highlighted below where Islamic banks would need to acquire the required proficiencies for building and managing
a successful “Islamic SME Banking” business (similar to what many of their conventional banking peers have done):

Ideal Business Model

Banks are generally incapable of servicing the needs of the SME sector effectively due to gaps in their current operating model. Most
commercial banks are not geared efficiently to deal with SMEs and are structured to meet the needs of large businesses. While many
conventional banks have now realized the opportunity in the SME sector and are taking steps to build the necessary capacity, Islamic banks
are still reluctant to do so.

In order to target the SME sector, Islamic banks would also need to adopt the above mentioned strategy framework, which involves building
capabilities on all fronts – human, procedural, and institutional. This strategy would have to be gradually implemented, as the process would
require a paradigm shift in processes, strategy, and attitude. The above figure (fig.24) outlines the changes that should occur across Islamic
banks in MENA.

These measures need to be complemented by the efforts of government and regulatory authorities to encourage and incentivize lending and
other banking services to the SME sector. Appropriate measures need to be initiated to also strengthen the legal environment to safeguard
the SME assets of these banks.



Figure 24: Integration of Islamic Banking SME Model




Road Map for Islamic SME Banking Inception and Growth

Islamic banks would need to implement a long-term strategy to execute and sustain the above framework, as such change is resource
intensive, time consuming, and an organization wide effort. There is no “one size fits all” universal framework that can be applied, as the
operational characteristics and functional environment of each bank is different.

Banks would have to conduct a thorough self-evaluation, prioritize the steps that need to be implemented, create a roadmap, define targets,
and chalk out an implementation plan. By following a pragmatic phased roadmap (taking into account the steps mentioned below) Islamic
banks would also be able to capitalize on the “new to bank” and “cannibalization” SME potential across MENA and Pakistan.

Objectives and Approach

This study focuses primarily on the following facets –

•	 Number of enterprises, broken up by size (small and medium); mode of operations (formal and informal); and nature of business (industry)
•	 SME usage of banking services (depository and lending)
•	 SME access to credit and the difficulties in accessing credit
•	 The potential for Islamic banking services in terms of financing and deposits (in dollar values)

Summary

Post the initial country level analysis, appropriate weight was applied to the different categories to develop scores for individual countries.
The results were mathematically validated to ensure accuracy. We believe that the approach provides the right order of magnitude and has
the ability to replicate the outcome and monitor changes going forward.
