I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Egypt perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Egypt
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Egypt
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information




II. Methodology
From April to June 2016, 600 stakeholders of the WBG in Egypt were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 278 stakeholders participated in
the survey (46% response rate).

Respondents received and completed the questionnaire online on an independent survey
platform. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Egypt; their overall attitudes
toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Egypt; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations. Respondents from private foundations,
       NGOs/CBOs, trade unions, and youth groups were combined into the “CSO” category.
       Few respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a minister,
       office of a parliamentarian, local governments, independent government institutions, the
       judiciary branch, and other organizations were included in the “Other” category. There
       were no respondents from faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
     Stakeholder difference: Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and employees
      from ministries were significantly more familiar with the WBG than respondents from
      other stakeholder groups.

     Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
      with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Egypt, and significantly,
      moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG contributes to Egypt’s
      development results.

       efforts to “inadequate level of citizen/civil society participation” compared to respondents

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from ministries and bilateral/multilateral agencies
       had statistically higher mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty three
       COS indicator questions than respondents from other stakeholder groups. Responses for
       individual indicator questions by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see
       page 45).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty three COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 6.5) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 5.6). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix E (see page 66).

Greatest Weakness
       It is worth noting that only 4% of respondents who collaborated with the WBG chose
        “don’t know” as their response to this question. Respondents who collaborated with the
        WBG were significantly more likely than respondents who did not work with the WBG
        to indicate that “not collaborating enough with stakeholders outside of Government,”
        “imposing technocratic solutions without regard to political realities,” “its processes
        being too complex” and “its processes being too slow” are the WBG’s greatest

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Egypt, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty two specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Egypt. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Egypt, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection.
