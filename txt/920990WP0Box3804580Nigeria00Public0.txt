THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

      The fees for the tax clearance issuance are as follows: (i) for newly
      registered companies within 6 months of incorporation: no fee; (ii) for
      companies that are yet to commence business and show up for
      registration after 6 months of incorporation, if they request for tax

      the first time and NGN 20,000 is payable for subsequent years until it
      files a notice of commencement of business.

      Companies required to register for VAT complete the VAT registration
      form (VAT Form 001, obtainable free of charge from all FIRS offices) and
      return it to the integrated tax office, which will issue a taxpayer
      identification number (TIN). Companies required to register for VAT
      must do so within 6 months from the date of company incorporation.

      Since the registration for corporate income tax and VAT are done in the
      same place; one Tax Identification Number (TIN) is issued to companies
      for all federal taxes.

        A soil investigation report is done by an expert for the stability of the
        foundation. While according to Law No 3 (implemented in August
        2012), only 3-storey (or more) residential or office buildings would
        need such a report, it would also be needed for a commercial

      A certified true copy of the survey plan must be obtained from the
      Land Registry to show the plot and its coordinates. Proof of ownership
      must also be obtained; otherwise the permit application will not be
      accepted. The sworn affidavit obtained previously must be presented to
      obtain the documents.

      Obtain development permit from the Lagos State Physical
      Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA)

      The development permit authorizes construction and is valid for 2
      years. To obtain this permit, a building development plan portraying
      the intended uses and the proposed development on the site and the
      effect on adjacent developments and neighborhood must be prepared
      by a professional.

      Legally, a pre-approval inspection is required to verify that the land is
      located where the owner has stated it is and to verify that construction
      has not already started. BuildCo does not have to be present during the
      visit. An assessment of the amount to be paid will be written after that
      visit. All the necessary banking accounts where each payment for each
      tax must be made must be listed on this letter of assessment.

      (10% of the building permit cost) for the preparation and production of
      development plans, such as local, district, subject, and action plans;
      development guides; office maintenance; procurement and
      maintenance of vehicles; office equipment; and similar issues.

      Hire a private engineer to conduct inspections

      A private engineer must be hired to conduct the inspections during
      construction phase. According to the Doing Business methodology,
      BuildCo has an engineer that prepares all the plans. However, this
6     engineer cannot conduct the inspections as well, so an external                 1 day      NGN 111,725

      Obtain certificate of structural stability (first pouring of concrete)

      The concrete crushing test is done as follows:
      1. A sample from a block of concrete is taken and brought back to the
      laboratory for testing. At this stage BuildCo pays for the entire testing.
      The testing is done at several stages:
      2. 7 days after the sample is taken, the first result is obtained.
      3. 14 days after the sample is taken, the second result is obtained (7
      days after the first result).
      4. 21 days after the sample is taken, the third result is obtained (7 days
      after the second result is delivered).                                          7 days      NGN 35,000
7
      5. 28 days later the last and final result is obtained, as well as the final
      report.
      Normally the longer the concrete is kept, the harder it will become and
      therefore it will have a better resistance to the crushing test.

      All payment for concrete testing is done once in this procedure.

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
