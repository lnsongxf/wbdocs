Executive Summary
 Agriculture is among the most risk-prone sectors in the economies of Central Asia. Production shocks
from weather, pests and diseases and adverse movements in agricultural product and input prices not
only impact farmers and agri-business firms, but can also strain government finances. Some of these
risks are small and localized and can be managed by producers. Others are the result of more severe,
exogenous shocks outside agriculture or outside the country, which require a broader response. Failure
to respond adequately to these more severe risks leads to a perpetual cycle of “shock-recovery-shock”,
which reinforces poverty traps and compromises long-term growth.
The agriculture sector’s exposure to production and price risk is increasing. Climate change is
increasing production risks in the short to medium-term by increasing the frequency and severity of
droughts and floods and in the longer-term by reducing the availability of water for irrigation due to
accelerated glacial melt. The modernization and commercialization of agricultural production and
processing, which is critical for sector growth, also raises the sector’s exposure to price risk at a time
of high volatility on international markets for agricultural commodities.
An effective response to these risks requires a broader, more integrated approach to risk management
than the current system of ex-ante, public sector activity associated with crop and livestock disease
and ad hoc, ex-post emergency responses to local disasters. Measures to strengthen risk mitigation
will need to be mainstreamed into sector development and investment programs, additional human
and financial resources will need to be allocated to the public institutions responsible for ex-ante and
ex-post risk management, and the potential for transfer (insurance) mechanisms will need to be
clarified and developed where feasible. Given the limited human and financial resources available for
public sector activity, a clear sense of the priorities for agriculture risk management is also required,
together with a balanced view of the respective roles of public and private sector stakeholders.
In response to these issues, the World Bank Group (WBG) initiated an agricultural sector risk
assessment in Tajikistan in 2014, as part of a three-country study to improve agricultural risk
management at both national and regional level (the reports for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic
are also available). Based on a framework developed by the Bank's Agricultural Risk Management
Team, this work consists of three phases. Phase I identifies, analyses and prioritizes the systemic risks
affecting production, markets, the enabling environment, and public sector support to agriculture. The
second phase focuses on solutions and strategies, and on the instruments that will be most effective
in reducing major risks, including technical assistance, investments by local governments and
development agencies - and how these instruments can best be scaled up. Phase III of the national
agriculture sector risk assessment, which is not covered in this report, involves support for the public
sector to develop a systematic agricultural risk management plan. The ultimate objective of this body
of work is to reduce short and medium term volatility in the agricultural sector while improving
resilience over the longer term, thereby reducing vulnerabilities among all stakeholders and increasing
the potential success of agricultural investment and development strategies.
For purposes of discussion and analysis, risks to agriculture are defined as an uncertain or
unpredictable event with adverse consequences for the volume or value of agricultural output. Risk

                                                   vii
thus differs from constraints to agriculture, which are permanent impediments to sector output.
Sudden shocks to production (droughts, floods, locusts), prices or the enabling environment (sudden
policy changes or sharp, unexpected exchange rate movements) are thus considered risks; while factors
such as low productivity, poor access to credit, lack of land and lack of information are viewed as
constraints. Analysis is based on the risks that led to significant shocks to agricultural output, at both
aggregate and commodity level, for the 20 year period from 1992-2012.
The agriculture sector in Tajikistan faces two different types of risk: high-cost low-frequency risks
associated with sector-wide events such as the onset of civil war in 1993 and a generalized price shock
in 2007; and low-cost, medium-frequency, commodity-specific risks associated with drought and price
volatility. The low frequency of major, sector-wide shocks is attributed to the high level of
diversification at both farm and sector level, and access to irrigation. No single commodity accounts
for more than 10 percent of total output, and most farms produce a diverse mix of (irrigated) crop
and livestock commodities. Drought is the main production risk at commodity level, with cotton as
the most vulnerable crop. Inter-annual price volatility is a greater source of risk than drought, however,
affecting more commodities, and resulting in a higher frequency and severity of commodity-level
losses.
These results show that public and private sector initiatives to support the current high level of
diversification within the sector, and to maintain the physical and institutional infrastructure for
irrigation are the foundation for agricultural risk management. At commodity level, future agricultural
sector development will need to place more emphasis on responding to price risk for all commodities,
as opposed to the traditional emphasis on production risks for cotton. As government is very aware
of the need for diversification and irrigation, and sector investment programs already support these
imperatives, Phase II of the study focused on the development of more specific recommendations for
risk management grouped under two “Solution Areas”: the creation of market opportunities and the
improvement of livestock production.
Many of the price risks facing specific commodities can be significantly reduced by measures to create
more market opportunities in both domestic and regional markets. Wider, deeper markets reduce price
risk by improving the capacity for spatial and temporal arbitrage. Improving the competitiveness of
Tajik agricultural commodities is the basis for deepening and stabilizing agricultural markets, however,
starting with an increase in on-farm productivity. Associated market-related initiatives include
continued investment to strengthen market information systems, storage capacity, transport
infrastructure and supply chains. Market stability will also benefit from the establishment and
expansion of export markets in Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Russia, provided that Tajik products are
competitive on these markets. Specific recommendations to increase sectoral efficiency and
competitiveness are developed in three areas: (1) market knowledge and training, (2) investment
promotion and business enabling environment, and (3) trade facilitation.
The second Solutions Area involves improving livestock productivity by strengthening the resilience
of production systems and rangelands in Tajikistan. The recommended interventions under this rubric
include measures to: (i) reverse water and soil degradation and improve vegetation cover, (ii)
strengthen livestock services such as veterinary health, feed and fodder supply, and (iii) ensure
                                                   viii
sustainable access to grazing lands. This sustainable access will rely on measures that ensure the long-
term viability of rangeland ecosystems. Livestock producers will also benefit from timely weather and
market information that enables them to manage their resources better and to protect their assets in
times of drought.
The recommendations developed under these two solution areas continue the underlying emphasis
on mitigation as the foundation for risk management. They also highlight the mutually reinforcing
benefits of measures to improve crop and livestock productivity, the competitiveness of agricultural
commodities and the depth of agricultural markets for both risk management and sector growth.

Introduction
Agriculture is among the most risk-prone sectors in the economies of Central Asia. These risks lead
to a perpetual cycle of “shock-recovery-shock”, which endangers the sustainability of ongoing
initiatives and is a major impediment to the development of agriculture. These risks can lead to and
reinforce poverty traps and pose serious consequences for all stakeholders. Adverse movements in
agricultural commodity and input prices, together with production-related shocks (e.g from weather,
pests, and diseases) not only impact farmers and firms active in agricultural sector, but may also put
severe strains on a government’s fiscal position. The prevalence and complexity of multiple risks facing
agriculture systems and the failure to address them on an ex-ante and integrated basis, continues to
leave countries and their agricultural sectors less competitive, at best, and more often extremely
vulnerable.
Risks in agricultural production have become more pressing after independence with the increased
reliance on local food production for livelihoods and food security. Previously managed through
redistribution systems between sectors and regions in the Former Soviet Union, such risks are now
left to the individual Governments to deal with.
The mainstreaming of agricultural risk management, and thereby development of medium term
resilient and sustainable agricultural systems requires:
      An integrated operational approach to agricultural resource management, which is embedded
       in country development and investment planning;
      Expertise and capacity in the field of agricultural risk management;
      Interaction and knowledge exchange by stakeholders and practitioners, to break down the
       often existing siloed approach to products, strategies and risks.
In light of the above, the World Bank Group (WBG) initiated an agricultural sector risk assessment
in Tajikistan, using in part the agricultural risk management framework developed by the World Bank’s
Agricultural Risk Management Team (ARMT) as described below in the Methodology Section.
This study is the first step towards a comprehensive agricultural risk management dialogue in
Tajikistan and developing the investment program. The report is part of a three-country study (the
reports on Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic are also available at this time), and also covers the
regional dimension given the proximity of the countries, which leads to sharing of some of the same
risks across more than one country. The analysis draws on time-series data from FAOSTAT, the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the national statistical agencies of each country, and
other sources of secondary data.
Methodology
The World Bank’s Agricultural Risk Management Team (ARMT) has developed an approach for a
comprehensive and coherent Agricultural Sector-Wide Risk Management Framework, which covers
the following:


                                                   1
Pillar I: Risk Assessment and Management includes a number of Technical Assistance activities
to help clients evaluate agricultural risks and establish systems for improved risk management.
Pillar II: Capacity Transfer offers a range of training products on various aspects of agricultural risk
management.
Pillar III: Knowledge and Networks includes production of a number of knowledge products on
agricultural risk management, which, among other things, facilitates dialogue and knowledge exchange
among the practitioners and stakeholders.
The ultimate objective of such assessments is to reduce short and medium term volatility in the
agricultural sector while improving resilience over the longer term, thereby reducing vulnerabilities
among all stakeholders and increasing the potential success of agricultural investment strategies.
National Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment (NASRA) Methodology
Phase 1: Based on a holistic framework for risk analysis and management, the agricultural sector risk
assessment will identify, analyze, quantify, and prioritize systemic risks (i.e., production, market,
enabling environment risks) that adversely impact the functioning and growth of the bulk of a
country’s agricultural commodities. The risk assessment will also evaluate existing and potential risk
management strategies (i.e., mitigation, transfer, and coping) to understand if interventions are in line
with the magnitude of existing risks and where gaps may exist. The ultimate objective is to optimize
the use of available public resources for improved agricultural risk management and to build risk
management capacity among local private and public stakeholders. The study assesses aggregate
trends and risks in agricultural production, but focuses on the three major crops grown in the region
(wheat, cotton, potatoes,), as well as the most important high-value vegetable crop (onions) in
Tajikistan to illustrate the main risks. Together, these four crops constitute 47 percent of the
country’s gross agricultural output and 58 percent of total area cultivated.
Phase 2: Once the risk assessment has been conducted through desk review and in close consultation
with relevant stakeholders, and the most appropriate risk management instruments have been
identified, a solutions assessment will be conducted. This phase involves a mapping of: 1) prioritized
risk management instruments already in place; 2) responsible institutions (including gaps and
overlaps); and 3) potential needs (e.g., TA, investments, policy support) for scaling up risk
management approaches to more effectively manage prioritized risks.
Phase 3: A third phase involves supporting Government efforts to: 1) develop an integrated and
systematic Agricultural Risk Management Plan that appropriate responds to priority risks; and 2) and
to identify and allocate resources.
Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment Study in Tajikistan
This study is limited to Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the NASRA methodology, due to time and resource
considerations. Therefore, further work is needed to develop a broader, integrated agricultural risk
management framework in the country, including the recommendations proposed in the Solutions
part of this study. As part of report preparation, fieldwork was undertaken multiple times during the
risk identification and solutions identification phases of work.
                                                   2
Summary of Recommendations
This analysis shows that future agricultural sector development will need to place a much greater
emphasis on responding to price risk for all commodities, as well as responding to the risks of drought,
flood, and water scarcity for irrigation. The recommendations in this report are targeted to encourage
diversified production, create better market opportunities in response to price risks, and strengthen
the resilience of production systems and rangelands. Action should be taken to:
   1. Continue support for a diversified agricultural production base and assure access to
      irrigation. These are fundamental components of effective risk management.
   2. Improve productivity and competitiveness and deepen domestic markets. These
      market-related measures include better market information systems, more effective supply
      chains, better access to storage and improved transport infrastructure;
   3. Establish export corridors from Tajikistan to export markets in Russia, Kazakhstan
      and Pakistan. This will help reduce market instability for export products and improve
      availability of imported farm inputs.
   4. Seek guidance on how to provision public financial resources for significant periodic
      shocks such as locust attacks, outbreaks of trans-boundary livestock disease, droughts
      and floods. The financial resources of line ministries to respond to these shocks are minimal.
Specific Recommendations for Creation of Market Opportunities
To increase sector efficiency and competitiveness, policymakers should design and implement
interventions that create new market opportunities. These recommendations focus on widening and
deepening agricultural markets by increasing market knowledge and training, promoting agribusiness
investment, and facilitating trade.
      Improve market knowledge by designing and implementing a market information
       structure. Existing market information and forecasting tools should be inventoried, and in
       collaboration with the private sector, a new structure should be designed to provide timely
       reporting of market information.
      Develop and implement, with the private sector, training in the use of market
       information and market intelligence for producers and small- and medium-size
       agribusinesses and traders. These trainings may be specific to the value chain and should
       occur at the oblast or rayon level. Training may be leveraged to facilitate market linkages and
       develop business relationships.
      Review the existing regulatory reform and investment promotion public-private
       consultation meetings to assess the focus on agribusiness investment and
       development promotion. Ensure that all stakeholder groups are represented, and use other
       country experiences to devise a best-practice consultation framework in consultation with
       existing organizations.
      Develop a business plan for, and create a matching grant fund to spur critical
       investment in new technology and encourage innovation to improve competitiveness
       and efficiency. Consider risk within the framework and governance of the fund to avoid
       incentivizing extremely high-risk investments.
      Create a logistics roadmap to include regulatory reform to support the development
       of a leasing industry and incentives to support expanded logistics services and
                                                   3
        businesses within Tajikistan. Develop the roadmap in consultation with the private
        sector, particularly financial services.
       Undertake a food safety regulatory environment reform aimed at achieving
        compliance with international best practices in food safety. Design and structure the
        project to address both public and private sector needs and work collaboratively with
        existing commodity and value chain groups.
Specific Recommendations for Improvement of Livestock Production
The interventions identified below would strengthen the resiliency of livestock systems and rangelands
in the Tajikistan by i) reversing degradation of water, soil, and vegetation cover; ii) ensure sustainable
access to grazing lands; and iii) strengthening livestock services, enabling farmers to manage their
resources more effectively.
       Strengthen drought cycle management and community preparedness. Early warning
        indicators should be used to trigger community drought preparation and/or response
        interventions within the parameters of an effective national drought management
        framework.
       Implement Community-based Pasture Management. The program envisioned in the
        Pasture Law should be implemented with three components i) legal and regulatory policy ii)
        institutional strengthening, and iii) environmental management.
       Formalize a pasture monitoring program. The program would include components on
        policy and regulatory development, institutional strengthening, and development of a
        regional Livestock Early Warning System (LEWS) with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz
        Republic.
       Promote supplementary feed production and pasture rehabilitation. A livestock feed
        sector development project should be implemented to address feed policy, particularly feed
        production emphasizing drought-resistant varieties, manufacturing, testing, and use. In
        cropping regions, introducing more sustainable crop rotations in the grain sector can
        significantly increase the supply of supplementary feedstuffs, provided there is suitable
        market incentive for crop producers to do so.
       Support economically viable and environmentally sustainable irrigation systems to
        improve productivity and adapt to climate change. Review and reform existing
        institutional arrangements for water management, and develop sustainable water use groups.
       Strengthen the country’s animal health systems. A national animal health and food
        safety program is needed to address various issues contributing to higher risks to human and
        animal health, food safety, product quality, and market access.
       Establish a regional animal health program with Afghanistan and the Kyrgyz
        Republic to control transboundary diseases. Diseases with the potential to affect trade
        and threaten public health, including FMD, PPR, brucellosis, tuberculosis, should be
        targeted.
       Tajikistan could consider introducing index-based livestock insurance, which has
        been introduced in Mongolia with the assistance of the World Bank, or pasture
        insurance. Any consideration of agricultural insurance should be done on the basis of a
        solid feasibility analysis, livestock and/or pasture, insurance.
                                                    4
       Improve access to seasonal credit. Develop season credit products that allow producers
        to invest in risk mitigation inputs.
       Increase public expenditure on agriculture and funds allocated specifically to
        innovation and climate change adaptation at a level at least equivalent to that of
        other countries in the region (2.2 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic). Establish an
        innovation council and give research into livestock feeds, feeding, and feed efficiency high
        priority.
       Clearly define eligibility for participation in disaster relief programs in advance.
        Instead delivering relief ad hoc after a disaster occurs, rules-based mechanisms for

        framework of drought cycle management and community preparedness.
Country Context
With 23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 51 percent of employment, the agriculture
sector is a significant component of Tajikistan’s economy. Crop production accounts for
approximately 80 percent of agricultural output. Cereal and cotton predominate in arable areas, with
cotton as the major agricultural export. Fruit and vegetable production is increasing for both domestic
and export markets. Cattle and sheep are raised for milk and meat, but herds are small. Livestock are
wintered on the farm and then grazed in the mountains during summer and autumn. Local (near-
village) pastures tend to be overgrazed, as there is limited land for grazing relative to the number of
livestock. Mountain pastures are underused due to their distance from villages and lack of water.
Agricultural land, especially arable land, is scarce due to the country’s mountainous terrain. Of the
total land area of 14 million hectares, only 35 percent (4.855 million hectares) is classified as agricultural
land. Approximately 20 percent of this agricultural land is arable (980,000 hectares), and the remaining
3.875 million hectares are pasture. Small-scale, mixed farms predominate, averaging 5–10 hectares of
arable land per farm. Land and labor productivity are low relative to other Central Asian countries.
Rainfall is low, and irrigation is critical for agriculture (figure 1). Approximately 70 percent of arable
land is irrigated (700,000 hectares), and this irrigated land accounts for most of Tajikistan’s crop
production. Of the irrigated area, 60 percent is gravity fed and the rest is pump irrigation.
The current system for managing irrigation water is inefficient, and much of the physical infrastructure
is in poor condition. Despite substantial water resources, around 20 percent of irrigated land (for
example, in Kulyab, Istravshan, and Gissar regions) faces water shortages due to poor regulation of
river flows (MIWMRT, UNDP, and IFSAS 2006). Inadequate funding for the maintenance and
operation of infrastructure exacerbates these water shortages. These constraints are highest for pump
irrigation systems, which are the most expensive to maintain and operate. As most of the irrigation
systems were constructed for cotton production, areas near cotton-growing regions have better access
to water for agricultural and household use.

Agro-Climatic Conditions
A warm, dry continental climate predominates. Approximately 80 percent of crop and livestock
production occurs in the irrigated river valleys in northern and southern Tajikistan, where climate,
soil-type and irrigation are well suited to cotton, cereal, and horticultural production. Dryland
production of cereals, potatoes, and livestock is prevalent in foothill areas throughout the country.
This diversified production base combined with access to irrigation reduces production risk.
Nevertheless, assured access to irrigation is vital given the low rainfall levels.

Tajikistan has four main agro-ecological zones (figure 2). Of these, three (excluding the mountain
zone) are important for crop and livestock production. These zones are characterized by different
production systems due to their differing geography, climate, and natural resource base (Safarov 2003),
as summarized in table 1.

The southern valleys, which are 350–800 meters above sea level, are characterized by moderate winters
and hot summers, with annual precipitation of 150–250 millimeters. Crops include cotton, rice,
lucerne, wheat, vegetables and maize as well as subtropical fruit (lemons, oranges). This zone covers
most of Khatlon, including large cotton farms in the west and south. Approximately 320,000 hectares
are irrigated. Irrigation water comes from the Kofarnihon, Vaakhsh, and Pyanj rivers, which originate
in the glaciers of the Hissar mountain range and the Alai and Pamir mountain chains.

The northern valleys, which are 270–800 meters above sea level, are characterized by cold winters and
very hot summers, with annual precipitation of 150–250 millimeters. Most of this zone is in Soghd
oblast, with cotton grown widely in the irrigated areas. Other crops include wheat, rice, lucerne,
vegetables, maize, and sorghum. This zone also accounts for most of the stone fruits that are a
traditional export to Central Asia and the Russian Federation. The Syrdarya River is the main source
of water for irrigation in the northern areas, and the Zarafshon River is the main source in the west.
High-lift pumps are needed to supply irrigation water in the northeast.
The foothill zone is located 800–2,000 meters above sea level and includes foothill areas throughout
Tajikistan. It is characterized by very cold winters and hot summers; annual precipitation averages
200–650 millimeters. This zone includes the foothill regions of Khatlon and Soghd oblasts as well as
the Region of Republican Subordination (RRS) and some parts of Gorno Badkhshan (GBAO). The
main crops include cereals, potatoes, fruit, vegetables, lucerne, and melons and gourds. Livestock
production is very important. Irrigation is limited to small areas and often relies on high-lift pumps.
The mountain zone includes regions higher than 2,000 meters above sea level, mostly in the GBAO,
where winters are long and extremely cold, summers are warm, and average annual precipitation is
200 millimeters. Agricultural output is minimal. Livestock production predominates, as the short
growing season and small amount of arable land limit the scope for crop production. Wheat, barley,
oats, potatoes, and lucerne are the main crops.


Vulnerability to Climate Change
Tajikistan is vulnerable to numerous sources of risk, including food insecurity and climate change.
According to Fay and Patel (2008), it is the most vulnerable of all 28 countries in Europe and Central
Asia to climate change (figure 3).

Historic and projected trends in temperature and precipitation (figure 4) show that agriculture is
particularly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and falling precipitation—both in
the medium and long term. Rising temperatures will increase the rate of glacial melt and the associated
risks of flooding and storms in the medium term. Together with falling precipitation, these trends will
reduce the availability of water for irrigation in the long term. Rising temperatures will also increase
the risks of locust attacks and plant disease.

Although Tajikistan clearly needs to respond to climate change, its adaptive capacity is extremely low,
ranking second to last in Europe and Central Asia (figure 5).

Implications for Agriculture Risk Management
Climate change will have important implications for agriculture risk management in that (i) it will
change the context in which the sector operates in, and (ii) it will likely change the patterns of the risks
that have occurred in the past in terms of frequency and impact. A changing climate is in itself not
considered a risks but rather a trend as it is a shift that occurs over a longer term and thereby is
predictable. Instead, agriculture risk assessments look at risk events that takes place as a result of
unpredicted and/or extreme weather events (among other risks). Globally, most climate change
models, and indeed already occurring events, point however at more volatile and unpredictable
weather patterns emerging as a result of this change in climate, and with them new and/or more
frequent/severe pests and diseases – i.e. more risks.
Important for policy makers is also that the context in which the sector operates may over time not
be what it was in the past. Climate projections also indicate a shift in the average growing conditions.
This means that policies have to adapt to the new context and longer-term agriculture risk
management investments (e.g. in research and irrigation infrastructure) should take climate change
projections into account. Nevertheless, agriculture risk assessments will remain important as a tool to
prioritize and quantify current risks to the sector and to make optimal risk management decisions in
the short to medium term (figure 6).

National and Agriculture Sector Growth
Economic output contracted sharply after the end of central planning in 1989. The initial collapse
from 1990 to 1992 was due to the abrupt termination of Soviet support. Subsequent economic
transition and recovery were then slowed by a prolonged civil war from 1993 to 1997. The economy
has grown steadily since 1998 (figure 7) in response to progressive reform and large remittance flows.

Both crop and livestock production fell after independence, with a 6 percent fall in the area cropped
from 1990 to 1995 and a 30 percent fall in livestock numbers (measured in livestock units) from 1990
                                                                                  11
to 1998. Slow reform limited the initial recovery after 1998, but sector growth quickened after the
acceleration of land reform and farm privatization in the mid-2000s. Agricultural GDP had recovered
to pre-independence levels by 2008 and has grown in most years since then.
Aggregate Crop and Livestock Production
Analysis of gross agricultural output (GAO) in constant (2004–06) prices for the period 1992–2012
shows the contribution of crop and livestock production to overall GAO and to the variability of
physical production (figure 8). Crop production accounts for around 80 percent of sector output in
most years. It is also less variable than livestock production, with a low adjusted coefficient of variation
(CV) of 0.15* versus 0.27* for livestock.1 The higher variability in livestock production during this
period is attributed to the sharp losses in livestock experienced after independence and during the
subsequent civil war.

A similar pattern emerges when GAO is measured in real prices, although there is much less variability
in livestock GAO, as data are only available for the period 2000–11. The adjusted CVs were 0.14* and
0.17* for real crop and livestock GAO, respectively. The variability of total GAO is also lower, with
an adjusted CV of 0.14* for real price GAO since 2000, versus 0.18* for constant price GAO since
1992. This lower variability is more indicative of current levels of risk.
The reduced variability of aggregate output is attributed to increased crop diversification (figure 9) as
a result of increased production of wheat after the civil war, a gradual increase in vegetable and fruit
production, and a reallocation of less-productive land from cotton to wheat after the cotton debt crisis

of 2008. In addition to lower levels of variability, increased crop diversification has also resulted in
higher overall returns to land and labor. The area allocated to forage crops has fallen markedly, from
200,730 hectares in 1992 to 126,240 hectares in 2012. Livestock numbers increased 35 percent during
the same period (measured in livestock units). This 37 percent reduction in the area allocated to forage
crops has contributed to the high levels of overgrazing observed in near-village pastures and the low
levels of livestock productivity.

Part I Risk Identification


Country Risk Identification and Quantification
This section reviews the natural disasters that occur in Tajikistan and assesses their impact on
agriculture. It then reviews the risks associated with the production of Tajikistan’s main agricultural
commodities: wheat, cotton, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, watermelons, cow’s milk, beef, mutton, and
eggs. These commodities account for approximately two-thirds of Tajikistan’s total GAO.


Natural Disasters and Their Impact on Agriculture
Tajikistan is highly prone to natural disasters due to its mountainous terrain, climatic extremes, and
location on a seismic rift. Records from the EM-DAT International Disaster Database show that
Tajikistan experienced numerous natural disasters from 1985 to 2015, with floods, landslides,
avalanches, and earthquakes being the most frequent (figure 10). Glacial melt and bouts of intense
rainfall in the spring lead to floods, mudflows, avalanches, and landslides,2 winter brings severe storms,
and summer brings the risk of drought and extreme temperatures.

In most cases, the impact of these natural disasters on agricultural production has been highly localized
and relatively limited in scale (table 2). Food insecurity can increase, however, particularly in response
to complex disasters that lead to increased food prices. Closer analysis also shows that assessment of

the economic impact of these disasters on agricultural production is based on forecasts and estimates
made in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Once the emergency is over and actual production
data are collected and collated, the impact often turns out to have been significantly overstated.

Floods, Mudslides, Avalanches, and Storms
While floods occur relatively frequently (figure 11) and devastate the communities they hit, the
resultant loss of crops and livestock is limited in comparison to total land cultivated and total livestock
numbers (table 2). This is also true for mudslides, avalanches, earthquakes, and severe storms.
Localized disasters such as these can be managed effectively by a well-organized national emergency
response agency working with local government authorities.

Locusts
Locusts are a permanent threat to agriculture in Tajikistan, infesting approximately 100,000 hectares
of agricultural land every year (figure 12). Due to an effective control program, actual agricultural
losses are minimal, however, with only one major attack during the 30 years from 1985 to 2014 (EM-
DAT). This occurred in 2007, with the loss of approximately 35,000 hectares of crops. The major
determinants of loss are the location of the attacks (pasture versus cropland) and the extent to which

                                                     16
control measures cover infested areas. Locusts usually feed on mountain pastures and forests, only
attacking crops when there is no pasture.

Two locust species are found in Tajikistan: the Moroccan locust and the Italian locust. They breed in
mountain areas along the borders with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic (figure 13),
which makes them difficult to detect and control. Control was minimal from 1997 to 2007, but was
boosted in 2008 following the attack in 2007. Support from FAO has further strengthened this
program since 2011, but this support will end in 2015. Most of the budget for the control program is
used to spray locust breeding grounds in the mountain border areas.

Drought
Two major droughts are reported by EM-DAT for the 30-year period from 1985 to 2014, in 2000–01
and 2007–08. Lesser, localized droughts are reported nationally for 1995, 1999, 2005, 2010, and 2012.
Each of the two major droughts (2000–01 and 2007–08) led to forecasts of major crop losses and a
national food security crisis, described in box 1.
In reality the resultant food security crises were due more to rising food prices than to the impact of
drought on agricultural production. The losses in crop production were overestimated, and higher
producer prices offset the impact of these losses on the value of agricultural output. In the 2000 –01
drought, actual cereal production fell only 12 percent. Moreover, drought only explains some of this
fall in cereal production, as many farmers shifted land from cereals to cotton in response to favorable
cotton prices (cotton production increased 35 percent). Agricultural GDP fell only 2 percent in 2001,
as higher producer prices offset the impact of the loss of 30,000 hectares of cropland. For the 2007–
08 drought, actual cereal production was constant in 2007 and 2008 (903,000 tons and 906,500 tons,
respectively), up from 893,000 tons in 2006. The decline in area planted was offset by an increase in
yields in 2007, while lower yields were offset by an increase in area planted in 2008. Agricultural GDP
also increased 17 percent in real terms from 2007 to 2008 due to higher producer prices, negating the
forecast loss of US$100 million (box 1).

 Box 1 The Forecast Impact and Scale of Major Droughts in Tajikistan
 2000–01 drought in Sughd and Khatlon oblasts. In the Sughd region, low rainfall led to the failure
 of rain-fed and approximately 30–50 percent of irrigated crops. Aggregate cereal output of 236,000
 tons was 46 percent lower than the previous year (UN OCHA 2000). Khatlon in the south faced a
 similar reduction, with the most affected areas being Kabodiyon, Shartuz, Jilikul, Gozimalik,
 Kumsangir, and Pyanj. Agricultural losses amounted to 30,000 hectares. By autumn 2001, 3 million
 people were expected to be affected by drought, with 2 million possibly facing a critical food
 shortage.
 2008–09 drought combined with other natural calamities (nationwide impact). Agricultural losses
 amounted to 40,000 hectares of land in 40 out 58 districts in the country. The damaged lands
 included 22,000 hectares of cotton, 8,000 hectares of cereals, 3,000 hectares of fruit and vegetable
 gardens, 960 hectares of vegetable fields, and 221 hectares of potato fields. The total economic loss
 was estimated at US$100 million (UN OCHA 2009).


Hence while these droughts were major disasters for food security and severely compromised
agricultural production in many areas, they did not have a “disastrous” impact on the aggregate value
of agricultural production. They were also low-frequency events, occurring only twice in 30 years.
Complex Disasters
The worst disasters for agricultural production and food security have been complex disasters: the
result of either multiple shocks in a short time period or a sequence of shocks over an extended time
period. In most cases, these disasters have involved some combination of shocks that are exogenous
to agriculture and others that are endogenous. For example, the combination of economic transition
and civil war from 1992 to 1997, interspersed with adverse climatic conditions from 1994 to 1996,
resulted in a substantial fall in agricultural production, causing severe hardship for rural people. More
recently, a succession of adverse events from 2007 to 2009 also had a major impact on agricultural
output and food security, as described in box 2.
 Box 2 The Complex Disaster of 2008–09
 Tajikistan experienced a series of economic, environmental, and social shocks in 2007–09, which
 severely affected production and reduced the capacity of the most vulnerable to deal with further
 shocks. Beginning in 2007, rising fuel prices led to higher transportation and food costs, followed
 by continued drought in the spring and summer of 2007 and a locust invasion in 2008.
 Against the backdrop of increased food insecurity in early 2008, Tajikistan experienced the worst
 winter in 44 years. Heavy snowfall isolated communities, and severe weather hampered travel.
 Temperatures ranged from -15°C to -25°C for extended periods. The exceptionally cold weather
 caused breakdowns in the country’s aged energy infrastructure and water supply systems, affecting
 irrigation and food production.

Crop Production
The crops analyzed below were chosen on the basis of their importance to sector output and because
they reflect different types of production, price, and policy risk.
Wheat
With approximately 10 percent of GAO and 33 percent of total cultivated area, wheat is a major source
of agricultural output in Tajikistan. It is also one of the most stable components of sector output, with
an adjusted CV of 0.20* for production and 0.18* for yield. Production has grown steadily since 1998
in response to increased area and yields (figure 14). Approximately one-third of all wheat is grown on
household plots.

As figure 14 shows, inter-annual variation in yield explains most of the variation in wheat production.
Rainfall variability is the major source of yield and production volatility, as around 50 percent of wheat
is unirrigated. For the period 1992–2012, one major drought occurred in 2008, with lesser droughts
in 2001, 2005, 2010, and 2012. The sharp fall in production and yields in 2011 was due to a marked
switch from wheat to cotton, with the associated reallocation of land and other resources and a return
to long-term yields following two years of above-average yields in 2009 and 2010 in response to high
rainfall. There was no production “shock” as such, although the impact on commodity prices was
quite marked.
Locusts and crop disease (especially rust) are further sources of production risk for wheat. Locust
swarms resulted in the loss of approximately 35,000 hectares of wheat and other crops in 2007.
                                                              20
Although devastating at the local level, this loss was small relative to the total cultivated area of 970,000
hectares. A small, but highly experienced crop protection program operates in the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), but its capacity to intervene is limited by scarce budget resources. Farmers receive
advice about how to manage outbreaks of crop disease, but little direct support. A locust control
program established in 2008 has received FAO support since 2011, but this support will end in 2015.
Most of the budget for this program is used to spray locust breeding grounds in mountain areas along
the borders with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic.
Cotton
Cotton is the second most important crop, with 9 percent of GAO and 20 percent of total cultivated
area. The adjusted CVs for cotton yield and cotton production are both moderate at 0.20*. Irrigation
reduces the climatic risks to production, although low rainfall in 1999–2000, 2004–05, and 2008–09
resulted in lower yields (figure 15). A 40 percent fall in cotton area cultivated from 2004 to 2009, in
response to the cotton debt crisis, also shows that policy has a major impact on production.
Government views cotton as a highly strategic crop and intervenes actively to protect the high cash
and export revenues generated. However, not all of its interventions are appropriate. Crop protection
programs implemented by the MOA mitigate disease and insect risks.

Potato
Potato production is also important, with approximately 10 percent of GAO and 35 percent of the
area planted to vegetables. Potatoes are produced in all regions, with approximately 50 percent of total
output grown on household plots. Production has grown steadily since 1998 in response to increased
area and yields (figure 16). Production risks are relatively low, with adjusted CVs of 0.17* for

production and 0.16* for yield, with no major yield or production shocks since 1995. Drought, disease,
and insect pests are the main production risks.

Onions
Onion production accounts for 7 percent of GAO and 15 percent of the area planted to vegetables.
Approximately 60 percent of vegetables (excluding potatoes) are produced on household plots.
Output has more than tripled since 1998, driven by steady increases in both yields and area (figure 17).
Production risks are low, with a CV of 0.26 for production and an adjusted CV of 0.19* for yield, with
no major shocks since 2000.

Tomatoes
Tomato production accounts for 6 percent of GAO and 11 percent of the area planted to vegetables.
Output has more than tripled since 1998, driven by steady increases in both yields and area (figure 18).
Production risks are low, with a CV of 0.21 for production and an adjusted CV of 0.21* for yield, with
no major production shocks since 2000.

Watermelons
Watermelons account for 2 percent of GAO and 17 percent of the area planted to vegetables. Output
has increased more than four times since 1998, driven by increases in both yield and area (figure 19).
Production variability is high, with adjusted CVs of 0.40* for production and 0.31* for yield. This is
due in part to vulnerability to moisture stress. Producers also vary the area planted from year to year
in response to changes in market conditions.

Livestock Production
Livestock numbers fell for the first 10 years after independence due to the combined impact of
economic transition and civil war (figure 20). Numbers increased significantly after 1998, except for
pigs, for which there is minimal demand. Growing domestic demand for livestock products has driven
the increase in livestock numbers. Livestock numbers rose sharply following resolution of the cotton
debt crisis in 2008, as farmers were able to allocate more land to pasture and fodder crops and had
more freedom to choose their preferred production systems.

Livestock production is important in all regions, providing an important source of food and cash
income on the small, mixed farms that predominate in Tajikistan. It also helps to stabilize rural
household incomes when crop production or crop prices fall. Cattle are the most important form of
livestock production, followed by sheep and goats, but most farms own some combination of all three.
Most herds are small, and productivity is low, as farmers prioritize the allocation of land and labor to
crop production—except in mountainous and upland areas.
Milk Production
Cow’s milk is the most important livestock commodity, with 9 percent of GAO. Figure 21 shows
trends in production from 1992 to 2012 and the impact of changes in the number of cows and
production per cow. Economic transition and civil war led to the high, observed fall in production,
due mainly to the decline in production per cow. Production has increased more than threefold since
1996, due mainly to the increase in the number of cows. Milk yields increased initially until 2003 and
then fell until 2008 during a period when forage production fell, as many farmers were coerced into
growing cotton. Yields began to rise again after cotton debt was resolved, although they still remain
very low, at approximately 700 kilograms per cow.

Source: FAOSTAT.

Overall production is relatively stable, with an adjusted CV of 0.24*. Most of the observed variation
reflects the sharp reductions in yield until 1996. Milk yields also fell moderately in 2006 (for unknown
reasons) and in 2008 due to lower rainfall.
Beef and Mutton Production
Mutton accounts for 6 percent of total GAO and beef for 2.5 percent. Both experienced sharp falls
during the period of economic transition and civil war and were slow to recover (figure 22). Mutton
production has increased significantly since 2000, but beef production has recovered more slowly.

Production volatility has been minimal since 2001, apart from a moderate decline in beef production
in 2006 due to a reduction in cattle numbers. The moderately high adjusted CVs, 0.26* for beef and
0.24* for mutton, reflect the impact of economic transition and civil war.
Egg Production
Eggs account for approximately 1 percent of total GAO. The trend in egg production, as for other
commodities, saw a massive decline in production associated with economic transition and civil war,
followed by strong growth since 1999 (figure 23). This growth is due to a significant increase in the
number of laying hens and a smaller increase in egg production per hen. The adjusted CV for egg
production for the period 1992–2012 is very high, at 0.85*, due to the impact of transition and civil
war. The variability of output since 1999 has been very low.

Livestock Disease
The main livestock disease risks for Tajikistan are brucellosis, anthrax, foot and mouth disease (FMD),
pestes des petits ruminants (PPR), Newcastle disease, and tuberculosis. Official reports to the
International Office of Epizootics (OIE) for the period 2005–13 indicate a low incidence of these
diseases, with brucellosis as the main risk. Brucellosis was reported every year from 2005 to 2013,
although the reported cases represent less than 1 percent of cattle and small ruminants. Actual
brucellosis infection rates are probably higher, as demonstrated by an FAO vaccination program in
southern Khatlon from 2003 to 2009 that reduced infection rates from 10 percent to 2.5 percent.
Anthrax was reported in all years from 2005 to 2013, with annual losses of less than 10 animals (all
animals included). One case of FMD was reported to the OIE during 2005–13, with the loss of 31
goats and 14 cattle. Newcastle disease was reported in 2005 and 2006, with no information on the
losses incurred. Human infection from livestock disease ranges from 650 to 1,500 cases per year for
brucellosis and 15–50 cases per year for anthrax.
Apart from FMD and anthrax, vaccination against these diseases is low (World Bank 2014b).
Vaccination rates for FMD are estimated at 100 percent and are reported to be “high” for anthrax.
For other diseases, including brucellosis, vaccination rates are low. Yet recent analysis shows that
vaccination costs are very low relative to livestock value (World Bank 2014b).




                                                                                                           28
This limited apparent interest in protecting livestock health is variously attributed to farmer s’
expectations that the government will pay for vaccination programs,3 mistrust of vaccine quality,
inadequate understanding of the costs and benefits of improved livestock health, and limited cash to
pay for vaccinations. It may also indicate that farmers view livestock disease as a low source of risk
and prefer to accept limited losses rather than pay for vaccines. This perception may change as
livestock production grows in importance and larger, more specialized livestock operations emerge.
Many of the major livestock diseases in Central Asia are highly contagious, trans-boundary diseases
that are impossible to control at the national level (for example, FMD, brucellosis, and PPR). These
diseases are transmitted by domestic animals, wild animals, people, and vehicles along 3,650 kilometers
of border, including 2,030 kilometers along the border with Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.


Price Risks
Producer price data are available for the period 2000–11 only.
Wheat Prices
Tajikistan produces approximately half of its total wheat requirement, importing the rest from
Kazakhstan and Russia as wheat and flour. Trends in real prices reflect the combined influence of
domestic production, international prices, and inflation (figure 24). Real prices are thus somewhat
variable, with a CV of 0.23 versus adjusted CVs of 0.24* and 0.27* for nominal wheat prices and 0.17*
for international soft wheat prices, respectively. Measured in real prices, major price shocks occurred
in 2002 due to a significant increase in domestic production, in 2007 due to a generalized fall in
nominal and real prices, and in 2009 due to a major increase in domestic production.




3 Under current law, government is obliged to provide vaccines for eight major livestock diseases —at a cost of SM 7
million to SM 8 million (somoni) relative to its budget of SM 2 million. Lacking the resources to meet this demand, the
Veterinary Service allocates the vaccines it purchases to state-owned livestock farms first and then to high-risk zones. The
remaining vaccines used by farmers are imported and sold commercially.

Cotton Prices
Trends in world markets are the major determinant of cotton producer prices, as all production is
grown for export (figure 25). Government policy also has an impact, as shown by the steady decline
in real producer prices from 2003 until resolution of the cotton debt crisis in 2008. Both world prices
and real domestic prices have increased since 2008. Real producer prices are less variable than world
prices, with an adjusted CV of 0.26* versus an adjusted CV of 0.30* for world prices.

Vegetable Prices
Real prices for vegetables are highly variable (figure 26), with unadjusted CVs of 0.23 for tomatoes
and 0.35 for potatoes and adjusted CVs of 0.24* for onions and 0.36* for watermelons. As production
of all four crops has increased steadily since 2000, this instability is attributed to the weakness of
domestic markets and the limited capacity for export in years when marketed surplus is higher than
normal. Domestic markets are easily saturated, especially for perishable, seasonal crops such as
watermelons and tomatoes. The impact of this latter risk was particularly evident in 2007.

Livestock Commodity Prices
Livestock commodity prices are analyzed for the period 2000–11. Real prices increased steadily from
2000 to 2006 in response to growing incomes and increased demand (figure 27). All prices then fell
sharply due to the generalized price fall of 2007, as for crop commodities. Meat and milk prices have
risen somewhat since 2008, while egg prices have continued to fall.

Price stability varies. Real egg prices are the most stable with an adjusted CV of 0.09*, followed by
cow’s milk, with an adjusted CV of 0.15*, and sheep meat, with a CV of 0.18. Real beef prices are
much less stable, with a CV of 0.33. Beef prices fell sharply in both 2007 and 2010, with the more
recent fall due to the adjustment of prices following the global food price crisis of 2009–10.

Enabling Environment Risks
Exchange Rates
In an open economy like Tajikistan, exchange rate movements can have a wide-ranging impact on
economic activity, affecting export revenues (aluminum, cotton, fruit, and vegetables), the price of
imported agricultural commodities, and the purchasing power of remittances. Government introduced
a flexible exchange rate policy in 2000, with minimal intervention in foreign exchange markets. This
policy has resulted in a gradual depreciation against all major currencies since 2000 (figure 28), with
minimal exchange rate volatility. The adjusted CVs are correspondingly low, at 0.08* for the euro,
0.12* for the U.S. dollar, and 0.14* for the ruble.

Agricultural Policy and Budget Support
While public expenditure for agriculture has increased significantly in real terms since 2000, it remains
low in both absolute terms and relative to overall public expenditure (figure 29). Current budget
expenditure for the Ministry of Agriculture is less than 2 percent of the total government budget and
is barely enough to cover basic regulatory activities. Programs for crop and livestock disease protection
are thus underresourced. Less than 1 percent of this budget is used for subsidies. Additional public
expenditure, outside the MOA budget, is also provided for irrigation and occasional directed lending
programs for agricultural credit, but data on this expenditure were not available for analysis.

Agricultural policy has traditionally focused on measures to support cotton production, through direct
intervention, subsidized credit for inputs, and higher budget allocations for crop protection and seed
production programs for cotton. Government recognized the need for more broad-based support for
agriculture following resolution of the cotton debt crisis in 2008 and is now allocating more MOA

Tajikistan’s cotton debt crisis is the most important policy-related adverse event. It began in 2000
following privatization of the “cotton investors” who controlled cotton input supply, processing, and
marketing. Once privatized, the larger “investors” contrived with local government authorities to
create local and regional monopsonies, through which they provided cotton producers with inputs on
credit at inflated costs and purchased raw cotton at below-market prices. Unable to grow cotton
profitably under these conditions, producers accumulated debts to the cotton investors and their
partner financial institutions. The low profitably of cotton was further aggravated by government
insistence that 70 percent of all arable land should be used for cotton, forcing farmers to grow cotton
on land that was inherently unsuitable. Local government benefited from this setup by meeting official
production and sales targets and cotton investors benefited by having an assured supply of raw
material at highly favorable prices. Producers faced lower incomes and high levels of poverty; and as
their debts grew, they became even more vulnerable to exploitation by the cotton investors.
As a result of this situation, farmer cotton debt grew from an estimated US$180 million in 2004 to
US$550 million when these debts were frozen at the end of 2007. Government made numerous
requests for donor assistance to refinance this debt, but to no avail. The donor community was
                                                                             35
unwilling to assist in the absence of a strong government commitment to reform the policies and
structures that had led to the crisis and was unconvinced as to the actual level and nature of the debt.
Resolution of this crisis was eventually catalyzed in late 2007 when the National Bank of Tajikistan
(NBT) revealed that it had taken out undisclosed loans to finance the cotton campaign, thus breaching
an International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement. The NBT was also at risk of defaulting on these
loans, which were secured by its foreign exchange reserves.
Faced with the loss of IMF support and loan default, government ordered investors and their partner
financial institutions to write off the debts owed by farmers and initiated a comprehensive set of
reforms. The monopsony powers of cotton investors were curtailed through debt write-off, increased
competition, and the provision of alternative sources of credit to reduce producer dependence on
investors for input supply. Local government authorities were no longer permitted to force farmers
to grow cotton, allowing producers to grow and sell whatever crops they chose (known as Freedom
to Farm). Cotton production contracted initially because input supply fell and less productive cotton
land was allocated to other crops. Output has now stabilized around a smaller, more sustainable base
of land and producers, and cotton remains a major element of Tajikistan’s agricultural economy.
These policies incurred major costs, not all of which were borne directly by the agriculture sector. The
cotton investors and their partner financial institutions incurred the major losses through debt write-
off. Given that the debt write-off was based on accumulated farmer debt rather than on actual
operating losses by cotton investors, the amount of this loss was probably much less than the US$550
million written off. (The offsetting monopsony profits earned by cotton investors were never
measured.) Losses were incurred by the agriculture sector, nevertheless. Producer prices and
production fell, particularly during the final stages of the cotton debt crisis from 2006 to 2008.
Agricultural Insurance
The Tajik insurance industry is small, with a penetration rate of 0.34 percent in 2012.4 The insurance
industry is growing quickly, however, with annual growth of 18 percent for the period 2008–12
(Timetrics 2013). There are 16 insurance companies, of which 2 are state owned and 14 are private.
Mandatory insurance products, which are tightly regulated by government, account for approximately
75 percent of the market. A 2010 government decree that 70 percent of profits from state insurance
companies should revert to the budget has weakened the capacity of state insurance companies to
build reserves and expand.
Agricultural insurance is provided by the state-owned company Tajiksugurta. There are relatively few
clients for this insurance, even though it is officially mandatory. Private insurance companies also
show little interest in agricultural insurance, citing the higher regulatory requirements, weak statistical
base for risk assessment, and low perceived profitability of agriculture. Despite this limited interest,
government is trying to develop a public-private partnership for weather-index crop insurance.

There are opportunities for commercial agricultural insurance in Tajikistan, beginning with the
insurance of high-value crops against frost and hail. The expected losses from these risks are moderate,
increasing the incentives for private insurance companies to offer suitable products and for farmers
to buy them. Beyond this, any expansion to broad-based insurance for cereal and industrial crops and
for livestock or livestock production will require a major investment in the development of a market-
based program of agricultural insurance with considerable government financial participation. Inter
alia, such a national program will have to rely on commercial reinsurance, adequate pricing and
underwriting of risks and professional claims management. In addition, the government will have to
clearly demonstrate its commitment to the program through budgeting for the cost of program
subsidies in the annual national budget. Therefore, a comprehensive feasibility study is required to
consider any agricultural insurance. In the meantime, there is a need to focus on animal health,
improving crop yields, knowledge transfer to farmers and other measures to reduce production risks
and thus, the cost of insurance in the future.

Costing and Prioritizing Agricultural Risks
The frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events are analyzed in this section to provide an empirical
basis for prioritizing different sources of risk. Official information on losses due to adverse events is
derived in different ways and is invariably approximate. Hence, in order to provide a consistent basis
for comparison, analysis was based on estimates of the “indicative” value of losses, as defined below.
While these estimates draw on actual data as much as possible, they represent indicative, not actual,
losses.
Conceptual and Methodological Basis for Analysis
Risk is defined as exposure to a significant financial loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence
and severity are unpredictable. It thus implies exposure to substantial losses, over and above the
normal costs of doing business. Agriculture is inherently variable, as producers incur losses every year
due to suboptimal climatic conditions at different times in the production cycle or departures from
expected prices. For the purposes of this study, risk refers to the more severe and unpredictable
adverse events that occur beyond these smaller events, measured as the inter-annual variation in the
value of agricultural output. A loss threshold was set to distinguish major adverse events from smaller,
inter-annual variations in output. Drawing on the results of agricultural risk analysis in other countries,
this threshold was set at 10 percent.
This definition also distinguishes between risks, which are unpredictable, and constraints, which are
known and so predictable. Sudden shocks to production (droughts, floods, locusts), prices or the
enabling environment (sudden policy changes or sharp, unexpected exchange rate movements) are
thus considered risks; while factors such as low productivity, poor access to credit, lack of land and
lack of information are viewed as known, predictable constraints to sector output.
Indicative losses were calculated as follows:
For production risks, the value of GAO “lost” for each adverse event was first calculated in somoni
as the difference between the actual change in output and the threshold change in output, using
constant producer prices (2004–06). The resultant value was converted into U.S dollars at 2012
exchange rates and also expressed as a percentage of the value of GAO. The same methodology was
used to derive the combined impact of production and price shocks, based on actual production and
real prices. This captures the joint impact of price and production shocks, which is the reality that the
sector faces.
As shown by the identities derived in appendix A, the losses due to the joint impact of production
and price shocks (as derived above) can be disaggregated into production impacts and price impacts.
These identities were used to calculate the indicative losses associated with price shocks alone for
individual commodities. While this analysis is disaggregated by subsector and commodity, it does not
show the different risk characteristics of the four agro-climatic zones due to lack of suitable data.5

5Measuring the impact of producer price risks on the economy poses several other challenges. Producer prices and retail
prices or international prices do not always move together, which can decrease the impact on the economy as a whole.
Seasonal price movements (not measured) may be a greater risk than annual price changes. Finally, lower commodity prices
                                                          38
The two main agro-climatic zones have similar characteristics, however, and account for around 80
percent of production.
Application of this methodology requires a consistent set of data on both production and prices, for
an extended time period. Of the various sources of data available, FAOSTAT’s data series (1992–
2012) on the value of gross agricultural production and producer prices was considered the most
suitable. These data allowed the analysis of risk over a 19–20-year period for all products for constant
prices and for 2000–11 for real prices (statistics for many variables were not collected during the civil
war). The various shocks derived from this analysis were attributed to specific events on the basis of
interviews with officials in national and regional government, farmers, and traders, plus information
from published reports and Internet sites. A chronology of these adverse events is presented in
appendix B.
Aggregate Production Risks
The impact and causes of the major shocks to aggregate output since 1992 for constant prices and
since 2000 for real prices are summarized in table 3, first for total GAO and then for livestock and
crop GAO. Results in both constant and real prices are presented to show the impact on production
alone (constant prices)6 and the joint impact of shocks to production and prices.




will, all other things equal, be beneficial for consumers and thus may have a positive impact on the overall economy.
Nevertheless, estimating the severity of commodity price risks gives an idea of sector volatility stemming from price risk
and indicates which commodities are most vulnerable to price risk.

The main conclusions from these results are as follows:
   The onset of civil war in 1993 resulted in a significant fall in agricultural output, due to a sharp
    drop in livestock numbers and crop and livestock productivity.
   The combination of increasing crop productivity, reallocation of land from cotton to other crops,
    and growing food imports led to the saturation of domestic agricultural markets in 2007, a
    generalized fall in nominal and real producer prices, and a sharp drop in real GAO. Both crop and
    livestock commodities were affected.
   These shocks to aggregate GAO show first that the sector’s diverse production base combined
    with irrigation limits the frequency of production shocks at the aggregate level. The major shocks

    price shocks).

The results reflect the impact of the shocks identified in table 3, plus further commodity-specific
shocks due to drought and price volatility. The main results are as follows:
   At the commodity level, the indicative costs associated with all shocks are small in both absolute
    terms and relative to agricultural GDP.
   The civil war from 1993 to 1997 resulted in production shocks for all major crops.
   Drought is the main cause of production (constant price) shocks, with cotton most susceptible to
    drought.
   Cotton output suffered a further series of shocks from 2005 to 2008 due to the combined effects
    of drought and the cotton debt crisis.
   Price volatility is the major cause of shocks since 2000, with the strongest price shocks observed
    in 2007 in response to the saturation of domestic markets.

The 1993–97 civil war is the main cause of production (constant price) shocks, due to both an increase
in animal losses and a reduction in animal productivity. The generalized price shock in 2007 also had
a strong impact on livestock commodities.
Commodity Price Risks
Price shocks were analyzed for the livestock and crop commodities examined above, using real prices
as the basis for analysis (table 6). The analysis focused solely on price shocks associated with an overall
loss above the threshold for the period 2000–11. Price falls that were offset by production increases
were not included.

The frequency of price volatility is high, with one or more commodities subject to price shocks in 7
of the 12 years analyzed. But in most cases the losses incurred were moderate. The exception is the
generalized market saturation in 2007, which caused sharp price falls for most commodities. Crops
are more prone to price volatility than livestock commodities, with real prices for cotton and
vegetables the most volatile. Cotton price shocks reflect the impact of the cotton debt crisis, as world
prices rose steadily from 2005 to 2008. The high volatility of vegetable prices is the result of short-
term imbalances between supply and demand and the weakness of domestic markets.
A Timeline of Agriculture Sector Shocks: 1992–2012
Figures 30 and 31 provide further insight into the incidence and magnitude of agriculture sector shocks
during the last 20 years. The two figures are drawn to the same scale to allow comparison of the
magnitude of production shocks alone versus joint production and price shocks.

The prolonged impact of the civil war on production alone is apparent in figure 30. No equivalent
production shocks occurred until the drought of 2010–11, further confirming that the frequency and
severity of production shocks is significantly reduced by access to irrigation and the diverse production
base.
Although the analysis of real price shocks only covers the period 2000–11, the greater impact of price
versus production shocks on the value of agricultural output is evident nevertheless. The indicative
losses associated with the generalized price shock of 2007 were six to seven times greater than those
observed at the beginning of the civil war and affected more commodities. Smaller, price-related
shocks are also more frequent than production shocks alone.
Comparison of figures 30 and 31 also shows the need to measure the impact of shocks on both
production and prices. The impact of many production shocks on GAO is offset by a corresponding
increase in producer prices, which tend to rise when production falls. The worst shocks typically occur
when production shocks coincide with an exogenously driven fall in real prices.
Ranking and Prioritizing Agriculture Sector Risks
The preceding analysis shows that the agriculture sector faces two different types of risk: high-cost,
low-frequency risks associated with sector-wide events, such as the civil war and the generalized price
shocks of 2007, and low-cost, medium-frequency, commodity-specific risks associated with drought
and price volatility. These two sets of risks are examined in this section to elucidate approaches to risk
management.
Each category of risk is quantified according to two parameters: (a) the average indicative cost of the
observed shocks above the loss threshold during the relevant time period and (b) the frequency of
these shocks, expressed as the number of events during the relevant time period (for example, 3 events
in 21 years: frequency = 0.14). Results are presented for both production shocks (in constant prices)
and joint production-price shocks (in real prices). Due to lack of price data, production shocks are
analyzed for the period 1992–2012 and joint production-price shocks are analyzed for the period
2000–11. While this limits the number of data points for analyzing joint production-price shocks, the
economic and political conditions since 2000 are more representative of future conditions in the
agriculture sector. At the commodity level, price volatility is likely to become an increasingly important
source of risk.
Sector-wide Risks
Major shocks to aggregate agricultural output are less likely to occur in a diversified agriculture sector
with reasonable access to irrigation, such as Tajikistan. When they do occur, however, such shocks
typically result from extreme events that affect production or prices of a wide range of commodities.
The impact of such shocks can be high, as occurred during the generalized price shock of 2007, which
incurred indicative losses equivalent to 23 percent of GAO (table 3). Figure 32 shows the
characteristics of these shocks.

The sector-wide shocks reported for the civil war are production shocks, as there are no price data
prior to 2000. The sharpest production shock occurred in 1993 in response to falling livestock
numbers and livestock productivity (table 3), but further production shocks occurred for all of the
commodities analyzed, throughout the war period (table 4). As in other Former Soviet Union
countries, this contraction of production is also attributable to the economic collapse that followed
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. But civil war was the overriding influence on political
and economic conditions from 1993 to 1997 and into 1998. The lack of price data precluded analysis
of the impact of any concomitant fall in producer prices during the civil war.
Various factors combined to cause the generalized price shock observed in 2007. The postwar increase
in agricultural production due to improved crop and livestock productivity was accentuated after 2005
by the reallocation of land from cotton to food and forage crops (for livestock) in response to the
cotton debt crisis. This increased the supply of agricultural commodities sold on domestic markets.
Food imports also rose in response to economic growth and high remittance income. These supply-
side factors inevitably led to the saturation of domestic markets for a wide range of agricultural
commodities and a broad-based fall in producer prices. Weak markets and limited producer
understanding of market dynamics exacerbated the drop in nominal prices, with the producer price
index for agricultural products falling 25.6 percent in 2007. High inflation exacerbated the impact on
real prices. This constellation of factors and its impact on real GAO are shown in figure 33.

Despite its magnitude, the public response to this price shock was muted. In part this was due to the
sector’s preoccupation with the cotton debt crisis, which reached its controversial apex in late 2007.
The direct impact of the generalized price shock on producers was also reduced by their limited
reliance on commercial agriculture and the self-consumption of much of their output. Cash incomes
fell, but subsistence requirements were not compromised. The impact of the generalized price shock
is noteworthy nevertheless, because it demonstrates the vulnerability of sector output to broad-based
price volatility and the need to strengthen agricultural markets.
Commodity-Level Risks
Analysis by commodity includes production risks, (real) price risks, and the impact of joint production
and price risks. Aside from civil war, drought is the main cause of shocks to physical output (measured
in constant prices for 1992–2012), although its incidence and impact are heavily mitigated by access
to irrigation (figure 34). Cotton is most vulnerable to drought, although access to irrigation minimizes
its impact, with indicative costs of less than 1 percent of GAO (table 4). Tomatoes, watermelons, and
beef production exhibit a low-frequency, low-cost exposure to drought. There were no major drought-
related production shocks for the other commodities.

Analysis of the frequency and cost of (real) price shocks was based on adverse events caused partly or
solely by a decline in real prices, using the identity in appendix A. Price shocks that were offset by
increased production were not included in the analysis. The results are shown in figure 35.
Price volatility is a greater source of risk than drought. Almost all of the main commodities experienced
(real) price shocks during the period 2000–11, with varying levels of severity. Potatoes are most
vulnerable to price shocks, in terms of both frequency and severity. Cotton and watermelon also
experience price shocks with medium to high frequency, but the average costs of these shocks are
moderate. The cotton price shocks occurred during the cotton debt crisis, at a time when world cotton
prices were rising, demonstrating the adverse impact of inappropriate policy. Of the remaining
commodities, price volatility is a low-frequency, medium-cost risk for milk and mutton and a medium-
frequency, low-cost risk for wheat, beef, tomatoes, and onions. There were no price shocks for eggs.

The pattern of joint production-price shocks by commodity follows a similar pattern to that observed
for price risk (figure 36). This is to be expected, given that price risks are larger and more prevalent
than observed production (drought) risks.

Potatoes and cotton are most vulnerable to joint production and price risk, followed by watermelon.
Beef and wheat have a similar (medium-frequency, medium-cost) risk profile, while milk and mutton
have a low-frequency, medium-cost risk profile. The risks for tomatoes and onions are low, and there
are no observed production-price shocks for eggs. The average indicative costs of these joint
production-price shocks also tend to be much lower than for price shocks alone, as would be expected.
A fall in producer prices is generally associated with higher production levels, reducing any loss in the
value of agriculture output.
Implications for Risk Management at Aggregate and Commodity Level
These results confirm that agricultural risk is low at aggregate level due to the sector’s diversified
production base and access to irrigation. Sector-wide losses can be high when they do occur, however,
as occurred in response to the generalized price fall in 2007. Public and private sector initiatives to
continue this diverse production system and maintain the physical and institutional infrastructure for
irrigation are thus the foundation for agricultural risk management.
At commodity level the analysis shows that future agricultural sector development will need to place
much more emphasis on responding to price risk as compared to the traditional focus on production
risk. Although cotton is the commodity that is most vulnerable to production shocks, when combining
production and price risks, potatoes rather than cotton emerge as the commodity most vulnerable to
risk. Most major commodities are vulnerable to price shocks, although the indicative costs of these
commodity level shocks tend to be small in both absolute terms and relative to gross agricultural
output. By showing the risks associated with cotton versus other commodities, the analysis also
highlights the need to take a broader approach to risk management as opposed to the traditional
emphasis on the risks associated with cotton production.
These conclusions also highlight the implications for risk of the continued shift towards commercial
agriculture – and the increasing associated vulnerability to market shocks. Improved management of
price and market risks will require deeper, stronger markets, a better understanding of market behavior
by producers and market agents and better access to market information.
Risks Specific to Foothill and Mountain Zones and Small-Scale Farms
As Khatlon and Sughd dominate agricultural production (with 80% of arable land and livestock
numbers), the preceding results mask the risk characteristics of agriculture in the foothill and mountain
zones. Farmers in these zones rely much more on livestock production, both as a source of income
and as a means to manage production and price risks. Dryland farming prevails, increasing the
vulnerability to drought. The more rugged terrain and climatic extremes also increase exposure to
floods, mudflows, landslides and severe winters. Colder winter temperatures reduce the risk of crop
pests and diseases, but market risks may be higher due to poor market access and limited market
information.




                                                   52
Small-scale farms are particularly exposed to risk7 due to their low resource base and heavy reliance
on agriculture (especially crops). Their ability to manage risk is also weaker as they have limited access
to risk transfer, adaptation or mitigation techniques. They are thus highly vulnerable to both market
shocks (such as the one in 2007-08) and adverse climatic events (droughts, floods, weather variability,
pests and diseases etc). Price risks are especially high as their bargaining power is weak and they lack
timely information. Recent survey evidence shows that such small-holder farmers seek the following
kinds of support to address these risks:
   Drought tolerant, pest resistant, high yield crop and planting material
   Soil water conservation and natural resource management techniques
   Expansion and improvement of irrigation facilities and adoption of on-farm water-use efficiency
   Appropriate land use and agricultural diversification
   Support for risk transfer mechanisms (insurance), credit facilities, provision of markets and
    information
   Provision of better animal breeds, health and improvement in pasture management
Ultimately, the priorities identified by these small-holder farmers are relevant to most Tajik farmers –
large or small. This suggests that although small-holder farmers are highly vulnerable to risk, the risks
they face are in fact similar to those faced by other farmers.
The main recommendations of the report are as follows:
   Continued support for a diversified agricultural production base and assured access to irrigation
    will remain fundamental to effective risk management;
   Similarly, continued measures to improve productivity and competitiveness and deepen domestic
    markets will address many of the price risks for agricultural commodities. These market-related
    measures include better market information systems, more effective supply chains, better access
    to storage and improved transport infrastructure;
   Continued efforts to establish export corridors from Tajikistan to export markets in Russia,
    Kazakhstan and Pakistan will also help to reduce market instability for export products and the
    markets for imported farm inputs;
   Government may also benefit from guidance on how to provision public financial resources for
    significant periodic shocks such as locust attacks, outbreaks of trans-boundary livestock disease,
    droughts and floods. The financial resources of line ministries to respond to these shocks are
    minimal.

Solutions Area 1: Create Market Opportunities
In agriculture, different layers of risks are based largely on the frequency and magnitude of risk events
(OECD 2011). The interconnected nature of supply chains and agriculture sector actors and
stakeholders requires a holistic, systems approach that emphasizes transparency and predictability
from the public sector. Aggregate sector efficiency, diversity, and competitiveness underpin any strong
risk management strategy.
Phase I of the risk assessment concluded that Tajikistan’s agricultural risk at an aggregate level is
relatively low due to a highly diversified base of production, which has grown since the 2007
agricultural reform. The Tajik agriculture sector is fairly resilient as a result of this strong diversification
and access to irrigation. Normal risks are high frequency and low magnitude, affecting only a single
commodity or handful of value chains at a time. They have minimal effects at the national level. With
diversity of production already contributing to resilience, the risk management solutions presented
here prioritize practical policies, programs, and investments to increase efficiency and competitiveness
across the agriculture sector, without focusing on any one commodity.
Recommendations to increase sectoral efficiency and competitiveness are offered in three areas: (1)
market knowledge and training, (2) investment promotion and business enabling environment, and
(3) trade facilitation.
While each value chain or commodity may have fairly unique constraints on efficiency or
competitiveness related to technology, seasonality, handling and perishability, or markets,
overemphasis or investment in a particular subset of crops or products may increase the aggregate risk
profile by decreasing diversity. Government needs to achieve a balance between efficiency, diversity,
and competitiveness in all policies and interventions.
Risk Management: Background
Normal risk variations, which are high-frequency, low-magnitude (or low-cost) events in production,
prices, markets, and weather, do not typically require any specific policy response and are managed
directly by farmers and other sector stakeholders as a part of their everyday business strategy.
Catastrophic risks, which are low-frequency, high-magnitude extreme events that affect many or all
producers or sector stakeholders, are usually beyond the capacity of producers or markets to cope.
Between the extremes of normal and catastrophic risks are marketable or transferable risks.
Government policy can ensure a predictable and equitable operating environment to encourage the
development of market-based risk management tools, such as investment and financing, insurance,
and marketing contracts.
This agriculture sector risk assessment differs from previous work by considering aggregate risks at
the national level instead of at the supply chain level or from the perspective of a particular set of
actors, such as producers. A systemic approach considers both the long-term and short-term effects

                                                      54
of adverse events across the entire sector. A systemic approach empowers agriculture sector actors to
manage normal risks by formulating strategies and policies that balance sector efficiency, diversity,
and competitiveness with growth.
Phase I also identified the risk to Tajikistan’s agriculture sector as low due to its diversified base of
production and access to irrigation. Sector-wide losses, such as generalized price drops, can be high
when they do occur, but are the result of the country’s being a small, largely isolated market and the
poorest country in Central Asia. The domestic market can become saturated, with bumper production
of either highly perishable crops, such as tomatoes, or even less perishable crops, such as potatoes,
due to a lack of sufficient handling and storage capacity. As a landlocked country, Tajikistan must rely
on its neighbors as potential destination markets or for transit. Government can support the ability of
supply chains and key stakeholders, including producers, to cope with these normal risks by
strengthening agricultural services, encouraging private investment and competition, particularly in
trade and postharvest ventures, and satisfying specific infrastructure requirements.
Tajikistan’s Agriculture Sector
Tajikistan is the poorest of the Central Asian countries. More than half of GDP in 2013 came from
migrant remittances, and most migrant laborers work in Russia (World Bank 2014a). As presented in
the phase I analysis, agriculture is an important sector for the Tajik economy, representing 23 percent
of GDP and 51 percent of employment. Crop production accounts for approximately 80 percent of
agricultural output. Sector performance can have a significant impact on poverty reduction, as 77
percent of the poor live in rural areas.
A significant agricultural reform initiative—commonly referred to as Freedom to Farm—was
launched in 2007 to reduce government intervention in farming decisions and allow farmers to
diversify away from cotton. While the phase I risk assessment found that this crop diversification,
which relies largely on access to irrigation, underpins the relatively low aggregate risk profile of the
Tajik agriculture sector, the land reforms also launched the shift toward more commercial production
and farm decision making, both of which are still very new. On the one hand, this reform created a
greater opportunity for producers to respond to market signals and mitigate their risk by diversifying
their production base; on the other hand, market linkages and an active trade, particularly in the
Khatlon area in the south, are not yet in place to provide those market signals to producers. The
reform also resulted in the breakup of larger farms into much smaller individual farms, which works
against economies of scale and increases the cost of aggregating attractive volumes for market.
The 10 agricultural products with the largest share of Tajikistan’s GAO together represent only 63
percent of total GAO (table 7). Two staple food crops, wheat and potatoes, each account for 10
percent of GAO. Cotton is now only 9 percent of GAO, with production falling 40 percent between
2004 and 2009 in response to the cotton debt crisis. The main vegetable crops—onions, tomatoes,
and watermelons—together represent 15 percent of total GAO. Animal products, milk, beef, mutton,
and eggs represent about 19 percent combined.

The diversity of types of crops within the most significant 10 crops and the limited contribution that
each makes to the total demonstrate the diversity within Tajikistan’s agriculture sector. Every one of
these top 10 crops, with the exception of cotton, has experienced growth in overall volume of
production.
While Tajikistan’s production base has become more diverse and food production has steadily
increased as hectares move away from cotton, Tajikistan remains a net importer of food. In fact,
growth in food imports have significantly outpaced growth in exports, as shown in figure 37.8

Imports are dominated by wheat, vegetable oils, and sugar. Tajikistan’s food and animal exports
equaled only about 4 percent of total production by value in 2011 (figure 38). This confirms the
importance of the domestic market for Tajik producers. Even as cotton production has fallen
dramatically, cotton continues to be the most significant agricultural export. The other export crops
are higher-value products, including onions, dried fruit (particularly apricots), tomatoes, wet hides and
skins, and fresh fruit, including grapes.

And while the overall production of each of these crops (except cotton) has increased steadily,
particularly since the agricultural reform initiative launched in 2007, the volume and position of each
as exports have been extremely volatile, as shown in figure 39. Onions have been a significant export
each year, but the quantity has varied widely. Dried fruit, fresh fruit, and wet hides and skins have
been largely steady over the years. Tomatoes, much more perishable than onions, experienced
significant volatility in the quantity of trade and in price.

Looking at overall production alongside exports, figure 40 shows how insignificant export markets
are to the overall tomato industry in Tajikistan. Exports had two very sharp peaks, with exports
dropping to nearly zero before and after the reform, with no resulting impact on overall production.
Exports represented 41 percent of total production in 2007 and 25 percent in 2008, dropping to only
4 percent in 2011. These market signals were either not sufficiently communicated back through the
value chain to producers, thus affecting production decisions, or the domestic market grew to absorb
the excess production. Production continued to grow steadily.

Onion exports, in contrast, have represented at least 20 percent of total onion production (figure 41).
Exports peaked at 45 percent of total production in 2007 and 41 percent in 2010. Khatlon oblast is
able to overwinter onions, producing an early onion crop in May and early June, prior to Sugd and
other latitudes to the north. Similar to tomatoes, when onion exports fall from 40 percent to 20
percent, production does not contract. Production continues to grow steadily.

Agricultural exports are limited by the undeveloped trade and entrepreneurial segment of the
agriculture sector and by the logistical challenges of getting products out of Tajikistan. Russia is the
largest traditional export market for food products. Russian agricultural exports totaled US$75 million
(figure 42). Onions were the second most significant export, after cotton. More than 55,000 metric
tons of onions were exported in 2011. But both the volume and value traded (of onions, dry apricots,
                                                               59
and other exports to Russia) have been variable due in large part to the uncertainty of access and cost
of transporting by rail across Uzbekistan.

Kazakhstan is the second largest food export market for Tajikistan. While the Kyrgyz Republic can
be used as a transit country to reach the Kazakh and Russian markets, the most direct road routes are
through Uzbekistan. Longer truck routes via the Kyrgyz Republic to Russia can be used, but only for
the less perishable crops, and they increase cost and transit time. The Kyrgyz Republic also grows
some of the same products as Tajikistan, particularly apricots, but it cannot compete on the seasonality
of early onions. However, it does have lower transport costs to the same destination markets as
Tajikistan.
In general, Tajik products are sold in Russia’s second-tier cities, where Tajik traders have personal
relationships or relatives, such as Chelyabinsk, Ufa, and Kazan. Tajik traders need working capital,
market linkages, additional experience, and market information, as well as larger volumes of consistent
product before they can access the larger, more formal markets, both within these second-tier cities
and in the largest Russian markets. A niche exists for this spot commodity trade within the Russian
and Kazakh markets, but they are less consistent and highly competitive.
While diversity of production underpins the country’s relatively low risk profile, diversity of export
products and reliable access to export markets can support resilience of the sector. There are some
concerns that improved relations with Uzbekistan, which would improve reliability and reduce the
cost of transit through Uzbekistan via rail to Russian markets, could open Tajik markets to more
Uzbek agricultural products. Uzbekistan has a well-developed greenhouse horticulture industry, which
grew thanks to subsidized gas (for greenhouse heat) and benefits from the diversion of subsidized
fertilizer and inputs from cotton to the higher-value horticulture crops. Opening the Uzbek
relationship could improve access to export markets, but runs the risk of displacing Tajik production
on the domestic markets with cheaper Uzbek production of high-value horticulture products.

                                                  60
Tajikistan has been pursuing alternative trade agreements and transport routes to diversify market
opportunities for its growing production base. Discussions for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-
Tajikistan railway to bypass Uzbekistan as a rail link to the Middle East and Russian markets (and
beyond) were launched in 2013. Scheduled for 2015, the railway is unlikely to be completed on time,
but it is indicative of alternative opportunities to focus on alternative markets and transit routes.
Southern markets, including the large urban population of Pakistan or its port for international
markets, may be more difficult for Tajikistan because of continuing concerns about security and
wariness to give market access to the well-developed and highly skilled Afghani and Pakistani traders.
Improved relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the global community could also open
up port access to Tajikistan for global trade. China has been investing heavily across Central Asia to
improve transport routes and infrastructure along with the Asian Development Bank–supported
CAREC program. The infrastructure investments must be combined with political and trade
relationships at the national level and security confidence.
Aggregate market risk improves with efficiency, diversity, and competitiveness. Tajikistan has a strong
diversity of products, which has risen largely since the 2007 agricultural reform. With this diversity of
production and transition to more commercial agriculture, farmers have started to produce higher-
value and more perishable products. There is limited diversity of markets. Most products are sold in
the Tajik markets, which are still inefficient, lack investment and trade sophistication, and have limited
capacity to absorb fresh produce during the main harvest seasons. The purchasing power of the Tajik
market is also tied closely to the Russian and Kazakh economies due to the high dependence on
remittances. Current export markets are unreliable due to closures, high costs, impoundments, and
lack of available rail cars on the traditional logistical route (rail through Uzbekistan). Alternative
markets and transit routes to the south suffer from insecurity and are difficult to access due to a lack
of trade experience and sophistication.
Improving the risk profile of the agriculture sector requires increasing the diversity of market options
and improving the efficiency and competitiveness of supply chains. Continuing to open the economy
will bring higher risks from imported products alongside improved logistical access to foreign markets.
The sector can be supported with improved access into these markets and improved efficiency in the
domestic market (improved logistical infrastructure, marketing information, quality and standards
capability and capacity, and trade facilitation will positively affect multiple products) and continued
investments in improving competiveness in supply chains and products (including investments in
upgrading technology along supply chains, access to affordable finance, and business enabling
environment).
Risk Management: Areas of Priority
The Tajik agriculture sector has an overall low risk profile and largely normal market risks, including
price volatility risk and market shifts that affect individual or groups of commodities rather than the
entire sector. The domestic market is the most important market, accounting for more than 90 percent
of GAO value. However, purchasing power in the domestic market depends on remittances from
laborers in Russia and Kazakhstan. Unreliable access to foreign markets means that perishable
products are dumped on domestic markets when logistics shut down or become too costly.
                                                   61
While various livestock products represent roughly 20 percent of total GAO, no single crop
dominates. The sector has improved its risk profile through the diversification of crops. Tajik istan’s
agricultural reform, opening up production and therefore increasing opportunities in postharvest
enterprises and trade, is still relatively new. It was only launched in 2007. The supply chains have not
seen significant investment and cross-cutting growth in capacity and value added due to lack of access
to affordable working capital and investments, unreliable access to markets with high absorptive
capacity, use of old technology and antiquated handling, storage, and processing facilities, and lack of
market intelligence. Risk management policies should support the capacity of producers and
stakeholders in the entire sector to manage and respond to market shifts and events, without
overemphasizing any particular crop or set of crops.
Tajikistan may have a seasonality advantage for some products in the traditional northern markets.
However, continued focus on improving access to traditional markets (Russia and Kazakhstan)
magnifies Tajikistan’s risk exposure and vulnerability to the political and economic welfare of these
countries. These countries not only are destination markets for the majority of Tajik food exports, but
economic problems in those markets have a large impact on Tajik domestic markets. Tajikistan is in a
geographic location to consider markets and transit to the south, including to and through
Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan.
Various donor projects and government programs are investing in projects to increase the efficiency
and competitiveness of specific agriculture value chains and increase private sector investment across
agricultural industries and supporting services, including financial and information services. This
includes the World Bank’s recently launched Agriculture Commercialization Project, which seeks to
increase the efficiency and competitiveness of five value chains.9 These programs contribute to
improving the capacity of stakeholders to manage and respond to normal agricultural risks.
It is important to balance agriculture sector investments and development efforts across the three risk
management pillars of efficiency, diversity, and competitiveness. Diversity of production is the
strongest aggregate risk mitigation characteristic of Tajikistan’s agriculture sector. Practical prog rams
and investments to increase efficiency and competitiveness of specific value chains are important to
unlock their particular constraints. Diversity of markets, including nontraditional export markets, will
be possible with greater efficiency and competitiveness and will contribute to decreasing sector risk.
An overarching aggregate risk management strategy needs to balance pursuing narrow constraints or
specific opportunities within particular commodity value chains with pursuing diversity of production
and of market. Without this balance, the sector runs the risk of overemphasizing dependence on a
smaller set of products, value chains, and end markets.
Other possible government interventions related to normal risk, such as the establishment of
supported floor prices, may encourage producers and sector stakeholders to pursue more risky
activities. Unintentionally incentivizing risky behavior, however, should be avoided. The public sector
needs to ensure that all policies and activities are predictable and transparent. Uncertainty of

regulations and interventions, including responses to both normal and catastrophic risks, can
disincentivize private investment, savings, and an active commodity trade.
Risk Management in National Agricultural Strategy
Tajikistan’s Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS) 2013–15 highlights relevant objectives and
activities for improving the risk management capacity of the agriculture sector as well as a few key
challenges and risks relevant to the agriculture sector and more specifically to the market risks
identified in phase I of this assessment. The LSIS outlines specific goals with regard to improving
foreign trade policy and procedures; strengthening Tajikistan’s contribution to global trade; facilitating
regional cooperation; improving the business climate, in particular by strengthening its legal basis;
supporting entrepreneurship development and attracting investment; and applying necessary reforms
in the financial sphere. Work to strengthen these areas will improve the efficiency and competiveness
of the agriculture sector and attract additional investment and businesses.
The agriculture sector focus within the LSIS gives priority to food security and continued gains in the
effectiveness of producing agricultural goods, including cotton. However, focusing on food security
at the national level runs the risk of promoting a narrower range of staple food crops where a
comparative advantage is not possible, thus increasing risk to the agriculture sector. Specific objectives
include the development of meat, milk, and poultry products for domestic consumption.
Market information, enabling environment, and dated technology are challenges to the Tajik
agriculture sector. Tajikistan has joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), which was a specific
trade facilitation and competitiveness activity noted by the LSIS. However, the LSIS did not focus
specifically on risk. Tajikistan is also an active member in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with
China. Other important trade agreements and frameworks include the Commonwealth of
Independent States Free Trade Area and the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Tajikistan Transit Trade
Agreement. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the second largest investor in Tajikistan after China.
Potential Solutions
Therefore, recommendations to increase sectoral efficiency and competitiveness fall into three broad
areas: (1) market knowledge and training, (2) investment promotion and business enabling
environment, and (3) trade facilitation. An aggregate, systemic sectoral approach can support actors
and stakeholders across the diverse products and value chains. Table 8 provides an overview over
identified market risks and proposed responses.

Market Knowledge and Training
Asymmetrical availability of and access to market information result in significant sector inefficiencies.
Basic market information includes accurate historical data sets of market prices, timely indicative
market prices, traded volumes through critical markets, and production data. Market intelligence is the
analysis of basic market information for use in decision making. Market intelligence includes trend
and correlation analysis, forecasting, and analysis of other relevant external business environment
information, including political and macroeconomic factors. Basic market information is typically a
public good and is necessary for the development of market intelligence. Market intelligence is most
often a private sector product that stakeholders may develop and analyze themselves or may purchase
as a service from a third-party specialist.
Active market actors, including producers, traders, and processors, track prices and trade trends across
seasons and regions to predict market movement for the current season. Having publicly available,
accurate data sets allows stakeholders, not only market actors but also financial institutions, to conduct
trend and correlation analysis. Many larger actors are active in their local markets on a daily basis and
are extremely well informed; however, they may be tangentially aware of the usual and expected
correlations between their markets and the large regional markets but not monitor those regional
markets with the same depth or focus. Smaller producers and actors are often only active in their local
markets as harvest approaches and into the storage season. They likely do not have the same access
or resources to obtain market information or generate their own market intelligence outside of the
main marketing season.
The LSIS identifies lack of information on product markets and prices as a key challenge for
agriculture sector development. In addition, the LSIS has noted widening of entrepreneurship and
access to new Asian markets as part of ensuring an improved investment climate and private sector
and entrepreneurship development. The public sector has some capacity for forecasting production
using reports and statistics submitted by the oblasts to the central government. The strength and
timeliness of this information are not clear. The National Statistics Bureau collects and publishes
production and price data, but the information is not easily accessible and is not available in a timely
fashion. Hard-copy reports are published periodically with rich data and information, but no soft
copies are publicly available to other stakeholders, including financial institutions.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has developed tools specifically for the financial sector
to assess loan risk. A web-based agricultural risk assessment, which is based on technology and
cashflow cards, is being rolled out to Tajik financial institutions. This effort required and continues to
require market information data sets. Neksigol is a private market information and intelligence
organization that came out of an IFC project in 2002. It is a member-owned company with more than
1,000 member producers. Neksigol has some member-focused services and entities. Its main business
is aggregated purchase and resale of inputs and agrochemicals (serving as agents for high-quality crop
protection companies such as Syngenta).


                                                   66
It was founded within a cotton program and continues to be strongest with regard to cotton
production. Recently the company has started to diversify into fruit (including dried fruit), and other
horticulture. One unit serves as a microfinance institution. The extension and information unit was
founded in 2008, reaching approximately 7,300 producers through a website, a text message service,
two smartphone apps, and a self-published newspaper. More extension information appears to be
shared than market intelligence, although basic price information is included in all mechanisms.
Neksigol is active in pursuing new market linkages and serving as a broker for farmers. New markets
include FairTrade certified dried fruit to Europe and Australia, dry beans into Afghanistan, and
watermelon and onions along border areas with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Neksigol has
approximately 3,000 subscribers and distributes information in the three main crop-producing regions
of Tajikistan. The company continues to receive some donor support, particularly for providing
extension and information services to producer households.
Other private agricultural advisory services are focusing mostly on linking extension information with
input finance, with the business based primarily on cotton producers, with other production as
ancillary. Some of these firms are also moving into market linkage and broker roles, but are new to
that space. The Rural Investment Climate Assessment noted that more than half of farmers who
market their production sell at the farm-gate. This is not uncommon, but it may weaken the access of
producers to market information and market intelligence.
Equal and predictable access to reliable market information, accurate data sets, and market intelligence
allows stakeholders, including producers, to make critical decisions to mitigate risk and cope with
normal market risks.
A complementary set of market information, market intelligence, and training services and support
can be developed between the public sector and the private sector. The public sector can strengthen
its timely collection and reporting of production forecasts, market prices, and end-of-season
commodity data. CAMIB in Moldova is an NGO agriculture market information and intelligence
service that was launched within the Ministry of Agriculture and Processing Industry under a
European Union TACIS program in 1997. In 1999, it became a nonprofit NGO, providing domestic
food operators with information and marketing services fundamental to creating and maintaining
market transparency. The program receives donor funding, which has helped to fund its publicly
available market information as well as to underwrite market intelligence reports both on Moldovan
and on target international markets.10
Private market intelligence services and commodity groups, such as the Neksigol, can use the publicly
available data sets and political and economic analysis to provide useful market intelligence through a
variety of fee-for-service mechanisms, including agricultural magazines and regular commodity- or
market-specific subscription newsletters.11 They are already providing both public market
information (largely donor funded or subsidized by other revenue streams) and private market

10   See http://www.camib.com/eng/about_us.php.

intelligence for target markets. As noted, some private capacity exists within Tajikistan, but it is
focused mostly on cotton, with other commodities and market focus still emerging. The market for
services in other value chains is nascent, as there is limited investment in commercial agribusiness. At
the same time, this market intelligence can support investment promotion and risk planning. Both the
trade promotion agencies in the public sector and the specific export-focused commodity groups are
well situated to contribute to meaningful market intelligence for market diversification and for the
most relevant foreign markets.
Training is needed for key market actors, particularly producers, smaller traders, and agribusinesses,
in the use of publicly available data sets and building capacity and interest (market development) in
market intelligence services and products.
To improve market knowledge and training, the following next steps are recommended:
      Inventory existing forecasting and market information processes and reports within the
       relevant ministries and agencies, including the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of
       Economy, and the National Statistical Agency. A wealth of information is collected, but it is
       not collated or made available in a useful, timely, and easily accessible and analyzed format.
       The information is collected and maintained in different ministries and agencies. Data are
       often only available in hard-copy reports. One agency or team needs to have clear
       responsibility for driving the process and ensuring progress.
      Design and implement a timely market information reporting structure in consultation with
       the private sector. Consider the use of appropriate information technology to facilitate access.
       Review other country experiences.
      Develop and implement, with the private sector, market information and intelligence
       utilization training for producers, agribusinesses, and traders to inform stakeholders of the
       availability of public information, to increase the use and effectiveness of information and
       reporting mechanisms, and to build a market for privately developed high-quality market
       intelligence. These trainings may be value chain specific and should occur at the oblast and
       district levels. They may be leveraged to bring together value chain actors, particularly traders,
       to facilitate market linkages and develop additional business relationships.
Investment Promotion and Business Operating Environment
Tajikistan has uneven investment in the postharvest, downstream end of the various commodity value
chains. Even within the country, Sugd and the areas around Dushanbe have more agribusinesses and
active traders than Khatlon, in the south. A significant agricultural reform initiative, which was
launched in 2007, reduced government intervention in farming decisions and allowed for crop
diversification away from cotton. This reform created opportunities for producers to respond to
market signals and to mitigate risk by diversifying their production base, but farmers have limited
experience and market channels are not yet in place to provide those market signals. The postharvest
and downstream private sector does not yet have the experience or the time to build businesses around
the new production and market opportunities.
The World Bank’s Doing Business indicators rank countries and measure factors important for the
business investment and operating environment. Tajikistan and other Central Asian economies are
ranked among the poorest business operating environments in the world. In 2011, the Doing Business

                                                  68
report highlighted Tajikistan’s progress and emphasized the need to continue improving the
investment climate and enabling environment for entrepreneurs. Tajikistan was listed as one of the 10
most improved economies, climbing 10 places. The LSIS emphasized the need to continue building
on that improvement. One result of the difficult investment climate and lack of access to affordable
finance is the extremely old age of the few existing postharvest, downstream businesses within the
commodity value chains.
With regard to processors, there are few dairy processors, food manufacturers, fruit drying companies,
or any other agribusiness with modern, competitive equipment. In Khatlon in particular, few
agribusinesses have access to “red-line” electricity, which is prioritized for 24-hour service. Old
infrastructure and equipment are often still used, significantly below capacity, with low efficiency and
high costs compared to equipment that could be imported. These operating and investment issues
drag down the efficiency and competitiveness of the value chains. The lack of innovation is not only
relevant to physical technology but also to processes and standards, such as the adoption and
implementation of hazard analysis and critical control points and other food safety and processing
best practices.
In 2011 Tajikistan was ranked 139 in the Doing Business list of 183 countries. Tajikistan was one of
the countries cited for forming a regulatory reform committee, convening regularly, and focusing
specifically on improving the Doing Business indicators. In 2015 Tajikistan’s ranking is 166 (improved
from 177 in 2014). The challenges have remained largely the same in the intervening years: dealing
with construction permits, getting electricity, paying taxes, and trading across borders (discussed
further in the next section). Transparency International ranked Tajikistan 152 on their Corruptions
Perceptions Index. Transparent, predictable, and evenly applied regulations and a competitive
business operating environment are risk variables considered for any investment.
A quarterly advisory council is convened at the presidential, regional, and district levels to continue
pushing necessary regulatory reforms in a participatory manner with the private sector.
Increasing investment in agribusiness along the supply chain will improve the competitiveness of the
Tajik agriculture sector. This will reduce exposure to some market risks, including the displacement
of Tajik products in both domestic and export markets from competing producers and processors,
and will improve market linkages. Improving the business enabling environment and promoting
investment are cross-cutting activities within many donor projects, although they focus mostly on
particular value chains, including the World Bank Agribusiness Competitiveness Project. The
following are the key components of promoting investment and improving the business operating
environment, specifically focused on aggregate sectoral risk rather than specific value chain
constraints.
Private sector consultation should underpin all efforts to improve the enabling environment on the
part of the public sector. Tajikistan has quarterly advisory committee meetings at the presidential,
oblast, and district levels for consultation on regulatory reform and investment promotion. If
agriculture and agribusiness investment is not a central convening focus, it may get sidelined among
more general investment promotion or other public-private dialogue.

                                                  69
Upgrading technology and adopting innovations across the agriculture sector will improve
competitiveness and efficiency of the sector. Existing finance has not been sufficient to encourage
investment and implementation of new technologies and innovations. A competitive matching grant
fund can encourage the sector to upgrade innovation and technology, particularly in postharvest
marketing, handling, and processing. Existing enterprises can upgrade equipment, processes, and
technology to improve the competitiveness of their existing product portfolio and develop and
produce new products. Producers and traders can upgrade their handling capacity and reduce losses
by upgrading their storage, handling, and packing facilities. A complementary activity can be combined
with commodity value chain groups and chambers of commerce to facilitate information and exposure
to international best practices and technological advances.
To strengthen the investment promotion and business operating environment, the following next
steps are recommended:
      Review the existing regulatory reform and investment promotion public-private consultation
       meetings to assess the focus on agribusiness investment and development promotion. Ensure
       that all stakeholder groups are represented. Use other country experiences to devise a best-
       practice consultation framework and work with existing organizations. This platform could be
       used to raise critical issues across the entire sector with the aim of improving the capacity of
       the sector to cope with normal risks. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing, and Processing may
       be an appropriate co-chair to maintain an agribusiness focus.
      Define and develop a matching grant fund for spurring critical investment in upgrading
       technology and adopting innovation within the agribusiness sector to improve
       competitiveness and efficiency. Consider the example of Fundación Chile and others to
       incorporate previous experiences (box 3). It is important to consider risk within the framework
       and governance of the fund to avoid incentivizing extremely high-risk investments. Assess the
       feasibility of the matching grant fund in terms of scale and potential impact and develop a
       business plan for it. Prioritize value chains and postharvest enterprises that may not be the
       focus of other donor funding. Competitiveness and equal access to affordable finance are
       important to avoid incentivizing high-risk investments or concentrating market power.
 Box 3 Innovation to Increase Investment in Agribusiness
 In 1976, the Chilean government created Fundación Chile to add economic value to the country’s
 products and services through innovation. As a private, non-profit corporation with funding from
 the state and an American conglomerate, Fundación Chile played a crucial role in technology
 transfer and incubation in target industries, including agribusiness, investing in research and
 development to overcome market failures. In the 1970s and 1980s, Fundación Chile supported
 innovation to encourage export diversification, initiating quality-improvement programs for
 salmon, aquaculture, meat, vegetables, and fruit. As a result, exports of salmon and trout increased
 from 300 tons per year to 24,000 tons a year in the 1990s. The “Boxed Beef” initiative introduced
 vacuum packing to the meat supply chain, creating new jobs and bringing more hygienic, better-
 quality packaged meat products to the market. Similar successes occurred in the oyster, berries, and
 asparagus subsectors.

 Business Model
 Fundación Chile identifies investment opportunities with high potential, based on technology
 innovation that is appropriate for local conditions. Once a new technology is developed (or acquired

Trade Facilitation
Trade facilitation seeks to make trade across borders faster, cheaper, and more predictable. Trade
facilitation can make Tajik products more competitive both in domestic markets and as exports in
foreign markets. Predictable and lower-cost trade procedures can also encourage private investment,
including foreign direct investment, in the agriculture sector, particularly in postharvest handling and
processing ventures. The four pillars of trade facilitation are transparency, simplification,
harmonization, and standardization. Various literature reviews have estimated trade transaction costs
to represent between 1 and 15 percent of the value of traded goods (for example, see ADB and
UNESCAP 2013).
The World Bank’s Doing Business ranking measures factors important for the business investment
and operating enabling environment and ranks countries accordingly. The Trading Across Border
factor considers the bureaucratic and logistical challenges of international trade, both imports and
exports. This includes the financial and time costs of procedures and transport. Central Asian
countries rank among the lowest in the world, a result of both their geographic location (since cost to
an ocean port is an important component) and regional trade issues (which can strengthen or weaken
their ability to reach critical ocean ports). Tajikistan ranks 188 of 189 in the Trading Across Borders
factor. The cost to export a standard 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) from Tajikistan is 63 percent
higher than average, and the cost to import is the second highest in the world, more than double the
cost to import 1 TEU into the Kyrgyz Republic.
Tajikistan is a central transport hub in the region. Three Asian highways connect through the country.
AH 7 provides access through Afghanistan to South Asia, running north-south. AH 65 runs east-west,
with Uzbekistan on the west and the Kyrgyz Republic on the east. The longest is AH 66, which
connects Dushanbe with Kulma Pass, a critical link with China. Traditional Russian markets are
                                                     71
located at a significant distance from Tajikistan. Chelyabinsk is 2,500 kilometers from Dushanbe and
relies on Uzbek transit and railway. Karachi, Pakistan, with a population of approximately 14 million
consumers and international port access, is approximately 2,000 kilometers by road, which requires
transit through Afghanistan. Tajikistan should continue to improve bilateral relationships with
neighboring countries and to develop alternative transit routes to diverse end markets. It is well
positioned to prioritize South Asia and its port as well as China as alternatives to its traditional markets
and opportunities west, which require transit through Uzbekistan.
Tajikistan’s trade facilitation needs to be broad based and requires investment in infrastructure,
operations, and institutions (ADB 2009). Tajikistan is one of nine countries within CAREC, the
Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. With funding from the Asia Development Bank,
CAREC is using transit trade for development and linking Western China with Europe through
Central Asia. The CAREC transport area has identified six transport corridors for investment and
development to improve competitiveness of trade in, out, and through the Central Asian countries.
Four of the six corridors include Tajikistan. CAREC identified a significant need to upgrade and invest
in its road system along the key identified corridors. Continued investment and upgrading of roads
themselves as well as the trucks and transit equipment across the industry will contribute to decreasing
transport costs and increasing sectoral efficiency.
Nontariff barriers are among the most important trade-related concerns, and agriculture, in particular,
can be affected by domestic subsidies, uneven implementation of sanitary and phytosanitary
requirements, technical barriers to trade, export or import restrictions, and import or export licenses
(ITC 2011). The lack of innovation and investment in Tajikistan within the private sector includes
quality processes and the ability to meet international standards. The public sector lacks the capacity
to certify export products, which is not as relevant for primary production but is necessary for
investments in processing.
Improving trade facilitation requires the use of a regular platform for private sector consultation (for
example, the proposed agribusiness public-private consultation dialogue outlined in the section on
investment promotion). Tajikistan’s trade facilitation needs to be broad based and requires investment
in infrastructure, operations, and institutions.
Improving infrastructure inefficiencies requires the upgrading and maintenance of old railways and
rail cars. Main roads need upgrading, particularly as trade continues to increase traffic along central
roads. A lack of leasing facilities has kept the trucking fleet from needed investment. The logistical
services available within the country are limited and lack significant trade experience. Investment
promotion and business expansion in logistical services can decrease the cost and improve the
efficiency of the agriculture sector.
A leasing industry can help logistics companies to refleet and expand transport fleets (box 4). Tajikistan
can collaborate with the financial sector to ensure that a supportive regulatory framework is in place
for banks to develop and offer leasing mechanisms to expand investment and upgrade trucking and
rail equipment.

 Box 4 Challenges to Establishing a Leasing Industry for Agribusiness: Lessons from
 Armenia
 Leasing is mechanism that can provide Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) with the ability to
 invest in productive and logistics equipment. In credit-constrained environments, a lease provides
 access to finance, where the borrower (lessee) makes a monthly payment in exchange for use of a
 productive asset and the lender (lessor) retains legal ownership. This helps SMEs establish a credit
 history and gain access to the formal financial system. In the agriculture sector, a leasing industry
 can provide much needed access to term financing, allowing agribusinesses to use leased equipment
 as collateral.
 The case of the ACBA Leasing Company in Armenia provides lessons in overcoming unexpected
 challenges to establishing a leasing industry. After starting up in 2006, ACBA encountered problems
 with the availability of equipment for import, lack of consumer understanding of how leasing works,
 and regulatory issues in the enabling environment. Since the type of equipment ACBA typically
 offers for lease was not previously imported in large quantities, ACBA hired a manager to analyze
 the lifespan, local capacity for operations and maintenance, and resale value of equipment being
 leased. To disseminate knowledge on leasing, ACBA provided training for staff and paid
 commissions to each of its branches for every new lease. Finally, ACBA successfully advocated for
 equipment imported for lease to be exempt from a value-added tax, if the equipment was already
 on the government’s list of equipment exempt from VAT when imported for use.

Both the public and the private sector lack the capability to control quality, and this weakness
constrains access to certain markets and competitiveness with foreign products. Improved quality
control capability is a cornerstone of investment promotion targeting export market opportunities. A
collaborative approach between government and the private sector should be pursued. The IFC has
supported successful food safety projects in transition countries, including the Ukraine and Belarus.
Its extensive experience could be replicated and adapted to Tajikistan (box 5). The IFC Food Safety
Toolkit provides extensive coverage of core building blocks and describes examples and models of
food safety regulatory reform. Upgrades to the capacity of both the public and the private sectors are
relevant to nontraditional markets and will increase the diversity of processed products and
competitiveness into traditional markets.
 Box 5. Stepwise Approach to Food Safety
 For Indian agribusinesses, compliance with food safety standards is one of the key barriers to
 entering new markets. The upfront investment cost required for standard certification is too high
 for most smallholder farmers, and this limits their ability to market horticulture crops to
 supermarkets and regional exporters. To overcome this barrier, the Indian agribusiness Jain
 Irrigation System Ltd. partnered with the IFC to develop and pilot a “JAIN GAP” standard to apply
 to farmers within its supply chain. JAIN GAP – a simplified version of GLOBALGAP – introduces
 basic standards for pesticide use and worker safety without significantly increasing production costs
                                                  73
 for farmers. GLOBALGAP recognizes the JAIN GAP standard as a “Primary Farm Assurance”
 Standard, providing a stepping stone for certifying small farmers to a higher standard in the future.

To facilitate trade, the following next steps are recommended:
       Outline a logistics roadmap to include regulatory reform to support the development of a
        leasing industry and incentives to support expanded logistics services and businesses within
        Tajikistan. Develop the roadmap in consultation with the private sector, particularly financial
        services. Use the experiences of other countries to create a best-practice framework.
       Consider a food safety regulatory environment reform project aimed at improving compliance
        with international food safety best practice. Design and structure a reform and capacity-
        building project to address both public and private sector needs. Use a collaborative process,
        working with existing commodity and value chain groups.

Solutions Area 2: Improve Livestock Productivity
Introduction
This section builds on the Phase I recommendations for the livestock sector to identify and assess
strategies to strengthen the resiliency of livestock systems and rangelands in Tajikistan. Interventions
are identified that could (1) reverse degradation of water, soil, and vegetation cover; (2) safeguard the
long-term viability of rangeland ecosystems, while ensuring sustainable access to grazing land; and (3)
strengthen livestock services (veterinary, animal health, feed and fodder supply, destocking, water and
grazing access, and weather and market information, among others), enabling farmers to manage their
resources better, to respond to climate and market signals, and to protect their assets in times of
drought.
Overview of the Risk Environment and Framework
The National Development Strategy, originally covering 2007–15, is now being developed for 2016–
30. The three priorities of the national government are energy, communication, and agriculture. Yet
agriculture receives less than 2 percent of the national budget, which barely covers basic staffing and
operations and leaves little or no funding for programs. Less than 1 percent of the allocated budget is
used for subsidies. On an ad hoc basis, funding may be provided for irrigation and directed credit
from other parts of the national budget. The MOA budget is allocated mainly to wages (70 –80
percent). The priorities for agricultural development are to (1) improve processing to avoid losses in
production and ensure better export potential; (2) develop marketing linkages to meet international
standards and requirements with competitive products; and (3) improve the efficiency of land use,
preservation, and reclamation. In agriculture, 16 programs are being implemented, including the
following.
The National Pasture Program is underfunded, receiving only TJS 200,00012 a year. Locusts destroy
50,000–60,000 hectares of pasture and crops annually in Tajikistan. The MOA estimates that US$2
million a year is needed to control locusts if Afghanistan and Uzbekistan also take measures.
The Vaccination Program receives TJS 2.5 million, but an additional TJS 8 million is needed to cover
the eight main diseases covered through national programs. Total vaccine coverage would require TJS
18 million a year. Donor projects on tuberculosis, FMD, and other diseases currently fill some of the
gaps.
Government agriculture policy and programs previously focused on directed production of cotton.
The government is in the process of refocusing on a broader range of products, including livestock.
This major policy shift, known as “Freedom to Farm,” began in 2008, following the cotton debt crisis.
The government is working with the World Bank on the Agrarian Reform Program (2012–20), which
seeks to “develop a productive, profitable, and sustainable employment-creating agricultural system,
based on ecologically sound use and management of natural resources, making agriculture one of the

                                                          75
main pillars of the Tajik economy.” Additional objectives are to (1) enable farmers to access land, (2)
ensure access to irrigation, (3) allow farmers to develop organizations, associations, and cooperatives
and to choose what to grow and how to market their products, and (4) develop financing mechanisms
that are sustainable, affordable, and fair. While the program is a significant improvement over previous
approaches, subprograms need further definition to be effective.
The Tajik government and the International Trade Center prepared a Food Safety Strategy with the
World Health Organization and the FAO to ensure Tajikistan’s compliance with OIE standards. The
program was to be launched in early April 2015. The biggest constraint to implementation is that the
program rests with Tajik Standard instead of a group that has the knowledge and linkages to support
the mandate.
The IFC–Central Asia Agri-Finance Program (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic)
supports access to finance and business development for supply chains. It works with banks and
microfinance institutions to build up the capacity of credit agents. The program has developed
products on risk assessment and introduced innovative products from other parts of the world,
including the use of warehouse receipts and asset-backed loans to overcome collateral problems. Raw
materials qualify as collateral up to a certain ratio of total value. Processors are seen as the aggregators
and catalysts of the system. They offer diagnostic services and recognize mismatches between available
equipment and available raw materials. Diagnosticians look at technology, human resources,
management, and other factors and provide an estimate of potential increases in productivity. The
IFC provides advisory services. Projects cost approximately US$2 million, with costs shared 50:50..
For smaller enterprises, the Invest Program with IMON International supports project start-up. Five-
year loans at 18 percent interest are provided for investments in equipment. In the broader area of
financial capacity building, the IFC supports knowledge sharing to build creditworthiness.
The World Bank has implemented several projects related to agriculture. The most recent is the US$22
million Agriculture Commercialization Project to support commercialization of the agricultural sector.
Other projects have addressed environmental management, transportation, land registration, and
cadaster. A regional Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Project is at the concept stage, and
implementation is planned for 2016–21.
The FAO is helping the government to coordinate the Agrarian Reform Program. The program
involves restructuring the MOA and addressing issues related to water, land, and agricultural financing.
The FAO has also been involved in conservation agriculture, the seed sector, dairy production, and
integrated pest management, among others. The FAO has also worked with veterinarian service
reform and capacity development for government and private veterinarians. The veterinary service
and association are very proactive, but lack the funding to carry out their mandates. The FAO is
developing a US$1 million project to support the institutional development of veterinary services at
all levels.
The European Union (EU) Enhancing Competitiveness of Agribusiness Project is a four-year project
(€32 million credit line, of which €6 million is designated for grants) that focuses on developing food
value chains and enhancing farm production. Channel 1 provides small loans (up to €10,000 for 1.5

                                                    76
years) for an approved menu of equipment. Channel 2 provides larger loans, primarily to processors,
in the range of €100,000 to €300,000 for equipment upgrades. Business plans are developed.
The United Nations Development Programme’s Aid for Trade Project works with the Chamber of
Commerce and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The components include
strengthening capacity for (1) trade policy, especially with regard to WTO compliance, (2) trade
promotion, and (3) grassroots market information on trading platforms and prices, among others.
A local nongovernmental organization (NGO) hosts the market information platform and collects
information, which it provides, for a fee, to farmers, businesses, and other users. It also has a
messaging service with price information, updates, and alerts as well as a mobile application with “how
to” information (agroinform.tg). The website was established in 2010 and by 2014 was receiving
80,000 visits monthly, mostly from Russia. The level of local use was not disclosed. Commercial
farmers use the platform for buying and selling.
The project also runs a Business Challenge Fund, a revolving fund with affordable loans that charge
interest in the range of 22 percent. Rates are high because agriculture is seen as risky and not profitable.
The fund provides loans at 8–12 percent interest to women, green technology projects, and
agribusinesses seeking to retool their operations. The purpose is to increase processing capacity for
final, value added products. Import substitution is a focus.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is implementing the Livestock and
Pasture Development Project in seven districts of Khatlon oblast, one of the poorest areas of the
country. The project has three components:
               Community development and institutional strengthening. This component provides equipment
                and training to pasture user associations (PUAs), which were created under the Pasture
                Law. The project works with the MOA at the national, regional, and local levels.
               Pasture development. The project has an 87-hectare demonstration site and will look at
                the economics of forage production. The medium-term plan is to cultivate 900
                hectares in six or seven districts. The project seeks to strengthen the private sector,
                including veterinary services and facilities, and improve the production of fodder
                (seeds, minerals) and livestock by improving pastures. This includes work on
                community livestock and pasture development plans, with related subprojects,
                investments, and community grants for forage production and infrastructure (wells,
                bridges, roads, winter structures).
               Income generation for women. The project creates community groups for producing and
                marketing livestock products.
The German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) is implementing the Sustainable Pasture
Management in Central Asia Project in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan. The aim is to introduce sustainable land use approaches (pasture rotation, increased
grazing mobility) to reduce overgrazing and degradation of pastures, especially in the vicinity of
villages. This long-term project will run until 2015. It has established regional linkages and hosted the
first pasture practitioner’s conference in Bishkek in November 2014. The project is creating a regional
platform to support continued learning and sustainability in pasture management in Central Asia.

                                                    77
Many other projects have been implemented in the agriculture sector. Aid needs to be coordinated if
these many initiatives are to achieve aggregate results. Aid is coordinated by the Aid Coordination
Council, which is under the Office of the President. However, turnover of representatives on the
council has hampered its ability to provide long-term guidance for project coordination.
The Agricultural Risk Environment
Risks and their management approaches are multifaceted. The high-priority risks and proposed
management approaches identified in Phase I were investigated in more detail to identify their
component parts and related weaknesses or gaps in risk management. Phase I recommended
continuing to diversify the sector by expanding irrigation and improving water management,
developing markets, investing in storage and transport, creating export corridors from Tajikistan to
Russia, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan, and improving planning and financing for emergency preparedness
and response. Within this context, the analysis takes a supply-chain, value-chain approach and looks
at input supply systems and services, feed and strategic forage reserves, animal health, medicines and
vaccines, breeding stock, supplements, and market, agricultural, and weather information systems.
The analysis here looks at various types of risks that face livestock producers, including market risk,
price risk, production risk, business risk, financial risk, and policy risk. Issues with any single risk or
production problem will lead to suboptimal performance and profitability and ultimately decrease
resilience to risk. This section draws heavily on stakeholder interviews conducted in April 2015.
Market and Price Risk
Tajikistan has unique advantages that position it well for agricultural development: water supplies are
abundant, 11 agro-climatic zones allow for a wide range of products and a long period for production
and marketing, labor is inexpensive, and domestic and export market opportunities are good.
However, many of these opportunities are missed due to a lack of capacity on the part of both the
public and private sectors to respond. Due to weaknesses throughout the system, farmers are not
incentivized to respond to the market opportunities that exist around them.
Milk is a primary example of lost opportunities. There is a large unmet demand for milk. Large
processors are establishing their own farms to secure a steady supply of reliable raw products. Small
producers are not at scale for low-cost production or market aggregation. Even though the sale of
unprocessed milk has been banned, small holders sell milk directly into the market at a price higher
than is being paid by formal processors. Inspection and certification costs are frequent and high.
Processors offer producers less than TJS 2 per liter. Without a system for recording dairy production,
there is no basis for payment. At the same time, poor hygiene of raw milk poses a real cost to
processors. Productivity must increase if the costs of production are to decrease.
Processors face several issues. Old plant and equipment are often mismatched in capacity with the
actual supply of raw materials. Electrical shortages impede the implementation of quality control
programs along the value chain, making it difficult to ensure the proper postharvest handling of
products. The national budget has adopted a new program for cold storage of fruits and potatoes in
various regions of the country, but much more storage capacity is needed for meat and milk. Exporters
have gaps in their knowledge of international trade requirements and how to achieve them. Many
                                                 78
companies cannot satisfy sanitary and phytosanitary standards, hazard analysis and critical control
point (HACCP) testing, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and other requirements
because of issues related to equipment, facilities, knowledge, capacity, packaging, labeling, nutritional
labeling, and branding.
Shortages of raw milk affect the viability of milk processing. Low farm production (1–2 liters a day)
and seasonality are factors. Very little has been done to improve the collection of milk, so the quality
of milk is poor.
Animal Health Risk
The top priorities for strengthening veterinarian services are infectious disease control (FMD, PPR,
contagious caprine pleuropneumonia), laboratory strengthening (technical equipment upgrading
estimated at US$20 million), and implementation of the animal identification program (US$2 million
for the database, central and decentralized network, and ear tags).
The most immediate need is to strengthen the vaccination program for infection diseases. The national
budget of TJS 2.5 million covers only 20–25 percent of the funds required to implement the program
fully. As a result, only eight zoonotic diseases are covered, and only anthrax has 100 percent coverage.
Although 70 percent of the budget is spent on FMD, coverage for this disease is only 10–20 percent.
The budget is often delivered late, when livestock have already been sent to pasture. The large, state-
owned farms are 100 percent covered. Private producers who have the financial means to do so pay
for their own vaccines. The main risk is from small holders who comingle livestock around the village
and in pastures. If one or two farmers do not vaccinate their livestock, the entire local herd is exposed
to the disease. The annual requirement for full implementation of the program would be TJS 18
million.
Vaccines for the eight main diseases are tested for quality, but other vaccines available on the open
market may be of poor quality or fake. Cold chains for the vaccines are deficient. The FAO has
supported cold chains in a few districts. This program needs to be replicated across the country.
Another issue is that vaccines do not always match the strains of the prevalent disease. When
mismatched, efficacy can drop to 40–50 percent. Local laboratories do not have the capacity to analyze
to this level of detail, and samples must be sent to Russia for analysis.
The animal identification program has been approved by government resolution, but no budget has
been allocated for its implementation. Activities that do not require money for implementation, such
as regulations and the animal passport, have been completed and approved. The FAO is about to pilot
the program in a limited area for one or two species. This pilot should be scaled up after its completion.
Laboratory capacity is inadequate. The central laboratory was assisted under an FAO–EU program
and is functioning. All other laboratories are in poor condition, having been built in the 1940s and
equipped in the 1960s. There are 22 labs in total, including 3 regional labs that a recent OIE assessment
scored as 0 out of 4.
Veterinary inspection systems are more or less in place. In two international assessments, Tajikistan
received the highest score in Central Asia, scoring 4 out of 5. Likewise the legal framework for

                                                   79
veterinary services is complete and received an international gold medal for regulation development
in 2012.
A Risk Assessment Department has just been established as required by the OIE. Capacity building
is required for staff, and key personnel should be sent abroad for training.
Veterinarians receive very low salaries. The FAO-EU project has trained nearly all veterinarians and
assisted in the construction of private veterinary clinics. This project has improved the conditions for
private veterinary services. Government veterinarians focus on supervision and disease prevention, as
per OIE guidelines.
Feed Risks
Winter feed is lacking in all areas of the country. Only 50–60 percent of all nutritional needs are being
met, indicating a 50 percent shortfall in feed supplies. The decrease in fodder crop production since
the transition is a major factor in the shortage of winter feed. Limited irrigated areas are available for
fodder production, as land has been transferred into crops that are more profitable.
Lack of access to remote pastures puts additional pressure on pastures around settlements. Fractured
land ownership disrupts large swaths of herding routes between summer and winter pastures. In
addition, widespread plowing of pastures reduces the amount of accessible pasture even more. Pasture
degradation is common, and vegetation comprises a large proportion of unpalatable weeds, especially
close to settlements. This process is partly due to increasing livestock numbers, exacerbated by the
breakdown of migratory systems. The majority of animals are owned by unregistered household farms,
which have no formal access to pasture.
The Pasture Law was passed in 2013, covering all aspects of community-based pasture management,
including rotational grazing, associations, and empowerment. However, amendments are needed to
make implementation effective at the grassroots. The Land Code needs to be harmonized with the
Pasture Law to remove conflicting approaches to land allocation. The agency responsible for pastures
has not yet been established, leaving responsibility for pasture management organizationally orphaned.
Financial Risks
Agricultural finance is scarce, making up only 1.5–2.5 percent of the commercial banks’ lending
portfolio. Remittances are an important source of agricultural funding, but the Russian ruble crisis has
reduced this source, leading to a decrease in the use of fertilizers and inputs.
Many banks do not have branches in rural areas and do not have an agricultural credit line because
they perceive agriculture to be a risky, unprofitable enterprise. Credit agents do not have enough
knowledge of agriculture or the information needed to make informed lending decisions.
AgroInvestBank is the largest agricultural lender in the country, and the Islamic Bank lends to
agriculture. Large enterprises use private finance, when needed.
Between 130 and 140 microfinance agencies are operating in Tajikistan. The Association of
Microfinance Institutions in Tajikistan has terms for lending of 18 months at 26 percent interest, but
when all fees and commissions are considered, the effective interest rate can be as high as 50 percent.
Some projects provide subsidized credit lines. TAFF provides loans at 8–12 percent interest for
                                                  80
women, green technologies, and agribusinesses seeking to retool their operations. Loans are in the
range of US$10,000.
Human Resource Risks
Gaps in knowledge are evident throughout the agriculture sector, including among researchers and
enterprise managers, technicians, advisers, and farmers. Land redistribution created many new farmers
with little knowledge of agriculture, especially of new technologies and crops. Pasture users know little
about environmental management. Further, there are few pasture specialists in the country to support
programs for pasture management. Veterinary training is mostly theoretical, and few young
veterinarians opt to stay in the field after their training is complete.
Diversification Risks
While diversification is a core risk management tool, undertaking diversification introduces its own
set of risks. In Tajikistan, many of the potential alternative crops have no established markets. Farmers
and specialists do not know how to grow alternative crops optimally, and there are limited sources of
seed and other inputs required to produce them. Several stakeholders noted that small holders do not
have the desire to increase productivity, primarily because there is no market for livestock products.
Aggregating land and hay-making areas could help farmers to mechanize their production and to use
inputs. The mechanisms for collaboration are limited (the Cooperative Law is weak and PUAs do not
have clear responsibilities), and producers are hesitant to work collaboratively. Some collaboration is
emerging, with producers aggregating up to 50 hectares of land.
Information on productivity levels is scarce, especially for households and small farms that fall outside
the regular reach of government statistical programs. Establishing a process for measuring
productivity across the functional groups of producers and regions of the country would support
improved farm management, policy development, and agricultural lending.
Smallholders, Poverty, and Organizational Risk
Most livestock products (60 percent) are produced by households. The mountain areas dependent on
livestock production are very poor, and many are still based on a barter economy. Wealth is measured
by the number of livestock owned, which inhibits farmers from switching to holding fewer, more
productive animals.
Most agriculture is done by women because young men have left the country to find employment.
Women have difficulty obtaining land use title and are not empowered to do business. This issue
needs to be addressed in policy, program design, organizational capacity building, and lending
programs.
Before the Russian ruble crisis, more than 1 million Tajiks were working abroad and sending
remittances home. Since the crisis, 400,000 to 600,000 of these workers have returned to Tajikistan.
The flow of funds into the country has stopped, constraining agricultural credit and creating the need
to provide local employment and livelihoods for returning workers.

Organizational structures that could improve the access of small holders to the market and to power
are poorly developed. Water user groups have been piloted, but they have not been sustained after
project completion. The Cooperative Law is in place, but it is not well used because of lingering post-
Soviet distrust of collective actions and tax issues related to cooperatives. PUAs are permitted by the
Pasture Law, but the regulatory framework to give them authority is not yet in place.
Policy and Program Risks
Stakeholders cited numerous policy and program risks, including the following:
      Agriculture is chronically underfunded, making it impossible for the MOA to carry out its
       mandate. This includes a shortage of funds for national programs and a lack of budget for
       district agriculture agencies to deliver frontline services.
      The business environment is very difficult. As a result, the World Bank’s Doing Business
       rankings place Tajikistan near the bottom of all countries. The Tax Code was reformed in June
       2013, and the various types of taxes were reduced from 34 to 17, but all of the old taxes were
       retained within the 17 remaining categories. Certification is difficult and costly, requiring as
       many as 9 certificates. Unofficial fees (bribes) commonly cost US$50 per truck crossing the
       border.
      Corruption and lack of transparency are common, especially in the certification process and
       at border crossings.
      Standards are not enforced. Antibiotic and pesticide testing equipment is in place, but
       standards are ignored. Dangerous products, such as DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane),
       are imported from Uzbekistan and China.
      Government and donors both lack long-term commitment to change. Many donors are
       working on value-chain development, but consistent and coordinated priorities are needed if
       donors are to influence government to adopt successful models. The 2008 Joint Country
       Partner Strategy for donor coordination was effective, but has been implemented
       inconsistently.


The Risk Management Framework
Pasture Management Systems and Oversight
Under the Land Code of Tajikistan, pastures may be privatized for long-term or inheritable use, which
has led private farms to annex pastures, further constraining access. The Pasture Law of 2013 allows
for community-based management by pasture user groups, but individual use remains allowable under
other sections of the law. This impedes the ability of livestock owners without a registered farm to
access pasture and makes access dependent on the interpretation and application of the law by local
authorities.
Numerous weaknesses in the Pasture Law and its implementation need to be addressed. First, the
Pasture Law and the Land Code need to be harmonized to clarify access rights. Second, regulations
and mechanisms for implementing the Pasture Law need to be developed. This effort should include
the registration of user groups and the development of pasture management plans. A mechanism is
needed to allow for the use of trans-boundary pastures. Currently, the responsibility for pastures is

                                                  82
fractured over several institutions. Linkages need to be developed between the local authorities and
pasture users. Pasture user groups need to be established, and pasture maps need to be updated.
The Pasture Law allows user fees to be deposited into a pasture fund for infrastructure, but the fee
goes into general revenues and cannot be earmarked for pasture improvement. To date, 70 percent of
pasture area is not covered by PUAs. The World Bank and IFAD are implementing a large project to
establish pasture associations in nearly every village, as per the law. All livestock owners (households
and farms) are included. The associations exist mostly on paper because their rights and obligations
have not been clearly established. They require the clear right to limit the number of animals, rotate
pastures, issue fees and fines, and undertake other paster management actions. There should be a
separate committee for pastures, similar to what forestry has under the Forest Code. The Forest Code
places the committee directly subordinate to the central government, which is responsible for
supervision.
The Pasture Law says that a responsible authority for pastures should be established, but this has not
been done yet. Once the committee has been established, it can be given the power for better
management. Without an appropriate responsible agency, there is no mechanism with which to
implement the law.
Taxes for pastures should be differentiated. Government help is needed to analyze pasture conditions
and set proper fee structures.
Pasture Monitoring and Remote Sensing
A methodology has been adopted for pasture monitoring (express method), but it is not being
implemented in an orderly manner. The government body responsible for pasture management needs
to be established, and a monitoring and regulation program needs to be created. The IFAD project
does monitoring, but only beginning in late 2014, when it began to measure plots.
Based on a workshop on thematic mapping in Baljuvon, GeoIDee prepared land use and pasture
management maps for more than 30 watersheds for the Natural Resource Management Project of
Deutsche Welthungerhilfe e.V. in southern Tajikistan. The pasture management maps support the use
and rotational grazing of pasture during spring, summer, and autumn.
Farm Management
The IFC has two tools for assessing agricultural risk. The tools are Internet based. CLARA (Cashflow
Linked Agricultural Risk Assessment) was developed through an IFC project in Ukraine and has been
adapted to Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. It uses information based on agronomy,
livestock, engineering, and finance to develop scenarios for farm production and risk and to cross-
check certain operational elements, such as the match between tractor horsepower and
implementation sizes. Any individual farm can be compared to benchmarks. The system requires that
the local database for the benchmarks be populated. The system is for sale to banks to support their
agricultural credit programs.

Animal Health Programs and Veterinary Service
Tajikistan has been a member of the OIE since 2001. Accordingly, the professional veterinary
association was established in 2003, with the assistance of the FAO. There are 901 members and 42
local veterinarian associations across the country. Capacity-building activities under an EU-FAO
program began in 2008 (www.tvg.tj). One of the roles of the association is to provide continuing
education and training to its members. Three training centers have been established as well as 50
centers for veterinary service and consulting, which provide services directly to farmers. To date, the
centers have provided training to 3,591 veterinarians, farmers, and others. Training responds to the
needs of projects and communities, covering topics such as feeding and fodder production. Land has
been allocated for 777 veterinary stations, of which 535 are under construction and 160 are
operational. A mobile veterinary service has 33 vehicles, and 380 refrigerators have been provided to
create a cold chain for vaccines and other animal health products. In addition to the clinics, there are
148 veterinary drug stores, 138 animal feed stations, and 107 artificial insemination stations.
Artificial insemination services are important, but services are limited in Tajikistan (see box 6). There
is limited space for bulls in small household farms, and small farms may have room for just one or
two cows and no bull. However, artificial insemination services suffer from a series of problems. Small
household farms cannot afford the services, and veterinarians are not trained to conduct pregnancy
checks or heat detection. Dystocia is frequent due to lack of proper equipment. There is a shortage of
nitrogen and functioning generators. The Institute of Physics has an unreliable unit. The aluminum
plant has a generator, but access to it is restricted.
 Box 6 Private Veterinary Clinic and Artificial Insemination Service in Tajikistan
 A veterinarian based near Dushanbe operates a clinic providing both clinical and artificial
 insemination services. He extends credit to farmers, allowing them to pay for the service after the
 calf is born and milk production begins. He charges TJS 80–100 with an 80–100-day warranty. If
 the cow does not become pregnant, he redoes the insemination for free. A pregnancy check 60 days
 after the second insemination is also free. If the cow is still not pregnant, he provides treatment for
 the cow. In all cases, the farmer pays for the veterinarian’s transportation.




Veterinarians need training in the use of straw artificial insemination, heat detection, and pregnancy
testing. The Breeding and Artificial Insemination Center in Redicke district has a pilot program that
might have an artificial insemination plant in a couple years.
Government is constrained in its ability to carry out animal health programs. There is insufficient
budget to carry out a complete vaccination program. What is done is incomplete and poorly targeted.
The FAO project would like to draw up a business model for vaccination programs.
There is considerable animal movement between Afghanistan and Tajikistan and between Tajikistan
and the Kyrgyz Republic. Regional animal health cooperation exists between the three countries,
which inform each other of disease outbreaks. A formal agreement drafted with Afghanistan and the
                                                   84
Kyrgyz Republic is ready to be signed at the presidential level. The agreement formalizes vaccination
work that Tajik veterinarians are doing in Afghanistan, establishes communication protocols for
reporting disease, and addresses customs procedures and trans-boundary diseases. Each country will
use its own budget to implement the program.
Laboratory Testing: Inspection, Animal Health, and Feed Stuffs
Laboratory capacity is inadequate. The central laboratory was assisted under an FAO–EU program
and is functioning. All other laboratories are in poor condition, having been built in the 1940s and
equipped in the 1960s. There are 22 labs in total, including 3 regional labs. In a recent OIE assessment,
they received a score of 0 out of 4.
Innovation Systems
There is a lack of both knowledge and a comprehensive system to bring knowledge to farmers. The
gap is particularly large in relation to high-value products and poses a large risk to diversification and
value added. This gap has not been addressed.
The EU Enhancing Agribusiness Project is creating business linkages between processors and farmers
via agronomists in the region. The project works with farmers to achieve better crop management,
paying agronomists a small fee for working with established farms and a small commission for
recruiting new farmers. Generally, few agronomists are available in the country, and knowledge about
the new technologies being introduced is limited. Given the small pool of human resources, it is
difficult to find advisers both to train farmers and to provide technical support to processing plants.
SAROB is a cooperative of 160 agricultural advisers who provide fee-based services to the crop sector.
Established in 2011 with GIZ support, SAROB works with many international and domestic NGOs
to provide extension services to farmers either via projects or directly. The objective is to increase the
profitability of both farmers and advisers. The advisers provide ongoing services, follow up with
producers, and provide links to input and output markets. They also facilitate access to equipment. At
this point, advisers have 4,000 farmer clients.
The government extension system places agents down to the district (jamod) level. There are 500
extension officers, but little budget to support programs or professional development. The extension
staff is under the authority of the local government, not the MOA, and there is a disconnect in the
flow of technical information between the MOA and local government.
Insurance
Tajikistan has a small but growing insurance industry. Penetration was 0.34 percent in 2012. The
market includes 2 government and 14 private insurance companies. Mandatory insurance products
represent 75 percent of the market. However, the government diverts 70 percent of state insurance
company profits into the general budget, which means that these organizations have limited success
in building their reserves.
Agricultural insurance is provided by TAJIKSUGURTA, a state-owned company. Although the
insurance is mandatory, there is little uptake by producers. Private insurance companies are not
interested because of the high degree of regulation and the weak statistical foundation for risk analysis.
                                                   85
The government is attempting to develop a public-private partnership for weather-index crop
insurance.
Livestock insurance is not available at this time. There are several prerequisites to the expansion of
crop or livestock insurance: a larger risk pool, including access to reinsurance, regulatory freedom for
private insurers to set premiums and other conditions, a more robust statistical base, stronger
institutional capacity for risk assessment, and a demonstrated commitment from government to meet
its financial obligations in a public-private partnership.
Irrigation
The majority of arable land was irrigated under the Soviet system. Since the transition, these systems
have been costly to operate and maintain, and many have fallen out of use. Most irrigation is flood
irrigation, with very limited mechanical irrigation. In hilly areas, where irrigation used to rely on
inefficient pumps, the systems have fallen out of use. Canals are not cleaned or maintained as required
due to a shortage of funding at the district level. Anecdotal information indicates that up to 40 percent
of irrigation water might be lost through leakages. Water user groups have been piloted, but they have
not been sustained after projects ended. An assessment of economic viability should underpin reform
of the system.
Emergency Response and Disaster Relief
An emergency committee, with representatives from a cross-section of agencies, is consistent with the
United Nations approach to emergency management. Representatives include the central government
and the ministries of agriculture, finance, economic development, and transport as well as regional
and district governments and local departments of all ministries as well as the Material Resources
Agency.
The committee responds to natural disasters, including floods. However, financing for emergency
response is limited, and the MOA has no funds allocated for emergency response. In an emergency,
the committee first issues a statement of the losses and then seeks funds within the national
government for infrastructure or housing assistance. Finally, the international community is asked for
humanitarian aid. The response and timing are prioritized by level of damage associated with the
disaster.
Potential Interventions
The recommendations offered here are based on a holistic, layered approach to addressing agricultural
risk in Tajikistan. They take an in-depth look at the nuanced sources of risk within the broad areas of
feed production, animal health, and finance. Successful programs and pilot projects that could be
scaled up and the relevant institutions for action are identified. Where possible, good regional and
global examples are provided.
Figure 43 illustrates the concept of risk layering. The first layer includes high-frequency, low-loss risks.
These events are addressed through mitigation, usually by the producer. The second layer includes
low-frequency, medium-loss events. These are dealt with through risk mitigation and risk transfer.
Risk transfer can include, among other things, insurance programs, risk sharing through contracting,
                                                    86
and risk pooling through collaborative producer actions. These second-layer responses are generally
managed through markets, but they also may entail government involvement either directly or through
public-private partnerships. The third layer deals with very low-frequency, very high-loss disasters.
Here risk mitigation and risk transfer are accompanied by risk-coping (disaster recovery) responses.

Livestock Feed and Drought Cycle Management
The appropriate response to a localized, recurring drought should be community preparedness and
response carried out within the parameters of an effective national framework of fully funded policies,
agencies, and programs for protection, preparedness, early warning, response, and recovery.
Specifically, these approaches are defined as follows:
      Drought cycle management. Drought is an expected, normal event. Specific indicators can be used
       to trigger preparation or response interventions either alone or in combination, depending on
       the nature of the drought conditions. Early, timely response is important and preferable in
       terms of cost-benefit analysis. For example, destocking allows households to decrease the
       grazing or feeding pressure, while freeing up cash to procure additional feed and medicines or
       to fund household food purchases.
      Community preparedness. Communities should be capable of planning and preparing for both
       slow- and rapid-onset emergencies. This planning can include the provision of shelter,
       feedstock, water points, livestock vaccination, market development, pasture distribution, and
       organization of livestock movement to emergency pastures within the local area or in other
       jurisdictions through reciprocity arrangements.
Community-Based Pasture Management and Monitoring
The community-based pasture management envisioned in the Pasture Law should be implemented.
The work that GIZ and IFAD have been doing on pasture management capacity building should be
scaled up and any remaining gaps filled. Based on the first conference of pasture practitioners
sponsored by GIZ, the program would have three components.
The first component is policy, which entails technical support for completing a legal and regulatory
framework, including amending the Pasture Law to enshrine the legal rights and responsibilities of
pasture user associations and authorize the issuance and collection of fees. Harmonization of the
Pasture Law and the Land Code, among others, is needed to provide a unified approach to the
allocation of pasture and imposition of fees by head of livestock. Subsequently, the supporting by-
laws need to be developed. Given the privatization of pastures already under way, solutions to make
pasture accessible to user groups need to be found. This could require annulling long-term use
agreements, as was done in the Kyrgyz Republic. Alternatively, mechanisms to sublease private pasture
by user groups could be explored. International agreements to create a mechanism for the use of trans-
boundary pastures will be needed.
The second component is institutional strengthening. A governing body for pastures, the Department
of Pastures, should be established (box 7). Standard mechanisms for the establishment and transfer
of rights to pasture user groups should be developed. Provisions are needed to accommodate the use
of pastures by multiple user groups and the overlapping of pasture and forestry areas. A standard
definition and approach to developing and approving pasture management plans are needed. National-
level actions are needed to identify and allocate pasture areas and to update maps to show remote
pastures allocated to communities and districts for migration.

 Box 7 ARIS in the Kyrgyz Republic
 Financed in part by the World Bank, the Community Development and Investment Agency in the
 Kyrgyz Republic (ARIS) focuses on community-based initiatives and has a mandate to alleviate
 poverty. ARIS supported pastoral reform with village mobilization, capacity building, and
 implementation of micro projects. ARIS has facilitated formation of Pasture Committees, provided
 training for Pasture Committees, and administered community pasture-management investment
 grants.

Pasture user associations need to be established at the community level. These groups may need
funding to assist their start-up as well as a funding mechanism with uniform procedures for
establishment and registration. Initial support will also be needed to help PUAs to develop their first
pasture management plans. Local institutions to oversee the PUAs and endorse pasture management
plans need to be created. These could follow the model of the Kyrgyz pasture committees.
Leadership is critical to the success of PUAs and local community-based management approaches.
Capacity building for PUAs and others in the system should be provided, including training in
governance and transparency, financial management, fund raising, and communications, among other
topics.
The third component is environmental management. Training in sustainable pasture management is
needed for pasture users and local government representatives at the district level. Key pasture
specialists should receive training abroad, while local programs in pasture management should be
developed to support in-country capacity to train specialists. Legislative, administrative, and economic
barriers to migration need to be identified and resolved. Mechanisms, including reciprocal agreements,
to access pastures across district and other borders may need to be established and should be done in
a way that keeps administrative expenses and other transaction costs low. For PUA members,
economic barriers to pasture access should be lowered.
Management of total pasture resources should be improved by making use of remote pastures. To
support infrastructure development and pasture rehabilitation, a fund for pasture development using
funds generated by pasture user fees should be established with each PUA. These local funds could
be linked to a national pasture fund for matching grants. The national pasture fund could be financed
through the national budget, international contributions, or taxes and fees imposed on other users of
pasture areas, including tourism and mining.
Supplementary feed production should also be encouraged. The funds held by the PUA should be
usable for investments in supplementary forage production. Investment could include machinery,
fencing, seed and fertilizer, and postharvest storage facilities. Payment for environmental services
(PES) approaches, which compensate producers and landowners for adoption of land management
                                                  93
practices that provide ecosystem services, could be used to incentivize investments in pasture
reseeding, the conversion of marginal cropland to pasture, and the establishment of perennial hay
fields (box 8).


 Box 8 Payment for Environmental Services
 Payment for environmental services (PES) is a conditional payment system (ADB 2014). It could
 include payments for specified practices, payments for specific ecosystem services, input subsidies,
 off-take subsidies, one-off grant payments, and recurring payments for ecosystem services. “Co-
 investment in land stewardship” is a type of PES that pays communities for adopting best practices
 (for example, pasture rest and rotation) that will contribute to the desired environmental outcome
 (for example, improved biodiversity and biomass). In a situation like Tajikistan’s, where many
 subsistence producers are motivated by risk management and avoidance more than short-term
 profit maximization and where land tenure is based on collective action, this approach can be
 effective in promoting resource management.


Pasture rehabilitation is one method of improving feed supplies and should be part of a national
program to preserve pasture area and potential. Marginal lands where pasture has been plowed for
crop production should be returned to forage production. The World Bank Drylands Management
Project in Kazakhstan successfully reestablished pastures using wheat grass on 35,000 hectares. A
program could be developed to allow pasture committees and individual farmers to apply for
government matching grants or loans for the purpose of pasture rehabilitation or reestablishment.
PES approaches could be considered for financing the program. To support this program, technical
assistance and training would be needed for farmers and herders. Equipment and seed would need to
be made available. Equipment could be on a lease or rental basis. Research into varieties and
establishment methods should be carried out. Box 9 summarizes the potential PES approaches for
Tajikistan.
 Box 9 Potential PES Approaches for Tajikistan
 With regard to sources of financing,
       Government of Tajikistan. As possible, increased program spending in relation to what
        other countries spend, from the general budget and other sources
       International donors and programs. Grant money for program design, capacity
        development, training, and implementation and evaluation of pilot projects; World Bank
        BioCarbon Fund and methodologies for sustainable agricultural land management
       Tourism and other sectors. User fees, taxes, or environmental fees designated for PES and
        used directly for PES purchases and for research support and capacity building in land
        rehabilitation and the development of regional seed banks; voluntary contributions
        identified as part of environmental management and rehabilitation plans (which might be
        encouraged through potential tax offsets)

                                                 94
           International carbon market. Quantification of carbon sequestered using the Verified
            Carbon Standard, which would allow groups to sell certified emission reductions.
           The aims of the PES approach would be to achieve sustainable pasture management,
            conserve soil and water in crop production, and rehabilitate abandoned cropland.
           Beneficiaries would be herder groups, dairy groups, cooperatives, communities, individual
            farmers (grains, large-scale farmers), groups (vegetable cooperatives and others), local
            governments, and partnerships.
           Payments would be made through direct payments, market transactions, and co-investment.
 The project would undertake the following:
           Identify successful approaches from previous work in Tajikistan. Review the pasture and
            resource management programs to identify what approaches are successful.
           Identify and assess options for PES modalities. Identify under what conditions direct
            payments, market-based payments, or co-investment approaches are most appropriate
           Improve the base of scientific knowledge. Conduct targeted research to identify the links
            between management and environment, possibly incorporating the Ecological Site
            Description approach.
           Link public investment in livestock and grassland management with environmental
            outcomes. Revise policy to support positive environmental outcomes by adding
            conditionality to funding and removing or revising program elements with perverse
            environmental impacts.
           Learn from pilot activities. Review PES pilots.
           Ensure community involvement and benefits. Mainstream community consultation and
            engagement into program design and implementation.

Pasture Monitoring and Regional Livestock Early Warning System
Most livestock emergencies involve drought. Animals weakened by malnutrition during the drought
lack the body condition to survive the harsh conditions without sufficient supplementary feed and
adequate winter shelter. These are considered “slow-onset” emergencies, and good disaster
management systems integrate the information from drought and humanitarian early warning systems
into early decision making. Emergency warning systems for drought, weather (including severe
weather watches), and significant loss in agricultural income and/or food production, can be useful
for determining the extent of an emergency and supporting sound decision making around the
response to an emergency (box 10). Drought forecasting systems that integrate information about the
quantity and quality of forage can provide livestock producers with information necessary to adapt
their grazing patterns and decisions regarding the production and purchase of fodder. Livestock early
warning systems (LEWS) also give policy makers and agencies time to anticipate the location and
extent of emergencies, the population affected, and potential needs, which supports the preparation
of adequate, coordinated responses.
 Box 10 Innovative Weather Forecasting in the Kyrgyz Republic
 Innovative weather forecasting supported by a World Bank- financed project supported piloting of
 a weather information system for farmers via cellphones. The project built the capacity of Kyrgyz
 Hydromet to use a sophisticated local area model in providing localized (the distance between grid
 points is 5km) 3-day weather forecasts on rolling basis which then are transmitted via cellphones to
 farmers. The project also trained farmers in crop and livestock protection measures against adverse
 weather events.


Texas AgriLife Research developed the first LEWS in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and
Ethiopia). Through the Global Livestock Collaborative Research Program, Texas AgriLife Research
collaborated with Mercy Corps in 2004 to develop a LEWS for the Gobi Region of Mongolia (box
11). Given the success of the projects in East Africa and Mongolia, the U.S. Agency for International
Development has supported the development of a LEWS for Afghanistan.
 Box 11 LEWS in Mongolia
 Mongolia has established a LEWS with the assistance of the World Bank, Mercy Corp, and Texas
 A&M University. The LEWS integrates satellite monitoring and physical sampling to provide forage
 and carrying-capacity reports and forecasts. This system will provide nationwide data and is
 institutionalized in the National Agency of Meteorology, Hydrology, and Environmental
 Monitoring, which conducts regular forage sampling that the LEWS has used to verify its
 forecasting system to a high degree of reliability. The cost of developing the system and training
 regional users was approximately US$900,000.


                                                 96
A pasture monitoring program should be formalized domestically and linked into a regional LEWS
system. The program would include components on policy and regulatory development, institutional
strengthening, and development of a regional LEWS.
The first component of a LEWS is to develop policy and regulations. A government body responsible
for pasture management—the Pasture Department—needs to be established. Regulations and
guidelines for pasture monitoring need to be developed that clarify the responsibilities for pasture
monitoring at the national, district, and local levels. Any supporting legislation for participation in a
regional LEWS program needs to be developed, and operational agreements with international and
national bodies involved in pasture monitoring and the LEWS need to be completed.
The second component is to strengthen the institutions for pasture monitoring. Local monitoring
systems for the purpose of developing pasture management plans need to be established to support
sustainable rangeland management. This work is currently being piloted in Tajikistan by various
projects. This information needs to be shared with the national level to establish a database of forage
information. Methodologies and sampling protocols need to be developed, and personnel at the
national, district, and local levels need to be trained. A national database and reporting system needs
to be developed to maintain the data and provide analytical reports to various users of the system
from the national to the community level.
Participatory monitoring systems can help to build local knowledge of pasture conditions, but the
processes need to simple and cost-effective. The GreenGold Project in Mongolia and others have
used combinations of clipping programs and photographic sampling. Participatory monitoring
programs would have to be integrated into the national monitoring system. Herders would need to be
trained in the objectives and methods of the system.
The third component is to establish a regional LEWS. A regional LEWS could be established to
monitor pasture condition in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. The system would
combine near real-time weather, computer modeling, and satellite imagery to monitor and forecast
livestock forage conditions, providing the information needed for timely decision making in advance
of drought. Developing the system would include forage monitoring technology to assess the regional
quantity of forage, nutritional profiling technology to assess forage quality, and information delivery
and outreach.
Table 11 presents the estimated costs of the proposed interventions for pasture monitoring and
creation of a regional LEWS.

A joint Kazakh-U.S. International Science and Technology Center project (2006–11) tested and
demonstrated pasture-monitoring technologies using remote sensing and ground information based
on the rangeland growth model “PASTURE.” This system could possibly be scaled up to the national
and regional levels. As climate change creates the potential for more frequent and severe droughts, a
regional system for drought warning and early response could provide policy makers and producers
with the time required to take mitigating measures.
Supplementary Feed Production, Conservation, and Storage
Supplementary feed in the form of forage crops and feed grains is important to sustaining livestock
through winter and providing the reserve feeds necessary to keep livestock off early spring pastures,
when grass needs to attain a minimum level of growth prior to grazing. The three main approaches to
providing supplemental feed are to (1) grow perennial hay crops (either native or seeded grasses and
legumes) and use either cut and baled or left as standing hay crops, (2) grow annual fodder crops (oats,
barley) and harvest and bale them before maturity to use as “greenfeed” or preserve as silage, and (3)
grow feed grains (oats, barley) to maturity and use as high-energy feeds. Additional sources of feeds
include crop by-products (distillers mash, canola, and soybean meal).
In Tajikistan, the livestock production system can be divided very broadly into (1) dryland regions that
rely entirely on pasture resources for livestock feed and have limited scope for producing
supplementary feed and (2) locations where livestock is raised adjacent to irrigated crop farming. Near
settlements where dairy production has a market and requires daily delivery of milk to market,
households are less likely to send lactating cows to distant pastures, regardless of accessibility,
increasing the need to provide year-round, high-quality feed.
In pastoral areas, promoting forage production by livestock producers requires a number of
supporting activities. Hay-making areas need to be allocated and, in most cases, fenced to ensure that
livestock do not consume the crop before it is harvested. Fencing is a major long-term investment
that requires materials and finance. Improving the stand of forage requires top seeding or reseeding
and fertilization. Seeds must be purchased, and suitable equipment for seeding must be purchased or

                                                  98
rented. In many semi-arid locations, forage establishment is not possible without supplementary
irrigation.
In cropping regions, the introduction of more sustainable crop rotations into the grain sector can
significantly increase the supply of supplementary feedstuffs, provided there is suitable market
incentive for crop producers to do so. In Tajikistan, this could be the dairy market. Crop rotations can
include feed grains (oats, barley) and legumes (alfalfa, field peas), which provide the added benefit of
nitrogen fixing. Introducing alfalfa or other nitrogen-fixing legumes in a four-year rotation can
improve soil fertility and disrupt weed and disease cycles, lowering input costs. Additional benefits
include control of soil erosion and improved wildlife habitat.
Switching from a primary cash crop to livestock fodder production may not provide sufficient
economic return to the farm business. Intercropping spring and winter cereals (spring wheat with
winter wheat or fall rye) can successfully extend the grazing season into the late fall without removing
the main economic crop. Another form of intercropping involves seeding annual crops such as barley
into living mulch, an established legume cover crop.
In Tajikistan, orchard grazing could provide considerable areas of pasture that could be grazed directly
by small livestock. Water must be provided for the livestock, protection is needed to prevent livestock
from browsing or rubbing trees, and movable fencing is needed to establish rotational pasture areas
in the orchard. Alternatively, the forage crop could be harvested mechanically and then used in dairy
feeding. This would require small-scale power and haying equipment and ongoing operating inputs
(diesel, oil) to cut and bale hay.
In irrigated areas, introducing an alfalfa crop in rotation could provide a large proportion of the feed
required by a typical household farm. For example, a five-hectare farm with two dairy cows could put
1 hectare of land into alfalfa in a four- or five-year rotation. Estimating the consumption of a 550-
kilogram cow at 2 percent of body weight per day, a 365-day feeding period would require 4 metric
tons per cow. Irrigated alfalfa production yielding 8 metric tons per hectare could support two dairy
cows for an entire year. In addition, the average acre of alfalfa will fix about 500 kilograms of nitrogen
per year, thus reducing the need to apply expensive nitrogen fertilizers.
The conservation and storage of feed need to be improved. Hay cut late and stored loose or in loose
bales is prone to high losses from breakage, sun, and water. As a result, little can be stored into
subsequent years. Proper conservation and storage can allow hay to be stored with good nutritional
quality for multiple years. This is important for the ability to hold reserve supplies for use during
droughts and their aftermath. Methods of conservation range from the simple to the complex and can
include dense baling (large or small), round bales, bagging, and silaging. Improved storage ranges from
simple tarping to roofs or buildings. Silaging can be done in pits or silos, but pits are economical and
easy to construct. All of these approaches require some level of investment supported by information
and training for producers. Research into feed efficiency and economic returns should underpin the
introduction of any improved conservation and storage system.

Technical and funding approaches to support supplementary forage production could include the
following:
        Ensuring better access to smallholders, possibly through loans and grants to pasture
         committees or their legal cooperatives
        Integrating PES to incentivize producers to establish perennial forage stands and improve
         pasture productivity and, in the crop sector, introducing long rotations involving perennial
         forages
        Supporting the program with applied research and development that would involve variety
         trials, demonstrations, and research into intercropping and rotations that are technically
         feasible and economically viable.
        Providing practical, hands-on training to livestock and crop producers on how to manage
         forage production and livestock feeds.
        Retaining the funds obtained from pasture use fees and supplementing them with matching
         grants and loans
        Establishing feed financing programs to assist herders and PUAs to purchase feed supplies as
         part of winter preparedness.
A livestock feed sector development project should be implemented to address feed policy; feed
production emphasizing drought-resistant varieties (trials and demonstrations on pasture, forage, and
feed grain production); feed manufacturing (feed mills and ration formulation); feed testing (feed
laboratory); and feed use (research and on-farm livestock nutrition and feeding programs). Table 12
summarizes the costs of the proposed feed sector development project.

Irrigation and Water Management
Irrigation is a priority under the Agrarian Reform Program. Supporting economically viable and
environmentally sustainable irrigation systems should be a central part of improving productivity and
adapting to climate change. The program should address the following:
      Assess water resources and management based on hydrological boundaries
      Review and reform institutional arrangements for water management, including ministerial
       responsibility, institutional arrangements, and mechanisms for operations management
      Develop effective and sustainable water user groups
      Review and reform water tariffs and cost recovery
      Review and rationalize irrigation infrastructure to determine what elements of the system can
       be operated in an economically viable and sustainable manner
      Identify new water- and energy-efficient technologies for pumping and distributing water
      Implement agricultural adaptation programs in areas that will no longer be served by irrigation.
Animal Health
A national animal health and food safety program should be implemented in Tajikistan to address
various issues contributing to higher risks to human and animal health, food safety, product quality,
and market access. The core components of the program would be to strengthen the following:
      Infectious disease control. This would include strengthening the vaccination program, including
       vaccine procurement systems, vaccines quality control, cold chain and handling of vaccines,
       creation of incentives for farmers to carry out vaccine programs (access to credit and other
       support services), and training for farmers.
      Surveillance systems. This would include strengthening laboratories for food safety and disease
       detection (infections and production) by providing upgraded facilities and equipment,
       upgraded processes and protocols, and training for management and staff.
      Animal identification and trace back systems. National rollout of the animal identification program
       based on a scale-up of the FAO pilot project would include building capacity for handling
       information and responding to disease (identification, trace back, containment, treatment,
       destruction).
      On-farm herd health and food safety programs. Animal health and food safety starts at the frontline
       of disease and health management, the farm. This component would address, among other
       things, farm bio-security, hygiene, product handling (new milking and handling equipment),
       storage (milk tanks, coolers), proper drug withdrawal protocols, diagnosis and treatment of
       production diseases (especially of parasites and mastitis), guidelines for designing new farms,
       and standards. Animal health circles could be established, where a group of farmers, possibly
       PUAs, would together hire the services of a veterinarian to help them to set up herd health
       programs to improve productivity and profitability.
      Food safety in processing. This would include plant design and equipment selection, quality control
       and assurance systems (HACCP, ISO, good manufacturing practices), and food testing
       capacity (somatic cell counts, antibiotics, hormones).
      Capacity development. This would include improving practical animal health and food safety
       knowledge and skills by veterinarians, para-veterinarians, extension personnel, and farmers
       and building the capacity of the national veterinary service for implementing, monitoring, and
                                                  101
         evaluating programs (see box 12 for an example from China). Assistance would be given to
         the MOA to develop implementation manuals on (1) HACCP standards, (2) good agricultural
         practices, and (3) good manufacturing practices.


  Box 12 China-Canada Livestock Health Extension Services Project

  The China-Canada Livestock Health Extension Services Project (LHESP) supported capacity
  building in animal health policy, epidemiology, laboratory training, veterinary associations, on-farm
  bio-security, and herd health and the development of livestock health extension services. Work
  was carried out in seven provinces and at the national level. More than 13,000 people received
  training. The total budget was US$19 million over five years, with matching contributions from
  the government of China.


The approximate costs of the program could be US$47 million over five years (table 13).

Regional Control of Trans-boundary Disease
A regional animal health program could be implemented to control zoonotic and trans-boundary
diseases with the potential to affect trade and threaten public health and the livelihood of livestock
farmers. FMD should be the first disease targeted. Additional target diseases would include PPR,
brucellosis, tuberculosis, and other diseases identified by the national veterinary services and the OIE.
The project would include Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic, where tradition trans-
border grazing patterns contribute directly to the risk of trans-boundary disease outbreaks and for
which a tripartite agreement has already been prepared. The components of the project would include
(1) policy and regulatory development of protocols and guidelines governing livestock movement,

                                                  102
disease prevention and control, and communication; (2) strengthening of border-crossing facilities
(inspection, testing) and procedures; (3) strengthening of disease response programs, including zoning,
quarantine, livestock eradication, and compensation. Table 14 summarizes the estimated costs of the
proposed intervention.

Livestock Insurance
Tajikistan could consider introducing index-based livestock insurance, which has been introduced in
Mongolia with the assistance of the World Bank, or pasture insurance. Index-based insurance operates
using aggregate livestock mortality rates by species and geographic area (county) rather than by
individual household. The approach combines the three layers of risk response: self-insurance, market-
based insurance, and social safety net. If losses are low and do not threaten the viability of their
business, herders cover the cost through themselves. If losses are larger, the private insurance industry
pays. In the case of catastrophic loss, the government bears the cost. Insurance is provided through
partnerships with private insurance companies.
Any consideration of agricultural insurance should be done on the basis of a solid feasibility analysis,
livestock and/or pasture, insurance. Following the feasibility study, if the results are promising, a pilot
project involving the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, and private insurance companies
could be implemented. Table 15 summarizes the estimated costs of the proposed project.

Credit, Grants, and Tax Reform
Access to credit is necessary for producers to invest in risk mitigation. This includes longer term
investment into assets for feed production, conservation, and storage as well as on-farm infrastructure
for water and other environmental assets (retaining walls, berms).
Seasonal credit is required to plant forage and fodder crops and to purchase feed prior to winter.
Given the relatively thin margins typical in agriculture, the long growing and storage periods, and the
large amount of funds required for inputs or feed, it may be necessary to stretch repayment periods
for borrowers. The reverse argument is that the productivity of crops and livestock must be high
enough to generate a positive return over interest carrying charges.
A broader range of agricultural credit products should be made available on the market to accomplish
the following:
        Allow producers to obtain finance using future crops, or the expected sale of crops or livestock
         as collateral
        Use warehouse receipts to collateralize products in storage
        Allow processors, input providers, and commercial advisory services to act as loan guarantors
         for small holders
        Support good risk analysis and planning by including productivity and profitability assessments
         and collecting those assessments into a database of agricultural performance data to support
         farm management, investment, and lending decision making, such as the IFC’s CLARA
         program.
A package that would provide long-term loans to individual producers and prosducer groups (PUAs,
cooperatives, shareholder organizations) based on proof of participation in animal health (vaccination,
herd health) and insurance (crop, livestock) to safeguard the loan in case of crop failure or livestock
death could be considered.
A PES conditional grant fund could be created that would provide grants to individual producers and
producer groups (PUAs, cooperatives, shareholder organizations) based on proof of participation in
environmental management programs (implementation of pasture management plans, pasture
                                               104
rehabilitation, forage establishment, infrastructure investments, participation in monitoring
programs). The fund could be created through donor contributions, the World Bank Bio-Carbon
Fund, government contributions, and user fees charged on other users of pasture areas (tourism,
mining). Additional market-based funding could be obtained by quantifying the carbon sequestered
using the Verified Carbon Standard and selling certified emissions reductions.

Innovation and Adaptation
Tajikistan’s research and extension system needs to be revitalized to serve the needs of the agriculture
sector as it modernizes to compete in global markets and survive in the shifting environment caused
by climate change. Researchers need to upgrade their research skills and be given the laboratory,
research facilities, and mandate needed to conduct research that is relevant to the needs of industry.
Research into drought-resistant varieties of cereals, feed grains, and forage crops needs to be
undertaken. Research into livestock genetic improvement should be undertaken to develop cross-
breeding programs that improve feed use, growth rates, and carcass yields.
Research into livestock feeds, feeding, and feed efficiency should be given high priority. The feed
sector needs to be supported with research, testing, and extension. A feed testing laboratory fully
capable of testing feed and feed ingredients and screening for contamination and adulteration is
needed (box 13). Building local capacity to develop least-cost feed rations is required. Producer
understanding of livestock nutrition, feed, and feeding is fundamental to providing the motivation to
invest in improved pasture management and production of supplementary feed.




                                                   105
 Box 13 Canada-China Feed Industry Project
 The Canada-China Feed Industry Project established a national feed testing laboratory in Beijing.
 The program worked with feed millers across the country to improve feed milling facilities and
 quality control processes. Least-cost formulation of rations was introduced. The project helped to
 modernize the Chinese livestock feed industry and contributed to the improved use of feed in
 China.


Knowledge platforms should be established to build the capacity of processors and their supply-chain
partners around quality control, food safety, and good agricultural manufacturing practices. Market
information systems should provide price forecasts to assist processors and primary producers to
conduct better planning and risk management (box 14).
Funding and technical support for innovation and climate change adaptation could come from the
following sources:
      Increase public expenditure on agriculture and funds allocated specifically to innovation and
       climate change adaptation at a level at least equivalent to that of other countries in the region.
       For example, the Kyrgyz Republic spends 2.2 percent of its agricultural GDP on research and
       extension.
      Establish an innovation council with representation from research, industry, and science to
       provide leadership and oversight to the research program.
      Agricultural projects should include applied, farmer-focused research and extension in project
       design to facilitate the establishment these programs.

 Box 14 Market Information System to Facilitate Export Growth
 Market information systems (MIS) provide market monitoring indicators and decision-making
 support to agricultural stakeholders. The goal of MIS is to correct for information asymmetry
 between market actors and to improve market efficiency by increasing transparency. Price data
 alone is not sufficient for MIS to be effective; the data must be comprehensive, timely, and
 commercially useful. Agricultural stakeholders, particularly smallholders, should also be empowered
 to use the information to facilitate decision-making and to negotiate with trade partners. Thus,
 successful MIS are typically linked to support services, such as: business opportunities, market
 analyses, climate forecasts, and training. Ideally, MIS are integrated into value chain and enterprise
 development activities.
 The case of the Agricultural Market Information Service (SIMA) in Bolivia is a successful example
 of a MIS designed to support export growth with regional trading partners. Donors provided long-
 term funding for the creation of a private, non-profit organization to operate and maintain SIMA.
 Today, SIMA collects daily price data on over 180 agricultural products in key markets in Bolivia,
 Peru, and Argentina, providing access to annual historical data dating back to 2002. Fundación

 added services to farmers, including improving marketing channels and training on new
 technologies and practices.

Disaster Relief
Instead of responding in an ad hoc manner to disasters, disaster relief programs should clearly define
eligibility for participation. Mechanisms for assessment, compensation, and distribution of funds
should be established. Payments could be designed in two streams, one to compensate for lost income
and one to compensate for the repair or replacement of damaged infrastructure and productive assets.
The reform of support and disaster response programs should be assessed for their efficiency and
impact on beneficiaries. Programs should be developed within the concept of drought cycle
management and community preparedness. The devolution of budget and program management to
the community level should be considered, where possible.

A. 2. Production: Price Derivation for Indicative Loss Analysis
Base Case: Derivation without Loss Threshold
Let total output be Y1 = P1Q1, change in output be Y2 - Y1 = P2Q2 - P1Q1, and decompose this change
into a production impact and a price impact. Consider production impact alone by holding prices
constant at P1. Let production impact be P1(Q2 – Q1). Then price impact is total impact – production
impact:
= (P2Q2 - P1Q1) – [P1(Q2 – Q1)]
        = P2Q2 - P1Q1 – P1Q2 + P1Q1
        = Q2(P2 – P1).
        Hence
        Y2 - Y1= P1(Q2 – Q1) + Q2(P2 – P1).       (1)
Total impact is production impact + price impact.
This construct allows full decomposition of the production and price impact on the total value of
output for each of the following scenarios:
               Both production and price increase
               Production increases and price decreases
               Production decreases and price increases
               Both production and price decrease.
The methodology is only useful for individual commodities. It is technically possible to use it at the
aggregate level if all of the relevant price and production data for the aggregate are available. But this
would be very difficult and time-consuming to do.
        The methodology cannot be used to disaggregate production and price impacts at the
aggregate level by using the results of constant price and real price analysis. At the aggregate level, the
following are the relevant parameters for analysis:
       P1Q1
       P2Q2
       P1Q2.
The first two parameters are available from real price analysis. In principle, the third parameter is
available from the constant price analysis. In fact, the P1 variable available from the constant price
analysis is not the same as the P1 variable from the real price analysis.


Derivation with Loss Threshold
Derivation varies according to whether the threshold applies to production (Q), price (P), or total
output (Y).
                                                   113
Where the loss threshold applies to production alone (Q), threshold = wQ1, where w = loss threshold in
percentage (for example, 0.1). Substitute Q1* for Q1, where Q1* = Q1 – wQ1.
Then indicative loss = Y2 - Y1 = P1(Q2 – Q*1) + Q2(P2 – P1). Price impact is unchanged in this scenario.
Production impact falls by the amount equivalent to the threshold.
Where the loss threshold applies to price alone (P), threshold = wP1, where w = loss threshold in percentage
(for example, 0.1). Substitute P1* for P1 where P1* = P1 – wP1. Then indicative loss = Y2 - Y1 = P*1(Q2
– Q1) + Q2(P2 – P*1). Price threshold affects both production and price impacts.
       Where the loss threshold applies to total output (Y), threshold = wP1Q1, where w = loss threshold in
percentage (for example, 0.1). Let Y1* = Y1 - wP1Q1. Then indicative loss = Y2 – Y1* = Y2 – (Y1 -
wP1Q1) = (Y2 – Y1) + wP1Q1 = P1(Q2 – Q1) + Q2(P2 – P1) + wP1Q1.
Rearranging
= P1Q2 – P1Q1 + wP1Q1 + Q2(P2 – P1)
        = P1(Q2 – Q1 + wQ1) + Q2(P2 – P1)
= P1[Q2 + Q1(w – 1)] + Q2(P2 – P1).
