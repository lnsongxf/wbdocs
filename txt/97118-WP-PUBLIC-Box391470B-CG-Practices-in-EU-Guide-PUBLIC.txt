European Context

The word “Europe” may be used to describe several
different entities. For example, it can refer to the 47
member countries of the Council of Europe (see Appen-
dix E for details of membership). On other occasions it
may be used to refer to the 18 Eurozone countries that
share the euro currency (Appendix A).

More frequently, the word is used as a collective term to
describe the 28 member states of the European Union
(Appendix B). The population of the European Union
is about 490 million people, and the land area is nearly
4.5 million square kilometers. Over time, this member-
ship is likely to grow, with the addition of EU candidate
countries (Appendix C) and potential candidate coun-
tries (Appendix D). Germany has the largest population,
with 80 million people, and Malta has the smallest, with
about 400,000 people.

                                                             include the following:

                                     member states. These binding agreements set out legal principles that all EU

    human rights	                    respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and
                                     human rights. The EU’s institutions are legally bound to uphold these rights, as

    members that do not form part of the Schengen Area, Ireland and the United Kingdom maintain opt-outs, and Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,
    and Romania are legally obliged to join the area and wish to do so. Also, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, and Sweden have signed the Schen-

    Box 1.1: Definitions of Legislation, Soft Law, and Comply or Explain
    Legislation: All of the European jurisdictions have companies acts that regulate the activities of
    companies. These laws typically draw clear “lines” to distinguish legal from illegal activity.

    Soft law: Soft law is typically composed of corporate governance codes that contain “recommendations”
    for good and responsible governance. Typically, companies are required to report to their shareholders on
    a comply-or-explain basis.

    Comply or explain: If a company chooses to depart from a corporate governance code, the company
    must explain in its annual report to shareholders which parts of the code it has departed from and why it
    has done so. A comply-or-explain approach provides companies with flexibility to adapt their corporate
    governance to their specific situation. Technically, “apply or explain” (associated with the King Reports
    in Southern Africa) is a more accurate term than “comply or explain,” but it is rarely used in Europe other
    than in the Netherlands (which is the country that first brought in this expression).

Box 2.1: Royal Ahold
In February 2003, Royal Ahold, a Dutch international retailer, announced a number of accounting
irregularities at its subsidiaries. The CEO, CFO, and a number of senior managers resigned as a result,
and earnings over 2001 and 2002 had to be restated. As a consequence of the announcements, the
company’s share price plunged by two-thirds. Dutch law enforcement authorities filed fraud charges
against Royal Ahold, which were settled in September 2004, when Royal Ahold paid a fine of
approximately €8 million.

Royal Ahold’s former CEO, former CFO, and the former executive in charge of its European activities were
charged with fraud by the Dutch authorities. In May 2006, a Dutch federal court found Royal Ahold’s
former CEO and CFO guilty of false authentication of documents, and they received suspended prison
sentences and unconditional fines.

A new CEO was appointed in May 2003, and Royal Ahold launched a “road to recovery” strategy in late
2003 to restore its financial health, regain credibility, and strengthen its business. The strategy was a
great success, and Royal Ahold restored its financial health through strengthening its accountability,
controls, and corporate governance.

      Box 2.2: Gecina (Spain) and Valeo (France)
      Gecina (Spain): In 2010, shareholders were asked to approve a related-party transaction involving
      Spanish-owned Gecina’s wholly owned subsidiary, Société des Immeubles de France, and its purchase of
      a 49 percent stake in Bami Newco. The board authorized the transaction in February 2009. Subsequently
      the Association for the Defense of Minority Shareholders wrote to the l’Autorité des marchés financiers
      asking for an inquiry on the financial information disclosed by Gecina, and suggesting that certain
      transactions would not comply with Gecina’s corporate interests, constituting misuse of corporate
      assets under French law. In the end, based on a vote of disinterested shareholders, the proposed related-
      party transaction was rejected by 83.7 percent to 16.3 percent. This case was significant in that it was
      one of the rare instances in which shareholders defeated a related-party transaction.a

      Valeo (France): Shareholders rejected a CEO severance package considered at the Valeo annual general
      meeting of 2009. In this case, the board had issued an opinion prior to the meeting, stating that it no
      longer supported the transaction in the light of new information that had emerged (including the fact
      that the board meeting at which the deal was originally approved had been recorded without board
      members’ knowledge).b

    Box 2.3: Geltl versus Daimler in Germany (2012)
    In April 2005, the chair of Daimler, the German car manufacturer, decided that he would tender his
    resignation prior to the end of his term. In May 2005, he informed the chair of the supervisory board of
    his intention for the first time. In the following weeks, other members of the supervisory board were
    informed of this intention. On July 7, 2005, the “presidential commission” (a body within Daimler’s
    supervisory board) decided to propose that the supervisory board approve the early resignation of the
    chair and the appointment of a new chair.

    On July 28, 2005, the supervisory board decided that the chair would lay down his mandate by the end of
    the year and that a new chair would be installed. This information was disclosed to the markets on the
    same day. Following this announcement, the price of Daimler shares increased significantly. However,
    several investors had already sold their shares prior to the announcement of the decision and took the
    view that they had been harmed by the late disclosure of the proposed resignation. They filed a complaint
    against the company and sued for damages.

    In a judgment in June 2012, the European Court of Justice confirmed that intermediate steps of a process
    can qualify as inside information. The implication of the judgment is that European listed companies
    will need to monitor the risk of inside information more closely (Court of Justice 2013).

    Royal Dutch Shell plc is an Anglo-Dutch multinational oil and gas company headquartered in the
    Netherlands and incorporated in the United Kingdom. In 2004, Shell overstated its oil reserves, resulting
    in loss of confidence in the group, a £17 million fine by the Financial Services Authority, and the departure
    of the chair. A lawsuit resulted in payment of $450 million to non-American shareholders in 2007. The risk

     Box 2.6: Corpbank and Crédit Agricole Bulgaria (2014)
     In June 2014, Bulgaria’s central bank suspended operations at Corpbank and its recently acquired
     subsidiary, Crédit Agricole Bulgaria, amid fears that a dispute between its major shareholder and
     biggest single borrower could trigger the group’s collapse. The withdrawals began after Delyan Peevski,
     a businessman and politician who built a newspaper and television empire on loans approved by
     Corpbank, claimed in media statements that Tsvetan Vassilev, the bank’s largest shareholder, with more
     than 50 percent of the total shares, planned to kill him!

     Within a week, small savers withdrew more than 20 percent of deposits from Corpbank, the country’s
     fourth-largest lender, causing a liquidity crunch that forced the bank’s management to seek emergency
     central bank funding. This situation has had a significant impact on the not-so-small noncontrolling
     shareholders.

     Box 2.7: MG Rover Group in the United Kingdom (2005)
     In May 2000, BMW sold Rover to Phoenix, a consortium led by former Rover chief executive John
     Towers, for £10. It was believed that Phoenix would save thousands of jobs at its factory at Longbridge,
     Birmingham, which BMW had threatened to close. At the time, Rover was losing £2 million a day.
     Phoenix took on Rover debt free, aided by a £427 million loan from BMW, repayable in 2049.

     In November 2002, MG Rover failed to hit its break-even target, suffering a £95 million loss. In February
     2004, it became known that four staff from Phoenix had been paid £31 million for having restructured the
     firm. BMW branded the Phoenix Four as “the unacceptable face of capitalism” for awarding themselves
     excessively high salaries despite MG Rover’s operating losses that rose to £119 million.

     Subsequently, Chinese carmaker Shanghai Automotive worked on a joint venture with Rover to make
     cars in Shanghai and Longbridge. In April 2005, MG Rover called in the receivers after suppliers refused
     to deliver to Longbridge and analysis of published accounts revealed £200 million as missing. MG Rover
     collapsed in 2005, causing 5,000 workers and another 15,000 in the supply chain to face redundancy.

This chapter explores the various types of companies in Europe. It discusses
a variety of corporate legal forms within the public, private, and third sectors
and identifies the governance challenges that each sector faces. It also
addresses the impact of differing tax regimes on the location of incorporation.

     Box 3.1: Survey of Baltic Practices
     A survey (BICG 2012) found considerable public dissatisfaction with the governance practices of SOEs
     in the Baltic states. In particular, respondents said that the appointment process for board members is
     opaque: disclosure of information on board members is insufficient for judging their qualifications or
     forming an opinion on their potential for conflicts of interest.

     In general, boards have no formal policies on conflicts of interest or related-party transactions. Nor do
     they have structures to oversee real or potential conflicts of interest. Many of the boards of SOEs in the
     Baltic region are fiefdoms of ministries or political parties. Specific criticisms included the following:
     l	   Key director skills are lacking in many cases.
      There is an insufficient number of independent board members and insufficient independent
     l	
     	oversight.
     l	Oversight of the control environment needs to be strengthened. (Board sizes are generally
     	 appropriate in all of the countries.)
     l	   No self-evaluations by boards have been conducted in the Baltic region.

      Box 3.2: Applying IFRS in Italy and Germany
      Companies converting to International Financial Reporting Standards find that it involves much more
      than simply a change in accounting rules. Zambon and Cordazzo (2009) discovered that German and
      Italian companies’ main concern has been to understand the extent to which accounting differences
      between national Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial
      Reporting Standards affect their reported performance. For example, the findings indicate significant
      differences in reporting net income. In accounting adjustments, the most significant partial impacts on
      equity and net income are those concerning the treatment of employee benefits, provisions, intangible
      assets, and goodwill.

The Owners

This chapter provides an overview of the structure of company ownership in
Europe. It discusses the role of active and inactive stock exchanges and the
differing powers and rights of shareholders (including dominant block
shareholders, minority shareholders, and groups of shareholders). It also
addresses shareholder issues associated with pyramids, related-party
transactions, and tunneling.

     Box 5.1: Criteria for Determining Director Independence
     The European Commission recommends the following criteria for an independent director:
     l	Cannot be an executive or managing director of a company or an associated company or have been in 	
     	 such a position within the previous five years;
     l	Cannot be an employee of the company or an associated company or have been in such a position 		
     	 within the previous three years unless elected to the supervisory board as a worker director/
     	representative;
     l	      Cannot receive or have received significant additional remuneration from the company or an
     	       associated company apart from a fee received as a non-executive. Such additional remuneration
     	       covers in particular any participation in a share option or any other performance-related pay scheme; 	
     	       it does not cover the receipt of fixed amounts of compensation under a retirement plan (including 		
     	       deferred compensation) for prior service with the company (provided that such compensation is not 	
     	       contingent in any way on continued service);
     l	      Cannot be or represent the controlling shareholder(s);
     l	      Cannot have or have had within the last year a significant business relationship with the company or 	
     	       an associated company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder, director, or senior employee of a 	
     	       body having such a relationship. Business relationships include the situation of a significant supplier 	
     	       of goods or services (including financial, legal, advisory, or consulting services), of a significant
     	       customer, and of organizations that receive significant contributions from the company or its group;
     l	Cannot be or have been within the last three years, partner or employee of the present or former
     	 external auditor of the company or an associated company;
     l	Cannot be an executive or managing director in another company in which an executive or managing 	
     	 director of the company is a non-executive or supervisory director, and not to have other significant 	
     	 links with executive directors of the company through involvement in other companies or bodies;
     l	Cannot have served on the board as a non-executive or supervisory director for more than three terms 	
     	 (or, alternatively, more than 12 years where national law provides for normal terms of a very small 		
     	length);
     l	      Cannot be a close family member of an executive or managing director of the company.

Box 5.2: Good Practice—ecoDa Principles
for Board Composition and Practices
In 2010, ecoDa proposed the following governance principles relating to board composition:
l	The board should not be so large as to be unwieldy. The balance of skills and experience should be
	 appropriate for the requirements of the business. Changes to the board’s composition should be
	 manageable without undue disruption.
l	There should be an explicit procedure for the appointment of new directors to the board.
	 Appointments to the board should be made after careful examination against objective criteria.
l	The board should satisfy itself that plans are in place for orderly succession for appointments to the 	
	 board and to senior management. The aim is to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and
	 experience within the company and on the board.
l	The period of appointment of directors should be carefully considered. The board should balance the 	
	 flexibility of open-ended appointments against the need to ensure planned and progressive refreshing 	
	 of the board.

    Box 5.3: Voluntary Code of Conduct for
    Executive Search (United Kingdom, 2011)
    In July 2011, the executive search community in the United Kingdom drew up a voluntary code of
    conduct to address gender diversity on corporate boards and best practice for the related search
    processes. To date, 34 leading executive search firms, including all of those dealing with FTSE 100 board
    appointments, have pledged to abide by the voluntary code. It provides for the following:
    l	   Succession planning. Search firms should support chairs and their nomination committees in
    	    developing medium-term succession plans that identify the balance of experience and skills they will 	
    	    need to recruit over the next two to three years to maximize board effectiveness. This time frame will 	
    	    allow a broader view to be established by looking at the whole board, not individual hires; this should 	
    	    facilitate increased flexibility in candidate specifications.
    l	Diversity goals. When taking a specific brief, search firms should look at overall board composition 	
    	 and, in the broader context of the board’s agreed aspirational goals on gender balance and diversity, 	
    	 explore with the chair whether recruiting women directors is a priority on this occasion.
    l	Defining briefs. In defining briefs, search firms should ensure that significant weight is given to
    	 relevant skills and intrinsic personal qualities and not just proven career experience, to extend the
    	 pool of candidates beyond those with existing board roles or conventional corporate careers.
    l	Long lists. When presenting their long lists, search firms should ensure that at least 30 percent of the 	
    	 candidates are women—and if not, should explicitly justify to the client why they are convinced that 	
    	 there are no other qualified female options, through demonstrating the scope and rigor of their
    	research.
    l	Supporting selection. During the selection process, search firms should provide appropriate support, 	
    	 in particular to first-time candidates, to prepare them for interviews and guide them through the
    	process.
    l	Emphasizing intrinsics. As clients evaluate candidates, search firms should ensure that they continue 	
    	 to provide appropriate weight to some of the key characteristics, supported by thorough referencing, 	
    	 rather than overvaluing certain kinds of experience.
    l	Induction. Search firms should provide advice to clients on best practice in induction and onboarding 	
    	 processes to help new board directors settle quickly into their roles.

Box 6.1: EU Audit Directive and Regulation
The new legislation goes into effect on June 17, 2016, except for the mandatory firm rotation (MFR)
requirements for auditors. MFRs are subject to transition arrangements.

The legislation comprises two legislative instruments: the directive applies to all entities required to
have a statutory audit, and the regulation introduces further requirements for public-interest entities.

The legislation includes introduction of 10-year mandatory firm rotation for all PIEs in the EU, subject
to member state options to shorten or extend the period and the transitional arrangements relating to
length of tenure; far-reaching prohibitions on the provision of non-audit services to audit clients,
applicable from June 17, 2016; and a cap of 70 percent on permitted non-audit services, applicable to
services provided by the auditor or auditing firm.

     Box 7.1: The UN Global Compact—10 Principles
     The Global Compact’s 10 principles are derived from The Universal Declaration of Human Rights; The
     International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; The Rio
     Declaration on Environment and Development; and The United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

     The Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere of influence, a
     set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment, and anti-corruption:

     HUMAN RIGHTS
     	 Principle 1:	         Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed
     		                      human rights; and
     	    Principle 2:	      make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

     LABOUR STANDARDS
     	 Principle 3:	         Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of
     		                      the right to collective bargaining;
     	    Principle 4:	      the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
     	    Principle 5:	      the effective abolition of child labour; and
     	    Principle 6:	      the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

     ENVIRONMENT
     	    Principle 7:	      Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;
     	    Principle 8:	      undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and
     	    Principle 9:	      encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

     ANTI-CORRUPTION
     	 Principle 10:	 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion
     		               and bribery.

     Box 7.3: OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
     The Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises state that enterprises should take fully into account established policies in
     the countries in which they operate, and consider the views of other stakeholders. The following are what the guidelines
     say enterprises should do:

     1.	   Contribute to economic, environmental and social progress with a view to achieving sustainable develop-
           ment.

     2.	 Respect the internationally recognised human rights of those affected by their activities.

     3.	 Encourage local capacity building through close co-operation with the local community, including business
         interests, as well as developing the enterprise’s activities in domestic and foreign markets, consistent with the
         need for sound commercial practice.

     4.	 Encourage human capital formation, in particular by creating employment opportunities and
         facilitating training opportunities for employees.

     5.	 Refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated in the statutory or regulatory framework
         related to human rights, environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial
         incentives, or other issues.

     6.	 Support and uphold good corporate governance principles and develop and apply good corporate governance
         practices, including throughout enterprise groups.

     7.	   Develop and apply effective self-regulatory practices and management systems that foster a
           relationship of confidence and mutual trust between enterprises and the societies in which they operate.

     8.	 Promote awareness of and compliance by workers employed by multinational enterprises with respect to
         company policies through appropriate dissemination of these policies, including through training pro-
         grammes.

     9.	 Refrain from discriminatory or disciplinary action against workers who make bona fide reports to manage -
         ment or, as appropriate, to the competent public authorities, on practices that contravene the law, the Guide-
         lines or the enterprise’s policies.

     10.	 Carry out risk-based due diligence, for example by incorporating it into their enterprise risk
          management systems, to identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts and account for
          how these impacts are addressed. The nature and extent of due diligence depend on the circumstances of a
          particular situation.

     11.	 Avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on matters covered by the Guidelines, through
          their own activities, and address such impacts when they occur.

     12.	 Seek to prevent or mitigate an adverse impact where they have not contributed to that impact,
          when the impact is nevertheless directly linked to their operations, products or services by a
          business relationship. This is not intended to shift responsibility from the entity causing an adverse impact to
          the enterprise with which it has a business relationship.

     13.	 In addition to addressing adverse impacts in relation to matters covered by the Guidelines,
          encourage, where practicable, business partners, including suppliers and sub-contractors, to apply principles
          of responsible business conduct compatible with the Guidelines.

     14.	 Engage with relevant stakeholders in order to provide meaningful opportunities for their views to
          be taken into account in relation to planning and decision making for projects or other activities
          that may significantly impact local communities.

     15.	 Abstain from any improper involvement in local political activities.

     Box 7.5: A Study of Ethics Codes in the United Kingdom
     A 2003 study of U. K. companies by the Institute of Business Ethics (Webley and More 2003) made the
     following discoveries:
     l	Companies with an ethics code outperformed those without one—in economic value added, market 	
     	 value added, and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
     l	    Companies with an ethics code experienced far less P/E volatility than did those without one.

     In 2007, the IBE repeated the study (Ugoji, Dando, and Moir 2007) and found that the companies that
     provided training in business ethics and financial performance fared better than did those that merely
     disclosed ethical values and provided no training.

Box 7.7: Director Integrity
GUBERNA, the Belgian Directors Association, produced a detailed guide on what it means for a director to
behave with integrity:

1.	   A director acts ethically and with integrity (base of minimum requirements for moral values) in
	     accordance with the applicable governance codes and company practices. A director is able to describe 		
	     the behaviour and identify the common values of the company (for example, respect, dialogue,
	     tolerance, diversity or pluralism).

2.	   A director has the personal and professional qualities that meet the highest definition and most
	     demanding standards in terms of integrity, honesty and loyalty.
	 l	 A director organises his or her personal and professional life so that it does not interfere with or
		 hinder the exercise of his or her professional functions.
	 l	 A director maintains under all circumstances his or her independence of analysis, decision-making 		
		 and action and rejects any form of pressure.

3.	The integrity of a director includes—at the very least—respect for both the letter and intention of
	  written and unwritten rules and customs in place within the company.

4.	   A director is familiar with, follows and complies with the procedures put in place within the
	     company to avoid and/or resolve conflicts of interest. When relevant, a director will notify and inform 		
	     the other directors of his or her interests, clearly and in tempore non suspecto. To this end, the director will
	     contact the designated persons within the company.

5.	   A director participates in the development and promotion of a culture of honesty. Honesty consists 		
	     of irreproachable behaviour, with regard to both the laws and the company’s internal rules, as well as 		
	     the generally accepted definition of honesty (uprightness, loyalty, etc.).
	 l	 A director does not participate in any way in unlawful transactions and does not use unlawful
		 means to perform his or her duties.
	 l	 A director draws a clear line between the performance of his or her official duties for the company 		
		 and the promotion of other professional or business activities or executive responsibilities.
		 A director does not use his or her office or the information obtained further thereto for purposes 		
		 other than to manage and represent the company.
	 l	 A director does not participate in the creation of misleading situations and does not spread or state 		
		 incorrect information.

6.	   A director is incorruptible. A director takes care to maintain his or her free will and to ensure that he 		
	     or she is free of all pressure when taking decisions.

7.	   A director is loyal. A director is faithful to his or her commitments. Such loyalty is constant and
	     should be displayed prior to taking up the directorship, during the appointment process and
	     performance of the directorship, and after the end of the director’s term of office.

8.	   A director is trustworthy. He or she is capable of safely maintaining the confidence of information
	     received. A director acts in a courteous manner and maintains relations characterised by good faith,
	     in order to preserve the confidence and trust required by his or her office.

9.	   A director is responsible.
	 l	 A director acts with diligence and efficiency. He or she behaves and takes decisions in a responsible 		
		 manner. A director displays caution and reserve in the exercise of his or her duties.
	 l	 A director refrains from holding indiscrete or indelicate conversations about any information that is 		
		 brought to his or her attention both during and outside the performance of his or her duties.
	 l	 A director respects his or her commitments and assumes the consequences of his or her behaviour 		
		 (acts and/or omissions). A director discharges the duties conferred on him or her, in pursuit of the 		
		 company’s objectives, to the best of his or her abilities and with discernment.
	     l	   A director is in general true to his or her commitments.
