  	Estimates are based on a panel VAR with country fixed effects and quarterly data from Q1 1999 to Q2 2015 using the ‘Helmert procedure’ (Arellano and Bover, 1995).
    This procedure removes only the forward mean, i.e. the mean of all the future observations available for each country-quarter, and preserves the orthogonality
    between transformed variables and lagged regressors. Lagged regressors are used as instruments and coefficients estimated by system GMM. This methodology
    deals successfully with the Hurwicz-type bias associated to the use of fixed effects in a dynamic panel framework.

     	Social assistance programs are typically not designed to fully lift families out of poverty – their purpose is to mitigate poverty and connect people to opportunities that can lift
      them out of poverty. A transfer given to an extremely poor family will enhance their welfare, and reduce the poverty gap. Transfers given to families closer to the poverty line are
      more likely to have an impact in terms of fully lifting them out of poverty and therefore reducing the poverty headcount.

                                           	After the crisis in 2008/2009, many EU countries suffered a decline in GDP. Spending, measured as a share of GDP, may therefore no longer capture the real spending.
                                            Real spending (in constant 2005 Euros) is anchored at the share of 2008 GDP – the peak GDP for many countries in recent years – to compare the actual spending over
                                            time while taking into account the country differences on the level of the spending.
