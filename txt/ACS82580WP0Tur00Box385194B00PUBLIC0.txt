                   Turkey
                Key observations
                           The objective of this brief is to present a picture of the students in Turkey using data from TIMSS 2011.
                           For comparability reasons we did not use data from previous rounds of TIMSS. Thus, we are not able to
                            explore whether students in Turkey have improved, or not, their performance over time.
                           Results show that Turkey’s student performance on the TIMSS international education assessments is as
                            expected given its level of economic development.
                           Turkish students’ results in Science are stronger than in Math for grade 8, suggesting that students have
                            a better command of the Science than the Math curriculum.
                           There are opportunities to improve the quality of education for all children as inequalities remain across
                            groups in the education system.

Key Observations
    There is room for improvement in addressing inequalities in the education system. Disaggregating national scores
     shows that Turkey’s test scores gap between the highest and the lowest quintiles is higher in Math than in
     Science. These gaps are slightly larger than those seen in OECD and EU countries; with a gap of 125 points in
     Turkey versus 118 in science for OECD countries.
    There are spatial and linguistic inequalities; students living in urban areas (including urban, suburban, and
     medium-size cities) perform better in both subjects than those living in rural areas (including small towns and
     remote rural areas).
    Schools in Turkey are stratified. Previous World Bank reports using PISA test scores (taken after the examination
     for upper secondary) do not indicate that stratification in Turkey increases after the exam. In fact, analysis
     suggests that if at all, the exam reduces it.

            Key Observations

                       Most eighth grade teachers in Turkey have a bachelor’s degree.
                       Eighth grade science teachers in Turkey have on average 10 years of experience; relatively lesser years than
                        in other comparator countries, partially due to the fact that Turkey’s school population has been growing
                        relative to that in other middle income ECA comparators.
                       Eighth grade science teachers recruited before and after the 2002 selection reform have different majors.
                        Many more eighth grade science teachers major in education than before the reforms.

        Key Observations
          Performance of Turkey’s students is largely explained by individual, household, and school level
           characteristics.
          Parents’ education levels and socio-economic status account for around 27 of the variance in student
           achievement; individual aspirations add an additional 18 percent. All variables, including school and
           teacher characteristics account for 53 percent of the student achievement variance.
          Foreign language at home is negatively correlated with student achievement.
          Students with higher individual aspirations perform better.
          Eighth grade science teachers who apply effective teaching strategies, like summarizing main points and
           providing positive encouragement, can make an important difference in students’ learning.
          Other school-related variables, like class size, while still statistically significant in determining student
           achievement, are very low in magnitude.
          Higher parental involvement positively affect students from lower socio-economic status.

        Policy Recommendations
    There are policy leavers that affect student achievement. A combination of policies may work better than one
    policy alone. Two important ones are:
         Strengthening the skills of eighth grade science teachers by training them in effective teaching practices,
          and
         Promoting parental involvement.
