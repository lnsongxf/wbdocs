Introduction

Africa is facing unprecedented rates of urbanization, driven largely by constricting
rural economies and the expectation that cities are more inclusive, productive, and
integrated spaces. Currently, over a quarter of the 100 fastest-growing cities in the world
are in Africa.1 Migration to urban areas is expected to give citizens better access to higher
per capita incomes, increased employment levels, competitiveness and productivity,
improved living conditions, and better integration to the national territorial economy.

However, this promise is yet to be fulfilled in many African cities. Hampered by low
levels of institutional and infrastructural capacity, the continent’s cities struggle to absorb
the growing number of migrants: “The pace of urbanization, together with its sheer scale . . .
is likely to stress national and urban institutions in many developing countries to their
breaking point."2 Many of these cities exhibit a mix of low institutional capacity rising
violence and growing instability, inequitable development and access to services, insecure
land tenure, weak institutions and inadequate livelihood opportunities, which could be
characterized as urban fragility. 3

More often than not, the urbanization process is poorly managed, resulting in
inequitable, exclusionary and fragmented cities and increased risk of violence. Certain
cities exhibits some of the lowest rates of economic growth in the continent. In fact, it is
Africa’s constricting urban economies, not the abundance of urban economic opportunities,
which drive urban migration.4 Consequently, the majority of migrants find themselves in
slums, where government presence is weak, donor reach is constricted, and social mobility is
low. Without adequate economic development and urban planning to accommodate the
population growth, poverty in cities and especially in slums is particularly dire. According to
experts, in many countries the poorest 20 percent in urban slums have worse development
indicators than the poorest 20 percent in rural areas.5 Additionally, many of the urban
residents, compared to their rural counterparts, are much more vulnerable to economic and
environmental shocks, not to mention the lack of human security, as they exhibit greater
dependence on cash income and markets, as well as more exposure to pollution, poor

3 According to the World Development Report 2011, fragility and fragile situations are defined as those

“periods when states or institutions lack the capacity, accountability, or legitimacy to mediate relations
between citizens groups and between citizens and the state, making them vulnerable to violence”. The
same report points out that to determine if a country is fragile, the World Bank and other institutions
have used measures of institutional weakness such as the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) frameworks. For more details see: World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and
Development: World Bank.
On the other hand, the concept of urban fragility refers to a particular form of fragility experienced by
dwellers in urban areas of Africa directly related to unequal access to services and a strong sense of
abandonment by the State and state actors. Urban fragility mutates into an experienced “every day
fragility”. For more details see: Commins, Stephen (2011), “Urban Fragility and Security in Africa”,

sanitation, and water shortages.6 An additional risk factor is Africa’s youth bulge. Africa’s
growing cities host a largely young, poor and marginalized population facing low access to
basic services. This setup creates the potential for a contested space, in which urban crime
and violence can flourish.

The World Development Report, ‘Conflict, Security and Development’ (WDR 2011),
which examines the cost of intra-state violence, notes that countries and sub-national
areas with the weakest institutional legitimacy and governance are the most
vulnerable to violence and instability and the least able to respond to internal and
external stresses. Unmanaged growth of cities increasingly challenges stability of countries:
The WDR 2011 identified the urban arena as a crucible within which so-called new threats –
indices of chronic fragility and cyclical violence – have come to define the challenges of fragile
and conflicted states. The WDR emphasizes the importance of institution building, especially
regarding security, access to justice and job provision: “to break cycles of insecurity and
reduce the risk of their recurrence, national reformers and their international partners need
to build the legitimate institutions that can provide a sustained level of citizen security,
justice, and jobs.”7 Cities are indeed, key ecosystems for improved access to socio-economic
opportunities, inclusion and social mobility.

People in fragile urban areas in Africa experience highly unequal access to services,
‘differently governed’ (although not ‘ungoverned’) spaces, and a strong sense of
abandonment (or predation) by the state and state actors, making them more
vulnerable to a series of risks including crime and violence. This amounts to an
experience of ‘everyday fragility’, which affects several aspects of daily life of citizens in urban
areas. As aforementioned, the security of residents of underserved urban areas is more
threatened by disasters, such as fires, mudslides, local flooding or waste exposure, and is
more exposed to crime and violence. In those urban areas, where states, markets, and social
institutions fail to provide basic security, justice, and economic opportunities for citizens,
criminal activities and city conflicts can escalate. Such a negative spiral risks compromising
forms of public authority and human security. The strategic and political significance of cities
implies that uncontrolled urban violence may, contribute to weaknesses of a state.

Indeed, crime and interpersonal violence in cities are a growing problem in the region,
restricting the developmental potential of cities. Recent data suggests that in the last
decade violence in the region is less anchored in traditional forms of conflict, and more
related to criminal violence, violent extremism, and other forms of civil unrest.8 While
violence data in Africa is still sparse, the WHO, based on simulated projections, was able to
map some disconcerting trends: In 2012, the Africa region is estimated to have the second
highest rate of homicide worldwide with an estimate of 98,081 victims of homicide. This adds
up to an overall rate of 10.9 per 100,000 populations.9 Death is one of most severe
consequences of violence, which then incurs wider social and economic costs, due to societal
fear, which constricts economic activity, the costs of increased security, and loss of the
victim’s economic contribution: “areas experiencing comparatively high rates of conflict-

related and homicidal violence tend to experience declining levels of progress in relation to
both human development as measured by poverty, income and the achievement of specific
MDG goals.”10 Both governments and donors have provided a limited number of
developmental responses to urban fragility and violence with most efforts, particularly on
the Government side which focuses primarily on securitization approaches. The absence of
an analytical framework for the region that connects drivers or urban fragility and violence
with developmental dynamics, is a contributing factor of urban fragility, and within it, urban
violence, which tends to be understood as “normal” given the overall fragility of many African
States, and the technical constraints for the development of long-term, inclusive and
sustainable urban development strategies.

Given the urbanization trends in the region — characterized by increasing levels of
inequality and weak institutional systems capable of delivering security, justice and
jobs — urban violence as a manifestation of urban fragility will persist unless
governments and donors prioritize it through a series of policy reforms and
developmental responses. Urbanization trends are set to continue, underscoring the
importance of addressing crime and violence in cities as part of a broader development
strategy. Indeed, the presence and size of informal settlements such as Camp Luka in
Kinshasa, Kibera in Nairobi, Kanu in Abuja, and the “Jesus is our Saviour” settlement in Lagos
is increasing, with a growing number of citizens living in areas that fall outside the control of
formal and traditional forms of authority and exercise high levels of self-governance. In Sub-
Saharan Africa, 200 million people were living in slums in 2010, nearly 62 percent of the
region’s urban population, according to estimates by UN-Habitat.11 Presence of the State in
these areas is limited and, too often, the governments respond to urban violence through
securitization. However, security solutions alone will not address the multi-faceted drivers
of urban crime: “Approaching urban fragility solely as a security problem often leads to short-
term instruments that are disconnected from underlying causes of insecurity and fragility…
attention must be given to delivering services to meet [a population’s] immediate needs while
strengthening public institutions over the longer term to ensure sustainability and equitable
coverage.”12

Understanding the dynamic interplaying between urban violence and fragility and a
countries’ economic potential will be key to boosting development in most African
countries13. As a first step to tackle this challenge, the Africa unit of the Social, Urban, Rural
and Resilience Global Practice undertook a comparative research process, which identifies
common trends across Sub-Saharan Africa in order to facilitate the identification of
mechanisms through which urban fragility and violence prevention could be further
integrated into the development process of African countries. Research and pilot activities
were undertaken in one country of each of the three sub-regions in the continent, namely
West Africa (Nigeria), Central Africa (Republic of Congo) and East Africa (South Sudan). These

countries, the analytical work focused on understanding dynamics of crime and violence in
selected urban areas and existing institutional (formal and informal) responses to crime and
violence, so as to further the World Bank understanding on how to best address urban
fragility and foster local resilience while putting the building blocks to define an urban
fragility agenda in the Sub-Saharan African region. This report gives an overview of this
multi-country study.

This report includes four main sections. The first section provides an analytical overview
of urban fragility, and in particular, urban crime and violence in the Africa Region. The second
section covers the multi-country study, including its objectives, methodologies, and a profile
of the countries covered by it, followed by the main findings of the study in terms of forms of
violence that were most frequently reported, key risk factors for crime and violence found
across all countries, and local responses to crime and violence by a series of actors, including
the government. The third section proposes a series of areas in which World Bank support
could address urban crime and violence risk factors, impacts and responses. The fourth
section summarizes the main conclusions of the study.

Chapter 1: Urban Fragility, Crime and Violence in Africa

The African continent is one of the regions experiencing faster urbanization, and the
unmanaged nature of rapid urbanization leads to every day fragility for a considerable
part of urban residents. Rural to urban migration is the main driver of urbanization, due to
an increase in rural population density, vagaries of weather producing both droughts and
floods and the driver that the fastest growing sectors of the national economy are usually
mainly urban based. The majority of newcomers live in rented accommodation in slums,
where the government is unsupportive and donor projects are few, making it hard for
families to graduate out of poverty. Some obtain low paid employment, and some serve as
casual laborers in the transport and service sectors. Unlike the situation in rural areas, where
a range of survival strategies is often available, cash is required for urban survival, and as a
result levels of indebtedness are high.

Africa is also over-represented at the top of the fragility index. The literature on state
building, particularly fragile states building, frequently refers to the nature of the political
settlement or settlements that underlies the formation of the state (or, better, nation state
since identity is part of the glue that holds states together). What have been less studied are
the complex factors that create “Urban political settlements”. As different populations move
into cities and as different political interests compete for power, the existing political
arrangements may become more contested and questioned. Yet, little attention has been
given to the relationship between urbanization and fragility, and in particular, to urban
violence as a consequence of this fragility.

Urban areas experience fragility to varying degrees and with differing dimensions. The
new OECD report on fragile states outlines five interconnected and overlapping dimensions
of urban fragility, which interact in a complex way, and result in a continuum of fragility: i)
Crime and Violence ii) Justice; iii) Institutions; iv) Economic Foundations, and, v)
Resilience.14 These different factors affecting urban fragility manifested to varying degrees
in urban communities in Africa. The consequences include increasing levels of violence,
highly unequal access to services, ‘differently governed’ spaces with varying forms of
authority including institutional, traditional and informal, limited presence of the state and
state actors and localized, poorly connected economic ecosystems. Insecure land tenure
further encourages the proliferation of informal settlements, characterized by temporary
structures that do not adequately protect occupants from the elements, informality in regards
to livelihoods and access to basic services such as water and sanitation facilities, inadequate
solid waste management, poor connectedness across different areas of the city; and higher
exposure to flooding, landslides, fires and other local hazards. Hence, urban fragility touches
multiple dimensions of the day-to-day life of citizens. Experts and practitioners describe this
heightened, and multi-dimensional lack of human security as ‘everyday fragility’.

The governance challenges associated with administering increasingly complex urban
systems present multiple problems, including the rise in crime and violence.
Increasingly populated while underserved urban centers have the potential to aggravate

conflict and prejudice. Xenophobic hostility towards other ethnic groups, “foreigners”, extra-
legal vigilante activities of “crime-fighting” and socio-economic struggles around issues of
land and services emerge can be heightened in dense urban contexts. Social contextual
factors, such as access to weapons, alcohol, and insecure public spaces, also play a role. Weak
policy responses, executive and legislative, as well as poor urban planning, further aggravate
everyday fragility. On one hand, cities can be places of great progress and increased human
wealth; on the other, in those urban areas, where states, markets, and social institutions fail
to provide basic security, justice, and economic opportunities for citizens, city conflicts can
escalate. Such a negative spiral can further compromise forms of public authority and human
security.

Policy responses to date are still relatively weak, and urbanization trends outpace
local government’s ability to respond. The trends regarding rapid urbanization, and with
it the increased risk of urban fragility, have persisted over several decades. However, there
remains a dearth of targeted research and policy guidance addressing the connections
between urbanization and crime, violence and everyday fragility as linked to wider political,
economic and social processes. The challenges are not confined to mega-cities, but are
becoming frequent throughout much of Africa. Urban demographic shifts along with state-
directed decentralization have outpaced the capacities of local government institutions to
manage urban growth and provide services equitably. The growing proportion of
underserved citizens may weaken local government’s legitimacy. Urban power relations and
social, economic and environmental trends will affect questions of national identity and
political legitimacy. Urban centers, especially capitals and large cities, tend to be centers of
competition for political power and resources, as well as battlegrounds for both official and
unofficial definitions of national identity and state legitimacy power. Grievances around the
lack of essential and basic services, coupled with increased insecurity, crime and corruption
can contribute to different forms of fragility. Urban areas that are largely underserved and
underrepresented can become differently governed and contested spaces.15

 ‘Differently governed’ cities can contain spaces that are relatively secure and those
that are highly insecure. Some individuals and neighborhoods have situations that may
be characterized as being ‘secure’, while other individuals and neighborhoods may be
defined as fragile or insecure. These spaces may overlap for different groups, in different
locations, or in different economic, social or political contexts. Within large ‘slums’ there are
differences in access to services and livelihoods, as well as the relative threats of crime and
violence. Violence is distributed unequally even in poor areas, which affects access to and
utilization of basic services and transport systems. At the household level, a number of
African countries report high levels of domestic violence.

Interpersonal violence affects different population groups unequally, and often,
women and children are particularly vulnerable. Sexual and gender based violence
seem to be a particularly prevalent form of violence across Africa. According to the WHO,
36.6% of women report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner
in their lives. Further, findings from the Violence Against Children Surveys conducted in
Kenya, the Republic of Tanzania, Swaziland and Zimbabwe indicate that about 1 in 3 girls
have experienced sexual abuse during their childhood, revealing a much higher rate of both
childhood sexual and physical as well as emotional abuse than the global average rates. This

15 Theterm ‘ungoverned’ implies that there are no governing authorities, but all spaces are ‘governed’,
but not necessarily by state agencies or ‘civil’ society.


                                                                                                     6
is especially troubling as violence against women, children, and the elderly tends to be
underreported, which is partially explained by what is considered violence against women
based on cultural norms and social stigmas.

With a growing frequency, unmet expectations in quantity and quality of governance
outputs across security, political, economic, and social sectors engender violence,
which (especially when related to gang and militia activity) further increases fragility
and insecurity. Generally governments and development partners have not given adequate
attention to issues around corruption, criminal justice and community policing. The lack of
ability to address different forms of insecurity highlights the problems of institutional
capacity, inter-organizational coordination and access to information.

Further research and higher government capacity is needed to address urban violence.
Currently, across Sub-Saharan Africa, governments exhibit a limited ability to collect data on
crime and violence in African countries, and, when data exists, a limited ability to effectively
connect the data to policy responses. For example, the WHO indicates that there are
substantial gaps in homicide data from the police and from civil ministries across the African
continent:16 While 93 percent of the countries report having police data on the number of
homicides, a majority of 70 percent of the countries fail to collect homicide data. Data on other
types of violence, especially sexual violence and intimate partner violence, is also sparse: In
Africa, only 52 percent of the counties report having conducted surveys on intimate partner
violence, and only 33 percent have administered national surveys on child maltreatment.17

Responses to address crime and violence across the continent are just evolving, and to
date, the few existing ones tend to have limited involvement of citizens. Among the
countries which had national action plans on crime and violence, national strategies tend to
address the issues from the top policy level. Few countries actually take advantage of social
and educational policy measures to mitigate key risk factors for violence from the bottom
level (see table 1). In addition, mitigation measures are limited as well. Providing services
and supports to victims of violence is as important to preventing further violence. Victims
require medical, psycho-social as well as legal assistance to help reduce physical suffering as
well as mental trauma. Conflict and high rates of violence have destructive effects on social
norms and institutions regulating violence. Additionally, although research on traumatized
population and violence trends is just starting, findings have indicated that long-lasting
psychological scars are associated with increased violence: traumatized children, for
example, have a higher disposition to violent behavior in adulthood.18 Across the African
region, access to services designed to identify, refer, protect and support victims is extremely
weak. Despite strong evidence suggesting the importance of mental care after victimization,
only 15% of the African countries report any provision of mental health services for victims
of violence. In terms of protective services, only 41% of African countries included in the
WHO study have adult protective services, and only 15% have child protection services.

Crime and violence have a negative impact on development, on the quality of life of
citizens, and on the emergence of democratic processes.19 By incorporating the crime and
violence agenda within the context of rapid urbanization into its operations and initiatives in
the region, the World Bank can play a constructive, supportive role. Given that in Africa urban
crime and violence affect the poor disproportionally, addressing them is also key to the
achievement of the twin goals of ending poverty and sharing prosperity.

This report aims to further the World Bank’s understanding of the challenges of crime
and violence within the context of urbanization in three Sub-Saharan African
countries. It attempts to also present avenues to identify specific needs that can be
addressed by Bank operations. These analyses offer opportunities to comprehend the
dynamics of crime and violence at a multi-scalar level ranging from the regional, sub-regional,
and national level and therefore, highlight the different geographies, context, and historical
particularities of the countries in the Africa region. The selected three case studies (Nigeria,
Republic of Congo (RoC) and South Sudan form a body of knowledge that allows for
comparative analyses of the crime and violence dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Chapter 2: Multi-country Study on Urban Crime and Violence
2.1 Methodology and Definitions

This paper draws on three analytical reports, as well as the inputs from World Bank
practitioners. The three studies relied on qualitative data collection in selected urban areas
of the three mentioned countries (Useh and Okhoro in Benin City, capital city of Edo State,
Nigeria; Juba in South Sudan; and, Brazzaville, Mindouli, Kinkala and Gamboma in Republic
of Congo). Overall, the research process relied mostly on qualitative research methodologies,
which included focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, both individual and in
small groups and interviews with relevant stakeholders and policy makers. Research teams
held meetings with representatives of Government agencies, such as the National and local
Police, Ministry of Security and Youth Affairs; local and traditional rulers; as well as
representatives of civil society organizations related to initiatives aimed and preventing
crime and violence. In Nigeria, focus groups, key informant interviews as well as key
stakeholder interviews were conducted in Useh and Okhoro, two local communities in Benin
City; South Sudan complemented this process with detailed quantitative analysis, a total of
124 households were randomly selected and interviewed during the household victimization
survey; while in Republic of Congo, eight focus groups were conducted in Brazzaville,
Mindouli, Kinkala and Gamboma, and a total of eighty people identified by local NGOs
participated in the focus group discussion.

Participants in described methods (i.e. focus group discussions, semi structured interviews,
etc.) were identified using community mapping and snowballing techniques. In Nigeria, a
variety of individuals, ranging from women in the community to traditional leaders,
contributed to the discussion. Research teams in RoC ensured that participants included
groups of young men and women, between the ages of 18 and 30. In the case of South Sudan,
where datasets related to crime and violence were available and contain an adequate number
of data that would not compromise the validity of the conclusions of the study, the teams
relied on available statistics to apply quantitative research methods. According to the data
obtained, respondents of the household survey were between the age of 18 and 65, 44.3% of
which were female. In addition, the South Sudan report’s author was granted access to
national crime and violence focused datasets, as collected by the South Sudan National Police
Services (SSNPS) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which, while not
comprehensive, did offer the opportunity for a national analysis of crime and violence that
complimented the qualitative research.

It is important to clarify that the sample of individuals and communities covered by this study
are not, and were not intended to be, representative at the city or national levels. Rather, the
focus of the study was unveiling how citizens experience crime and violence in urban areas
in Africa, and which mechanisms are available to them whenever they experience them. That
said, findings of the analysis are aligned with those of larger, representative studies such as
the WHO World Status Report on Violence Prevention, and literature on urban fragility, crime
and violence. In this way, this analysis contributes to the debate by bringing some granularity
to the understanding of these events and responses in the African context. Furthermore, it
attempts to clarify the linkages that exist between these issues and the World Bank twin goals




                                                                                              9
and interventions for their achievement, particularly those implemented by the Social, Urban,
Rural and Resilience Global Practice.

Conducting research, both qualitative and quantitative, on crime and violence remains a
challenge in all three countries. The researchers not only needed to ask the sensitive
questions in a careful way, but also needed to interpret the responses with extreme caution.
While all three countries of study inherit rich ethnic diversity, ethnic issues did not appear to
be prominent in the field study. Efforts were made to minimize the limitation and biases of
the research. Research teams were trained on the use of research tools and on how to
minimize personal biases. The South Sudan task team, for instance, held a training session for
enumerators on conducting victimization survey prior to the field work, and female
respondents were only interviewed by female enumerators in order to better manage the
emotional feeling and victimization experience. In addition, before conducting the interviews,
researchers obtained clear consent from respondents and clarified that respondents could
terminate the interview at any moment they would need it.

As further detailed in later sections, this paper uses the terms crime, criminal violence and
violence interchangeably as they are largely entwined in the views of people. These are, of
course, different concepts. A crime is “an offence against a public law.”20 As such, what is
considered a crime is the result of a political process, by which a society deemed a certain
conduct unacceptable and against the law. Violence on the other hand is much broader, and
refers to the use of force to harm another. It can further be qualified to include physical,
psychological, sexual and interpersonal violence, and on a societal level, structural and
political violence. Interpersonal violence is defined in this report as "the intentional use of
physical force or power, threatened or actual, against another person or against a group or
community that results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological
harm, mal-development, or deprivation."21 However, the different terms were used by
respondents in interviews and focus group discussions in an interchangeable way. This could
be explained by the fact that there is limited knowledge of what is defined by the country’s
legal frameworks as crime, and most people rely on their social understandings of violent
behavior to assess any given situation. In that way, what constitutes harm, force and damage
to another varies largely across individuals, communities and countries according to different
social constructs. Therefore, while for some people certain situations could be considered as
violence or are widely recognized as crime, for others these situations are not associated with
crime and violence.

2.2 Country profiles

Three countries were chosen to represent the various geographic regions of Africa: South
Sudan in the East, Republic of Congo in Central Africa and Nigeria, in the West. Additionally,
they represent a progression since conflict, and by extension different progressions in terms
of governance and institution building: Nigeria, while a host to multiple organized and
informal armed groups and increasingly embroiled in a crisis in the North, has nevertheless
been relatively stable since the Biafra war; Republic of Congo has experienced relative peace

since 1999, and has progressed in institutional capacity since; South Sudan is still in the cycles
of violence, and experiences high political and interpersonal violence coupled with very low
institutional capacity.

Despite this diversity, the challenges were similar: rapid urbanization driven by declining
rural economies, a youth bulge coupled with an economy struggling to absorb them, and weak
institutions unable to mitigate conflict and provide human security equitably.

South Sudan

South Sudan is primarily a rural country with only 18% of the population living in urban
areas, with a 5.0 % annual rate of increased urbanization. 22Although crime and violence are
prevalent and widespread in South Sudan, urban areas experience higher levels of crime such
as robbery, assaults, and murders. Data suggests that violent crimes are concentrated in
urban areas, and are frequently linked to extreme economic conditions, high levels of
unemployment, and easy access to weapons. For example, murders in the capital city of Juba
are frequently preceded by robbery or assaults. Other pervasive forms of violent crime in
South Sudan, like cattle raiding, are more concentrated in rural states.

After decades of civil war against Sudan, South Sudan gained independence on July 9, 2011.
With a population of about 10 million people, South Sudan has significant natural resources,
including oil. Despite its rich natural resources and significant oil wealth, the country faces
myriad problems including the legacy of a protracted civil war, weak institutions, low levels
of human development emanating from a poor educational system, and high rates of crime.
Since achieving independence, South Sudan has experienced high levels of poverty,
increasing inequality, high unemployment levels, high population growth, and institutional
inefficiencies coupled with continued political violence. South Sudan’s population is
primarily young, undereducated and underemployed: Estimates show that South Sudan has
the highest population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the fastest growing
populations in the world at an average of more than 4% per year since the signing of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

Level of violence in South Sudan is among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, it was
the 10th most violent country—measured by the homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants—in
2012 with a homicide rate of 16.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. The homicide rate is significantly
above the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (11.5 homicides per 100,000) and the threshold of
10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, above which the World Health Organization (WHO)
terms it a health epidemic. Much of its crime and violence appear to be concentrated in the
center and northeastern states of the country. States situated in the western part of the
country appear to have less crime and fewer violent crimes such as homicides as compared
with, for example, Jonglei, which has very high levels of crime and violence.

The costs of crime and violence on South Sudan’s economy is substantial. The country study’s
analysis reveals that crime and violence represent almost 4% of South Sudan’s total GDP.

Republic of Congo

Republic of Congo is another post-conflict country. RoC, like South Sudan, is one of sub-
Saharan Africa’s major oil producers, though manufacturing is another important component
of RoC’s economy. As the other countries, RoC has been experiencing rapid urbanization. As
of 2013 World Bank data, 64.53% of RoC's population lives in cities, versus 35.47% in the
countryside – almost the reverse of population distribution in 1960. Similarly to the other
countries, 42.54% of RoC's population is under the age of 15, pointing to the challenge of a
growing youth bulge in a context of rapid urbanization.23

Corruption and relative instability contributed to slow development and continued poverty
for much of the population. RoC was ranked 140 out of 187 countries on the 2014 UN Human
Development Index.24 Freedom House considers the country not free, and ranked it very low
on freedom, civil liberties and political rights; they point to political violence, pervasive
corruption, especially in the extractive industry and the justice sector. In urban areas where
the pubic judicial system dominates, institutional weaknesses and lack of technical capacity
however hamper its effectiveness. For example, the judicial system offers few protections for
business and property rights. In the rural areas, traditional courts still prevail, especially in
cases regarding local property, inheritance and domestic abuse. Human Rights Organizations
reports cases of excessive use of force by RoC’s security forces as well as point out the
necessary improvements needed by the prison system in the country. 25

In the RoC, crime and violence take multiple forms. Interlocutors report theft of property, to
include armed robbery, using guns and knives. Crimes related to sorcery, including murder
and assault are also committed. Interviewees further noted psychological and economic
violence. Violence against women, including beatings, molestation and rape, is reportedly
widespread. While rape, including marital rape, is illegal, this common crime is rarely
reported or prosecuted.26 Interlocutors reported that adult males and minors in detention
by security forces have also been subjected to excessive use of force.

Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and most populous country in Africa. An accelerated
economic growth due to important oil revenues of US$74 billion per annum have not been
translated in better socio-economic conditions for most Nigerian citizens. Indeed, the human
development index for Nigeria remains low: According to the 2014 UNDP Human
Development Index, Nigeria ranked positioning 152 out of 187 countries, while 43.3% of the
population is multi-dimensionally poor. Per consequence, more than half of Nigerians live on
less than US$1 a day and four out of ten are unemployed. Paradoxically, the majority of
Nigerians are economically worse off today than at independence- a consequence of multiple
factors: corruption coupled with high oil income, a struggling agriculture economy, and

increasing insecurity.27 Economic development and access to government services are
unequal across the country, as the state has struggled to deliver public goods, including
security, transportation, water, medical care, power and education, in an equitable fashion.
For example, whilst 27% of the population in the south lives in poverty, this figure is at 72%
in the north. 28

Nigeria ranks in the bottom third according to all aggregated good governance indicators, and
scores in the bottom 10th percentile on Political Stability and Control of Corruption as well
as the bottom 20th percentile on Rule of Law and Government Effectiveness. For example,
Transparency International ranks Nigeria in the 16th percentile in its control of corruption
and 11th percentile in its rule of law.29 Freedom House’s ranks Nigeria as partially free, and
especially low rule of law score. Political interference, corruption, and a lack of funding,
equipment and training negatively affect the judicial system. Still, Nigeria’s judiciary has
progressed both in terms of independence and professionalism. However, there are still
reports of excessive of force by security forces while there are serious problems of trust on
the police forces.

The country has been increasingly affected by instability, with a growing insurgent threat by
Boko Haram, and recent economic downturn that resulted from a decline in oil prices. 30 In
addition to the Boko Haram insurgency, violent crime is a problem across Nigeria, which has
experienced a steady increase in crimes against persons, armed robbery, and political
violence, while trafficking of drugs and small arms is also on the rise.31 There are some
regional variations in terms of crime. For example, abductions are especially common in the
Niger Delta and the southeastern states of Abia, Imo, and Anambra.

Like the other two countries, Nigeria shares the troubling demographic challenges pertaining
to urbanization and a youth bulge. Over the past three decades, many peasants have
abandoned their farms in the rural areas in favor of cities and today about half of the
population of Nigeria live in urban areas. Additionally, Nigeria exhibits restrained ability to
provide adequate economic opportunity for its large youth bulge, failing to materialize its
demographic dividend.32

Nevertheless, Nigeria has also demonstrated strength and resilience by managing two
simultaneous crisis effectively: Ebola and the Boko Haram insurgency for instance. When
Ebola first entered the country, the Government managed to put in place all necessary
controls to keep the disease from spreading. The response of the federal state to the Boko
Haram insurgency, while not as timely or effective, has translated in recent months to the
recovery of the territory controlled by the insurgents forcing them to retreat into remote
areas, as well as to the recovery of hundreds of citizens being held captive by the group. While
emergency responses are yet to reach the over 1.6 million citizens forcibly displaced by the

conflict, the new administration has identified the control of the insurgency and the
reconstruction of areas affected by conflict as key priorities. Nigeria has also prioritized
addressing interpersonal violence. It designed a set of national action plans to address
different types of violence, including interpersonal violence, youth violence, sexual violence,
child maltreatment, intimate partner violence as well as elder abuse. In addition, Nigeria
enacted federal laws to regulate civilian access to firearms and instated programs to reduce
civilian firearm possession and use. However, national social and educational policies to
reduce rate of violence are comparatively lagging. For example, currently, incentives
provided for high-risk youth to complete schooling are weak.

The Nigeria study concentrated in the capital city of Edo State, Benin City including urban a
peri-urban areas in that city (Okhoro and Useh). The research team found considerable
differences between lived experiences of security and crime and violence in these
communities. Many of these differences are due to the distinct compositions of the
communities, and the fact that Useh is peri-urban—and at times almost rural—while Okhoro
is urban. In Useh, crime and violence tend to be localized, while in Okhoro, although there are
some areas that are more prone to crime and violence, security concerns are much more
widely distributed geographically. Crimes typically cited in the surveyed communities
included cultism, robbery/theft, and burglary.

2.3 Forms of violence most frequently reported

Despite of the different concepts on crime, violence and criminal violence, during the
interaction with survey correspondents, respondents often reported on acts they considered
violent based on their own cultural frameworks, regardless whether or not these acts were
recognized as crimes or considered as violence. At other times, behaviors that can be
considered both crimes and violent acts, such as child beating are just seen as normal
behaviors socially accepted by individuals and communities. This is particularly the case for
interpersonal violence. For example, some forms of gender based violence like wife-beating
were not considered as violent behavior (or a crime for that matter).

Beyond these nuances, this section elaborates on the most common forms of violence in the
countries part of the study.

Violence against Property, Personal Violence and Other Forms of Violence

Violence with a focus on property, such as burglary and robbery

One of the most common types of crime across the countries surveyed was theft of personal
property. In the three countries respondents often underscored thefts, robberies, and
burglary as serious areas of concern. Different from theft, which is defined as taking others’
property without their consent and without using threats or force, robbery and home
burglary include the use of force and sometimes even weapons. Violence against personal
property with or without the use of threat or forces are potentially a product of high
inequality, weak protection of property, inadequate services regarding citizen security, and
weak institutions. .

According to surveyed respondents in South Sudan, home burglary is the most common type
of crime in the researched communities (with 31% of the respondents in 2013 and 23% in
2014 who said they have been victims of crime), followed closely by theft and physical


                                                                                            14
assault. Other pervasive forms of violence against property in South Sudan, like cattle raiding,
are more concentrated in rural states and are frequently ethnically motivated. Such incidents
tend to increase intra-communal conflict and resulting in higher numbers of murdered and
displaced people (OCHA 2013). In the RoC and Nigeria, surveyed interlocutors echoed petty
theft, armed robbery and thuggery as main areas of concern in the community.

Interpersonal violence, including homicide

Interpersonal violence, such as physical abuse and homicide, can result in severe physical
injuries, death and long lasting psychological consequences. High rate of homicides is an area
of concern in South Sudan, as the country ranks among the most violent countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa, and the homicide rate is significantly higher than the “epidemic thresho ld
rate” of 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants established by WHO.

In Nigeria, kidnapping is a growing concern while murders were also cited as a common
crime. Additionally, Nigeria respondents also cited cultism, which appears to be the most
serious crime occurring in the studied areas. Cultist activities are conducted by gangs of
young men who use juju (black magic) as part of their rituals, which largely involve fighting
with other cultist gangs. The cults operate under mutual defense pacts; if a member of one
cult picks a fight with or threatens a member of another cult, members of both groups are
required to join in fighting in order to defend the honor and physical wellbeing- of the
members involved in the original dispute33. In this country, thuggery was also mentioned as
a common type of crime. This involves intimidation and extortion and it is often used during
election periods to influence electoral outcomes. Nigeria also noted crimes related to sorcery,
including assault. In RoC, research findings also pointed out the use of substance abuse as
characteristic of crime and violence dynamics in urban areas as well as crime related to
sorcery, including murder and physical assault.

Gender Based Violence (GBV)

Defined as “any harmful act that is perpetrated against a person’s will, and that is based on
socially ascribed (gender) differences between males and females,”34 gender-based violence
is a serious concern in all three countries, and requires special attention and policy responses.
Women and girls comprise an extremely vulnerable group, with deep cultural roots that have
a severe negative impact on the health, wellbeing, and social inclusion. Although accurate
data are largely unavailable, females appear to experience high levels of gender-based
violence in all three countries. Focus group interviews revealed that women and girls in South
Sudan consider sexual and gender-based violence to be one of the major problems they face.
Additionally, it is important to note that males can also become victims of gender-based
violence. More research could be beneficial to find out if these challenges are differ in rural
and urban environments, and if victims in urban environments face additional challenges.

defined “as a group of people whose activities are carried out in exclusive locations and unusual
times without being exposed to the uninitiated”. In the Nigerian context these groups have associated
with violent activities as part of the cult activity and operating in universities and education centers.

There are various ways in which violence against women is manifested:

Rape

Sexual violence including rape appears to be a common type of crime in all three countries of
study. In South Sudan, rape statistically accounts for 5% of all of major crimes, despite the
fact that rape is underreported. Similarly, in RoC, focus groups comprised solely of women,
cited rape and domestic violence as primary concerns for women. In one female focus group,
100% of participants stated that they knew someone, who had been raped. Medical staff in
the urban areas in Mindouli confirmed that by far the most common injuries requiring
treatment are those associated with rape; while in Gamboma, medical staff at the local
hospital estimates that three women each month access his clinic for services related to rape.
Rape also tends to be an underreported crime, for multiple reasons, including the associated
stigma and the insensitive and/or ineffective response of formal and informal justice
institutions.

Domestic Violence including Intimate Partner Violence

Across all three countries, domestic violence was a recurring and grave problem – though in
some countries, such as Nigeria and South Sudan, respondents did not consider domestic
violence a criminal offense. Perpetrators of domestic violence identified during the country
studies were predominantly male family members such as male relatives and husbands. In
South Sudan, this is the most common form of violence experienced by married women.
According to existing literature and study, close to 70% of those interviewed knew of a family
member or a neighbor, who had been beaten by their husbands in the previous month; over
40% knew of males who had forced their wives to have sex in the previous month; and 80%
knew of males who had gotten drunk and beat their wives.35 In RoC, women’s focus groups
described beatings, molestation and rape occurring frequently between partners, and male
respondents recognized that it was a serious concern. One NGO director recounted that
women living ‘en concubinage’ disproportionately experience domestic violence. In a
particular troubling reflection of the discriminatory status of women, most Nigerian
respondents interviewed, including women, did not consider domestic violence (wife
beating) to be a criminal offense, despite the fact that Nigeria’s penal code criminalizes it.
Women frequently do not report domestic and sexual violence because they are afraid they
will not be supported by their families and/or social institutions and may even suffer
retaliation.

Early Marriage

Child brides is another serious concern, when examining violence against women. It
compounds structural discrimination and aggravates vulnerability to domestic violence, as
these girls are “disempowered, dependent on their husbands and deprived of their
fundamental rights to health, education and safety.” Based on recent studies, South Sudanese
girls under the age of 15 are forced into marriage, a practice with long cultural history. This

phenomenon is connected to girl’s limited access to secondary education, families’ need to
access money or resources in exchange for marriage, and families’ assumptions that marriage
is a means of “protecting” or “controlling” their daughters. While the other countries did not
focus on early marriage, statistics outside the World Bank confirm that the phenomenon is
present: In Nigeria, 43% of girls are married off before their 18th birthday and 17% are
married before they turn 15, while in RoC, 6% are married before turning 15 and 33% are
married before they turn 18.36

Structural discrimination

Compounding the first impact is the structural discrimination women face in terms of access
to services, education, protection and justice. Thus, frequently, female victims of GBV are
afraid to report the crime because of potential social and family consequences such as societal
shunning in addition to not having safe and accessible confidential services available to them.
This was common in all three countries, and linked to the patriarchal power structures. For
example, married and often pregnant at a young age, young women throughout the RoC are
less likely to complete the final year school examination, the baccalaureat, less likely to enter
tertiary education, as a result, and less likely to find formal employment. The RoC remains a
traditional society, reflected in gender roles. Women are more likely to assume household
responsibilities for family, including child rearing, and 33% of women find themselves in
charge of the household, without a husband or partner to rely on as a result of divorce,
polygamy, widowhood, or abandonment. Widows can be treated particularly harshly
throughout the RoC by the family of a dead spouse, sometimes finding herself and her
children ejected from the family home.

The fact that women frequently do not receive justice or institutional support if the crimes
are reported suggest that double and triple victimization is an important issue in all three
countries. This double and, often triple victimization that women experience further inhibits
their ability to live normal, productive lives subsequently.

 Structural Discrimination

 The structural discrimination found in traditional societies can take many forms, and leave
 women particularly exposed to economic hardship and human insecurity. In Republic of Congo,
 where women are more likely to assume household responsibilities for family, 33% of women
 find themselves in charge of the household, without a husband or partner to rely on as a result of
 divorce, polygamy, widowhood, or abandonment. This represents a challenge for equitable
 development and service provision.

2.4 Common risk factors of crime and violence across countries

Nigeria, RoC and South Sudan all share several risk factors correlated with crime and
violence. It is important to note that “Violence is not ‘caused’ by any one factor, but is the
result of the accumulation of a variety of risk factors at different levels, and at different stages
of the life cycle.”37 Risk factors include individual, family, and community or social
environments, and their interactions are often complex. Moreover equally important is the
failing of protective factors or local resilience.38 The study identified the following as main
risk factors for crime and violence:

Inequality

Increasing level of economic inequality is a risk factor for rising levels of crime and violence.
It is important to note that “inequality and deprivation is not limited exclusively to income,
but also lack of access to basic social services, lack of state protection, exposure to systematic
corruption, and inefficiencies that most acutely affect the poor.”39 Data suggest that those
excluded as a result of socioeconomic disparities, particularly young males from ethnically or
racially disadvantaged groups, are frequently involved in serious violent behavior, as victims
and perpetrators. All three countries exhibited a worrying level of inequality. South Sudan’s
GINI coefficient of income inequality stood at 45.3 in 2009 (last available data), which ranks
among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. In RoC, the GINI coefficient for disposable income
declined between 2005 and 2011, and is now equivalent to 40.17, which is above countries
with similar level of income.40 Nigeria’s GINI coefficient ranks at 39.79, but as
aforementioned, the economic inequality is growing worse, and is often regionalized; in
Nigeria: the percentage of Nigerians living in absolute poverty (earning less than a dollar a
day) has increased to 61% over the past decade, compared with 55% in 2004.

Additionally, rapidly urbanizing spaces aggravate inequality and human insecurity. As
aforementioned, Africa’s cities host highly deprived and volatile slums in the world, and the
rights and property of their residence are not sufficiently protected. Poor urban residents
are rarely have access to adequate services to satisfy human security in its broader sense,
while also being more at risk to economic shocks and pollution. Research from across Sub-
Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia point to a strong connection between
“underlying conditions of poverty and inequality” and urban violence.41

     Built Environment – addressing inequalities in urban settings

     Cities increasingly collect more information on resources, infrastructure, environment, and
     services. In a wide variety of settings globally, such information is become available to all
     through either open data strategies or through government institutions. Measuring the built
     environment can be a useful tool to understand the distribution of networks (e.g. road
     networks), services (e.g. police, health and education institutions) and population (i.e. through
     census data). Linking and spatially locating such services will enable researchers, policy makers
     and the community overall to visualize clusters of services or areas that are underserved. Basic
     descriptions such as these may provide baseline arguments for addressing deeper issues such
     as understanding access to services or cost implications for communities with different socio-
     economic levels (for example costs of transport). Furthermore, linkage of infrastructure data
     with different outcomes can further highlight the impact of inequalities on the population as a
     whole. Studies using tools that look at socio-economic level and pedestrian fatalities for example
     have shown that in some cities such fatalities are clustered in certain areas. Using socio economic
     level information on the residence of those fatally injured, analysts demonstrated that most of
     those victims are individuals from middle and lower socio-economic levels. Correlating the built
     environment characteristics with specific outcomes and locating them in time and space is a very
     powerful tool to visualize inequalities and inform corrective strategies.


Institutional weaknesses, especially in the security sector& justices

The inability of state and local institutions to address urbanization challenges and to manage
the legitimate use of force is a major contributing factor to urban violence. In many fragile
states, “systems of law and order, ranging from the police, judiciary, penal systems and other
forms of legal enforcement, are dysfunctional and considered illegitimate by the citizens who
they are intended to serve.” Per consequence, this “capacity gaps in providing basic and
accountable security services is a key determinant shaping urban violence.”42 The World
Bank’s 2011 World Development Report underlines the importance of prioritizing
institutional transformation of government entities charged with providing security, justice
as well as jobs as “central to effectively linking security and development approaches.”43
Weak institutions, often compounded by low levels of legitimacy, and low government will,
“feed wider alienation and mistrust of the police and government agencies,” thus contributing
to fragility.44

Governance is a major challenge across all three countries surveyed. The weakness of
institutions at the forefront to the state’s response to crime and violence is of particular
concern. This includes the lagging capacity in the municipal government as well as the
security sector, which includes the police, military, prison complex and justice sector.
Security and justice institutions provide the foundations for resilient societies and for
providing sustainable, equitable access to justice. These are the institutions at the heart of the
social contract with the state, which are crucial to economic growth. Corruption and
ineffective performance negatively impact human security, economic growth and equity in a
country.

The South Sudan study provides a detailed analysis of the weaknesses of the country’s justice
sector, including the judiciary, the penal system, and the police. A young country, still conflict-
affected, South Sudan has suffered from limited capacity to deliver services to citizens. One
manifestation of this is that the limited ability of the police force to control crime and violence
contributes to higher levels of crime and violence. In addition to a relative low police to citizen
ratio, the majority of South Sudanese police force is functionally illiterate. Consequentially,
many of SSNPS staff cannot fulfill basic safety and security duties. Capacity of the police
remains low. In RoC, which enjoyed stability since the 2000s, the security sector is
comparatively more developed. This was reflected in increased trust in the institutions
among surveyed participants: Focus group participants often cited the security sector,
particularly the police, as the most effective mechanism to prevent and deal with crime and
violence. Recognizing both its shortcomings, and the importance of security institutions that
are accountable, the RoC government ensures that personnel of the army, police and
gendarmerie are subject to human rights and international humanitarian law training
modules. In Nigeria, however, the Nigeria Police is perceived to exercise excessive force.
Additionally, corruption further undermines the police. These perceived inefficiencies and
corrupt acts of the police lowered citizens’ trust in the police: some Nigerian respondents
stressed that they trusted traditional institutions over the police; others turned to vigilante
groups and private security forces for help.

The justice system is the next structural component of the criminal justice system. In Nigeria,
political interference, corruption, and a lack of funding, equipment and training negatively
hamper judicial efficiency and service provision. Even though the Nigerian state has
improved criminal justice delivery in recent years; problems such as long wait times for trials,
political interference with judicial appointments and judicial decision-making, weak
coordination among the various justice sector institutions continue.45 In South Sudan as well,
the justice system suffers from delays in the process, insufficient human resource capacity to
run the system efficiently, and problems of corruption. When institutions are corrupt, the
poor appear to be more affected and their efforts to obtain access and justice through the
formal justice system are often thwarted.

The third structural component of the criminal justice system is the prison/correctional
system, which exhibited major shortcoming in all three countries. Prison systems embody all
of the perceived and actual weaknesses of the police and justice systems. Long wait times in
overcrowded prisons negatively affect the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the
state’s justice system. As the youngest country most recently affected by conflict, South Sudan
had the biggest capacity gap among the three countries: South Sudanese prison system faces
enormous challenges in terms of capacity and infrastructure, which is aged and dilapidated.
In general, there is no electricity and there are inadequate accommodations for inmates. At
present, it is affected by problems ranging from undertrained prison officers, overcrowding,
poor hygiene and sanitary conditions, and inefficient and ineffective correctional services.
South Sudan has a large number of detainees in pre-trial detention, that is, those citizens who
are in jail awaiting trial, and have not yet been convicted on anything. In RoC, prisoners had
much less of a wait time: those arrested spend between 48 and 72 hours in the custody of
security forces before the court process commences. However, prison conditions were cited

as an area of concern, especially for imprisoned youth. Interlocutors maintain that boys as
young as 13 have been imprisoned because juvenile facilities do not exist. Accusations of
excessive use of force in RoC were highlighted as an area of concern, as they may negatively
affect the trust in the social contract between government and its citizens. In Nigeria,
detention conditions in many of the police stations and military facilities are often precarious
including limited medical care medical care, sanitation facilities as well as food and water.

These weaknesses restrict citizens’ trust in their state and their access to justice. By their very
nature, security sector institutions are at the forefront of a local government’s response to
crime and violence. The WDR 2011 recognized the “importance of prioritizing the institutions
that provide citizen security, justice (including control of corruption), and jobs [in order] to
prevent a recurrence of violence and lay the basis for future reform.” When security
institutions fail, vulnerable groups, such as the poor and women, are often victimized again
by the lack to justice. In all three countries, citizens’ access to security institutions was diverse
and non-consistent. In the youngest country, South Sudan, for example, most victims of the
most common crime, burglary, do not seek redress from the state. Instead, the majority
(64%) looked for help from local vigilante groups, followed by the traditional authority
(16%). Such findings point to a lack of citizen confidence in the security institutions. While
communities arrange informal or private solutions to the security crisis, private solutions,
such as private security, vigilante groups and traditional authorities, present their own
challenges. They rarely provide security in an equitable and accountable manner.
Underperforming security institutions negatively affect social trust, resilience and economic
activity in a community.

Simultaneously, reform of the security institutions can increase stability, human security and
per consequence, economic growth. Problem oriented policing, that is responsive to
community’s needs and informed by crime data has for example contributed to lowering high
rates of violence.46

Growing Young Population

The World Bank intends to integrate youth at risk of perpetuating crime and violence in their
citizen security and urban planning policy, particularly in post-conflict societies. This comes
from a growing recognition that a disproportionate percent of the youth population is a risk
factor for increased interpersonal violence rates, without an economy to absorb them. Of note
is that, like with any of these risk factors, a young population alone is not necessarily linked
with rising crime and violence, and instead interacts with various other risk factors, such as
trauma, access to weapons, lack of social mobility and access to services. For example,
restrained access to social services, employment and education may stress a household,
negatively affecting on parenting skills, and potentially increasing exposure to violence at
home, which is linked to increased crime rates. However, respondents in all three countries
noted believed there was a link between lack of employment opportunities for their youth,
and crime and violence trends. All three countries exhibit rapid population growth, without
matching economic development: South Sudan is not only a young country; its demographics
indicate that almost 75% of the population is under 30 years old. This is just under twice the

population growth of the region – 2.7% – and 12% higher than the next country. The existing
“youth bulge” is increasing pressure on the already strained resources in South Sudan.
According to the quantitative and qualitative data collected in the South Sudan study, young
males are the largest victims and perpetrators in South Sudan. Simultaneously, 44% of
Nigeria’s population is below the age of 14, while in RoC approximately 41% of the population
is currently under the age of 14. 47

Furthermore, in all three countries, the majority of youth are both underemployed and
undereducated. The large “youth bulge”, compounded by high levels of underemployment
and low levels of educational persistence, correlates with criminal and violent activities. This
further negatively affects the larger social network. For example, youth in RoC causes
significant stresses on society: Young adult men and women remain tethered to the family
home, unable to strike out for themselves as a result of unemployment, and parents are
increasingly providing a financial safety net for their children, and sometimes their
grandchildren, for longer than was the case previously. Without additional resources, the
youth cohort may increasingly engage in delinquent and violent behavior, be lured into more
organized criminal structures, and, in general, engage in collective violence through
participation in non-state armed groups, militias, and gangs.


 Education – Teaching prevention

 Countries had different responses to the challenge of youth. Republic of Congo emphasized civic
 youth education as well as vocational training. Education strategies can be focused in a wide
 variety of ways. The strongest evidence linked to long-term beneficial effects relies on training
 families on practicing healthy parenting skills. In the communities of the world where violence is
 perpetrated frequently, most perpetrators and victims are usually youth. Violent behaviors are
 learnt early on in life. As such, within a more pro-social family and community environment such
 lessons on violence can be prevented. Evidence collected in multiple countries in the world shows
 that educating parents on the promotion of healthy behaviors towards their children is key for
 building resilience and long lasting pro-social behaviors. As a complement to these, working with
 youth in high-risk settings with a history of violent behaviors and teaching them alternative ways
 to interpret potential threats or situations can contribute to interrupt violent events. There is some
 evidence that introducing curricula that addresses conflict-resolution strategies can be useful in
 reducing aggressive behaviors. Education strategies are important but need to be complemented
 with a wider variety of efforts addressing community-wide needs and focused on youth.

Conflict Legacy

Another important risk factor is the legacy of conflict, and its potential nefarious effects on
crime and violence trends: “Legacies of armed conflict, political authoritarianism and
repressive policing are also all routinely associated with the onset and persistence of urban
violence.”48 Conflict has destructive effects on social norms and institutions regulating
violence. Additionally, research on traumatized population and violence trends is just
starting, but findings indicate that long-lasting psychological scars are associated with

increased violence: Traumatized children, for example, have a higher disposition to violent
behavior in adulthood.49

In the case of the three countries surveyed, all three had a history of violent conflict, but were
at different stages of post-conflict state building. The most recently affected is South Sudan:
Its historic war of independence and ongoing recent civil conflict are a risk factor for
increased rates of crime and violence for multiple reasons. For one, South Sudan’s population
has a high access to small arms and the knowledge of how to use them, contributing to the
increasing rate of violence. Another important issue contributing to crime and violence in
South Sudan is the high number of ex-combatants returning to civilian life in the society. In
the case of South Sudan, the more than 34,000 combatants who returned to civilian life are
struggling to integrate into local communities, despite DDR efforts.

Simultaneously, RoC was selected for this study because the country has made considerable
gains in peace and stability since its conflict, and preventing recourse amongst vulnerable
groups to crime and violence. Still, the report emphasized a lag in institutional capacity and
infrastructure in areas that were particularly affected by the conflict. However, it should not
be neglected that RoC also made impressive progress: Regarding its disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) efforts, RoC’s Reinsertion Commission for Ex-
Combatants reports that ex-combatants are now well integrated into society and that their
needs, such as unemployment, low education, mirror those of their counterparts, who did not
engage in armed conflict. The Commission continues to maintain informal operations to with
rebel leadership to ensure that ex-combatants remain outside the fray of potential conflict,
but this mechanism is largely focused with maintaining a post-conflict peace.

Nigeria has been officially out of conflict since the end of the Biafra war over four decades
ago. However, the country also faces serious challenges on instability: Nigeria is a host to
multiple organized and informal armed groups, with Boko Haram being the most lethal and
destabilizing. Due to Boko Haram violence Nigeria ranked fourth on the Global Terrorism
Index in 2014, and experienced the three of the most lethal terrorist attacks of the previous
year. 50

2.5 Mapping local response systems to Crime and Violence

While risk factors were similar across the countries, responses to the challenges were highly
diverse across the countries and within them. Often, a community’s response to crime
depends on the presence of the state, strength of traditional institutions, and in the face of
relative lack of either, communities turned to vigilante groups or private security- both of
which do not provide equitable access to justice. For example, the survey research in South
Sudan found that even though citizens view the police as the main institution to deal with
problems of insecurity, they don’t always rely on the police to deal with crime, especially
when rapid police response was inaccessible. The most common crime in South Sudan was
burglary, and 41% of the surveyed victims of housebreaking and burglary sought help from
groups other than the police; 64% of those, who reported the crime did so to local vigilante
groups followed by the traditional authority (16%).

The identity of the victim and the nature of the crime will impact, what avenues of redress, if
any, the victim may seek. A woman subject to rape may not even report her crime to any of
the institutions available, due to fear of further stigmatization and discrimination. For
example, in RoC, medical information on rape were more informative, suggesting that many
women did not report the crime, but did seek assistance from other sectors.

Thus, for policy makers and development experts designing a response to crime and violence,
it is important to note that a community’s response varies and is highly localized and context
dependent. Access to justice will depend on the victim’s gender, age, and socio-economic
status; as well as each community’s institutional arrangements. As such, these responses
differ within a city, within the country and between the countries. These localized coping
mechanisms reinforce that any successful response to the challenges must be informed by
the local context, and draw on local strengths in addition to addressing local gaps.

 Local Coping Mechanisms

 Nigeria exemplified the diversity of local coping structures within close geographic proximity:
 While Useh is organized largely around traditional structures, which dictates customs for
 transmitting information in the community; in Okhoro, strong overarching community structures
 do not exist. In Useh, information flows are concentrated through community networks that run
 up to the traditional leaders. Useh is peri-urban, not quite urban, and not quite rural. This transient
 nature and the relative homogenous population lent the traditional authorities enough authority
 to mediate conflict, as police access remained weak.



Traditional authorities

In many African countries, traditional authorities, or modernized versions thereof, play an
important role in keeping the peace in localities. As such, victims of crime often turned to
them. In Nigeria, the research team found different degrees of traditional governance, and by
consequence, responses to crime and violence. Many of these differences are due to the
distinct compositions of the communities. For example, Useh is organized largely around
traditional structures, which take a primary role in responding to crime and violence. Useh is
a peri-urban community in northwestern Benin City. While Useh is under the legal authority
of Egor Local Government Area, in daily management and administration, traditional rulers
are far more important. The community will take criminal concerns to the traditional leaders,
the Enogie (who is appointed by the Oba of Benin, the traditional king of the Benin Kingdom)
or the Odionweres (street elders). It is then the traditional leaders, who decide, of which
crimes to inform the police. When violence is perceived to be criminal (e.g. murder), the
Enogie and Odionweres typically refer the cases to the police immediately. Cases that are
perceived to be civil in nature (e.g. disputes, fights, theft) are not typically referred to the
police, but are instead handled by the traditional leaders.

Traditional authorities often hold significant legitimacy and are important institutions
responding to the challenges of violence. However, not all groups may be well served by them.
As customary law is often “developed in an era dominated by patriarchy, some of its norms




                                                                                                       24
conflict with human rights norms guaranteeing equality between men and women.” 51
Women, children and migrant groups may experience discrimination, and thus experience
double and even triple victimization.

Private sector response

A common response to rising crime and violence and the lack of a government response is
the rise of a private security sector. South Sudan exemplifies this: There has been rapid
growth of private security firms in recent years, mainly as a consequence of the limited
capacity of state institutions like the SSNPS. However, private security is not an equitable
solution to the challenges of crime and violence as such services are only available to citizens,
who can afford it. Although private security organizations are somewhat effective in
deterring crime in certain areas, it does not “solve” the crime problem; it simply pushes crime
to other geographic areas. With such a private industry, questions of accountability,
transparency and the respect for human rights are often a concern.

In Nigeria, researchers also found a more creative private sector response: In Benin City, the
research team identified three separate community call-in phone lines that could be used to
report crime into the system: the CrimeWatch phone-in line, the Benin City police’s
community line, and the DICT’s proposed call-in line. Such creative ways of leveraging
technology and the private sector can be a good entryway for working within the community
to address the problem of crime and violence.

Vigilante groups

Another common community response to the limited capacity of the police force, especially
for those who cannot afford private security companies, is neighborhood watch groups or
vigilante groups. These were present in many of the localities studied. In South Sudan,
qualitative research found that vigilante groups play an important role in community
responses to crime and violence. As aforementioned, housebreaking and burglary, which is
the most prevalent crime in South Sudan according to official statistics, is also the crime for
which victims seek the most help from vigilante groups. In Nigeria, researchers found several
vigilante groups present. There, access to vigilante groups is dependent upon payment; only
those streets, or groups of streets, that are able to pool financial resources to pay for vigilante
protection can access the services. Communities also reported that vigilantes groups are also
involved in criminal activities such as extortion, robberies and harassment.

Vigilante groups are rarely trained in human rights. The question of accountability is a further
concern. It is questionable whether vigilante groups provide equitable access to justice for
minorities such as women, juveniles and migrants.

Police

Of note is that in some localities, strong overarching community structures do not exist. This
was the case in Okhoro, Nigeria. As a result, crimes are generally brought directly to the
police, instead of communicated up the chain through the traditional authorities. Field

                                                                                               25
researchers described a noticeable lack of trust within Okhoro’s urban context, describing a
situation where “everybody is a criminal.” On Okhoro, participants perceived police
responsiveness generally to be good along the tarred main roads, where police are able to
respond in a matter of minutes. However, police response is poor along peripheral, un-tarred
roads, through which criminals are able to escape.

Civil society responses

Another community-based response is civil society organizations and NGOs working on some
aspects of crime and violence, though most often from a prevention perspective. For example,
researchers found preventative NGO activities regarding crime and violence in Brazzaville;
these included engaging disadvantaged children and young adults and vulnerable women
groups (such as sex workers for example). In RoC, NGOs were instrumental in establishing
the National Network of Associations in the Fight against Sex-Specific Violence, which
provides legal assistance as well as psychological and medical support.

While the challenges or rapid urbanization and weak institutions may be overarching, every
community has a different resilience and governance profile. The diversity of response
mechanisms points to the importance of accounting for the local context. In some areas, such
as Useh, Nigeria, where un-tarred roads hamper police response, better urban infrastructure
may be an important entry points. In areas, with strong traditional governance structures,
community engagement and cooperation with the state to allow for training of both the
community police and traditional leaders may be better suited. Development intervention
must take the local context into account in order to build strong communities, resilience and
equitable access to justice.

 Access to Responses

 A community’s response to crime depends on the presence and access to state institutions, or
 strength of traditional institutions, and in the face of relative lack of either, communities turn to
 vigilante groups or private security. Access to any of these responses often depends on the gender,
 age and socio-economic status of the victims. The combination of any of these services differs from
 neighborhood to neighborhood, to city to city, to country to country


The graphic below visualizes the different responses to crime and violence that were found
within countries, cities and between the countries:




                                                                                                     26
These localized coping mechanisms reinforce that any successful response to the challenges
must be informed by the local context, and draw on local strengths.

2.6 Beyond the security sector: mapping the government response

Often, governments address crime and violence from various angles, both nationally and
internationally. Of course, security services are key. Additionally, national strategies to tackle
urban violence can focus on prevention through education, or through a focus on reducing
contributing factors, such as access to weapons, alcohol, or insecure spaces. Urban planning
can integrate crime and violence data, and respond to local challenges, for example.

RoC, as an example, relies on a strategy of promoting civic and moral values, spearheaded by
the High Commission for Civic Instruction and Moral Education; and combatting violence
against women, spearheaded by the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the
Integration of Women in Development, in coordination with the Ministry of Health. At the
local level, RoC created citizens clubs based upon the tradition of mbongui, which now
constitute an inter-generational space, where older members of the community can instruct
and guide their more youthful counterparts towards strategies for harmonious co-existence
through dialogue and debate.

However, all three country reports identified a lack of coordination, both among government
agencies and stakeholders in charge of addressing and preventing crime and violence, as well
as between the Government and civil society. Given the complexity and multidimensionality


                                                                                              27
of crime and violence, the design of policies and programs will benefit tremendously from
comprehensive multispectral and multi-actor approaches, which involve coordination.

Such coordination can be encouraged through capacity building, as well as projects, which
involve multi-sectorial approaches. These could include infrastructure projects, urban
upgrading projects, and situational crime prevention activities. Coordination requires an
invitation to have a dialogue around a common narrative regarding crime and violence.


     Community Mobilization and Networks – Examples from Central America

     In countries with few data resources, community mobilization strategies can be an excellent tool
     to generate reliable information while involving the community directly in planning and setting
     municipal agendas aimed at solving problems related to crime, violence or many other outcomes.
     Through a World Bank funded project called Safer Municipalities, communities in three high
     violence urban settings in Honduras were contacted and involved in understanding crime location,
     crime dynamics and social vulnerabilities at the neighborhood level. Joint efforts with municipal
     authorities contributed to identifying types of crimes by location in neighborhoods as well as
     community resources and infrastructure. Further involvement with communities included
     capacity building efforts aimed at creating youth violence prevention plans emanating from the
     community and with the purpose of informing city government agendas. Community mobilization
     and involvement in a setting where few data sources existed allowed for the creation of more
     reliable diagnostics of the magnitude, distribution and dynamics of crime and violence.
     Furthermore, including the community in the design and proposal of youth violence prevention
     plans enhanced community involvement, awareness, and ownership of the programs. It also
     contributed to understand challenges that hamper prevention and control efforts. In settings
     where data are not easily available, engaging with the community can provide useful quantitative
     and qualitative information that can inform prevention and control strategies.


Chapter 3: Possible areas for World Bank Support
Institutional Capacity Building

The three country studies identified serious shortcomings in the capacity of institutions that
have the mandate of addressing crime and violence, and implement strategies for crime and
violence prevention. Capacities of municipal and local institutions were also weak. The
appearance of illegal non-state actors in the form of vigilante groups or other forms of non-
state agencies, which were observed in all three countries, speak to the societal distrust or
disillusionment regarding the state’s ability to address crime and violence. This is especially
troubling, as WDR 2011 established that “coordination across justice agencies is critical to
reduce impunity, and that effective linkages must exist between the police and other justice
institutions, including the judiciary, public prosecutors, and prisons, to address crime and
violence.”52 The WDR further suggests that consolidation of and coordination among security
services is a fundamental ﬁrst step in institutional reforms to prevent violence.

 Honduras Safer Municipalities Project - (P130819)

 Honduras is the country with the highest homicide rate in the world (UNODC 2012). Between
 2005 and 2012, the country’s homicide rate more than doubled from 37 to 90.4 homicides per
 100,000 inhabitants, imposing significant social, economic, and governance costs (economic
 costs are calculated at about ten percent of GDP). Although drug trafficking is the main factor
 fuelling the increasing levels of violence in Honduras, a combination of socio-economic and
 governance conditions have enabled, exacerbated, and amplified its impact. Within this context,
 the World Bank supported the Government of Honduras on the design and implementation of the
 project Safer Municipalities which aims to improve the capacity of national and local authorities
 in violence prevention; address risk factors of crime and violence in selected municipalities, and;
 (iii) improve its capacity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency.This
 initiative, the first stand-alone citizen security SIL in the Bank, is implemented in the
 municipalities of Choloma, La Ceiba, and El Progreso which have been affected by high
 concentrations of crime and violence.

 Up to date, the project has achieved the following implementation milestones: i) Municipal citizen
 security plans have been certified by the Ministry of Security for 10 major cities (including La
 Ceiba, Choloma and Progreso, municipalities where the SMP is being implemented), with high
 crime rates above 80 per 100,000. By the same token; ii) Crime and violence interventions and
 communities have been selected and agreed with municipal authorities and councils in all three
 participating municipalities; iii) A methodology for preparing community development plans has
 been defined and socialized with the communities, members of municipal security councils, and
 municipal officials; iv) 10 subprojects in all nine selected communities have been developed and
 their implementation started in December 2014; v) Key partnerships have been established with
 other donors and key actors to push forward the prevention agenda (e.g. Ministry of Education,
 National Pedagogical University, UNDP and USAID).


The police force is a critical component of this process. They are the first point of contact with
the criminal justice system for citizens, and they are the visible presence of government
policy. Strengthening their capacity and their respect for civil rights is important for any
successful crime and violence prevention strategy. Such a process benefits from the
engagement of civil society.

Additionally, local government is often at the forefront in the struggle against crime and
violence. Municipal government officials are closest to the problems and concerns of citizens
and are more attuned to their perceptions of insecurity. Municipal governments can assemble
a wider range of actors, such as police, communities, civil society organizations, and others,
to analyze, discuss, and design a mixed range of programs and interventions. Local
governance projects can provide an entry point for specific crime and violence prevention
activities with the participation of multiple sectors and actors.

Better coordination inter-governmentally and with civil society actors

Weak institutions and limited government reach often translate into lack of coordination
between government agencies as well as with civil society. However the multiple and
interlinked risk factors of crime and violence necessitate integrated, holistic efforts. Such
coordination can be encouraged through capacity building, as well as projects, which involve
multi-sectorial approaches. These could include infrastructure projects, urban upgrading
projects, and situational crime prevention activities. Coordination requires an invitation to
have a dialogue around a common narrative regarding crime and violence. Ministerial

perceptions on the scope of crime and violence may differ depending on their approach to
the issue. A common narrative can facilitate prioritization and cross-agency cooperation.

Civil society can play a crucial way in addressing crime and violence especially in prevention
as well as support services to victims.

Addressing gender based violence

Gender is often underestimated in policy design, and all three countries face an important
challenge when it comes to combating gender related crime and violence. Challenges remain
on gender disaggregated data collection on crime and violence as well as with access to justice
for women. Disaggregated data for gender is a complex matter, due in part to the low report
rates for GBV; thus, at times, the cost of investing into better data collection has to be weighed
against the cost of addressing prevention and service provision policies. In the context of GBV,
it is important to note that it is unclear to what extent these challenges differ in the urban
context vis-à-vis the rural context, as all of these crimes occur in rural contexts as well. More
research is needed to better understand how GBV differs in cities, and whether the changing
social dynamics of urban areas, and the potential longer commutes affect GBV.

However, cities can be important hubs for service provision for large population, including
women. Service provision includes a sensitive police response, access to the legal system and
prevention of secondary or tertiary victimization in this process, and policies, which shield
women from stigmatization. In addition to ensuring that the legal system provides equitable
and fair justice to victims of gender violence, a focus on gender will strengthen the diagnostics
of the problem and, as a result, improve targeting and better monitoring and evaluation of
interventions. Policies focused on prevention could include educational promotion of
behavior change. Gender policies ought to take into account gender dynamics, including the
question of masculinity. Additionally, policies to mainstream GBV awareness in the justice
system are important to prevent secondary and tertiary discrimination. Civil society
engagement can be key here: engaging women organizations can ensure that women’s
concerns are integrated in institutional reform. It also can slowly build trust between women
and the security institutions. Civil society in the RoC were key in advocating for policies on
GBV as well as in providing a network that helped victims to navigate the existing justice
system, for example.

 Responses by Civil Society
 The Republic of Congo exemplifies, how a country can draw on civil society in addressing pressing
 matters of Crime and Violence: The Ministry for the Promotion of Women stressed its engagement
 with NGOs in the fight against violence against women, and several NGOs were instrumental in
 establishing the National Network of Associations in the Fight against Sex-Specific Violence. The
 network is particularly active in providing legal assistance to victims as they navigate the legal
 process, in addition to providing psychological and medical support.


In short, with regards as GBV, there are clear opportunities and needs not only to mainstream
gender aspects in urban projects but also to implement standalone projects that specifically
address GBV, particularly prevention of GBV through promotion of behavioral change and
provision of services to survivors. The matrix below details examples of both challenges and
opportunities to address GBV in urban context. There are still many more options to be

Improvement of crime and violence data collection and management
information systems

Lack of reliable data on crime and violence limits effective policy action and response. To
some extent, all three country studies identified the lack of data and reliable information on
crime and violence as one of the main limitations for effective policy action and intervention
in this area. Crime data collection was weak; dissemination across government agencies rare
and policy responses were not grounded in data. Access to data helps policy makers design
better policies and programs and, more important, to make evidence based decisions which
will improve targeting and increase the impact of the interventions.

Limited data collection on crime and violence undermines the promotion of data driven
policies and programs to address crime and violence. In the case of RoC and Nigeria, it was
unclear to what extent the police and the governments were able to collect the data necessary
for informed policy. Nigeria had some localized crime call-in lines, and crime watch television
programs, which collect and disseminate data. These initiatives could be potential entry
points for training in data collection and support in governmental coordination. Existing
systems could be extended with a combination of trained helpdesk staff, digitization of
historical data, new input mechanisms, and new output displays (e.g. maps and
visualizations).

There is also room for multi-sectorial coordination with regards to data. Integrated policies
designed to tackle crime and violence can be greatly informed by data obtained from sectors
other than the police and the criminal justice system.

 Information and Institutional Coordination – The case of the observatories of crime in Latin
 America

 Data collection gathered in a systematic, reliable, and timely manner is essential for properly
 designing policies, programs and interventions aimed at preventing crime and violence.
 Experiences at the municipal level in Latin America have shown that to have such reliable and
 timely information, institutional coordination is essential. The first such approach from Cali,
 Colombia, included mainstreaming violence prevention as a central municipal level policy. The
 objectives of the program included the strengthening of democratic institutions, community
 empowerment, priority needs assessment, and a communication strategy for promotion of
 peaceful conflict resolution. A key structure to monitor progress on these objectives was the
 creation of an information system that integrated data collected by several institutions. The main
 data collection efforts were focused on a reliable and timely measurement of homicide
 occurrences within the entire municipality. To do this institutional coordination was essential.
 Data were collected on a daily basis and reviewed weekly by a committee that included
 representatives from the police department, the public health service, the district attorney's office,
 the ombudsman's office, the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, and the
 department of transportation, under the coordination of an a unit assigned by the mayor's office.
 The different sources of information allowed for identification of duplicate data, missing data and
 improved overall quality. These data in turn were used by all the involved institutions to
 implement control or prevention programs. This same information contributed to evaluate
 policies such as the effect of alcohol restrictions and its influence in homicide as well as the effect
 of restrictions in the carrying of firearms and its association with homicide. The model has since
 been replicated in a variety of municipalities in more than 20 countries in Latin America and has
 provided useful information for evaluating policies, programs and interventions. Furthermore,
 data dissemination to the general public has improved accountability mechanisms. As the
 population can follow the changes in crime, municipal governments need to become more
 responsive to those trends. These models can be useful in many contexts independent of the size
 of municipalities and geographic location.


All three countries share increasingly young populations with relatively low educations, and
an economy struggling to absorb the growing youth bulge. Youth are involved in crime and
violence both as victims and perpetrators. According to WHO’s estimates, they suffer one of
the highest homicide rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, evidence gathered in South Sudan
showed youths, and especially young man, are both the largest victim group and the main
perpetrators of crime and violence. If not addressed, the compounding factors such as low
levels of education, high levels of unemployment, and lack of opportunities for social and
recreational activities, will increase the risk of higher levels of crime and violence. All three
countries would benefit from well-conceptualized and administered vocational training
programs. There is room to build upon existing vocational and technical training for young
men and women.

Mainstreaming Crime and Violence Prevention into Urban Upgrading

There is a strong link between urban infrastructure, public services, and crime and violence
trends. Specifically, lights at night, access to roads, location and distribution of transport
networks play an important role in terms of the reduction of victimization rate and effective
police response. For example, the Nigeria study showed a link between urban design and
crime. Interviewees linked poor quality of the roads to slow police responses and higher


                                                                                                       33
crime rates. Respondents further underscored other factors such as lack of streetlights,
security cameras and prevalence of dense brush in some areas. Surveyed participants noted
that development projects frequently increase public safety, clearing brush (often a by-
product of development projects) and increasing the density of the built environment have
positive effects. A conscious evaluation of how urban upgrading affects citizen security can
lower crime and violence. These can include conscious installation of street lightning, an
emphasis on safe walking corridors and urban infrastructure that allows easy surveillance of
pedestrian access areas. Further, holistic urban planning strategies including territorial
organization and use of land are also key to crime and violence reduction. In the case of South
Sudan, residents in areas where there is no territorial planning tended to be more exposed to
crime and violence, and empirical evidence has shown that commercial and residential mixed
areas are associated with less crime and violence compared to areas that are exclusively
residential or commercial.

 Behavioral impact – The case of mass transport settings

 In urban settings, understanding the impact of services and infrastructure in relation to
 perceptions is very important. Evidence from Mexico and Colombia for example shows that in
 context or spaces where personal safety is perceived as a major issue, behaviors will change
 despite other environmental conditions set up for promoting citizens’ wellbeing. For example
 urban structures designed for promoting pedestrian safety (e.g. a pedestrian bridge) or
 controlling speed (e.g. traffic calming devices for motor vehicles) while useful for these purposes,
 can be rendered useless if citizens perceive them as places where their personal safety is
 compromised. Individuals will not cross a pedestrian bridge if they perceived they will be mugged
 there. Instead they will opt for crossing throughways exposing themselves to higher risks of injury
 because of their perceived (real or not) risk to their personal safety. In other cases individuals
 report that in neighborhoods that are unsafe, introducing traffic calming devices (designed for
 improving street safety by reducing motor vehicle speeds), can increase the risk of carjackings.
 For planning and prevention purposes, it is thus key to understand contexts beyond their primary
 objective. As such, when planning and developing transport infrastructures not only transport
 safety but also personal safety need to be well understood so that such investments get the use
 they are intended to provide for the population. This contextual information and understanding
 of behaviors is key for the proper implementation and effectiveness of interventions.

Conclusions

Incidents of crime and violence are prevalent in South Sudan, Nigeria and RoC. While the
respondents of the three studies and the cases studies of the three particular countries are
not fully representative of the crime and violence trend in urban Africa, the research findings
have reflected and showcased the fragile status of African cities. As a continent that hosts
more than a quarter of the 100 fastest-growing cities worldwide, Africa is extremely
susceptible to urban crime and violence and urban fragility due to limited institutional and
infrastructural capacity. Urbanization is inevitable in any developing region and is projected
to continue its high rate of growth in Africa, with importance implication and consequences
on the overall urban development and life of city dwellers. Cities are key ecosystems, in which
interventions can foster socio-economic opportunities, inclusion and social mobility. As such,
and as highlighted by the 2011 World Development Report (WDR), cities are key areas for
intervention in violence prevention efforts. Efforts aimed at understanding the dynamics of
urban crime and violence in African cities, including causes and characteristics, provide entry
points of informing development policy, so as to ensure inclusive, equitable and sustainable
growth. Hence, this comparison of three countries is a step towards fostering an
understanding of the challenges associated with increasing levels of urban crime within the
context of rapid urbanization.

The multi-country analyses identified the subsequent risk factors associated with urban
fragility in all three countries. Of note is that none of these risk factors by themselves led to
increased crime and violence, and instead, each interacts with the other and the wider social
context. Nevertheless, these factors were of note in the three countries surveyed:

    ● An increasing young population, coupled with low education and slow job growth;
    ● Rising inequality both in income and in access to services;
    ● Low institutional capacity to address the challenge of rapid, unmanaged urbanization
      and of increased violence;
    ● A serious presence of gender based violence;
    ● Corrosive legacy of conflict.

Despite the fact that the three countries share these challenges, their weaknesses and
resilience manifest themselves in profoundly local ways. Researchers found different arrays
of governance structures and coping mechanisms in each country, and often in different cities
within the countries. Often, a community’s response to crime depended on the presence of
the state, or strength of traditional institutions, and in the face of relative lack of either,
communities turned to vigilante groups or private security- both of which do not provide
equitable access to justice. Access to any of these responses often depends on the socio-
economic status of the victims, as well as their gender. As such, a community’s response to
crime varies within a state and between the countries. Development strategies must account
for this highly localized context. These should include programs that support bottom-up
state-society relations and community-based programs for violence prevention,
employment, and associated service delivery, and access to local justice and dispute
resolution. Simultaneously, declining productivity in rural areas drives Africa’s rapid
urbanization, pointing to the importance of situating the challenges within the country’s
national context. Addressing crime and violence will require a mixture of state and civil
society, bottom-up and top-down approaches.



                                                                                             36
The WDR 2011 emphasized that countries and sub-national areas with the weakest
institutional legitimacy and governance are the most vulnerable to violence and instability
and the least able to respond to internal and external stresses. It also prioritizes the reform
of institutions that provide citizen security, justice, and jobs as crucial in creating resilience
to repeated cycles of violence, and further highlighted that cities are a crucible within which
so-called new threats – indices of chronic fragility and cyclical violence. Crime and violence
have a negative impact on development, on the quality of life of citizens, and on the
emergence of democratic processes. By incorporating the crime and violence prevention
agenda within the context of rapid urbanization into its operations and initiatives in the
region, the World Bank can play a constructive, supportive role.

The three country studies point to some shared areas where the World Bank can play an
important role in supporting crime and violence prevention:

    ● Improve capacity of the security sector both at the local and national government
        level;
    ●   Improve the government’s ability to collect crime data for informed policy responses;
    ●   Assist the government with intergovernmental coordination regarding crime
        policies;
    ●   Support and improve the physical environment in the communities in order to reduce
        the risks of crime and violence;
    ●   Assist with both formal education and professional livelihood vocational training
        programs to reduce unemployment rate;
    ●   Explore community-based approaches to reduce and prevent crime and violence;
    ●   Assist with addressing gender based violence both with prevention responses and
        access to medical and mental services.
