          with both public and private sector stakeholders and studied international best
          practice models, including the OECD Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls,
          Ethics, and Compliance, in developing the integrity compliance guidelines against
          which the compliance programs of sanctioned parties are evaluated.

          There is an emerging global consensus as to the principles and components required
          for an effective integrity compliance program. The guidance developed by the Bank
          reflects this international consensus. At the same time, the guidance recognizes the
          need for flexibility in applying fundamental principles to the particular circumstances
          of sanctioned parties, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which play a
          major role in World Bank-financed operations in developing countries, and for which
          a full-blown compliance program may be unnecessary or prohibitively expensive.
          Program elements need to be tailored to the party in question, taking into account
          such criteria as its size, business sector, and particularly its risk areas, as well as the
          legal environment(s) in which the party operates.

system may be designed to instill integrity in a procurement
system, deter bad actors, and promote quality performance
by contractors. The panelists emphasized that a successful
suspension and debarment system should provide the right
incentives for contractors to act with integrity and to ensure
proper performance. The panelists also highlighted the
differences between the World Bank’s sanctions system and
other national suspension and debarment systems, noting the
unique nature of the World Bank as a multilateral development
bank and its ability to impose different types of sanctions
beyond debarment, including conditional non-debarment,
reprimands and restitution.

The second panel addressed questions related to the
decision-maker within suspension and debarment systems.
In particular, panelists discussed who the decision-maker is in
various systems around the world and the ideal qualifications
for such a person or entity. Panelists addressed the critical
importance of ensuring the decision-maker’s independence
and the need for transparency in the decision-making process.

2015 COLLOQUIUM

Building on the themes discussed in the previous two
Colloquia, the third Colloquium on Suspension and
Debarment will take place on December 16, 2015 at the
World Bank. Four panels will showcase the broad range
of first principles underlying suspension and debarment
systems and examine the developing trends and potential
harmonization of systems worldwide. Panelists will compare
and contrast the foundational purposes of different systems
and examine how those principles are put into practice around
the globe. As in previous Colloquia, the panelists will examine
the following questions as applied to any given suspension
and debarment system: What are the offenses that are the
bases for sanctions? Why are these offenses sanctionable?
Who makes the sanctions decisions? Who is being protected
by the adjudicative system? When available, proceedings will
be posted online.

Colloquia proceedings are available online:

OSD DASHBOARD                               This “all in one” dashboard with overall OSD caseload management statistics is used by the SDO and shared with senior
                                            managers who need a snapshot of activity in the sanctions system, both on a current basis and in comparison to historical
activity. The dashboard shows, on a quarterly basis, all key case activity since OSD’s inception, including the number of cases and settlements submitted by INT, the number
of suspensions imposed by OSD, and the number of final sanctions imposed by OSD and the Sanctions Board. For each such measure, there is a further breakdown showing
the status of active cases (for example, how many cases are with OSD for review, or how many issued cases are with Respondents pending their decision to appeal).

  DURATION OF CASES THROUGH FINAL SANCTIONS DECISION
 A common question posed to OSD is “how long does a sanctions case take?” This chart shows all sanctions cases (excluding settlements) that have been submitted to OSD
 since its inception. The chart measures the time taken up in the investigative phase and in each phase of the sanctions process through final resolution. It should be noted
 that some cases, particularly those submitted in FY14 and FY15, are still active, and therefore the timelines for these cases are not complete, potentially skewing the overall
 picture to a small degree.

While this data gives a useful overview of the activity in the sanctions system and the typical life cycle of sanctions cases, it
must be noted that many factors can have an impact on the timeline of a particular case, such as the complexity of the matters
involved, stays for unsuccessful settlement negotiations during investigations, the need to obtain legal and procurement policy
advice on case-specific matters, extensions to submission deadlines and additional submissions requested by the parties.

  TYPOLOGY: PERCENTAGE OF CASES/SETTLEMENTS
  RECEIVED BY TYPE OF SANCTIONABLE PRACTICE
  This chart shows what percentage of the cases and settlements received by OSD since its inception involved claims of each type
  of sanctionable practice: fraudulent practice, corrupt practice, collusive practice, obstructive practice and coercive practice. The
  total of the percentages exceeds 100% because a number of cases have involved claims of more than one type of sanctionable
  practice (for example, payment of a bribe (corrupt practice) and the submission of false documents (fraudulent practice)). For a
  further breakdown of the types of fraudulent practice claims, see Typology: Breakdown of Fraudulent Practice Claims.

TYPOLOGY: BREAKDOWN OF
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CLAIMS
This detailed breakdown shows the different types of fraudulent practice claims that have appeared in sanctions cases received from INT. First, a
distinction is made between fraud cases that involve the forgery of third-party documents and those that involve other types of fraud. Then, within
each of these two streams, a further categorization is done to reflect the specific type of forgery or other fraud. For example, within the forgery stream,
common instances are bid securities, performance certificates and manufacturer’s authorizations. Within the other stream, common instances are
misrepresentations of experience, over-invoicing and failure to make required disclosures of conflicts of interest. The totals at the bottom of each
column show how often INT has sent each type of claim to OSD for decision-making.

DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF DURATION OF CASES
This detailed chart shows all sanctions cases (excluding settlements) that have been submitted to OSD since its inception. The chart measures the time taken up in the investigative phase and in each
phase of the sanctions process through final resolution. It should be noted that some cases, particularly those submitted in FY14 and FY15, are still active, and therefore the timelines for these cases
are not complete, potentially skewing the overall picture to a small degree.

*“Pending” means pending as of June 30, 2015.

Notes:
1.	 All data as of June 30, 2015. Includes all submitted cases (SAEs and RTSs), and as such averages may be skewed slightly downward because of cases that are pending in each stage (e.g., as of June 30, 2015, Case No. 359 had been
    with OSD for initial review for 7 days, but the initial review remained pending, such that the final number of days for this stage can be expected to be greater than the 7 currently shown as of June 30, 2015).
2.	 In cases with multiple respondents, the date given for (i) delivery of Notice, (ii) receipt of Response, (iii) date of extension and/or (iv) uncontested determination is the latest applicable date (e.g., if the Notice is delivered on three different
    dates to the three respondents in a case, the latest date is used).
3.	 Four cases (Case Nos. 98, 100, 103 and 111) that were initially issued between July and September 2009 were reissued under the new Sanctions Procedures in March 2011 to permit constructive delivery. Since it relates to a delay in
    delivery, the intervening time has been attributed to the respondents, as have delivery delays under the new Sanctions Procedures.
4.	 For uncontested cases for which the Notice was issued to the Respondent on or after September 15, 2010, OSD issued a determination reflecting the imposition of the sanction recommended by the SDO in the Notice. For uncontested
    cases for which the Notice was issued prior to such date, the Sanctions Board issued a determination imposing the SDO’s recommended sanction.

  ANNEX B
  DETAILED TYPOLOGY WITH BREAKDOWN
  OF FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CLAIMS
  This detailed case-by-case breakdown shows the different types of fraudulent practice claims that have appeared in sanctions cases received from
  INT. First, a distinction is made between fraud cases that involve the forgery of third party documents and those that involve other types of fraud.
  Then, within each of these two streams, a further categorization is done to reflect the specific type of forgery or other fraud. For example, within the
  forgery stream, common instances are bid securities, performance certificates and manufacturer’s authorizations. Within the other stream, common
  instances are misrepresentations of experience, over-invoicing and failure to make required disclosures of conflicts of interest. The totals at the bottom
  of each column show how often INT has sent each such type of claim to OSD for decision-making.
