Part I:

Recent Economic and Policy Developments
The Philippine economy grew 6.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2016, exceeding
China’s growth rate of 6.7 percent. Strong domestic demand drove overall growth, supported by an
increase in public spending in the run-up to the recent elections. Public spending rose by more than
10 percent during the first half of 2016, as the government continued to implement its ambitious
investment program. Services and industry remained the primary engines of growth, while the
lingering effects of El Niño further diminished agricultural output. Meanwhile, anemic external
demand continued to inhibit the performance of the export sector.

         Box 1	 Mandatory lending targets

          Philippine law sets mandatory targets for lending to the agricultural sector and to micro, small and
          medium enterprises (MSMEs), with the objective of improving access to finance in these underserved
          sectors. Republic Act 10000, known as the Agri-Agra Law,11 requires that all banks allocate 25 percent
          of their total loanable funds to borrowers in the agriculture and fisheries sector, and at least 10
          percent of loanable funds must be devoted to beneficiaries of agrarian reform programs. Republic
          Act 9501, the so-called “Magna Carta for MSMEs,”12 requires that all banks allocate at least 8 percent
          of their loan portfolio to micro and small enterprises and at least 2 percent to medium enterprises.

          An analysis of bank compliance with mandatory lending targets reveals that the banking system as
          a whole has struggled to expand lending to MSMEs and the agricultural sector. Over the past five
          years lending to micro and small enterprises grew by an average of 3 percent per year, and lending
          to medium enterprises grew by 13 percent, while lending to agriculture declined. At the same time,
          the total lending portfolio expanded at an average rate of 25 percent annually. Despite the lending
          targets, the pace of credit growth in priority sectors was significantly lower than that of the overall
          lending portfolio. The Philippine experience with lending targets is not unique, and the international
          evidence reveals that similar targets are frequently ineffective.

          Lending to the agricultural sector and MSMEs, especially micro and small firms, is inherently risky
          and requires a specialized approach to product development and risk management. Mandating that
          all lenders allocate a given share of their total loans to targeted firms and sectors does not necessarily
          create incentives for new specialized lenders to enter the market or for banks that already lend to
          targeted borrowers to expand their operations. The authorities could better leverage specialization
          by allowing lenders that focus on MSMEs or the agricultural sector to “trade” their excess loans to
          more traditional lenders.
                                                                                               Figure 7: Lending to the agricultural sector

6        PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2016
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments


  Market dynamics are further undermining banks’ ability to meet agricultural lending targets. The
  declining share of agricultural lending across the financial system at least partially reflects decreasing
  demand due to the sector’s low growth rate. Accelerating growth in agriculture and among MSMEs
  will require addressing structural obstacles as well as financial constraints. When well designed and
  properly managed, alternative risk-mitigation instruments such as guarantees and insurance have
  proven effective. While the Philippines has a number of institutions dedicated to providing such
  guarantees and insurance products for MSMEs and agricultural producers, they will not be able
  to fulfill their potential unless all elements of the financial system—including credit information,
  collateral registration, contract enforcement, equity financing and risk-mitigation mechanisms—can
  be more fully developed.

          Box 2	 The poor performance of global merchandise trade and the resilience of service exports

           Low international commodity prices, China’s shift towards a slower but more sustainable growth
           path, and an anemic recovery among advanced economies continue to undermine the growth of
           global merchandise trade. The trade slowdown has reflected a combination of structural and cyclical
           headwinds, with the latter accounting for about two-thirds of the observed deceleration in global
           trade last year.15 Lower commodity prices have resulted in falling real incomes and sharp currency
           depreciations among commodity exporters, substantially reducing their merchandise imports. This
           import contraction has been particularly pronounced in Brazil and Russia, but a general slowdown
           has been observed across most commodity exporters. Since commodity exporters purchase about
           20 percent of the exports produced by other emerging markets and developing economies, falling
           commodity prices have also had an adverse impact on non-commodity exporters. Meanwhile,
           China’s economic rebalancing has reduced its demand for industrial commodities and intermediate
           goods. Subdued industrial activity and low rates of capital investment in the manufacturing sectors
           in the US and euro zone compounded this trend. Feeble global investment—reflecting mediocre
           growth, deleveraging pressures in advanced economies, and a maturing credit cycle in EMDEs—
           could continue to cap the growth of goods trade throughout 2016.

           The global trade in services appears to be more resilient to low oil prices than the merchandise
           trade, as it is more closely linked to consumer spending and income growth among major oil
           importers. The services trade now accounts for one-fifth of the total global trade volume and half
           of global trade value-addition.16 While barriers to the services trade have fallen globally, important
           obstacles remain in many smaller economies.17 Over time, the share of services in global trade is
           expected to continue to increase, especially IT-BPO and other IT-based sectors.18

10        PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2016
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments


      Despite the resilience of services, global trade growth is expected to remain weak in 2016. Following
      a pattern of repeated and significant downward revisions, global trade forecasts for 2016-17 have
      been lowered once again,19 reflecting evidence of a deteriorating relationship between global trade
      and economic activity. After growing roughly in line with global economic output in 2015, global trade
      growth is expected to marginally outperform global economic growth during the forecast period.
      Over the medium term, maturing supply chains, slowing trade liberalization and persistent weakness
      in global investment are expected to hinder global trade growth. Lingering weaknesses in the global
      merchandise trade diminish the scope for productivity gains through specialization and the diffusion
      of technologies in global value chains.20 This process is expected to cause global trade growth to fall
      back in line with global economic growth. A shift from truly global supply chains to regional ones
      could accelerate this process.21

          Box 3	 The Duterte administration’s inaugural budget

           The proposed 2017 budget reflects the new government’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda. The
           proposed PHP3.35 trillion budget would increase spending by 11.6 percent over the 2016 budget in
           an effort to alleviate binding constraints on the creation of high-quality jobs. The proposed budget
           would increase infrastructure investment to 5.4 percent of GDP in order to address infrastructure
           bottlenecks and enhance connectivity between the country’s wealthier and poorer areas. Agriculture
           and rural development are a major expenditure priority, as the government is striving to modernize
           the agricultural sector and foster inclusive rural development. The budget also calls for boosting
           education and health spending from a combined 4.7 percent of GDP to 5.3 percent. The increased
           education budget would finance the construction of 37,500 new classrooms, the hiring of an
           additional 53,831 teachers and the provision of private-school scholarships to 2.7 million students.

           The Duterte administration’s emphasis on the rule of law is underscored by a large proposed
           expansion in the budget for the police, the military and the justice system. The budget proposal
           includes a 24.6 percent increase in spending on the Philippine National Police and a 15 percent
           increase in spending on the Armed Forces of the Philippines

           In addition to its short-term budgetary priorities, the new government has also outlined its medium-
           term fiscal plan. The most significant departure from the previous administration is the proposed
           increase in the deficit ceiling to 3 percent of GDP, which the administration regards as sustainable in
           the medium term. In a recent budget address President Duterte stated that the higher deficit limit
           will allow the government to continue to increase spending on infrastructure, rural development
           and social services. In parallel with its planned expenditure increases the government has launched
           an initiative to reform the tax system by increasing tax collections, enhancing systemic efficiency
           and promoting fiscal equity. The government expects these measures to boost tax revenue from a
           projected 14.5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 16.1 percent in 2018.

          Box 4	 The challenge of irregular employment
           Irregular employment is increasingly common in the Philippines. According to the most recent Labor
           Force Survey about 25 percent of workers in the formal private sector were employed on an irregular
           basis in 2014, and there is evidence that this share has increased substantially in recent years.27
           While some firms use temporary contracts to hire seasonal or short-term workers, the pervasiveness
           of these contracts reflects a substantial gap in the employment benefits and protections afforded to
           temporary and permanent employees. Temporary contracts allow employers to hire workers without
           providing the benefits that are due to a permanent employee, and to terminate workers without
           incurring the administrative and monetary costs involved in the formal termination process.

           Although temporary contracts, subcontracting and other forms of employment are legal and may
           serve a legitimate purpose in principle, in practice they are frequently abused. For example, some
           firms terminate and then rehire the same worker every five months, a practice known as “5-5-5,”
           in order to circumvent the Labor Code’s provisions on employment security. Similarly, “labor-only
           subcontracting” allows employers to evade the requirements of regular employment contracts,
           including employee benefits and employment protections. In particular, the high cost of terminating
           permanent contracts gives employers a strong incentive to use fixed-term, project-based or seasonal
           contracts, which are much easier and cheaper to terminate.27

           The use of temporary contracts contributes to a bifurcated labor market, in which secure permanent
           jobs exist alongside precarious temporary jobs. In the Philippine labor market, workers doing similar
           jobs often receive very different levels of benefits and job security, which is inefficient from both
           a social and an economic perspective. Temporary workers, whose future employment is highly
           uncertain, are less likely to invest in job-specific skills. For the same reason, employers are also less
           likely to invest in the skills of temporary workers. As a result, pervasive irregular employment tends
           to hinder human capital formation and reduce labor productivity.

           Policymakers can limit the abuse of temporary contracts either by strengthening the enforcement
           of existing regulations or by reforming those regulations to alter employer incentives. While
           tighter enforcement could marginally reduce the frequency of irregular contracts, this strategy
           would be costly and difficult to implement effectively. Indeed, the incidence of irregular employment
           is currently rising in OECD countries despite efforts to curb it.29 Alternatively, policymakers could
           attempt to narrow the cost gap between permanent and temporary contracts. This could be achieved
           through regulatory reforms designed to reduce the costs of permanent contracts, increase the costs
           of temporary contracts, or a combination of both.30

           A more radical approach would be to introduce a single employment contract (SEC) in order to
           eliminate the division between permanent and temporary employment. Under an SEC, all contracts
           are open-ended, but the administrative procedures governing termination are relatively relaxed;
           instead, employment protection is provided via severance pay, the amount of which increases with
           job tenure. Legal recourse is limited to cases of discrimination or violations of worker rights.31 In the
           Philippines an SEC would increase protections for irregular workers, but it would reduce protections
           for regular workers. From the employer’s perspective, an SEC would be more flexible than a regular
           permanent contract, but less flexible and costlier than the current range of temporary contracts. For
           these reasons, introducing an SEC could be an effective means of achieving the government’s goal of
           “crafting a set of rules and regulations that are more holistic in orientation and at the same time more
           easily implementable and enforceable.”32

16        PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2016
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

     Box 5	 Perception-based poverty measures

      The Philippine Statistics Authority has released official poverty estimates from the Family Income
      and Expenditure Survey (FIES) every three years since 1988, and it has produced first-semester
      estimates using the Poverty Indicators Survey each year since 2013. Nevertheless, the timeliness
      of poverty data has long posed a significant challenge to poverty research. Moreover, the official
      estimates have undergone multiple methodological revisions, which limit time-series analysis. In
      this context, alternative estimation measures can help close gaps in the data and provide important
      complementary information on the evolution of poverty trends.

      Surveys that focus on self-rated monetary and food poverty can augment official poverty estimates
      by providing a qualitative perspective that reflects the experience of poor households. Even the
      most well-designed poverty line is ultimately an arbitrary number, and households that endure the
      externalities of economic growth but have limited access to its benefits may experience changes
      in subjective poverty that cannot be captured by official statistics. In the Philippines, the Social
      Weather Station, an international survey firm based in the Netherlands, has released self-rated
      poverty estimates since 1983. Its monetary-poverty estimates have been published quarterly since
      1992, and its food-poverty estimates have been published quarterly since 1998. The frequency of the
      data allows for a detailed qualitative analysis of poverty trends in the Philippines.

      However, perception-based, self-rated poverty measures are subject to their own unique caveats.
      The survey methodology for establishing self-rated poverty is limited and requires additional questions
      to validate its findings. Moreover, poverty is measured subjectively by the survey respondent (i.e. the
      head of household) and may not reflect the perceptions of the household as a whole. Nevertheless,
      the timeliness and frequency of self-rated surveys can provide early indications of emerging poverty
      dynamics and enable a more accurate analysis of long-term trends.

Outlook and Risks
The Philippines’ short-term growth prospects remain positive despite a number of medium-term
risks and policy challenges. The GDP growth rate is projected at 6.4 percent in 2016, and while the
World Bank expects growth to ease slightly to 6.2 percent in 2017 and 2018, this is a conservative
forecast with significant upside risks. Meanwhile, the poverty rate is projected to decline further
as rapid economic growth boosts real household income. The external environment is expected
to gradually improve, but short-term policy uncertainty during the transition to the new political
administration and capacity constraints on the execution of public infrastructure projects are
expected to slow economy-wide growth. Swift action to address either or both of these risks could
accelerate growth over the near term.

      Box 6	 The global economic outlook
      Global growth prospects have weakened over the past six months. The World Bank recently revised
      its global economic growth forecast for 2016 downward from 2.9 percent to 2.3 percent. Emerging
      markets and developing economies are facing stronger headwinds due to anemic growth among
      advanced economies, persistently low commodity prices, and lackluster global trade and capital
      flows. Commodity exporters continue to struggle to adjust to the protracted slump in global prices,
      while commodity importers are showing greater resilience to headwinds. However, low energy prices
      have delivered a surprisingly modest growth windfall. The global growth rate is projected to gradually
      accelerate to 2.9 percent by 2018 as commodity prices stabilize (Table 4).

      Downside risks to the global outlook have intensified. Key sources of risk include deteriorating
      economic conditions among major commodity exporters, a weaker-than-expected recovery among
      advanced economies, rising private-sector debt levels in some large emerging markets, and heightened
      policy and geopolitical uncertainties. While the available policy space for monetary and fiscal stimulus
      is narrow globally, structural reforms could boost growth in both the short and long term.

      In an environment of weak growth, rising risks and limited policy buffers, growth-sustaining structural
      reforms are increasingly urgent. Well-targeted structural reforms could boost aggregate demand,
      reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities and signal to investors that the authorities are committed to
      reinforcing strong fundamentals in support of long-term growth. Greater investment in infrastructure,
      productivity-enhancing technology and human capital could complement and catalyze this process.
      Structural reform and investment policies should aim to close public infrastructure gaps, encourage
      foreign direct investment, build human capital, foster economic diversification and lower barriers to
      trade. While countries with diminishing fiscal space may have a limited ability to finance investments in
      infrastructure and human capital, international cooperation efforts could support expansionary fiscal
      policies in the event that large downside risks materialize, channeling global resources into productive
      infrastructure and strengthening social safety nets in the most fragile economies.

          Box 7	 Moving up the value chain: from BPO to KPO
          Over the past decade and a half, the Philippines has emerged as one of the leaders in the global IT-
          BPO industry. Sectoral revenue has risen exponentially over the past decade, growing at an average
          annual rate of 30 percent between 2000 and 2015 to reach US$22 billion. The IT-BPO industry is also
          among the leading contributors to job creation, and total sectoral employment increased from 138,000
          in 2005 to about 1.03 million in 2014. Growth forecasts are highly optimistic: the IT-BPO industry is
          projected to generate US$25 billion in revenue in 2016, and direct employment is expected to reach
          1.3 million. Moreover, IT-BPO has had sizeable positive spillover effects on other economic sectors.
          The industry’s total direct and indirect contribution to the growth of value-addition in services exports,
          real estate, construction, retail trade and telecommunications is estimated at around 10 percent of
          GDP. The Philippines currently ranks as the world’s top destination for voice support, and it has the
          potential to compete in a range of high-value-added, knowledge-based services in the future.

          However, the country’s IT-BPO industry faces long-term sustainability challenges stemming from
          international competition and technological progress. The Philippines’ IT-BPO industry generates 85
          percent of its revenue from relatively routine cognitive tasks that are highly susceptible to automation.
          Low wages could slow the pace of automation, but are unlikely to halt it. As the global market for
          complex services grows, shifting production toward high-value, non-voice services such as KPO can
          promote the industry’s sustainability.

          There are important lessons to be learned from the experience of similar outsourcing destinations.
          India successfully diversified into high-value-added outsourcing services and is now the global leader
          in KPO, with a 63 percent global revenue share. With a highly skilled talent pool, relatively low-cost
          labor, well-developed IT infrastructure, and an enabling business environment, India was in a strong
          position to take advantage of the rising demand for more sophisticated outsourcing activities. The
          revenue generated by India’s KPO industry shot from just US$260 million in 2001 to an estimated
          US$15.2 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach a staggering US$55.5 billion in 2019.36 While India
          is expected to remain the global leader, Latin American and Asian economies have the potential to
          attract investment in KPO services by leveraging a relatively skilled, low-cost workforce and a generally
          favorable business climate.

          The Philippine government and the private sector recognize the opportunity to expand into KPO
          and other complex IT-BPO services, but a number of constraints are preventing the country from
          moving up the IT-BPO value chain. Foremost among these is the need to further develop the skills of
          the local workforce through improved education and job training.37 In addition, the Philippines must
          continue to address key infrastructure gaps, especially in IT and telecommunications infrastructure,
          foster a more favorable business and investment climate, and forge public-private partnerships
          devoted to providing non-voice service training and skills development. Due to its cross-cutting nature,
          a successful transition to a more diversified and sophisticated IT-BPO industry will require a concerted
          effort involving the private sector, academia and the government.

     43
       	 For instance, in 2013, the BIR announced a campaign to boost tax collection from self-employed professionals such as doctors and lawyers.
         The government estimates that only about 403,000 out of 1.8 million self-employed professionals pay taxes in a given year, and their average
         declared income is close to the minimum wage. The government believes that the successful implementation of these reforms could boost
         tax revenues by as much as 2 percent of GDP.
     44	
         Key transparency and accountability reforms include the passage of the Freedom of Information Bill, enhancing budget preparation and
         reporting, measures to allow the public to track expenditure execution, the timely release of a tax-expenditure statement, limitations
         on the use of lump-sum funds for large budget items, mandatory posting of procurement bids and awards on government websites, and
         strengthening the role of the Audit Commission.
     45
       	 Simplifying tax procedures and processes could help build confidence in the efficiency of the revenue authority. Publishing the net worth
         of top revenue officials on government websites could send a strong signal to the public that the revenue agencies are committed to good
         governance. Strengthening the Audit Commission’s oversight of BIR and BOC activities and ensuring that they adhere to their own audit rules
         could improve the accountability of the tax administration. Implementing Executive Order 38 of 1998, publishing BIR and BOC performance
         indicators on their websites, relaxing bank-secrecy laws in cases involving tax fraud, and requiring all government agencies and selected
         private sector groups (e.g., utilities and professional associations) to share their data with the BIR and BOC could further enhance public
         sector transparency. .

III. Increasing Tax Revenues Efficiently and Equitably

 Box 9	 The Government’s proposed tax reform package
  On September 26th the government submitted the first of six tax reform packages to Congress in
  support of its inclusive growth strategy. The reform program has two overarching objectives: (i) to
  make the country’s tax system the most equitable, efficient and competitive in the region, and (ii)
  to generate sufficient revenue to finance the administration’s 10-point socioeconomic development
  agenda. Each reform package will focus on a different area of tax policy and attempt to balance
  tradeoffs between revenue generation, economic efficiency and fiscal equity. These packages
  are part of a larger reform agenda that encompasses tax administration, good governance and
  budgetary reforms, as well as measures to simplify regulations, promote competition and enhance
  the business environment.

  If approved, the first reform package will be implemented in two phases. The first phase would
  consist of reforms to the personal income tax, the value-added tax (VAT), and oil and vehicle excise
  taxes. The country’s personal income tax brackets would be adjusted to reflect inflation, and its income
  tax rates, which are among the highest in the region, would be reduced. Reducing the coverage of
  VAT exemptions would offset the decline in income tax revenue. Meanwhile, the government would
  restructure the excise tax on personal automobiles and petroleum products, and one-quarter to one-
  third of the net revenue gain would be allocated to social protection programs such as conditional
  cash transfers, targeted electricity subsidies, direct discounts, expanded coverage of the national
  healthcare system (PhilHealth), and targeted subsidies to sectors that are adversely affected by higher
  petroleum prices. During the second phase a set of new surtaxes would be levied on unhealthy or
  socially harmful goods. These include taxes on sweetened drinks, which would be indexed to inflation,
  as well as higher excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products, which would be introduced after the
  current “sin tax” matures.

  The third tax reform package would reduce corporate income taxes while rationalizing fiscal
  incentives. The proposed reforms would lower the corporate income tax rate and simplify its provisions
  to improve compliance. Revenue losses would be offset by the rationalization of fiscal incentives,
  which would become more transparent, targeted, and performance-based, and “sunset provisions”
  would be applied to existing incentives. The current 5 percent gross income tax rate would also be
  replaced by a reduced corporate income tax rate. Finally, VAT zero-rating would be strictly limited to
  direct exports, tax-credit certificates would be abolished, and all VAT refunds would be paid in cash.

  The fourth and fifth reform packages focus on property taxes and capital-gains tax. The proposed
  reforms would attempt to simplify property taxes to support a more competitive real estate market and
  improve the efficiency of land use. Key measures would include reducing the estate and donor’s tax
  rates, as well as the tax rate for land transactions. Revenue losses would be offset by the rationalization
  of property valuation, which would bring property values closer to market prices and require the
  systematic review and revision of property values every three years. The tax rate on interest earned
  on peso-denominated deposits and investments would be cut from 20 percent to 10 percent, and all
  other capital-gains taxes would harmonized with this rate to improve their progressivity.

  A sixth and final reform package would address other tax types, but the specific reforms that would
  be included are still under discussion. The government is currently in the process of finalizing the
  sixth proposed tax-reform package. The current draft proposal includes a tax on high-fat foods, a tax
  on luxury items such as yachts and jewelry, new taxes on gambling, new taxes on mining, and a tax on
  carbon production.

34    PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2016
III. Increasing Tax Revenues Efficiently and Equitably

     Box 10	 The Philippine VAT system
     The Philippine government introduced the VAT in 1988. In 1994 the VAT base was broadened to include
     professional service providers, banks, nonbank financial firms and international shipping companies,
     but the implementation of these reforms way delayed by questions regarding their constitutionality.
     In 1996 the government approved a number of VAT exemptions, including exemptions on imported
     oil and coal, educational services, and the importation, production and sale of books and newspapers.
     In 2005 the authorities expanded the VAT base and increased the VAT rate in an effort to avert a fiscal
     crisis. Under the RVAT Law the tax base was expanded to include electricity, petroleum, and medical and
     legal services, inter alia, and the rate was increased from 10 to 12 percent. The law also imposed a 70
     percent cap on input VAT credit, extended the input VAT claim on capital goods exceeding PHP1 million
     over five years, and imposed a uniform 5 percent final withholding VAT on government purchases.

     Currently, there are three VAT regimes: exempt, zero-rated and taxed at 12 percent. The 12 percent
     rate applies to all goods and services except those that are specifically exempted or zero-rated by
     the tax code. Firms that produce zero-rated products can apply for a VAT refund on their inputs.46 In
     practice, however, these refunds are difficult to obtain, and the government now issues tax credit
     certificates in lieu of refunds. To protect exporters from cash-flow shortages the government extended
     the zero-rating to suppliers, but this has become a major source of revenue leakage. One important and
     unusual feature of the Philippine VAT system is its use of excess input tax credits. These credits cannot
     be directly redeemed for a VAT refund, but instead enable firms to apply for a tax credit certificate
     within two years of the quarter in which they were issued.47

     VAT exemptions are primarily intended to reduce the tax burden on poor households, but the
     system for granting exemptions is vulnerable to abuse. As of 2014 VAT exemptions were applied to
     agricultural and marine products, educational services, sales by cooperatives, the sale or lease of small
     properties, and firms with gross sales of less than PHP1,919,500 per year. Unlike zero-rating, firms that
     produce exempt goods cannot apply for VAT refunds on their inputs.48

  	 In 2012 the Office of the President issued Executive Order No.68, which enabled all tax VAT-registered taxpayers to redeem their
    outstanding tax credit certificates for their full cash value. While this did not completely eliminate the use of tax credit certificates, it did
    make them optional.

  	 Firms with revenue below the threshold are not required to register for VAT. If they choose to be exempted from the VAT, they are required
    to pay income tax equivalent to 3 percent of their annual gross sales and are not allowed to obtain VAT credits for their inputs.

      VAT exemptions on basic consumer goods greatly increase the progressivity of the tax burden.
      The bottom income decile accounts for 1.8 percent of total adjusted household spending but only
      0.9 percent of VAT-eligible spending. Meanwhile, the top income decile accounts for 37.5 percent
      of total adjusted household spending, but 48 percent of VAT-eligible spending. Because the VAT is
      a proportional tax, the distribution of VAT liability mirrors the distribution of VAT-eligible spending.
      (Figure 27). While removing VAT exemptions on electricity, social housing, cooperatives, and spending
      by senior citizens and persons with disabilities could reduce the progressivity of the VAT system
      (Figure 28), any resulting increase in the tax burden on the poor could be offset by cash transfers
      and/or enhanced social services.

III. Increasing Tax Revenues Efficiently and Equitably

While a one-time increase in excise rates                                    into higher excise taxes. This type of adjustment
coupled with indexation would be ideal, a                                    mechanism can ensure a more gradual, less

approach to automatically raise excise taxes                                 consumers and the government benefit equally
when petroleum prices fall and keep excise                                   until the excise rate reaches its target share of

of the decline in petroleum prices be translated                             kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

     Box 12	 Excise taxes on petroleum products: an equity analysis
      Under the current excise tax regime for petroleum products, households in the top income decile
      bear 62 percent of the tax burden, while households in the bottom decile bear only 0.18 percent.64
      However, since the national average petroleum excise tax burden is equivalent to just 0.03 percent of
      total income, the redistributive effect is extremely modest compared to other taxes.65 The progressive
      distribution of the tax burden is due in part to the fact that gasoline, which is overwhelmingly consumed
      by the wealthy, is subject to excise taxes, while fuels that are more likely to be consumed by the poor,
      such as kerosene, diesel and LPG are exempt (Figure 35).

      Increasing the excise-tax-to-retail-price ratio to 20 percent for gasoline and 10 percent diesel,
      kerosene, and LPG would enhance the efficiency of the petroleum excise taxes, but it would reduce
      the progressivity of the tax burden. Under the revised system the share of petroleum excise taxes
      paid by households in the poorest income decile would rise from 0.18 to 0.57 percent, while the share
      paid by households in the richest decile would fall from 62 to 52 percent.66 However, the increase in tax
      rates would intensify the redistributive impact of the tax (Figure 36).67 Despite the marginal reduction
      in progressivity, more than half of the increase in the tax burden would be borne by households in the
      top income decile, while only 0.63 percent would be borne by households in the bottom decile. Finally,
      an increase in targeted cash transfers could fully offset the negative impact on poor households.

  	    The petroleum excise tax regime’s Kakwani Index score is 18.25, indicating progressivity.
65
  	    This is reflected by its very low Reynolds-Smolensky Index score of 0.01.
66
  	    It should be noted that the after-tax Gini coefficient would fall to 54.45.
67
  	    The very large increase in the magnitude of the tax would boost its Reynolds-Smolensky Index score to 0.04, since the distribution of the tax
       burden would still be progressive.

     power of the Philippine tax regime. In recent                             global standards. Increasing rates as a share

     party information sharing to crosscheck VAT                               tax rates for gasoline with rates for other
     declarations could strengthen compliance.                                 fuels would attenuate price distortions, while
