DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
October 2015
Preface

          The Afghanistan Development Update is published twice a year, covering recent
          economic developments and the medium-term outlook for Afghanistan. A focus
          topic, with a more in-depth analysis, is included in each publication. While lack of
          high-frequency data in the country make detailed analysis somewhat difficult, efforts
          are made to use reliable sources of data as comprehensively as possible. The
          Afghanistan Development Update is intended for a wide audience, including policy
          makers, the donor community, the private sector, and the community of analysts and
          professionals engaged in Afghanistan’s economy.

          This report was prepared by Omar Joya, Claudia Nassif, Aman Farahi (all GMFDR)
          and Silvia Redaelli (Senior Economist, GPVDR). Useful inputs were received from
          Deepak K. Mishra and the wider country team. This report was prepared under the
          overall guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri (Practice Manager, GMFDR) and Robert
          Saum (Country Director). The authors also gratefully acknowledge the cooperation
          and suggestions received from the Afghan authorities and the International Monetary
          Fund staff.

  Executive summary
               More frequent incidences of violence in Afghanistan, as well as delays in the elections
               process and cabinet formation, continued to fuel uncertainty and affected investor
               confidence in 2014 and the first half of 2015. Economic growth slowed to 1.3 percent
               in 2014, down from 3.7 percent a year earlier. Unlike in previous years, agriculture did
               not contribute much to growth in 2014. Production levels were high for a third year
               in a row but did not supersede the strong output in 2013. Growth was mainly driven
               by services and a slight expansion of industries where an increase in construction
               activities outweighed lower production in manufacturing. Private investment activities
               showed strong signs of slowdown in 2014, evidenced by a drop of nearly 50 percent
               in new firm registrations since 2012.

               Growth, projected at 1.9 percent in 2015, will likely remain sluggish in light of a
               further deterioration in security over the first three quarters in 2015. The number of
               new firm registrations in the first six months of the year, which is a proxy for investor
               confidence, remained at the same level as in the first half of 2014.

               Fiscal developments in Afghanistan point to some headway on revenue mobilization
               in 2015. Domestic revenue increased over the first 8 months of 2015 as a result of
               improvements in the customs and tax administration. New revenue measures,
               implemented in September 2015, will likely lead to an acceleration of revenue
               collection in the remainder of the year. The most recent projections indicate that
               domestic revenues will reach Af 114.2 billion (equivalent to 9.8 percent of GDP) by
               end 2015, falling much behind the initial target of Af 120 billion.

               However, recurrent expenditures are also projected to increase in 2015, due to
               growing security costs. Substantial, additional discretionary donor grants this year—
               agreed under the New Development Partnership Agreement with the United States
               and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Incentive Program—will
               likely help to balance the budget this year. Nevertheless, the budget may run a deficit
               if the Government fails to meet the agreed commitments that trigger fund
               disbursements under these programs. Moreover, the weak cash reserve position at the
               beginning of the year exposes the budget to larger fiscal risks.

               With declining global food and fuel prices and weakening domestic demand, inflation
               is projected at −1.7 percent (period average) for 2015. The depreciation of the
               Afghani—around 8 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the first eight months of the
               year—has partially offset deflationary pressures stemming from the decline in food
               and nonfood prices. Imports amount to around 40 percent of GDP and tend to have
               a large impact on domestic prices through imported inflation.

               The medium-term outlook points to slow post-transition recovery. Real GDP growth
               is projected to increase to 3.1 and 3.9 percent in 2016 and 2017 respectively,
               conditioned on improvements in the security environment and strong reform
               momentum, which could help restore confidence in the economy. Nevertheless,
               much higher growth rates are required to counter population growth at 2.5 percent
               and an estimated 400,000 entrants into the labor force each year. Good performance
               of the agriculture sector and declining food prices could mitigate the upward pressure

               on poverty stemming from negative growth in per capita GDP in 2014 and 2015.
               However, poverty is expected to remain consistently higher than its pre-transition
               level due to the contraction in off-farm labor demand and security-related constraints
               in service delivery.

               The National Unity Government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to
               revitalize the economy, tackle corruption, and improve investment climate. However,
               it will take time for these reforms to have an impact, and it is yet unclear how much
               they will mitigate the high risks stemming from the fragile security environment.
               Growing trends in security and pension and wage spending over the medium term
               require immediate attention. Afghanistan faces significant financing shortages for
               both civilian and security spending. Therefore, securing continued high levels of
               donor financing over the coming years is of critical importance for fiscal stability in
               the country. The fragile security environment and financing constraints, compounded
               by weak governance capacity, pose serious challenges to service delivery in
               Afghanistan. Any setback in reform implementation would further slow down the
               pace of human capital accumulation in Afghanistan and reduce future prospects of
               growth and poverty reduction.

  A. Recent Economic Development

                     1. Background

Afghanistan’s                     Afghanistan emerged successfully from a security transition that was marked by the
economic and social               withdrawal of most of international military forces under the NATO-led International
development is                    Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission. Responsibilities for security operations
overshadowed by                   were fully shifted to the Afghanistan National Security Forces. Presidential elections
tumultuous events at              were held in 2014—for the first time without an incumbent candidate since emerging
the political and                 out of conflict. However, disputes over the election outcomes and the formation of
security front.                   National Unity Government (NUG) prolonged the political transition. Since in office,
                                  the NUG has embarked on a new, ambitious reform program centered heavily around
                                  initiatives to fight pervasive corruption. The NUG has also taken a number of bold
                                  steps to reshape internal and external political organization and restore peace. These
                                  steps were impeded by a change in the leadership of the Taliban and reports of the
                                  emergence of militant activities by the ISIS.

                                  Security continues to be a critical threat to personal safety, public service delivery, and
                                  private investments. Incidences of conflict and violence increased, resulting in nearly
                                  3,700 civilian deaths in 2014, higher than any level in recent years. Between January
                                  and June 2015 the number of civilian deaths was slightly lower than over the same
                                  period last year, but the surge of large-scale insurgent attacks over the summer combat
                                  period has led to an extraordinarily large number of additional victims.

                               in 2013. Growth was mainly driven by two factors. First, there was slight growth in
                               industries (2.4 percent), where an increase in construction activities (7 percent)
                               outweighed lower production in manufacturing (−2.5 percent). Second, services grew
                               by 2.2 percent in 2014, mainly on account of government and telecommunication
                               services.

Expansion of                   Industries grew overall by 2.4 percent in 2014. However, manufacturing and mining
construction                   contracted by −2.5 percent and −2.2 percent respectively. This was offset by strong
activities offset an           growth of 7 percent in construction. These trends are likely to be a result of lower
overall decline in             domestic demand due to weaker consumer and business confidence. Manufacturing
industry growth                was particularly hard hit. Except for carpets, which are to a large extent exported, all
                               manufacturing products are marketed domestically. On the other hand, construction
                               activities are less prone to transitory shocks, because construction projects typically
                               span several years and demand for construction stems largely from the public sector.

Private investment                                       There is little data on investment activity in Afghanistan. But proxy indicators, such
activities remain                                        as the number of new firm registrations, show that deterioration in the security
subdued                                                  environment and political uncertainty have taken a toll on business confidence. The

                                                         same level than 2014, and has dropped by almost half since 2012.

Inflation slipped into Declining prices for global commodities, as well as weakening domestic demand, have
negative territory     lowered the prices and exerted deflationary pressures. Consumer price inflation
                       dropped to −4.8 percent in July 2015, down from 1.4 percent in December 2014. This
                       is much more moderate than the decline in global price trends in commodities. World
                       prices of grains and energy, for instance, plunged by −40 percent and −21 percent
                       respectively (on a 12-month comparison basis in April 2015). The impact of declining
                       global prices has been countered to some extent by the depreciation of the exchange
                       rate for the Afghani. Imports amount to around 40 percent of GDP and tend to have
                       a large impact on domestic prices through imported inflation.

Deflationary                                             Food and nonfood consumer prices fell by −5.9 percent and −3.5 percent in July
pressures are driven                                     2015 respectively. Specifically, prices of cereals and bread—which comprise nearly 18
by both food and                                         percent of the consumer basket—declined by −6.6 percent (year-on-year basis).
nonfood prices                                           Prices for vegetables, which are the second largest food item, fell by −21 percent.
                                                         Among nonfood items, prices for housing, transportation, and communication
                                                         services—which together comprise more than a fourth of the consumer basket—
                                                         have also been falling. Property prices have plummeted over the past two years as a

Deflation could                                          The current deflationary trend is expected to be transitory. Prices are projected to
benefit the poor                                         rebound next year because exchange rate depreciation will start to exert upward
                                                         pressure on domestic prices. Deflation, as long as it does not persist for long periods

                                                         consumption with the expectation that prices will further decline in the future.
                                                         Period-average inflation is projected at −1.7 percent for 2015.

                              last year. Fixed tax revenues, on the other hand, declined by nearly 7 percent.

Official exports have                   Official exports in the first half of 2015 were 15 percent lower than exports over the
dropped                                 same period in 2014 in spite of a weaker exchange rate and strong agriculture output.
                                        In fact, as exports in Afghanistan are agriculture-related products and commodities,
                                        years with strong agriculture production normally see increases in exports. Dried
                                        fruits, medicinal plants, and carpets represent the three major export items for
                                        Afghanistan. The limited effect of the exchange rate depreciation on exports implies
                                        large competitiveness challenges in production and supply chains in export sectors.

Risks to balance of                          The current trend of currency depreciation is not expected to cause external

immediate future are                         predominantly financed by the large foreign aid inflows. The flexible exchange rate
low                                          regime further safeguards the stability of the external accounts because it allows the
                                             pass-through of changes in international prices on domestic prices without affecting
                                             the level of foreign exchange reserves. The same mechanism, however, could
                                             potentially lead to inflationary pressures on domestic prices which over the past
                                             months have been offset by the declining prices for global commodities. On the other
                                             hand, Afghanistan’s low domestic production capabilities and narrow export base
                                             limit the positive impact of the depreciation on competitiveness and export growth
                                             one would typically expect. This has important implications for macroeconomic
                                             stability: balance of payment risks could increase if foreign aid declines unless
                                             alternative sources of foreign exchange earnings are secured, for example, through
                                             export revenues or incoming foreign direct investments. Development of investment
                                             opportunities and exports, for instance in extractives sector, will therefore remain a
                                             critical priority in the years to come.

Banking lending                                         Commercial banks’ lending to the private sector continued to decline over the first
continues to decline                                    half of the year. Credit to private sector has been declining since the second half of
                                                        last year and dropped, as of July 2015, by −3.3 percent (year-on-year). Total banking
                                                        sector loans stood at US$740 million in July 2015, as compared to US$818 million
                                                        twelve months earlier. The drop in banks’ lending can be attributed to economic
                                                        slowdown, banks’ limited appetite for lending, and stricter regulations imposed on
                                                        FX-denominated loans. With increased uncertainty in the economy, proxy data
                                                        indicates that private investment has stalled and thus borrowing from the banking
                                                        sector has dropped. Further, the banking sector appears to have become more risk
                                                        averse since the Kabul Bank crisis in 2011. The decline in bank lending portrays weak
                                                        financial intermediation, which remains a key challenge to the system’s efficiency and
                                                        development. In addition, the quality of assets has deteriorated. The ratio of
                                                        nonperforming loans increased from 6.3 percent in June 2014 to 13.8 percent in June
                                                        2015, leading to a total loss of US$14 million in the first seven months of 2015.

B. Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
The growth outlook             Growth, projected at 1.9 percent, will likely remain sluggish in light of the
for 2015 remains               deterioration in security over the first three quarters of 2015. Investor and consumer
sluggish                       confidence in the nonagricultural sectors show no signs of picking up over 2015. With
                               declining global food and fuel prices and weakening domestic demand, inflation is
                               projected at −1.7 percent (period average) for 2015. While currency depreciation will
                               offset to some degree the effects of declining global commodity prices, weakened
                               domestic demand will continue to exert deflationary pressure through prices of
                               nontraded, nonfood items. Fiscal vulnerabilities will continue to be high. Revenues
                               recovered somewhat in the first half of the year, but they may remain below the initial
                               target of Af 120 billion. In light of the current revenue performance, the revenue
                               target for 2015 is revised to Af 114.2 billion (equivalent to 9.8 percent of GDP).
                               Recurrent expenditures are projected to increase in 2015, due to growing security
                               costs. The budget could potentially run a deficit of US$100–US$150 million this year.
                               However, if substantial, additional discretionary donor grants materialize under the
                               New Development Partnership Agreement with the United States and under the
                               ARTF Incentive Program, the government should be able to balance the budget and
                               build up depleted cash reserves.
Post-transition      Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 3.1 and 3.9 percent in 2016 and 2017
recovery is expected respectively, conditioned on improvements in the security environment and strong
to be slow           reform momentum, which could help restore confidence in the economy.
                     Nevertheless, much higher growth rates are required to counter population growth at
                     2.5 percent and estimated 400,000 entrants into the labor force each year. Good
                     performance of the agriculture sector and declining food prices could mitigate the
                     upward pressure on poverty stemming from negative growth in per capita GDP in
                     2014 and 2015. However, poverty is expected to remain consistently higher than its
                     pre-transition level due to the contraction in off-farm labor demand and security-
                     related constraints in service delivery.

The growth outlook       Agriculture and services will likely be among the key drivers of economic growth.
is contingent upon a     Agriculture accounts for about a quarter of GDP and is also linked closely to other
relatively stable        parts of the economy, such as food and beverages (which account for almost all of
political and security   manufacturing), and parts of transport and retail. Afghanistan has the potential to
environment              build on this foundation by reviving its historical position as an important exporter
                         of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other higher value-added products. This will require
                         investments in irrigation and extension services to improve capacity, as well as efforts
                         to build and improve downstream agro-processing activities. On the other hand, the
                         government also has the option to tap into large potential for developing extractive
                         industries, which currently account for a very small share of GDP. Unlocking this
                         potential will require progress on the legislative framework as well as securing
                         financing for the necessary infrastructure.

The medium-term          The fragile political and security environment has been a considerable constraint to

need to be carefully     achieving peace, stability, and reconciliation. A number of factors are exposing poor
managed                  and vulnerable households to more risks. First, the sharp slowdown in growth during
                         2013–15 puts pressure on underemployment and thus consumption across the board.
                         Second, although agriculture experienced a bumper year in 2012 (growing by 18.2
                         percent, likely postdating the 2011–12 household survey), subsequent growth in the
                         sector during 2013–14 remained relatively flat, and unfavorable weather conditions
                         point toward a contraction in 2015. Poverty incidence in 2015 is thus projected at 39
                         percent. In the medium term, Afghanistan faces headwinds from declining aid and a
                         demographic youth bulge. In this context, making progress on poverty reduction will
                         require a combination of factors, including a pickup in overall growth, achieving
                         steady growth in the agriculture sector, reducing underemployment, mitigating
                         climactic shocks, and addressing regional disparities.

Restoring fiscal         Revenue reforms have picked up momentum in the second half of 2015, with the
stability will require   implementation of new tax measures and commitments to important institutional
accelerating revenue-    reforms in the customs and revenue administration. Nevertheless, the fiscal crisis in
enhancing reforms,       2014 exposed the Government to larger fiscal risks in the medium term. The weaker
additional               cash position and larger stock of arrears at the beginning of 2015 mean that there will
discretionary            be more need for adjustment moving forward. In the medium term, contingent on
assistance, and          the successful implementation of revenue-enhancing reforms, revenues are projected
prioritizing             to improve from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 11.6 percent by 2018—which is
expenditures             about the level of revenue in 2012. While the projected increase in revenues is
                         ambitious, it will still leave Afghanistan with a currently unfinanced fiscal deficit of
                         1–2 percent of GDP during 2015–18. The fiscal deficit (excluding donor grants) is
                         forecast to reach 22.2 percent of GDP by 2018. If additional resources are not
                         forthcoming to cover this gap, more aggressive expenditure consolidation efforts
                         would be needed, which would compromise development prospects and social
                         outcomes.

Raising fiscal           Recent analysis shows that with considerably greater effort to reduce leakages and
revenue will require     improve administration of the tax regime, revenues could be raised up to 16 percent
larger reform efforts    of GDP. This is grossly inadequate to finance Afghanistan’s current level of spending,
and promoting new        which is at 30 percent of GDP and does not yet fully account for liabilities that are
sources of economic      currently financed off-budget, especially in the security sector. But raising revenue
growth                   above its current potential would require tapping into new sources for economic
                         growth. The natural resources sector would be a good contender, with its large
                         potential to contribute to revenues in the medium and long term. However, the
                         timeline for new developments in extractive industries has become more uncertain in
                         light of strategic reorientation in policy decisions and slow progress in reforms over
                         the past year.

Budget expenditures      Total budget expenditures are projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2014 to
are projected to rise,   30 percent in 2016. This increase is largely a result of more security spending moving
with higher security     on budget, while it was previously undertaken directly by international partners.
and social benefit       Moreover, Afghanistan has considerable public expenditure needs in the areas of
spending                 service delivery, building essential infrastructure, and operations and maintenance.
                         For example, delivering on goals to improve education outcomes will require hiring
                         increasing numbers of teachers. Developing new sources of growth will require much
                         better infrastructure. Prioritizing these expenditure needs within the Government’s
                         limited resource envelope will be critical to maintaining a pro-development stance.
                         With social benefits for martyrs and disabled increasing significantly in 2014, the
                         Government will need to consider reforms in the pension and social benefit scheme
                         going forward. Although more detailed analysis of public expenditures in needed,
                         there appears to be limited space to adjust expenditures.

Donors have              At the December 2014 London Conference on Afghanistan, the international
committed to             community reaffirmed its Tokyo commitment of providing US$16 billion in
considerable             development assistance for Afghanistan over 2012–15, sustaining support through
assistance for           2017 at or near the levels of the past decade, and providing continuing but declining
Afghanistan              support through the transformation decade. These funds, contingent on satisfactory
contingent on            reform progress under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), would
satisfactory reform      allow Afghanistan to progress toward sustainability and meet its development and
progress                 infrastructure targets. Together with earlier pledges on the security side, this means
                         annual aid of about US$8 billion—roughly equally divided between civil and security

                          Afghanistan will require acceleration of reforms as well as additional on-budget
                          assistance.

An ambitious reform       The National Unity Government has initiated a number of bold measures since it
agenda is already in      took office. Consistent with its strategy for greater self-reliance presented at the 2014
hand                      London Conference, the Government put forward an ambitious reform plan at the
                          Senior Officials Meeting in September 2015. The plan is anchored in programs such
                          as the ARTF Incentive Program, the IMF-supported Staff Monitored Program, and
                          the Mutual Accountability Framework (see Box 1).

Three measures      The new reforms will take time to have an impact—as will the current efforts to
complement the      achieve peace and stability. Meanwhile, given the current economic outlook, poverty,
Government reform   unemployment, and fragility will continue to increase. Three measures could help to
program for the     strengthen the impact of the Government’s reforms:
short- and medium          Restore private sector confidence to stimulate investment. In the short term
term
                            necessary reforms—such as the recent ones in procurement and tax policy—
                            can be viewed as increasing uncertainty. To mitigate this perception, closer
                            dialogue with the private sector would be key for building support for reform.
                            Providing greater clarity on the Government’s economic policy stance could
                            further enhance investment predictability.
                           Enhance the poverty impact of public expenditure. The fiscal space is very
                            narrow and without additional financing, the only way to mitigate poverty in
                            the short term is to reprogram the existing portfolio of development
                            interventions. In this context, opportunities for expanding direct household
                            transfers, insurance schemes, and adult literacy programs could be explored
                            to complement existing service delivery efforts. Our experiences show that
                            such measures could improve mobility and productivity, and enhance
                            participation of the poor in the growth process.
                           Rearticulate the needs for security and development assistance. Afghanistan’s
                            security strategy and commitments need to be revisited in light of the changes
                            in the security situation. Achieving greater self-reliance will critically depend
                            on how realistic and affordable the country’s security will be in the long term.
                            Commitments for development financing will likely need to remain at least
                            at current levels in order to meet Afghanistan’s extraordinary development
                            needs. A new National Development Strategy could provide a clearer sense
                            of direction and vision for donor financing.

C. Focus Section: Poverty
Growth without                                   Strong economic growth in Afghanistan during the pre-transition period has not
poverty reduction                                reduced poverty. Afghanistan’s per capita GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6.9
                                                 percent between 2007–08 and 2011–12. In 2007–08, 36 percent of Afghans were
                                                 poor—that is, more than one in every three Afghans did not have the buying power
                                                 to satisfy basic food and nonfood needs. Four years later, in 2011–12, 36 percent of
                                                 Afghans were still poor.

                                                 Economic growth, while necessary, is not in and of itself enough to reduce poverty.
                                                 The problem is in the distribution of the gains. Patterns of growth contributed to
                                                 widening inequality. Average per capita consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.2
                                                 percent between 2007–08 and 2011–12, but growth in consumption was not uniform,
                                                 thus increasing inequality. While the poorest 20 percent of the population saw a 2
                                                 percent decline in real per capita expenditure, the richest 20 percent experienced a 9
                                                 percent increase. Widening inequalities are reflected in an increase of the Gini index,
                                                 which moved from 29.7 in 2007–08 to 31.6 percent in 2011–12.
Characteristics of
Afghanistan’s poor:                              Data shows that the characteristics of the poor did not change (Figure 17). Poverty
rural, agricultural,                             in Afghanistan strongly correlates to geography—that is, to where people live. Four
underemployed, and                               out of every five poor people live in rural areas. The mountainous East, Northeast,
heavily vulnerable                               and West-Central regions—where almost half of inhabitants are poor—have the
                                                 lowest per capita consumption and highest likelihood of poverty.

                                                 poverty. Poor people tend to be illiterate (75.6 percent), and often lack opportunities
                                                 to educate their children. Poor people face higher unemployment1 (8 percent) or are

                      vulnerable and informal job (84.3 percent), most likely in agriculture (43.6 percent).
                      Poor people are much less likely to have access to basic services such as electricity
                      (63.8 percent), safe drinking water (40.3 percent), and sanitation (2.8 percent).

                      Poverty in Afghanistan closely intertwines with natural and manmade risks.
                      Approximately 84 percent of Afghan households experienced at least one economic
                      shock in 2011–12, and 53 percent suffered from three or more. Due to mountainous
                      terrain, poor connectivity, and greater reliance on subsistence and rain-fed agriculture,
                      the poorest regions in the East, Northeast, and West-Central are particularly exposed
                      and vulnerable to shocks, especially natural hazards. Poor people are among the most
                      vulnerable, because they are exposed the most to a wide array of risks, and because
                      they lack means to cope with hazards. Poor households are more likely to use harmful
                      risk coping mechanisms that may protect them in the short term, but at greater long-
                      term cost, reducing the likelihood of escaping from poverty in the future.2

International         International spending did not benefit Afghanistan’s employment sectors, regions,
spending is an        and people equally. International spending on military and civilian assistance drove
effective driver of   economic growth in Afghanistan, but growth did not reach the poor. International
growth, but gains     spending contributed to growth and job creation in the service sector. However, while
not distributed       the service sector growth created good-quality jobs, especially in the public and in
equally               health and education-related services, 80 percent of new jobs were in informal day
                      labor arrangements. Lacking education, the poor could not compete for these jobs,
                      and moved from vulnerable employment in agriculture to vulnerable employment in
                      the service sector. On the other hand, aid did not contribute to raising productivity
                      of the agriculture sector, where most of the poor find employment. While losing its
                      GDP primacy, the continued importance of agriculture in the Afghan economy
                      contributed to economic growth volatility due to the sector’s high reliance on rain-
                      fed production and vulnerability to weather-related shocks.

                      Tilted towards military operations, international spending benefited high-conflict
                      areas most, leaving behind the poorest West-Central, Northeast, and East regions.3
                      Moreover, while in the rest of the country a thriving service sector created new and
                      less vulnerable jobs, “lagging” regions remained reliant on vulnerable employment in
                      agriculture. Greater incidence of and greater vulnerability to natural hazards
                      contributed to widening inequality between the poorest regions and the rest of the
                      country.

Despite significant   While consumption-based poverty in Afghanistan stagnated, overall country human

education and basic   investment, from 2007–08 to 2011–12, literacy rates for the population aged 15 and

                          unemployment a rare phenomenon. The relatively low level of open unemployment is
                          counterbalanced by the severity of underemployment.
                      2   Lacking proper means to cope with risk, poor households face extremely unfavorable trade-
                          offs when hit by a shock and may resort to “harmful” coping mechanisms. These include
                          things like selling livestock or assets that may affect future productivity and livelihood;
                          increasing the use of child labor, which leads to intergenerational poverty; or reducing
                          consumption and going hungry, which affects health, human capital accumulation, and
                          future labor productivity.
                      3   Aid increased in nonlagging regions by 79 percent over the period compared to only 31

               by 6 percent annually. Access to electricity, access to safe drinking water, and access
               to improved sanitation all improved, growing annually by approximately 14 percent
               each. While these achievements have been significant, it is important to note that—
               at its pre-transition pace of progress—it will take the country from 20 to 25 years to
               achieve the same level of adult literacy of other low-income or conflict-affected
               countries. Further, it would take Afghanistan from 11 to 15 years to achieve the same
               level of youth literacy, and from 12 to 23 years to achieve the same level of primary-
               school enrollment.

               Afghanistan is still a long way from closing the widening gap between poor and better-
               off Afghans. Between 2007–08 and 2011–12, the gap in education between poor and
               nonpoor Afghans widened. Children in poor households have significantly lower
               school enrollment rates than their counterparts in nonpoor households. While urban
               areas and nonlagging regions saw significant improvement in school enrollment,
               education outcomes stagnated in rural areas and in lagging regions, mostly due to
               negative impact of shocks and conflict on girls’ enrollment.

               Lessons learned

               While economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty, the poor must receive benefits
               from the growth. For any given rate of growth, the extent of poverty reduction
               depends on the ability to distribute income, assets, and access to opportunities to the
               poor. For Afghanistan, the implications of our analysis are as follows:

                   Strengthening agriculture remains a top priority in Afghanistan to sustain
                    growth as aid dwindles, and for accelerating poverty reduction. As 75.6 percent
                    of poor aged 15 and above are illiterate, they cannot take advantage of better
                    employment opportunities requiring high skills. Thus poverty reduction should

                   benefit the most from growth in sectors like agriculture, where the poor
                   concentrate.

                  Afghanistan needs sustained investment in human development to support
                   economic growth, reduce poverty, and bridge gaps in these areas between
                   Afghanistan and other countries in the region. While continuing to expand the
                   supply of education, health, and basic services, the country should devote greater
                   attention to improving access in underserved areas and among traditionally
                   underserved groups such as girls and the poor.

                  Afghanistan’s poor households need help to manage risk. Geography
                   (which can increase exposure to natural hazards), economic structure, and high
                   incidence of poverty (which limits households’ ability to cope with shocks)
                   require coordinated assistance to prevent and mitigate risks, and to help people
                   coping with the impact of shocks. In particular, greater attention should be
                   devoted to the development of an efficient system of safety nets to promote
                   poverty reduction, and to complement and improve the effectiveness of
                   investments in human development and agriculture.

APPENDIX: WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN
1. The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
   FY 2012–FY 2014, which focuses on three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of institutions;
   (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs. The process for preparing the next country
   strategy—the Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistan—has been launched, and work on the
   Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) is in progress.

2. Since 2002, the International Development Association (IDA) has committed a total of US$3.12 billion in
   grants (86 percent) and credits (14 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty seven development and emergency-
   reconstruction projects and four budget-support operations have been committed as of end-August 2015.
   In addition, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$7.99 billion from 33
   donors, and committed US$3.61 billion for the government’s recurrent costs and US$3.79 billion for
   government investment programs. At end of August 2015, the active IDA portfolio was worth US$725.98
   million and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth US$2.5 billion.

3. The Bank also administers the ARTF—the World Bank Group’s largest single-country multi-donor trust
   fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling financing strategy.
   Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$1 billion per year in grant resources (about US$150
   million from IDA and about US$800–US$900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle for
   providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing and provides a platform
   for policy dialogue between Government and donors.

4. In FY 2015, the World Bank Board approved additional financing for an existing project—the Second
   Customs Reform and Trade Facilitation Project—in the amount of US$21.5 million. No new projects were
   approved under the ARTF during the political transition period. Funds were, however, allocated to ongoing
   projects for a total of US$450 million, which includes US$50 million for the National Horticulture and
   Livestock Project, US$100 million for the National Solidarity Program III, US$100 million for the Rural
   Access Program, and US$200 million for the System Enhancement for Health in Transition Project. In FY
   2015, US$419.56 million was disbursed under the Recurrent Cost Window, including the baseline financing
   (US$125 million), Incentive Program (US$132.5 million, of which US$65 million was through the O&M
   Facility), and additional donor grants of US$146.9 million through ad hoc mechanisms.

5. The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and places large emphasis on policy
   dialogue. These nonlending activities have been supportive of the Bank’s lending program and have played
   a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and advancing dialogue between the
   Government of Afghanistan and its international development partners. In recent years, four pieces of
   analytical work stand out: Transition Economics, Resources Corridors, Poverty Analysis, and the
   Agriculture Sector Review. The Bank also prepared Policy Notes on key sectors of the economy to help
   guide its policy dialogue with the new administration and launched the preparation of a comprehensive
   revenue analysis.

6. The portfolio of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Afghanistan has more than doubled since
   FY 2008—from around US$8 million to about US$135 million to date. IFC is following an integrated
   advisory and investment strategy. It is focused on improving the investment climate, building capacity, and
   supporting selective investments in sectors with high development impact and job creation. Currently,
   IFC’s portfolio includes two investments in the telecommunications sector and two operations in the
   financial markets. Going forward, IFC is looking to expand its investment program in Afghanistan, in the
   areas of infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, agribusiness, and services.

7. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$154 million of gross exposure in
   Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business projects. In 2013 MIGA launched its Conflict Affected
   and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supporting the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan. MIGA is
   currently supporting three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the telecoms
   sector (supporting telecom operator MTN). The other two operations are MIGA-only dairy and cashmere
   production projects.
