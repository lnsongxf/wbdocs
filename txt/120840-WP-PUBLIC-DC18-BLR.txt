About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       There are no laws requiring a business to purchase company seal. However,
       the company seal is required for consignment notes and for certain bank
       transactions and power of attorney. Government agencies, such as the tax
       authority, would have no legal grounds for refusing documents that do not
       have a company seal. Nevertheless out of habit, most limited liability
       companies would purchase a seal. In addition, for the purpose of opening a
       bank account, it is required to make a company seal.

building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Minsk City Executive Committee

      To start construction, BuildCo must receive the Minsk City Executive
      Committee’s decision to elaborate on design documentation. The
      permission letter states the main requirements for the intended building
      and lists the agencies and the institutions where additional technical
      requirements must be obtained. The request form must contain a brief
      description of the intended building project and company documents.

      On April 26, 2007 the Minsk City Municipality passed Decision # 859
      according to which applicants can choose to obtain technical conditions or
      request the Centre of Engineering Services to obtain them on behalf of the
      applicant. Prior to this reform, the Centre used to be under the Department
      of Technical Conditions of the Committee of Architecture and City
      Construction. Now the Centre operates as a semi-private entity and if the
      work load increases, it can recruit additional human resources.


      After the documents are submitted to the Reception Desk they are
      forwarded to the respective departments, and if the applicant wishes to
      obtain the technical conditions through the Centre, the documents are
      directed internally to the Centre.


      All service providers that issue technical conditions have a time limit of 7
      working days during which the approvals must be granted. All the approvals
      can be obtained in parallel. The services that are involved and would be
      required for BuildCo’s case are: water/sewage, telephone, sanitary
      epidemiological authority, ecological department and re safety. By law all
      technical conditions are granted free of charge. However, if it is done
      through the Centre for Engineering Services there is a fee -- for BuildCo's
      case, it would be approximately BYR 1,000,000.00. In practice, majority of
      companies choose to obtain the necessary technical conditions on their
      own.

      The applicants can choose to obtain technical conditions from each agency
      individually or to request them from the Centre of Engineering Services,
      which can obtain the technical conditions on behalf of applicant. However, it
      is very rare that building companies will choose to ask the technical
      conditions from the Centre of Engineering Services. The overwhelming
      majority of building companies obtain the technical conditions on their own.
      According to construction professionals, it is in the best interest of building
      companies to obtain the technical conditions on their own to ensure that
      the technical conditions are issued in the most optimal manner for the
      building company.


      All service providers that issue technical conditions have a time-limit of 7
      working days during which the approvals must be granted. However, in
      practice it might take on average 2 weeks. All the technical conditions can be
      obtained in parallel.                                                                                                   Page 14

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category

                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                        petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings under Art. 8 of the Law on "Economic
                                        insolvency (bankruptcy)". After the petition is accepted, the debtor will go into the protection
                                        period of up to 3 months, which can be extended up to 3 years (Art. 39). At the end of the
                                        protection period, the court will decide whether to initiate insolvency proceedings and will
                                        appoint an administrator (Art. 46). The court will decide, based on the decision of the
                                        creditors' meeting how to proceed in the insolvency proceedings - through liquidation or
                                        through reorganization (Art. 49, Art. 124). Liquidation per se lasts in practice from 7 to 16
                                        months.

Cost (% of           17.0               The cost of the entire procedure would amount to approximately 17% of the value of the
estate)                                 debtors' assets. Main expenses would include court fees (0.5%), attorneys' fees (3%),
                                        remuneration of the insolvency representative (7%), auctioneer's fees (3%), fees of
                                        accountants and other professionals working on the case (2.5%), and other expenses (1%).
