    Foreword


    In recent years, global remittance flows to developing countries have received increased
    attention from policymakers and the international community. Remittance flows have
    grown steadily over the years: today, they represent about 1 percent of the World GDP
    and are the second largest source of external funding for the developing world. But
    more importantly, more than 700 million people depend on remittance flows, and they
    still pay an excessive price for sending or receiving their money, as the average global
    cost for sending remittances stands at 7.7 percent.

    The efforts of the international community and the adoption by the G8 and G20 of the
    “5x5 objective”—reducing of the average cost of remittances by five percentage points
    in five years—have paid-off, as remittance prices have decreased by 2.3 percentage
    points over the last 5 years, but more can be achieved. Recently in Brisbane, the G20
    have renewed their commitment towards the cost reduction objective.

    Reducing the costs of remittances requires to take action on many fronts, but also to be
    innovative, and that is precisely what Project Greenback 2.0 is doing: being innovative
    by promoting change and increasing efficiency in the market inspired by the real needs
    of the ultimate beneficiaries of international money transfers, the migrants and their
    families. Project Greenback 2.0 is also testing and proving at a local level the efficiency
    of the best practices promoted by the World Bank for the achievement of the 5x5 objec-
    tive, by working with the migrants and their families.

    Turin, Italy has been the first home of Greenback 2.0, the first Remittances Champion
    City, and its first success story. The ideas developed in Turin included a whole range of
    activities which helped migrants make better choices for sending their money and meet-
    ing the needs of their families back home:

    •	 financial education activities focused on remittance services;

    •	 monitoring of the remittances market;

    •	 supporting projects of migrant associations in order to promote information, aware-
       ness, education, and implementation of best practices on remittance behavior;

    •	 facilitating and keeping an active dialogue between migrant citizens and market play-
       ers, encouraging them to develop new services or new approaches that are better
       suited to migrants’ needs.

    Montreuil, France, has been inspired by the example of Turin and the Greenback’s inno-
    vative approach. The first step involved carrying out a survey to collect data on the
    most representative migrant communities and the largest in terms of remittances sent
    to the country of origin. This survey, which was commissioned to a team (DIAL) from
    the French Research Institute for Development (Institut de Recherche pour le Dével-
    oppement) is the focus of this report. The research findings are the starting point for
    Project Greenback 2.0 activities aimed at promoting transparency and information in the
    market for remittances. The DIAL team included Flore Gubert (Deputy Director, DIAL),

      IRD), and Lisa Chauvet (Research Officer, IRD).

      In Montreuil, the project is led by Ceu Pereira (Senior Payment System Specialist, The
      World Bank) and supported by field coordinator Elodie Vitalis (Remittances Analyst,
      The World Bank). Marco Nicoli (Financial Sector Specialist, The World Bank) acts as the
      global coordinator for Project Greenback 2.0.

      I would like to express our gratitude to all of the participating communities, groups, and
      associations, the City of Montreuil, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other local
      authorities and, most importantly, the interviewed migrants who gave us their time and
      their attention.

    Executive Summary


    P   roject Greenback 2.0—Remittances Champion Cities consists in identifying cities
        where a series of measures are implemented to foster the development of a sound
    remittance market. The objective of the Project is the promotion of transparency and
    competition in the market for remittances and, ultimately, the reduction of prices for
    remittance services. Montreuil, France is the second Remittances Champion City after
    Turin, Italy.

    This report provides the results of a survey conducted by DIAL, a team of the French
    Institute of Research on Development (“Institut de la Recherche pour le Developpe-
    ment”) on a sample of migrants living in Montreuil and follows the same methodology
    as the report “Migrants’ remittances from Italy, international remittances and access to
    financial services for migrants in Turin, Italy,” undertaken in the framework of Project
    Greenback 2.0 in Turin. The survey constitutes the “baseline scenario” informing actions
    to be developed in Montreuil. Specifically, it investigates the socio-economic character-
    istics of migrants, as well as their financial inclusion and remittance behavior. Particular
    attention has been given to the channels used to transfer money abroad.

    The three migrant groups selected for the survey—Algerians, Ivorians, and Malians—
    reflect their important share in the foreign-born population in Montreuil as well as
    contrasted patterns of migration. While Algerian migrants represent the largest group,
    Malians stood as a natural choice as Montreuil is well known for being one of the most
    popular destination cities for this nationality. With regard to Ivorian migrants, the deter-
    minant factor was their more recent history of migration to France, as this was consid-
    ered to potentially lead to contrasted remittance patterns.

    The survey highlights differences between the three communities based on sociologi-
    cal factors—such as size of family, length of stay in France, type of education—as well as
    economic integration factors, such as occupation type, legal status, etc. Algerians tend
    to be more educated, have better jobs and enjoy a slightly higher level of income than
    migrants in the other groups; their length of stay in France is also longer in average. The
    same goes for Malians with regard to length of stay, but their income is slightly lower
    and the size of their families larger, in average, as compared with the other groups. Ivo-
    rians are the group with shortest length of stay in France and hence tend to be slightly
    less integrated than the two other groups.

    The survey confirmed that the three surveyed foreign-born groups are fairly well-
    integrated financially, with over 85% of individuals having one or more bank accounts.
    However, most migrants do not use their bank accounts to send money back home,
    which is consistent with the results of the Greenback 2.0 Turin Survey.

    The three groups also show different remittance behavior. Malian migrants remit more,
    on average, than the two other communities, while Ivorians remit less. This suggests that
    remittances are not linearly correlated with income, as Algerian migrants in Montreuil
    are, on average, wealthier than Malian and Ivorian migrants, but remit less, on average,
    than Malian migrants.

     The duration of stay in France does not seem to alter the intensity of the links migrants
     have with those left behind. Ivorians and Malians remit relatively small amounts of funds
     on a very regular basis (generally every month), whereas Algerians remit higher amounts
     of funds but much less frequently (two or three times a year). These contrasted patterns
     reflect different family structures—Malian and Ivorian migrants have much larger fami-
     lies in their origin country—but also a different use of remittances—Malian and Ivorian
     migrants contribute to the current expenses of those left behind, while remittances from
     Algerian migrants are more often used to buy durable goods or to invest.

     Remittance channels are also radically different among those three communities. Alge-
     rian and Malian migrants overwhelmingly rely on hand-carried cash transfers, while a
     large majority of Ivorian migrants use money transfer operators (MTOs). Several fac-
     tors may explain this pattern. Communities with a long-lasting history of migration to
     France rely on strong migrant networks and prefer using friends or other intermediar-
     ies to carry cash back home. In the case of Algeria, the presence of an informal market
     for foreign-exchange currency may also affect remittance behaviors. The survey shows
     that migrants in general have distorted perceptions about the real transaction costs and
     overall service conditions, especially as they generally do not consider the exchange rate
     factor as a cost.
