Water Supply
Indiscriminate abstraction of ground water to compensate for poor service quality has resulted in dropping
water tables. Access to drinking water is further threatened by the contamination of aquifers through un-
treated wastewater in urban areas and chemicals from agricultural use and irrigation recharge in rural areas.
Natural contamination of groundwater with arsenic and other metals such as fluoride is also common in parts
of India. Weak management of water resources, particularly in the catchments and river basin ecosystems
from which water is derived, exacerbates the issues of water quality and quantity. In India, each aspect of
the water use cycle is with different departments, and there is no composite examination of water use and
quality. According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) of WHO/UNICEF, 2012, 97 % of the country’s popu-
lation has access to improved water sources. However, these figures do not tell the real story. Currently, no
Indian city has continuous water supply.

Intermittent water supply increases both the likelihood of contamination and the coping costs for consumers.
JMP data also reveals that the coverage of piped water in urban India has been decreasing (52% in 1990
to 48% in 2010), implying that the rate of urbanization is outstripping the ability to expand service. In rural ar-
eas too, while 90% of the population has access to improved water sources, distance of water sources from
homes, availability of adequate water at the source, and lack of water for irrigation and the trade off with
drinking water remain key issues.


Sanitation
South Asia is home to 692 million people who are forced to defecate in the open due to the lack of sanita-
tion facilities; 90% of this population (623 million) lives in India. A 2006 Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
study estimated that the total cost of inadequate sanitation for India is $54 billion, or 6.4% of annual GDP.
Inadequate rural sanitation, in particular, is one of the most critical issues in India, with more than 550 million
people defecating in the open. GoI has implemented the Total Sanitation Programme (TSC) and Clean Vil-
lage Award, which provides financial incentives and Presidential recognition for villages that demonstrate
open defecation free (ODF) status. However, almost 95% of ODF villages lapsed back due to poorly con-
structed toilets, population increase, lack of water, poor market linkages for repair and up-gradation, the
fatigue of local leadership, and weak monitoring and incentives. Urban areas too face similar challenges in
sanitation due to financially weak institutions, lack of demand, poorly constructed and managed assets, and
lack of fecal sludge management.


Solid Waste Management
India is still a low income country and its solid waste generation rate per person is low. The average solid
waste generation is about 0.5 kg/capita/day or 188,000 tons/day. Waste issues are significant primarily in
urban areas, and only about 35% urban waste is safely collected at the source. Most of this waste undergoes
segregation of recyclables by waste collectors in an unhygienic and unsafe manner.


Drainage
Inadequate drainage of storm water is evident in most large Indian cities. This stems from a series of mutually
reinforced failures, including poor trash collection (resulting in blocked drains), poor enforcement of urban
planning regulations (resulting in loss of natural flood plains and drainage channels), and weak service provi-
sion. Whilst drainage is a low priority at this time, it is still a significant issue due to flooding and due to potential
commercial losses for major cities.

1.4.4 - TYPE OF ACTIVITY SUPPORTED
Both pre-Project Concept Note (PCN) tasks that deal with policy advocacy and those that are post-PCN
where a PCN has been approved in the Bank system and the task is then linked to the design and/or imple-
mentation of a project have been supported. In the Project Design Document (PDD) for WSI-India it had
been agreed that the split between pre-PCN and post-PCN activities would be 40-60. Pre-PCN activities
supporting policy dialogue have been allocated 35.27% of the funds while 64.73% of the funds have been
allocated towards post-PCN activities supporting the design and implementation of Bank projects.

1.5 PRELIMINARY
    RESULTS
The WSI window has been operational since June 2011. In the normal course, an activity takes two years to
be completed. However in the one and half years that the window has been active, we are starting to see
preliminary results from a number of activities. Some of these are detailed below.


1.5.1 - SCALING UP INNOVATION
BENEFIT ASSESSMENT OF THE 24X7 WATER SUPPLY DEMONSTRATION ZONES IN KARNATAKA
STATE - A Bank project had succeeded in demonstrating in demo zones of three cities that 24x7 water
supply is an achievable target. The assessment provided valuable information for the design of the project
currently under preparation to scale up 24x7 water supply from the demo zones citywide in the three cities.
It emphasized the positive social and economic impacts of the availability of water in a continuous manner
on the lives of the beneficiaries. People with continuous water supply not only save money due to lower cop-
ing costs, they have more time to engage in productive economic and educational activities. Based on this
work, the PFSA Program Secretariat has prepared a brief “Bringing 24x7 Water to India” which is forwarded

1.5.2 - SUPPORTING PPPs
TRANSACTION ADVISORY SERVICES FOR PPP IN RWSS IN ANDHRA PRADESH - Possible options
for PPPs for multi-village RWSS delivery were developed. After extensive consultations on the Design Build and
Operate (DBO) model government decided to tender three DBO pilots. These are to be implemented via the
Bank AP RWSS project currently under implementation. This is an early win for the WSI window. The Bank team
continues to provide transaction advisory support for the successful implementation of the PPP pilots. These will
have a demonstration effect on including PPP options for RWSS delivery.

PPP IN RWSS IN PUNJAB - The final report and action plan for possible PPPs in RWSS has been completed.
The report suggests the ways in which the government can incorporate PPPs into RWSS and structure better
PPP arrangements. Workshops to disseminate the findings are being conducted. A national-level one-day
workshop will be held on May 24th, 2013 by the Punjab Water Supply & Sanitation Department to disseminate
the findings of the report. The next step is to explore the possibility of implementing the suggestions made in
the report through pilots. Work has started on this aspect.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MINISTRY OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT (MoUD) ON PPPS IN THE-
SEWERAGE SECTOR - The final report has been completed and presented to government. An Action
Plan to include PPPs in the sewerage sector has been developed which has been endorsed by MoUD. The
action plan and the outputs from the report will be used to support small and medium sized urban local
governments in developing performance-based contracts and in rolling out these contracts. A national
workshop chaired by the Secretary, Urban Development was held on April 18th, 2013. As a result of this work,
the Secretary asked the Bank team to conduct state level workshops to disseminate the findings to various
stakeholders including the private sector.



1.5.3 - NEW LINES OF BUSINESS/SCALING UP INNOVATIONS
KARNATAKA URBAN WATER SUPPLY MODERNIZATION PROJECT - WSI has enabled the develop-
ment of a new line of business focusing on WSS delivery in urban areas. A part of this engagement is the
support provided for policy advocacy to scale up 24x7 water supply in three cities in Karnataka state. It has
allowed the Bank team to work closely with the government of Karnataka in creating a consensus for the
reforms needed for continuous water supply and for the design of the project. This has included improving
the quality of the various technical and financial models that underpin the project design, the assessment
of different institutional and PPP arrangements, and the organization of workshops to engage a range of
stakeholders.


1.5.4 - GENDER AND WSS
ENGENDERING UWSS - The study examined the neglected area of gender exclusion in WSS in urban
areas in India. See details in Highlight 2 Engendering Urban WSS in India. The final report is under preparation
and the findings will be disseminated widely through workshops and discussions to inform water and sanita-
tion policies at the national scale. This includes the National Urban Sanitation Policy which, at present, does
not mention gender.

               HIGHLIGHT
     ENGENDERING URBAN WSS IN INDIA
     While gender in RWSS has received some attention from policy makers, practitioners and
     academia, the same is not the case with urban WSS. Women suffer the most in urban
     settings due to the lack of access to WSS. This study on Gender and UWSS mainstreams
     attention to gender-based differences in the design and implementation of Bank proj-
     ects in the water and sanitation sector. It also suggests policy changes for gender inclu-
     sive UWSS. Through an extensive literature review and on the ground research in sev-
     eral cities, the obstacles to a gender inclusive approach to water and sanitation service
     delivery were analyzed. The reasons for why urban communities receive poor service
     and the gender implications of this poor service were distinguished. Building capac-
     ity of the service provider and knowledge sharing to ensure political support emerge
     as key factors in overcoming obstacles to gender mainstreaming in the WSS sector.
     As a part of this work, six case studies have been completed across India. They suggest
     two approaches to addressing gender and social exclusion issues in UWSS provision for
     the poor: (1) Household-level provision, which addresses most of the gender and social-
     exclusion issues; and (2) where this is not feasible, improved provision of shared services
     – with a special focus on gender and social exclusion issues. Based on this research, a
     social inclusion plan has been developed for the WSS sector. This plan is built around
     three key ideas – to increase awareness across all stakeholders (decision-makers, util-
     ity staff, academia, media and target groups) about social inclusion issues in UWSS, to
     highlight social inclusion issues in UWSS in the public domain – thus encouraging more
     government attention and action, and to create an institutional platform for joint ac-
     tion across government departments and institutions – for more effective grassroots
     impact. This plan, if buttressed by political support and an efficient service provider,
     could lead to a more inclusive and gender-sensitive service delivery in urban areas of
     India. This model of reform could provide valuable lessons for other cities in the region.

1.5.5 - JUST IN TIME (JIT) SUPPORT
KERALA SANITATION SCOPING - Technical guidance was provided for solid waste management in
Kerala. This was in response to an urgent request from the Chief Minister of the State. A reputable interna-
tional expert in SWM was engaged for this work and the final report suggested a way forward. Based on this
report, the Government of Kerala has expressed interest in a pilot project.

UTTARAKHAND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR RWSS - This JIT activity led to the
development of a menu of options for institutional restructuring of the Jal Nigam and Jal Sansthan, the agen-
cies responsible for delivering water supply and for operations and maintenance respectively, for the State
of Uttarakhand. This has helped the Government of Uttarakhand understand the options and international
good practices for turning-around poorly performing RWSS service providers and institutions.
