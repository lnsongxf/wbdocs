This case study was written by Halimatou Hima and Claudio Santibanez as part of the Delivery Case Studies series produced by the World
Bank’s Nigeria Country Team under the management of Hassan Madu Kida (GWADR) and Katherine Bain (GGODR). The Delivery Case
Studies series—part of the Doing Development Differently initiative—aims to generate knowledge on what works in Nigeria and why.
These cases are one of a number of instruments being piloted to help the World Bank continually improve its effectiveness as a partner
to Nigeria. The Doing Development Differently pilot is task managed by Katherine Bain in the Global Governance Practice. The authors are

observation, and focus groups, supplemented by secondary sources and desk review of project documents,
monitoring and evaluation reports, and existing knowledge on the delivery challenge(s) in question. Interviews
are guided by a protocol tailored to tease out decision-making processes at critical junctures of implementation.
Various other data analysis techniques and tools may be relevant in identifying the causal factors of results and
chronology of the intervention, such as analyses of root cause, systems, social networks, and stakeholder and
political economy, among others.

This case uses the process-tracing method. Interviews are guided by a protocol tailored to identify decision-
making processes at critical points in the implementation process. The case study complements existing World
Bank processes and project review documents, and is not intended to dispute the information and assessment
provided in such documents.

Key research questions include:

•	 How can implementers jointly ensure timely investments in “hardware” (infrastructure) and “software” (institutional)
   reforms to secure sustainable outcomes in the water sector, aligning short-term political incentives to deliver
   tangible results with the long-term goal of ensuring that outcomes are sustainable?
•	 How did individual and/or collective leadership improve financial viability and help overcome institutional
   deadlocks and delays?
•	 What mechanisms were used (in the project’s problem definition, design, and implementation) to reinforce
   accountability in the relationships along the delivery chain (beneficiaries, policy makers, and providers)?
•	 How did incentives shape performance? Did they guide implementers toward or away from improved and
   sustainable results, and how?

      the World Bank supported the NUWSRP1 in the hopes that it could draw in the private sector to revamp water
      supply in Nigeria. The PPP component was controversial, especially in light of the baggage that privatization had
      left behind in the region in the late 1990s. As one high-level officer inside the FMWR stated, “some of the states
      are not readily willing to have private partners come into their operations; they fear that they may lose their jobs
      or may not be able to control the situation—that certain benefits that they are enjoying will no longer be there.”
      The PPP issue was made even more challenging by lukewarm interest from local private investors, who saw Nigeria’s
      water sector as too risky an investment.

      The PPP component in the NUWRSP1 was a weak link that affected stakeholder commitment. One of the World
      Bank Project Task Team Leaders (TTL) saw inadequate stakeholder buy-in as a major deficiency of the project design:
      “[W]e knew we were dealing with a heterogeneous local context. Nigeria is diverse and large, but our relations were
      with one actor in a ministry. Ownership was at the central level” (authors’ interview, July 2014). In dealing with the
      heterogeneous contexts faced by different states, the ability to build consensus, particularly around controversial
      components, creates the space for setting appropriate and relevant targets backed up by accountability measures.

      Kaduna SWA adopted an internally delegated management contract to substitute for full private sector involvement.
      While this approach did not bring about the efficiency gains expected from a full PPP, it did support changes
      in management structures by reinforcing a performance-driven assessment of staff. “[T]his system is a tool that
      can motivate staff to perform better; it places a number of responsibilit[ies] on you, directly.” As staff capacity
      increased, SWA management granted greater operational, managerial, and financial autonomy at the district level
      instead of concentrating all decision making at the state level. “[B]efore every kobo, I had to sign. Now I only see
      the paper” (authors’ interview with a Kaduna SWA officer, September 2014).

      delivering improved services over the years increased the Kaduna SWA’s management legitimacy. One governor
      appointed a general manager to lead the SWA who delivered suboptimal results, without any signs of improvement.
      Pressured by the state’s residents, who had already tasted the benefits of better water services, the governor
      had no choice but to remove that general manager if he wished to survive politically. When political leaders feel
      threatened by weak service delivery, their response is to restore what continues to ensure popular support. The
      prior presence of good management, even if fleeting, had created space for citizens to demand, if not further
      improved services, then at least the maintenance of previous improvements.

      Subsequently, the management of Kaduna’s SWA used its increased negotiating power and legitimacy to establish
      sustained, strategic, and data-driven communication with the political leadership. Understanding the intrinsic
      political incentives was a turning point for the SWA management: “I approached my Honorable Commissioner and
      the Governor with a clear choice: we can continue to make 150,000 people happy or attempt to make 3 million
      happy by delivering better services [...] to do this, these 150,000 utility staff will have to go out and collect revenues.”
      This was the first step the government took in supporting change, granting the SWA greater autonomy to engage
      the reform process and supporting revenue collection.

       Box 5:  The Risk of Isomorphic Mimicry—Promoting Institutional Changes and Reforms
               That Do Not Last
       It is risky to induce changes from the outside if forces from the local environment are pushing in the opposite
       direction. One such problem has to do with institutional behavior that may mimic an institutional change or
       adaptation, as required by some development processes, but without addressing the institutional change needed
       for such reforms. Weak organizational capability for policy implementation can explain why countries and sectors
       are making no, or extremely slow, progress on key development indicators.

       Pritchett et al. (2010) identifies a risk in which systems “can create incentives for organizations and agents (leaders
       and front-line workers) to engage in ‘isomorphic mimicry’ (DiMaggio and Powell 1983), adopting the camouflage of
       organizational forms that are successful elsewhere to hide their actual dysfunction. When isomorphic mimicry is
       a sustainable, if not optimal, organizational strategy, this can result in [negative development outcomes] in which
       the appearance of development activity masks the lack of development activity.” Following such an approach
       may allow organizations and their counterparts in the state to gain legitimacy by adopting the forms or “façade”
       of what are seen as successful institutions, without performing the necessary functions or having the capacity to
       deal with internal and external factors and accomplish the expected outcomes.

Note: When “software” (institutional) reforms are not accompanied by “hardware” (infrastructure) reforms, a delivery gap
arises that can compromise the sustainability of outcomes. To fill the delivery gap, “software” reforms—aided by continuity in
initiatives, commitment of SWA management, and a Board that effectively oversees the organization’s activities and results—
must accompany “hardware” rehabilitation. To secure optimal results over the long term (t1) and reduce the delivery gap,
“software” institutional reforms, which require greater investments in SWAs’ adaptive capabilities, must be sustained (t0 to t1), as
“hardware” investment alone cannot guarantee service delivery over the long term (t1).
