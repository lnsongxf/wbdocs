Executive Summary
Access to reliable and adequate heat supply is critical for the wellbeing of the
population and the delivery of public services in the Kyrgyz Republic. Given the cold
climate and long heating seasons, lasting one-third to one-half of the year, access to
reliable heating services is an essential need in the Kyrgyz Republic. However, in
Bishkek and Tokmok alone, around 20 to 25 percent of residential and public heat
demand remains unmet every year due to insufficient and unreliable heat and
electricity supply in winter.
District heating (DH), once the principal heat source for the largest urban areas, is
deteriorating. The majority of DH assets were commissioned 20 to 50 years ago and
are in poor condition due to insufficient investments in maintenance and
rehabilitation. As a result, generation assets operate at 20 to 50 percent of their
installed capacity and heat losses often exceed 25 percent of the heat generated.
Service quality is also deteriorating; during the heating season in 2013, DH customers
in Bishkek experienced more than 300 network breakdowns, a six-fold increase
compared to the early 1990s.
The main cause of the sector’s decline is financial. Tariffs for heat and electricity are
well below cost-recovery levels. Depending on the heating source, residential tariffs
are estimated to be between 13 and 50 percent of the cost of heat supply. As a result,
most heat suppliers operate at a loss and do not have sufficient funds for proper
maintenance and rehabilitation. This contributes to the continued decay of assets and
results in inefficiency and poor quality of service. Consequently, the heating sector has
become highly dependent on subsidies, both direct subsidies from national or
municipal governments and cross subsidies from electricity (where heat is generated
by combined heat and power plants, or CHPs). At the same time, low electricity tariffs
foster the use of electric heating and provide no incentive to end-consumers to invest
in energy efficiency.
Around 35 percent of households in urban areas rely on electricity for heating,
aggravating winter power shortages. The deteriorating DH supply has increased the
reliance on electricity as a primary heating source, or to supplement insufficient DH
supply. The widespread use of electricity for heating is the main driver of the growing
residential electricity consumption during winter months – from 2009 to 2013,
residential electricity consumption increased by more than 60 percent. Combined
with the poor condition of the aging power infrastructure and low hydropower output
during winter, this increase in electricity load aggravates winter power shortages.
Additionally, a substantial share of urban households use inefficient solid fuel-fired
heating solutions, which negatively affects both health and poverty. With the
increase in natural gas prices over the last decade and the lack of access to DH, about
40 percent of urban households rely on inefficient and polluting coal-fired stoves or
boilers. As a result, the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the two worst-affected countries in
the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region for diseases resulting from indoor air
pollution. Moreover, the use of inefficient solid fuel-fired stoves and boilers results in
20 to 30 percent more coal consumption (and thus, household expenditures on coal)
compared to more efficient models.



                                            iii
The energy performance of residential and public buildings is poor, aggravating the
gap between heat supply and customers’ needs. The age of the building stock, the
lack of maintenance and the absence of proper insulation result in high heat losses
and low comfort levels in many buildings. Based on the results of energy audits
performed, there is significant potential for improving the energy efficiency of the
residential and public building stock (30 to 50 percent of consumption) by
implementing basic energy efficiency measures.
A mix of investment and policy measures is needed to address the key challenges in
the heating sector and meet heat demand in residential and public buildings in a
sustainable manner. The levelized cost assessment (see Figure 1 and Figure 2)
indicates that heat supplied by the CHP continues to be an economically viable heating
solution for buildings currently served by the DH system. Small heat-only boilers
(HOBs) are a cost efficient option for other multi-apartment and public buildings with
an existing building-internal heating network. The replacement of traditional coal- and
wood-fired stoves and boilers by more efficient models would be the most
economically viable solution for individual houses.

The investments and related policy and implementation measures must be
customized for different residential and public buildings. The following investment
and policy measures are recommended based on a multi-criteria assessment that



                                                   iv
combined economic analysis with technical, institutional, environmental and social
considerations:
   Implementation of tariff and social assistance reforms. Tariff reforms are
    important for the sector to ensure that the heating companies have sufficient
    funds to invest in supply-side improvements and consumers have the incentive to
    use energy more efficiently. Tariff reform involves the consistent implementation
    of electricity and heat tariff revisions in line with the recently approved Medium
    Term Tariff Policy (MTTP), and the development and implementation of a clear
    and transparent methodology which ensures that tariffs gradually come to reflect
    the heat provider’s actual cost of service and the consumers’ actual consumption.
    To ensure that a basic level of heat consumption remains affordable to poor
    households, it will also be important to improve the targeting of the social
    assistance program.
   Construction or gradual replacement of small HOBs. The construction or gradual
    replacement of small HOBs by either efficient gas-fired models or an extension of
    the DH network supplied by the CHP in Bishkek is recommended for: all public
    buildings not connected to the DH system; multi-apartment buildings with an
    existing building-internal heating infrastructure (i.e., buildings currently served by
    large or small HOBs); and new public and multi-apartment buildings that will be
    built in the future.
   Rehabilitation of the DH network. To improve the reliability and efficiency of the
    DH system, the following priority investments for the DH network supplied by the
    CHP plant and large HOBs in good operational condition are recommended:
    installation of modern building-level substations, including heat exchanger,
    building-level heat meters and apartment-level hot water meters; the
    replacement or re-insulation of dilapidated pipelines; and the installation of
    variable speed drives at pumping stations.
   Implementation of a scalable program to replace inefficient individual heating
    systems. A scalable program to replace inefficient electric heaters and polluting
    solid fuel-fired stoves with the following efficient individual heating technologies
    is recommended: (i) efficient small gas heaters or boilers for households with
    access to natural gas in the next 2-3 years; (ii) efficient heat pumps for households
    currently relying on electric heaters and without access to gas in the medium-
    term; and (iii) efficient and less polluting small solid fuel-fired stoves or boilers for
    households currently using old coal-fired models and without access to gas in the
    medium-term.
   Implementation of a national energy efficiency program for buildings. As a
    priority, energy efficiency investments should be implemented in buildings where
    the heating systems will be upgraded. The experience in other ECA countries
    demonstrates that linking improvements of heating systems with building energy
    efficiency measures generates significant operational and financial synergies. It is
    also recommended that the Government considers developing a broader energy
    efficiency program for public and/or residential buildings with targeted
    implementation and financing mechanisms. Such a program would also need to be
    accompanied by pricing and billing reforms (i.e. cost-reflective energy prices and
    consumption-based billing), capacity building and public outreach activities as well


                                             v
    as other policy/program enhancements, such as better enforcement of building
    codes or strengthening of homeowner associations (HOAs).

The required investments to ensure reliable heat supply are sizable and should be
carefully planned and sequenced, but the time for action is now. The implementation
of the heating sector investments recommended for Bishkek and Tokmok alone are
estimated to cost around US$225 million in the short-term (see Table 1 below) and
close to US$550 million in the medium- to long-term. The investments would need to
be carefully prioritized and financed through a combination of public (including
concessional donor funding) and private sources. However, action should be taken
now:
 The heating sector is of critical importance for addressing the recurrent winter
    power shortages the country is facing;
   Unless the DH system is improved, its continued deterioration will increasingly
    lead consumers to switching to electric heating and the related dismantling of
    building-internal heating networks, which will likely exacerbate winter power
    shortages and render the future restoration of the DH supply unviable;
   Without critical investments in the transmission and distribution network in
    Bishkek, the network will not be able to absorb the additional heat supplied by the
    modernized CHP plant in Bishkek;
   The MTTP adopted by the Government will gradually improve the financial viability
    of the heating sector but future tariff increases will not be accepted by consumers
    unless these increases are accompanied by improved supply quality and reliability;
   The availability and affordability of natural gas supply is improving since Gazprom
    acquired the majority stake in Kyrgyzgas.

1      Introduction
This report identifies viable heating options and related investment measures to meet
heating demand in urban residential and public buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic. The
report analyzes the condition and performance of the urban heating infrastructure
and building stock. It assesses in detail the heating situation in Bishkek and Tokmok.
These two cities were selected for the following reasons:
 About 40 percent of the residential living area and 90 percent of the multi-
  apartment buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic are located in regions with similar
  climatic conditions as Bishkek and Tokmok.
 They are both located in the northern part of the Kyrgyz Republic, have long and
  cold heating seasons and therefore high heating demands.
 The four heating companies operating in Bishkek and Tokmok supply more than 80
  percent of the total number of district heating (DH) customers in the Kyrgyz
  Republic and produce nearly 80 percent of the total heat produced in the country
  (about 3,100,000 Gcal per year).
 The building structure of both cities includes residential and public buildings, which
  are typical for the remaining urban areas in terms of heat demand.
 Their heating systems include all major heat supply options used in urban areas:
  Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP); large and small Heat only Boilers (HOBs);
  and individual heating systems.
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. The report begins with an
overview of the physical, institutional and regulatory characteristics of the urban
heating sector in the Kyrgyz Republic (Section 2), which includes an analysis of the
building stock. The following two sections (Sections 3 and 4) describe the heat supply
and demand characteristics of Bishkek and Tokmok and quantify the unmet heating
demand in these cities. Section 5 evaluates the available supply and demand-side
measures that could be implemented to improve the heating sectors in the target
cities based on a multi-criteria assessment. Section 6 recommends priority investment
measures to pursue for each building type, identifies related policy measures to
facilitate implementation of the recommended investments, highlights key
implementation issues and describes the next steps necessary to implement them.

2           Overview of the Urban Heating Sector
Roughly 40 percent of the 5.6 million people in the Kyrgyz Republic live in urban areas,
with half of the urban population (870,000 people) living in the capital, Bishkek. Other
large cities include Osh (260,000 people), Jalalabat (90,000 people), Karakol (70,000
people) and Tokmok (60,000 people). Figure 2.1 shows the country’s major cities and
oblasts.

There are three main climatic zones in the Kyrgyz Republic, which are identified by
their approximate number of heating degree days per year. Table 2.1 describes these
climatic zones.1




1   The number of “heating degree days” in a region is an indicator of the energy consumption required to heat a
     building.

2.1         Overview of the Building Stock
There are approximately 2,000 public buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic with a total
heated volume of 20 million m3. There are approximately 1.44 million residential
buildings with floor space of about 83.7 million m2.2 The residential building stock
consists of individual family houses and multi-apartment buildings. Individual family
houses comprise almost 80 percent of the households in the country and 85 percent
(or 70 million m2) of the residential building area. There are 7,725 multi-apartment
buildings, consisting of 255,000 apartments and approximately 14 million m2 of floor
space.3
Both residential and public buildings are characterized by low energy efficiency as the
result of old building stock, inadequate maintenance and the absence of proper
insulation. Newer buildings are in better condition. However, building codes are not
properly enforced, so new buildings are not built for energy efficiency. Energy demand
in individual family houses is particularly high, making this sector the largest consumer
of heat energy in the country.
2.1.1 Residential Buildings
In the residential building sector, rural individual family houses account for the
majority of the residential floor space, while the area of rural multi-apartment
buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic is quite small by comparison. In urban areas, multi-
apartment buildings represent a much larger portion of the total area, but the majority
of the residential area is made up of individual family houses. Figure 2.2 shows the
share of the total residential area by building type and location.

Roughly 40 percent of the buildings and one-third of the total floor space are located
in urban areas. About 40 percent of the urban population lives in multi-apartment
buildings, with the remainder living in individual family houses. Table 2.2 shows the
number of buildings, the floor space and the population for each housing type in urban
areas.

There are four main types of multi-apartment buildings and two main types of single-
family homes in urban areas in the Kyrgyz Republic:
 Brick masonry apartments. These buildings are made from traditional metric
  perforated bricks. The standard thickness of the outside wall is 40 to 50 cm,
  depending on the level of the floor. The walls have exterior lime-cement render
  with paint finish or exposed masonry.
 Panel apartment buildings. The buildings are most commonly made with a three-
  layer wall panel which has an integrated middle layer of thermal insulation. These
  buildings have a wall thickness of 25 to 35 cm.
 Monolithic concrete and concrete frame apartment buildings. These buildings
  typically have outside walls made of expanded clay concrete with expanded clay as


                                                  4
      thermal insulation. The outside walls have a thickness of about 35 cm. There is
      almost no additional thermal insulation.
 Newly constructed apartment buildings. These buildings usually have a skeleton
  structure with brick wall filling. They may also have sandwich panels, both with and
  without insulation. The outside walls have a thickness of about 25 to 30 cm.
 Clay individual family houses. This type of individual family house is made from
  mud bricks/blocks or cob.4 The thickness of the outside wall is typically 30 to 40 cm.
  The walls are sometimes plastered by a straw/clay mixture and are coated with an
  aqueous solution of slaked lime.
 Brick masonry individual family houses. This type of house is made from traditional
  solid bricks. The standard thickness of the outer walls is 38 cm. The walls have
  exterior and interior lime-cement render and lime paint finish or exterior exposed
  masonry. There is almost no additional thermal insulation of the walls.
Clay individual family houses are the most prevalent type of building, followed by
panel apartment buildings and brick apartment buildings. Figure 2.3 shows the
proportion of each type of residential building in urban areas.

2.1.2 Energy Performance of the Building Stock
Residential buildings are a major consumer of both heat energy and electricity in the
country. The residential sector accounts for about 19 percent of final energy
consumption6 and 60 percent of electricity consumption.7 An important factor
contributing to the high share of residential energy consumption is the relatively poor
energy performance of the existing residential building stock, especially in multi-

    There are an estimated 587,630 households in urban areas, including dwellings in multi-apartment buildings and
    assuming one household per individual family house.

buildings were built between the 1960s and 1980s.
Energy Performance of Residential Buildings
The different residential building types vary in their heat requirements, as indicated in
Table 2.3. The table shows that individual family houses (made of clay or brick) tend
to have the highest specific energy demand of all residential building types.

Walk-through energy-audits performed as part of this assessment indicate that the
energy performance of residential building stock in the Kyrgyz Republic could be
improved by an average of 35 to 50 percent. Figure 2.4 shows that average residential
heat energy demand in Bishkek is higher than in a number of European countries.

Residential buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic are characterized by relatively high specific
heat demand mainly for the following reasons:
 The absence of proper thermal insulation. In apartment buildings, heat losses are
  especially high on the first and top floors because basements are not heated and
  roofs are poorly insulated.
 The poor condition of windows. Windows typically are in poor condition within
  dwelling areas as well as in communal areas. As a result, they are highly air
  permeable, which contributes to heat losses.
 Insufficient maintenance and repairs. Due to the lack of funds and weak HOAs,
  common areas in buildings are not properly maintained or rehabilitated in many
  multi-apartment buildings.
 Insufficient enforcement of building codes. Overall, the energy performance of
  new buildings is better than in older buildings, but they are often not built to be
  energy efficient because the energy efficiency requirements in building codes are
  not well enforced.
A range of other legal, regulatory, institutional and financial issues impedes the
implementation of energy efficiency investments and proper maintenance of the
residential building stock. Section 2.4 further describes these barriers.
Many households do seek to improve the energy efficiency of their homes in order to
increase comfort levels and reduce energy bills. However, the measures are relatively
limited and do not have a major impact on energy performance. In the World Bank’s
recent Qualitative Assessment on Poverty and Social Impact of Energy Reforms in the
Kyrgyz Republic, all respondents indicated that they implement some form of energy



                                                   7
efficiency measures, including: (i) lining and covering windows and doors with
insulation tapes; (ii) putting rugs on floors and walls; and (iii) closing ventilation vents.
Energy Performance of Public Buildings
The majority of public buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic were constructed between 25
and 60 years ago during the Soviet period, and are relatively energy inefficient. Specific
heat demand tends to be highest in educational buildings, as shown below in Table
2.4. Walk-through energy audits performed in schools, kindergartens and hospitals
indicated that basic energy efficiency measures (e.g., insulation of the building
envelope, replacement of windows and doors, etc.) could reduce energy consumption
in public buildings by around 30 percent.

2.2      Overview of Heat Supply Systems
Heat in the Kyrgyz Republic is supplied by various systems, ranging in size from large,
centralized DH systems to individual portable heating devices. Most of the DH system
and HOBs were designed for gas, but many of them have been converted to burn coal
or use electricity. This has reduced the efficiency of the boilers and (where coal is
burned) contributed to air pollution.
As gas became more scarce and expensive in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Union, many households that were not served by the DH system began to rely on
electricity for heating. Households that are supplied with DH also use electricity for
additional heating to supplement the heat supplied by the DH system. This increases
demand for electricity at peak hours, which strains the power grid and has contributed
to an increase in power outages during winter months.
While the decreasing availability and increasing price of gas has been a major factor
impacting the heating situation over the last decade, recent developments in the
restructuring of the gas sector in the Kyrgyz Republic suggest that natural gas might
again become a more reliable and affordable source for heating purposes.
2.2.1 Main Heating Sources in the Kyrgyz Republic
Nationally, stoves are the most prevalent source of heating for urban households
outside Bishkek, followed by electric heating (37 percent) and DH (9 percent). By
contrast, in Bishkek, 43 percent of households rely on DH as a main source of heat,
followed by electric heating (21 percent) and stoves (22 percent). Table 2.5 describes
households’ main sources of heating by settlement type.

2.2.2 DH
DH provides heat to about 19 percent of the total urban population. DH is available in
urban areas of the regions Chui (which includes Bishkek and Tokmok), Osh, Jalalabat,
Talas, Naryn and Issyk-Kul. Table 2.6 below shows the penetration rate of DH in 11
major cities in the Kyrgyz Republic, which account for more than 90 percent of the
urban population.

Between 18 and 63 percent of the households living in these cities are supplied by DH
systems. DH customers in Bishkek, Osh and Tokmok comprise about 80 percent of the
DH customers countrywide. Other urban areas do not have large DH systems either
because of the small heat loads and the prevalence of individual houses, or because
DH systems are no longer operational due to the poor condition of DH assets and/or
the lack of reliable and affordable gas supply.
Four state-owned companies provide approximately 90 percent of DH supply in the
country. Small boiler houses, which are owned by regional or city administrations or
government agencies (e.g., Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health) supply
the remaining 10 percent of DH. Box 2.1 describes the four state-owned companies.

 Electric Power Plants OJSC
 Electric Power Plants (EPP) Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) owns and operates the
 Bishkek and Osh CHPs. In Bishkek, heat and hot water are sold to Bishkekteploset, which
 is responsible for the transmission and distribution to end-consumers. Electricity is fed
 into JSC Severelectro’s network, and steam is directly sold to 22 public and commercial
 customers, with heat loads between 20 and 60 ton/h.
 Kyrgyzhilkommunsoyuz SUE
 Kyrgyzhilkommunsoyuz (KZhK) State Unitary Enterprise (SUE), which is also known as “the
 state association of housing and utility companies and organizations” of the Kyrgyz
 Republic, is the largest DH service provider in terms of geographical coverage and the
 second largest service provider in terms of heat production. KZhK generates and
 distributes 17 percent of DH supplied throughout the country and provides DH services to
 24 cities and district centers in six regions.
 KZhK was established in 1991 as a voluntary association of Kyrgyz housing and utility
 companies and other various organizations. KZhK provides several types of services in the
 housing and utility sectors in addition to DH.
 Bishkekteploset JSC
 Bishkekteploset (BTS) Joint Stock Company (JSC) distributes heat generated by Bishkek
 CHP to DH customers in Bishkek city. BTS also distributes hot water and steam. For some
 multi-apartment buildings, BTS also performs maintenance and repairs of the building-
 internal heating infrastructure against a fee. These are based on separate agreements
 with the condominium owners. Heat distributed by BTS accounts for 69 percent of total
 thermal generation for DH.
 BTS was established in 2001 when the state-owned, vertically-integrated electricity
 company, Kyrgyzenergo JSC, was unbundled. BTS is 80 percent owned by the State
 Property Fund of the Kyrgyz Republic.
 BishkekTeploEnergo SUE
 BishkekTeploEnergo (BTE) SUE is a vertically-integrated, municipally-owned DH company
 which serves the areas of Bishkek city not covered by BTS (approximately 60 percent of
 the city). Heat generated and distributed by BTE accounts for approximately six percent
 of total thermal generation for DH nationally. The company was founded by the Mayor’s
 Office of Bishkek City in 1986.


In 2012, around 3,088,000 Gcal heat energy was produced by DH systems in the
country. About 75 percent of the total heat energy was generated in Bishkek. Table
2.7 presents data about the size of the main DH companies’ customer bases, as well
as the amount of heat they generated for their respective service areas. EPP, the
operator of the CHP in Bishkek, produces the vast majority of the district heat
produced in the country.

Heat supplied by these companies is produced in 269 boiler houses with an annual
fuel input of about 5,320,000 Gcal (2012). Total fuel consumption of DH companies in
2012 amounted to 912,000 tons coal, 46,000 tons mazut, 214 GWh power and
80,000,000 m3 natural gas.10 As shown in Figure 2.5 below, coal accounted for 76
percent of primary fuel consumption, followed by gas (12 percent) and mazut (8
percent).

2.2.3 Small HOBs
Small HOBs primarily provide heating for buildings that are not connected to the DH
system. In addition to small HOBs operated by DH companies, there are about 2,500
small HOBs owned and operated by public institutions and used to heat schools,
kindergartens, hospitals and other public buildings. As indicated in Table 2.9 below,
more than half of these HOBs are electricity-based. Most of the rest of the small HOBs
are coal-fired.

2.2.4 Individual Heating Systems
Individual heating systems for space heating in urban areas include individual coal or
wood stoves and boilers, gas heaters and boilers, electric oil radiators, air conditioning
units that can be used as heat pumps, individual space heaters and hot water boilers.
Solid fuel-fired stoves or boilers are used by 40 percent of the individual family homes
in urban areas without connections to the DH system. Most of the stoves and boilers
are characterized by low efficiency, which increases coal consumption by 20 to 30
percent compared to more efficient models. As a result of the high indoor pollution
caused by the traditional stove models in use, the Kyrgyz Republic ranks among the
two worst-affected countries in the ECA region for diseases resulting from indoor air
pollution. In terms of indoor air pollution influenced mortality proportionate to the
population, measured in terms of Daily Adjusted Life Years, the Kyrgyz Republic
compares to India. According to the results of the recently conducted Qualitative
Assessment on Poverty and Social Impact of Energy Reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic,
households mainly opt for coal-based stoves and boilers over electric devices because
of their low costs and because operation is not interrupted by frequent power
outages.
Nearly 30 percent of urban households rely on electric radiators as their primary
source of heating. Even where DH supply is available, residents of multi-apartment
buildings use electrical appliances for heating either outside of the period of the year
when DH heat is provided or to increase comfort levels. This high reliance on electricity
for heating is a main driver for the high residential electricity consumption and
contributes to winter power shortages, as further described in Section 2.3.3. Based on
the findings of the above referenced qualitative assessment on energy reforms in the
Kyrgyz Republic, electrical appliances are popular for residential heating because of
their low capital costs, relatively low operational costs (as a result of highly subsidized



                                                 14
electricity tariffs), and ease of installation and use. They also produce no local
emissions.
2.3         Fuel Supply for Heating in the Kyrgyz Republic
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Unified Energy System significantly altered
the use of fuels for heating in the Kyrgyz Republic. Natural gas was the main design
fuel for the heat supply system in the Kyrgyz Republic, but shortages in gas supply and
substantial price increases since the 1990s have resulted in fuel switching for heating.
Between 1992 and 2011, natural gas consumption dropped by around 80 percent from
2,400 million m3 to 400 million m3. The conversion of many HOBs from burning gas to
burning coal caused substantial decreases in boiler efficiency and capacity. As of 2011,
coal and electricity supplied a higher proportion of total primary energy for heating
than gas.
2.3.1 Gas
Natural gas is mostly imported from Kazakhstan (supplying the northern part of the
Kyrgyz Republic) and Uzbekistan (supplying the southern regions of the country).
However, in the past, political and pricing issues led to recurrent interruptions of gas
supplies. These interruptions decreased the reliability and availability of gas-fired DH
in the country. The most recent incident occurred in April 2014 when gas exports were
suspended from Uzbekistan to the southern regions of Osh and Jalalabat. These two
regions account for around 15 percent of the overall gas consumption in the Kyrgyz
Republic.
Recent developments in the Kyrgyz gas sector may improve gas supply reliability,
which could affect the heating fuel mix. At the end of 2013, the Russian gas company
Gazprom JSC bought the majority of shares in “Kyrgyzgas” SUE for 25 years. After this
purchase, the gas import price decreased to US$165 per 1000 m3. Retail gas tariffs for
residential customers dropped from 16 Som/m3 to 12.93 Som/m3. Gazprom is
currently developing a gasification plan through 2030 and has committed to invest in
the rehabilitation of the existing gas infrastructure and the development of the Kyrgyz
Republic’s indigenous natural gas reserves (estimated at six million m3). Gazprom’s
involvement could lead to more reliable gas supply, but the specific scope of
gasification and rehabilitation is still unknown, as are the more general implications
for the heating sector.
2.3.2 Coal
The Kyrgyz Republic has relatively large coal reserves, but there are significant
bottlenecks for scaling-up domestic production.11 Existing facilities for coal
exploration are depreciated and in poor condition. The country also lacks large scale
coal transportation infrastructure. Coal is mostly transported by truck.
Final coal consumption has more than doubled in the last decade, increasing from 0.2
mtoe in 2000 to about 0.54 mtoe in 2011. During the same period, local coal
production increased by more than 160 percent to 0.42 mtoe (2012 estimate).



11   Coal is found in the Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Jalalabat, Osh and Batken regions. There are about 70 known coal fields in
     four coal basins. Recoverable coal resources are estimated at 1.3 billion tons. The largest coal field is Kara-Keche.



                                                             15
Imports increased by around 40 percent to 0.44 mtoe (2012 estimate).12 The largest
consumer of coal is the CHP in Bishkek. The Government plans to further increase
domestic coal production.
2.3.3 Electricity
Seventy-eight percent of electric generating capacity in the Kyrgyz Republic (2,870
MW) is provided by hydropower. Electricity consumption increased significantly in the
last couple of years. The largest portion of that growth in consumption was
attributable to residential consumers during winter months. From 2009 to 2012,
winter consumption grew by 62 percent, while summer consumption increased by 16
percent (see Figure 2.6 below).13

        kyrgyz-republic


As a result of this growth in electricity consumption, partly driven by the high reliance
on electricity for heating purposes, the Kyrgyz Republic now has higher rates of
household electricity consumption per month than many other countries in ECA.
Figure 2.7 below compares monthly household electricity consumption rates in
different countries from 2007 to 2011.

The widespread use of electric heating adds significant load on the strained electricity
network and aggravates winter power deficits. For instance, between January and
May 2014, residential customers with three-phase electrical connections (used for
heating) consumed almost 30 percent of the total electricity supplied in the country
although they only account for a very small share of residential consumers. Box 2.2
describes the effects of electricity demand and consumption growth on the reliability
of the power supply in the Kyrgyz Republic.

 Box 2.2: Electricity Demand and Consumption Growth in Recent Years and the
 Effect on the Reliability of Power Supply in the Kyrgyz Republic
 Electricity consumption has increased significantly in the Kyrgyz Republic in the last couple
 of years. The largest portion of that growth in consumption was attributable to residential
 consumers during winter months. From 2009 to 2012, winter consumption grew by 62
 percent, while summer consumption increased by 16 percent. The heavy reliance on
 electricity for heating is one of the main reasons for the high winter electricity load. It puts
 increasing strain on the capacity of the aging power sector assets.
 As a result of the condition and strained capacity of power assets, power supply reliability
 and quality is deteriorating. In recent years, there have been frequent emergency shut-
 downs of assets, especially during winter months. The four distribution companies
 reported an average of 43 outages per day between 2009 and 2012. Company data also
 show that the number of outages tends to be much higher in the first and fourth quarter
 of the year (i.e., the beginning and the end of the heating season, coinciding with the
 period before and after provision of DH supply). While the use of electricity for heating
 purposes aggravates winter power shortages, frequent power outages during winter
 months seriously affect the living conditions of the large share of the population relying
 on electricity for heating.

2.4    Overview of the Institutional, Legal and Regulatory Framework in
       the Heating Sector
The Kyrgyz Republic has a relatively recent and robust foundation of heating sector
policies and laws. Implementation, however, is weak because of a lack of
enforcement, financing and capacity. The DH utilities, in particular, are constrained by
tariffs which have long been below the cost of service. The low tariffs prevent them
from properly maintaining and investing in the system. As a result, the utilities depend
on subsidies from municipal governments and extensive cross-subsidies from the
electricity sector.
2.4.1 Energy Policy and Laws
The principal policy document in the heating sector is the Long-term Strategy for Heat
Supply in the Kyrgyz Republic (2004-2015). The strategy plans for: (i) the introduction
of a new tariff system; (ii) the commercialization of HOBs and the creation of a
decentralized heating market; (iii) support of condominium associations, and (iv)
technical rehabilitation of the existing assets.
The laws “On Energy” and “On Electric Energy” (amended in July 2014) are the
principal laws in the sector. They define the basic legal and organizational principles
and methods for regulating economic activities in the sector. Other key legislative acts
are the laws “On Energy Saving” (2013) and “On Renewable Energy Sources” (2012).
These give a general framework for implementation of the priorities set forth by the
national policy.




                                                18
The principle documents in the building sector include the law “On Energy Efficiency
in Buildings” (2013) and construction standards and regulations (SNIPs). The major
standards, which have been adopted and amended in recent years, give
comprehensive rules for residential, public and other buildings. The rules are generally
in line with international practice. They introduce ambitious targets for specific energy
demand as well as a certification system for the energy performance of buildings.
However, the energy performance regulations for new buildings do not solve the
problem of the overall poor condition and energy inefficiency of the existing housing
stock.
While the legislative framework for energy efficiency and heating appears to be quite
comprehensive, secondary norms and regulations (SNIPs) related to the use of
efficient equipment and material (e.g., use of pre-insulated pipes for rehabilitating the
transmission and distribution network) need to be updated. In addition,
implementation and enforcement of sector legislation and regulation to date remain
limited and ad hoc.
2.4.2 Institutional Framework
The heating sector is at the intersection of three major industries: energy,
construction and housing. Many different institutions are involved in the sector. Key
responsibilities, including policy-making and the development of laws and standards,
are distributed across various governmental bodies at the central level. Other key
functions, such as supervision and setting tariffs, are spread both horizontally and
vertically. This arrangement gives rise to overlap and necessitates coordination. Table
2.10 below shows the heating sector responsibilities of the governmental bodies
involved.

                                          Ministry of Finance. BTE receives some financing as part
                                          of the municipal budget, because it is owned by the
                                          Mayor’s Office of Bishkek.


Ownership of the major assets for heating systems is spread among various entities,
including governmental bodies, companies, and end-users. Pricing and quality of
supply depends on interactions between several entities in the supply chain. For
example, BTS, which owns and operates the heat transmission and distribution
network, depends on EPP, which owns the CHP plant in Bishkek and supplies the heat.
Building residents are responsible for maintaining the piping and other heat facilities
inside their own buildings (or contracting out the maintenance of these facilities either
to third parties or the respective DH company).15 As a result, the heat supply
companies are dependent upon building residents for the maintenance of the heat
supply pipes within their buildings.
The interdependencies lead to operational inefficiencies. The heating system was
originally designed as a whole, but the fragmented institutional structure and the

14   As of June 2014, the Government made amendments to the Energy Law, Electricity Law and Law on Natural
     Monopolies that give the Regulatory Agency sole responsibility for energy sector regulation, including tariff
     setting responsibilities.
15   The heat supply companies were responsible for maintenance of the heat supply pipes within residential and
     public buildings, but the 1997 adoption of the Law on Condominiums passed responsibility for building-level
     utility infrastructure to building residents.



                                                         21
overlapping procedures and responsibilities among institutions hampers consistent
and systematic efforts to improve the heating system.
At the end-consumer level, housing management and maintenance of the existing
privatized stock create an additional challenge to improving infrastructure. Owners
are obligated to pay for maintenance, management and cleaning services, but they
lack funding. Even in buildings with Homeowner Associations (HOAs), maintenance
and major repairs are difficult to organize.16 Box 2.3 summarizes some of the key
difficulties presented in financing investments in energy efficiency.

     Box 2.3: Key Barriers to Energy Efficiency
     There are a number of technical, institutional, financial, regulatory and policy barriers
     which impede energy efficiency investments in the residential and public building sector
     in the Kyrgyz Republic. Among these barriers are: the low market capacity for preparing,
     implementing and financing energy efficiency investments (e.g., energy auditing
     companies, design companies, financial institutions, construction companies, etc.); lack of
     awareness; lack of access to affordable financing for energy efficiency; the low financial
     viability and lack of incentives to invest in energy efficiency due to the low energy tariffs
     and norm-based billing practices; incomplete regulatory and enforcement framework for
     energy efficiency (e.g., standards for energy efficient appliance and materials;
     enforcement of building codes); etc.
     In addition, a specific barrier to energy efficiency in the residential sector is a misalignment
     of incentives and responsibilities within multi-apartment buildings. Common spaces in
     residential buildings and centralized building-level heating systems often account for a
     large portion of energy savings potential. Simple repairs to doors, windows and hallways
     in common areas as well as heating system upgrades can yield substantial savings in
     heating costs to individual apartments. Experience from other countries in the ECA region
     indicates that low-cost weatherization can raises the indoor temperature by three to five
     degrees Celsius. More elaborate measures can save up to seven degrees Celsius.
     HOAs in multi-apartment buildings could facilitate the implementation of energy
     efficiency improvements. However, even where HOAs exist, the contributions of tenants
     to repair funds are generally very low. A large proportion of tenants refuse to make any
     payments into these funds. Furthermore, although HOAs are legal entities, it is very
     difficult for them to gain access to financing for improvements. Banks are reluctant to lend
     because they cannot foreclose on residents if they do not repay their loans.


2.4.3 Tariff Regulation
Heat tariffs for residential consumers are applicable countrywide independent of the
heating source. For public and other consumers supplied by HOBs, tariffs are linked
partially to the actual cost of heat supply and can vary substantially depending on the
source.
The Government recently adopted the Medium Term Tariff Policy (MTTP) and enacted
tariff increases for heat and hot water supply in 2014 and 2015, increasing residential

16   The organization of housing management is more efficient in up-new construction, as it is driven primarily by
     private developers. Private developers often contract-out maintenance, and the cost of such maintenance and
     future refurbishment are rolled into the apartment rental or purchase costs.

consumer tariffs by more than 28 percent from Som 715/Gcal to Som 917/Gcal (2014)
and Som 1,134.76/Gcal in 2015. Table 2.12 below shows DH tariffs for residential and
public consumers. Due to the lack of metering, heat and hot water is mainly billed
based on norms determined from a number of factors, including the heated area and
the number of residents.

The residential DH and hot water tariffs are well below cost recovery levels. Depending
on the heating source, residential tariffs cover between 13 and 50 percent of the cost
of heat supply. For example, the average cost of heat supply by KZhK in 2013 was
5,446 Som/Gcal, but the residential tariff at that time was 715 Som/Gcal
(approximately 13 percent of the cost of heat supply). The situation was similar for the
non-residential tariff at KZhK.
For large and small HOBs, current tariffs are calculated for each particular facility
based on actual billable costs for the heat it supplies. The heat supplier submits the
calculated costs for each boiler for annual approval by the respective authorities. In
the past, these authorities have included both the State Agency for Antimonopoly
Regulation and the State Regulatory Agency of the Fuel and Energy Complex.
Table 2.13 below shows the costs of selected types of HOBs operated by BTE and
Tokmok KZhK SUE.

BTS is different than the other heating companies in that the company only provides
heat delivery services. EPP (which supplies heat from the CHP 1 plant to BTS) sells heat
to BTS at a substantially discounted price. The wholesale tariff for BTS was 75 to 90
percent below the cost of heat production at the CHP 1 in 2007-2012, as shown in
Figure 2.8 below. EPP makes up for the financial losses it incurs from selling below-
cost heat to BTS by earning revenue from electricity exports.

Even after the envisaged heat tariff increase in April 2015, weighted end-user tariffs
remain 300 percent below the cost of heat supply incurred by BTS and EPP, as
indicated in Figure 2.9 below.

Fuel costs are the primary driver of heat generation costs. In 2013, the average cost
of supply for boilers operated by BTE was 3,666 Som/Gcal. The average cost by fuel
was 3,729 Som/Gcal for gas; 3,381 Som/Gcal for coal; and 3,314 Som/Gcal for
electricity. Operational costs are also dependent on the size and efficiency of the
boiler. The cost of gas at gas boilers ranged from a low of 2,200 Som/Gcal to a high of
10,597 Som/Gcal. To minimize costs, the companies planned to or did convert gas-
fired HOBs to coal. The companies have also discussed the conversion or replacement
of electric HOBs with coal due to the low reliability of the electricity supply in recent
years.
Because tariffs for most heat suppliers are so far below cost-recovery levels, most heat
suppliers operate at a loss. For example, KZhK operated at a deficit of more than 1.2
billion Som in 2013. Figure 2.10 below shows costs and estimated revenues for KZhK
and BTE in 2012. Costs were 77 percent higher than revenues for both companies.

There are a number of additional regulatory issues related to the tariff setting process,
which are further described in Appendix A. Box 2.4 discusses the subsidies that are
provided to heat companies to help them cover their operational costs.

 Box 2.4: Subsidy of Heat Supply Utilities
 Municipally-owned heat supply companies receive financial support from the municipality
 to cover costs that are not covered by tariffs. The state-owned DH system in Bishkek does
 not receive direct subsidies but is extensively cross subsidized by the power sector.
 However, companies are not always fully compensated for their revenue gaps. In Bishkek
 and Tokmok, the city councils are supposed to pay the DH companies (BTE and KZhK,
 respectively) for the difference between the costs and revenue raised by the existing
 residential tariffs. However, there are often delays with the payments. Sometimes the
 compensation is only partial.
 Furthermore, the direct and cross subsidies received only cover operational costs.
 As a result, all major DH companies lack funds for maintenance and rehabilitation
 of their existing assets. Heating tariffs are supposed to take depreciation expenses
 into account, but the allowed depreciation expenses are too low because the
 assets are undervalued. A lack of funds for maintenance and rehabilitation
 contributes to the continued decay of the existing infrastructure.

In addition, the implicit subsidies for heat and hot water (as a result of the below cost-
recovery tariffs) are regressive and predominantly benefit the upper 50 percent of the
population, as indicated in Figure 2.11 below.

2.5     Affordability of Heat Supply
Energy poverty is on average lower than in some of the Kyrgyz Republic’s ECA peers,
but can vary considerably depending on the location and the population segment.




                                                 26
Moreover, energy poverty rates are low largely because end-user energy tariffs are
substantially below cost-recovery levels.
2.5.1 Poverty and Energy Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic
In 2013, 37 percent of the population of the Kyrgyz Republic lived in poverty, and an
estimated 2.8 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty. Figure 2.12 below
indicates that the gap in poverty between rural and urban areas narrowed between
2009 and 2012 but that this trend changed in 2013 due to a significant decline in urban
poverty rates.

Energy affordability is an important concern during the winter months in the Kyrgyz
Republic when energy needs are highest. However, because of the exceptionally low
electricity and heat tariffs, the Kyrgyz Republic has a lower prevalence of energy
poverty than other ECA countries.17 Figure 2.13 compares energy poverty rates in ECA
countries and indicates that about 25 percent of households in Kyrgyzstan are energy
poor.




17   A household is considered to be in a state of energy poverty if it spends more than 10 percent of its total
     expenditures on energy such as electricity and heat.



                                                        27

Note: Horizontal dashed lines indicate average regional energy poverty rates.


The percentage of total household expenditures spent on energy varies by settlement
type (urban or rural). On average, households spend 7.2 percent of household
expenditures on energy. In Bishkek, the proportion of household expenditure on
energy (9 percent) is higher than the national average. Households in urban areas
other than Bishkek devote on average seven percent of their expenditures to energy,
while rural households spend 6.6 percent.
Expenditure by heating source differs by location. In Bishkek, the average household
spends 1.6 percent of its household expenditures on DH services, 2.5 percent on
electricity, 2.7 percent on piped gas, 0.6 percent on solid fuels and 1.7 percent on hot
water. In other urban and rural areas where households rely mostly on solid fuels such
as wood or coal, households spend 2.9 and 3.9 percent of their energy expenditures
obtaining them, respectively (other heat sources account for the other 4.2 and 2.7
percent of household energy expenditures for these two groups). Coal expenditures
are higher in rural areas because of the higher reliance on coal, and the additional
transaction and transportation costs. Figure 2.14 shows households’ annual energy
expenditure by source, settlement type and as a proportion of total household
expenditures per capita.

Total Household Expenditures

Households across all income groups spend a similar proportion of their household
expenditures on energy. Households in the poorest quintile spend about six percent
while households in the highest quintile spend about seven percent (see Figure 2.15).

of Total Household Expenditures

The recently conducted Quantitative Poverty and Social Impact Assessment indicates
that the enacted increase in tariffs for DH and hot water will have only a marginal
impact on the level of poverty. Based on simulations, the tariff increases are expected
to result in the share of total household expenditures spent on heating increasing from
2.4 percent to 3.2 percent for DH and from 2 to 3.2 percent for hot water for those
households connected to DH – a relatively moderate impact. The decrease in real




                                                 29
income for the poorest quintile of the population is also limited, at only 0.9 percent
for DH and 1.3 percent for hot water on average.
2.5.2 Coping Mechanisms for Managing Energy Expenditures in the Kyrgyz
      Republic
Focus group discussions revealed that households employ a variety of coping
strategies to pay for heat energy in winter.18 Urban households use budgeting and
prepayment in order to cope with higher energy expenditures during winter months.
Rural households sell livestock or crops. Borrowing money is a last resort for all
households. Some households that use coal as a heating source attempt to purchase
coal in bulk during the non-heating season. However, many poor households and
farmers do not have sufficient funds before the harvest to pre-purchase coal. For
households able to purchase coal in the non-heating season, coal storage has potential
health hazards and can be risky. Coal must be kept in a dry and confined environment
to prevent ignition or contamination. In addition to bulk fuel purchasing, households
employ energy saving and efficiency techniques to lower their energy expenditures
during winter. Most commonly, they insulate windows and doors. They also switch off
lights or remove some light bulbs from light fixtures in the house.
In addition, switching to consumption-based billing for households could help to
mitigate the impact of future tariff increases on DH customers. For instance, BTS
compared heating bills for three buildings over two heating seasons, one when based
on metered consumption and one when based on norms (see Figure 2.16 below). The
heating bills in the three buildings (Microdistricts 11, 12 and 4) were 10, 20 and 45
percent lower, respectively, when billing was based on metered consumption.

Based Billing

3           Heat Supply and Demand in Bishkek
Bishkek is the capital and largest city of the Kyrgyz Republic. It has the status of both
a city and a region. The official population is 874,400 people with an historical growth
rate of roughly two percent per year. Bishkek has a continental climate and belongs
to climatic region II with 2,970 degree days (0.2°C average outdoor air temperature
during the heating season; 20°C design indoor air temperature). The average length of
the heating season is 150 days.
The residential building stock in Bishkek consists of 89,000 individual family houses
(44 percent of the residential floor space) and 2,500 apartment buildings, which make
up the rest of the residential area. The city also has around 1,000 public buildings. The
aging building stock is characterized by poor energy performance and high heat losses.
Most of the space heating in Bishkek is provided by two centralized DH systems. Small,
building-level HOBs, individual electric radiators and coal- or wood-fired stoves and
boilers are also used for heating (the latter, especially, in individual houses). There is
a sizable gap between heat demand and supply in Bishkek. An estimated 20 percent
of heat demand in residential buildings and 30 percent of heat demand in individual
family houses is not met.19 The gap is the result of the poor energy efficiency of most
buildings and the poor condition of the heat supply infrastructure which has suffered
for years from lack of maintenance and investment. These issues result in poor supply
reliability and service quality.
3.1         Heat Supply in Bishkek
The following systems provide heat in Bishkek:
             EPP’s CHP plant (CHP 1), and BTS’ DH network which delivers heat from the
              CHP in Bishkek
             57 large and small HOBs owned and operated by BTE
             230 small HOBs owned and operated by various public buildings and private
              multi-apartment buildings
             Individual heating systems, including electric heaters and solid fuel-fired
              stoves
DH systems serve 98 percent of the multi-apartment buildings and 92 percent of the
public buildings in Bishkek. Individual houses rely almost exclusively on individual
systems. Table 3.1 summarizes how heat is supplied to residential and public buildings
in Bishkek.

     heat demand.

Note: This table only shows the primary heating source used by different building types and excludes
      newly constructed ‘elite buildings’ due to the lack of available data. The share of households
      relying on individual heating systems would be significantly higher, if the use of individual
      solutions as secondary source were included. A recent survey conducted by Unison and USAid
      found that many households use multiple heat supply options. For instance, a large share of
      multi-apartment residents use some form of individual heat supply option in addition to DH or
      small HOB-based heat supply.


3.1.1 DH System Supplied by CHP 1
Most of the floor space in Bishkek is heated by EPP’s CHP plant through BTS’ DH
network. Both the CHP and the distribution network are in poor condition because of
age, under-maintenance and lack of investment.
CHP
CHP 1 operates primarily to meet winter heating demand, producing electricity as a
byproduct. In 2012, the plant generated 2,142,000 Gcal of heat energy, 969,000 MWh
of electricity and 152,000 Gcal of steam.
The CHP was commissioned in 1961. It was built with a capacity of 666 MW electrical
and 1,679 MW thermal. The plant’s poor condition, however, limits available capacity
to 116 MW electrical and 1,030 MW thermal energy. According to EPP, 11 of 24 boilers
are no longer in operation, the remaining boilers in operation have relatively low
efficiency, and the level of wear and tear of the major equipment exceeds 80 percent.
The plant is designed to burn gas, coal and mazut, but coal accounts now for 97
percent of the fuel burned at the facility. Table 3.2 compares the CHP’s operations
now to its operations when commissioned.

The Government has secured a Chinese loan of US$390 million to modernize the CHP
1 plant. Reportedly, the rehabilitation will include dismantling of steam generation
units (No. 1-8) and turbo sets (No. 1-4), and the installation of two new coal steam
generation units (550 t/h) and two new turbo sets (150 MW). Modernization work was
underway in 2014 with expected completion in 2016. This will result in a total capacity
of 550 MW.


                                                33
There is a second CHP (CHP 2) in Bishkek, which was only operational for one winter
season. Box 3.1 below describes the history of CHP 2.

 Box 3.1: Information on CHP 2 (Bishkek)
 Construction of CHP 2 began in 1985 and included two phases: i) the installation of six
 steam HOBs; and ii) the installation of two steam 400 MWel units. In 1992, the first boiler
 began operations. Five km of transmission pipelines were constructed to supply the
 Bishkek DH system with hot water. A second boiler was commissioned in 1993.
 The plant only operated during the 1992-1993 heating season. After the collapse of the
 Soviet Union, gas prices increased significantly, the number of industrial heat consumers
 dropped substantially because of the economic crisis in the country and new construction
 of residential buildings came to a halt. The plant was eventually shut down because of the
 financial burden of operating it and the reduction in heat demand.
 CHP 2 is in poor condition. Considerable investment would be needed to make the plant
 operational again. Upgrades would have to be made to boilers and auxiliary equipment.
 EPP has estimated that rehabilitation would cost about 140 million Som (US$2.6 million),
 not including the costs of new pumping stations and a distribution system to connect with
 new residential areas.


BTS’s DH Transmission and Distribution Network
As described in Section 2.2.2, heat generated by CHP 1 feeds into the transmission and
distribution network of BTS to provide space heat and hot water to densely populated
areas in the central and southern parts of Bishkek. The network operated by BTS
includes 28 km overground and 112 km underground transmission pipelines, and 49
km overground and 197 km underground distribution pipelines. Figure 3.2 shows a
map of BTS’s DH transmission and distribution network.
In 2012, the company provided 1,372,075 Gcal heat to more than 100,000 customers,
including about 83 percent of all residential multi-apartment buildings and 83 percent
of the public buildings in the city.
Table 3.3 shows the number of residential and public customers that receive heat from
BTS, as well as the heated area/volume and the heat and hot water supplied in 2012.

Because of the age, under-maintenance and resulting poor condition of the pipelines
that bring heat from CHP 1 to customers, technical losses are estimated at more than
26 percent of the heat dispatched by CHP 1.20 Two-thirds of the two-pipe transmission
and distribution network was built more than 25 years ago and need to be replaced.
The underground pipelines that make up 75 percent of the network were originally
well-insulated with mineral wool and covered by cement plaster but over time the
condition of many pipelines has deteriorated. Leakages result in annual water losses
estimated at 1.2 million m3 (around seven percent of the water output from CHP 1).
Figure 3.3 shows the age of transmission and distribution pipelines operated by BTS.

Source: BTS, 2012


Although more than 70 percent of the network pipelines are beyond their service life,
BTS is only able to replace seven to eight km of pipelines per year due to insufficient
funds. As a result, the number of network failures (i.e., breaks with related service
interruptions) has increased from around an average of 50 per year in the early 1990s
to an average of 220 per year between 2005 and 2013. In 2013, 317 network failures
were reported – adding to high losses, decreasing heat supply reliability and increasing
emergency maintenance costs. Figure 3.4 shows a picture of a damaged heat
transmission pipeline.




20   In similar DH systems that are in better condition, technical losses are around 10 percent.



                                                           37

Part of BTS’s transmission system consists of 19 DH pumping stations with a total
installed electric capacity of 9,248 kW. This includes seven stations with capacities
above 500 kW. Most of the pumping stations were built 30 to 40 years ago, but walk-
through audits of five pumping stations showed that the pumps are generally well-
maintained. Individual pumps have an average reported efficiency of 92 percent.
However, the pumps are constant speed pumps, which means their speed cannot be
adjusted, even if doing so would increase the efficiency of the entire system. As a
result, the electricity consumption of the pumping system is high, amounting to
22,803 MWh per year. Five of the main pumps are equipped with variable speed drives
(VSD), which can operate at different speeds dependent upon the needs of the system.
The use of VSDs at these five pumps has resulted in electricity savings of about 30 to
40 percent. Figure 3.5 shows circulation pumps at DH Pump Stations 1 and 4.

The network also includes 2,030 open-circuit substations with automatic temperature
and flow-control of supply, including 216 substations that are equipped with heat and




                                          38
hot water meters.21 In total, about 75 percent of the multi-apartment buildings have
building-level substations, while the remaining 25 percent use older hydro-elevators.
Most of the substations were installed in the late 1990s, many with the support of the
World Bank-financed Power and District Heating Rehabilitation Project, and are
considered to have either exceeded their lifetime or are in need of urgent repairs.
The open system (providing both space heat and hot water) impedes the efficient
operation and maintenance of the DH system, obstructs the introduction of modern
controls and shortens the lifetime of the entire system (e.g., through high corrosion of
the network pipes due to poor water quality/treatment). In addition, the open system
could become a limiting factor in using the full heat supply capacity of the CHP.
Specifically, the open system is one factor limiting the transmission flow temperature
to around 80 to 90 C, cutting the transmission and distribution capacity to about half
of the maximum. Using the full temperature regime instead would reduce capacity
investment needs in pipes and pumps, reduce pumping costs and increase the amount
of CHP heat delivered to end-consumers. This will be critical once the rehabilitation of
CHP 1 is completed – without investments in BTS’s transmission and distribution
network, the network will not be able to absorb the additional heat supplied by the
CHP1, and the sizeable investment in the plant’s modernization will not generate the
full benefits for the population, public service delivery and businesses. Using the full
temperature regime would further increase comfort levels (by eliminating under-
heating), enable the company to serve more customers and help optimize investments
targeting the network and pumping capacity.
Only 16 percent of the public and residential consumers have building-level heat
meters and 44 percent have hot water meters. In addition, customers are not able to
regulate their consumption due to the lack of apartment-level thermostatic valves. As
a result, most customers are billed based on norms, not actual heat and hot water
consumption. This results in high commercial losses in particular for hot water (almost
40 percent of the water output)22, impacts the efficiency and service quality of DH
supply, inflates heating bills for customers (see Section 2.5.2) and provides no
incentives for consumers to improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings. Figure
3.6 shows photos of worn out hot water pipelines and flow regulation technology at a
heat substation.




21   There are no heat exchangers at building- or apartment-level, which would hydraulically separate the DH
     circulation water, the building-internal heating circuits (radiators) and the domestic hot water. As a result,
     customers are directly tapping hot DH circulation water for domestic use, such as showers, washing, etc.
22   Because customers are billed for hot water based on the number of registered people, almost 40 percent of the
     hot water is ‘non-demanded’ or billable (but consumed). Commercial losses for heat are estimated at 7 percent
     of the heat dispatched by the CHP 1.

The design and condition of the internal piping network within apartment buildings is
also problematic, preventing the even heating of apartments throughout individual
buildings. Customers located at the beginning of the internal piping network tend to
receive higher temperature heat than customers at the end of the piping network. For
this reason – and because customers have no control over their heat consumption –
some residential DH systems customers are “under-heated” while others are “over-
heated.”
3.1.2 Large and Small HOBs Operated by BTE
In 2012, BTE supplied 155,110 Gcal of space heat and hot water to residential, public
and commercial consumers. Residential customers living in multi-apartment buildings
represented the largest customer group, consuming about 75 percent (or 115,571
Gcal) of the heat and hot water supplied. Overall, 14 percent of multi-apartment
buildings and eight percent of public facilities are connected to BTE’s network.
Domestic hot water is produced and delivered to customers during the heating
season.23 Table 3.4 below shows customers supplied by BTE in 2012, and the amount
of heat and hot water supplied to each customer segment.




23   During the off-heating season, hot water is produced at 15 large boiler houses with a capacity of one Gcal.

To supply its customers, BTE owns and operates 57 boiler houses that contain a total
of 74 boilers. Each boiler house supplies heat to one or more buildings via installed
piping with a total length of about 108 km. The total installed capacity is 182 Gcal/h
(212 MWth) and the operational capacity as of 2012 was 89.9 Gcal/h (104 MWth).
Two-thirds of the operational capacity is provided by nine large HOBs. Data for the
main facilities are presented in the tables below (large HOBs in Table 3.5, and small
HOBs in Table 3.6).

The majority of BTE’s boilers were installed between 1960 and 1989 and most
generation units were originally designed for natural gas. Because of the shortage and
increasing costs of gas, some boiler houses have been redesigned and converted to
burn coal or mazut.
The conversion of boilers from natural gas to coal significantly reduced their
operational capacity and efficiency. Furthermore, flue gas cleaning systems were
never installed to mitigate the air pollution created by coal burning, so the converted
boilers have high emissions. The average combustion efficiency of the 23 coal-fired
boilers (in 18 boiler houses) is estimated at 41 percent, while the average combustion
efficiency of the mazut, gas and diesel-fired boilers is between 72 and 76 percent. The
electric boilers have efficiencies of 100 percent. 24
As indicated in Figure 3.7 below, gas-fired boilers still account for the majority of HOBs
in terms of operational capacity. While all boiler houses are equipped with make-up
water systems—including filtering, chemical treatment and degasification—only large
gas-fired boilers are equipped with automatic burners. There are no heat meters at
the outlets of the boiler houses.




24   These 14 electricity boilers are mainly installed at the premises or near end-consumers (mostly public buildings).
     Their operational capacity ranges from 0.1 Gcal/h to 1.32 Gcal/h.

The length of the BTE pipeline network from the 57 boiler houses to end-consumers
varies between 30 m and 14 km. Most of the networks are two-pipe systems, which
provide both space heating and hot water (open systems).25 Because of the lack of
funding for adequate maintenance and replacement of worn-out pipes, the pipeline
network is in poor condition and the insulation of many pipes is severely damaged.
However, because the networks are relatively short, the overall heat losses are
relatively low (compared to BTS), ranging from 12 to 21 percent.

BTE’s network also includes roughly 167 electric water pumps with a total capacity of
3,416 kW and an annual electricity consumption of about 10.8 GWh per year. On
average, there are two to four pumps with installed capacities of 15 to 200 kW per
boiler house. Most of the pumps are between 25 and 50 years old and are at or beyond
their service lives. None of the major pumps is equipped with variable flow control.
Many of the building-level problems with the DH network supplied by CHP 1 also apply
to the BTE system. Where installed, most of the building-level substations use hydro-
elevators and consumers have no heat metering or control devices. As a result, billing
is based on calculated demand rather than actual consumption. In addition, many of

25   The 15 networks distributing heat from larger HOBs (above one Gcal/h) have a 4-pipe configuration.



                                                         43
the building-level substations and internal piping infrastructure are in poor condition.
These problems lead to the inefficient use of energy, result in high energy losses, and
provide no possibility for consumers regulating their heat consumption and bills.
3.1.3 Small Building-Level HOBs
Small HOBs are dedicated boilers that are located on-site and supply one to several
buildings (connected by a short network). Small HOBs are generally owned by the
building that they supply.
Given that about 250 multi-apartment buildings and 82 public buildings are not
connected to the DH network (because of their location and/or the limited capacity of
the DH system), they depend on alternative heating sources. It is assumed that these
multi-apartment and public buildings are using small HOBs. The total heat supplied by
these small HOBs is estimated at 64,547 Gcal. Around 55 percent of the small HOBs
(185 boilers) are estimated to be based on electricity, 25 percent (67 boilers) on gas
and 20 percent (46 boilers) on coal.

3.1.4 Individual Heating Systems
Individual heating systems are used to heat a single dwelling. These systems include
oil or spiral radiators, coal or wood burning stoves or boilers, electric boilers or air
conditioners. Only about one percent of individual family houses are connected to the
DH system. The rest use individual heat devices as their primary source for heating. It
is estimated that 364,000 Gcal—about 18 percent of all residential and public building
space heat supply—is provided by individual electrical systems (mostly electrical
oil/spiral radiators). Estimates also suggest that 576,000 Gcal–about 28 percent of all
residential and public building space heat supply—is covered by individual coal stoves
or boilers in individual family houses. About 41,000 Gcal or two percent of all heat
supply is supplied by individual gas-based boilers. In total, about 39 percent of all
households depend exclusively on individual heating system. As indicated earlier, a
large share of households supplied by DH also use individual heating systems (mostly
electricity-based) as secondary sources because DH is insufficient to meet their heat
demand, particularly at the beginning and the end of the official heating season.
Table 3.9 shows the number of buildings, amount of heat supplied and share of total
heat consumption that comes from individual systems in Bishkek.

Note: Buildings may supplement DH-based heat supply with individual heating systems, which is why
      all buildings are shown in the “Total” column. Only those buildings listed in the “Using ind.
      systems as primary source of heat” column rely exclusively on individual systems for heating.
      The supply column shows all heat supplied by individual systems, whether primary or
      supplementary (for “topping-up”).

As mentioned in Section 2.3.3, the popularity of electricity for heating contributes to
high residential electricity consumption during the winter months. In 2012, residential
electricity consumption in January and December in Bishkek was almost three times
as high as residential electricity consumption in June and increased by more than 50
percent over the period since 2010. Figure 3.8 shows monthly electricity consumption
in the residential sector for the years 2010 to 2012.

As a result of the growth in residential electricity consumption during winter months,
which was driven by the increasing reliance on electricity for heating, distribution
networks in the city have become increasingly overloaded. Combined with insufficient
investment in power infrastructure, the growing demand for heating accentuates the
deteriorating power supply reliability in Bishkek. From 2010 to 2012, Severelectro
reported an average of 20 outages per day during winter and 15 outages per day on
an annual basis. This corresponds to around 360 hours without electricity supply per
year.
3.2      Heat Demand in Bishkek
Heat demand was estimated for Bishkek based on the characteristics of the residential
and public building stock in the city. The housing stock in Bishkek includes 91,513
residential buildings with a total residential area of 11.5 million m ² and 1,005 public
buildings with a total volume of 9.8 million m3. Table 3.10 provides a breakdown of
Bishkek’s residential building stock area, population and households by type of
building.

In order to estimate total annual heat demand for each building type, a standardized
set of assumptions about the amount of heat demand each year per unit of floor space


                                                   46
was developed for each type of residential and public building described in Section
2.1. Based on the results of walk-through energy audits of typical residential and public
buildings, heat demand assumptions were created.26
As is the case for most of the Kyrgyz Republic, the energy performance of the building
stock in Bishkek is poor, especially in multi-apartment buildings built before 2000. This
is partially due to the fact that most multi-apartment buildings in Bishkek have not
undergone any refurbishment since construction and are poorly maintained. Where
windows have been replaced, the replacements are of relatively poor quality and
therefore do not improve the energy performance of the buildings as much as higher
quality replacements might.
Individual houses and public buildings face a similar situation. Building envelopes and
building-internal heating infrastructure have not been maintained or rehabilitated.
The total heat demand and heat demand by building type during a typical year in
Bishkek were calculated by combining the estimated heat demand for each building
type with data on the area of each building type in Bishkek. Table 3.11 and show the
results of the heat demand analysis for different types of residential and public
buildings for a typical year in Bishkek.

The total estimated demand for heat and hot water in residential buildings in Bishkek
amounts to 2,372,258 Gcal per year, as shown in Table 3.11 above. Hot water accounts
for approximately 33 percent of residential heat demand. Individual family houses
account for only 44 percent of the residential heated area in Bishkek, but make up 54
percent of the heat demand in the city.
As shown in Table 3.12, total demand for heat and hot water in public buildings is
361,523 Gcal per year. It is assumed that heat for hot water is used only in hospitals
and kindergartens. Educational buildings account for about 67 percent of heat
demand in public buildings. Current total peak heat demand for the residential and
public sector is estimated at almost 3,000 MW.
Table 3.13 below summarizes the space heating demand by customer segment in a
typical year based on the analysis above.

3.3      Heat Supply-Demand Gap
The estimated amount of heat demanded in 2012 was calculated and compared to the
estimated amount of heat supplied (including by electricity) in 2012 to calculate the
heat supply-demand gap in Bishkek. The heat supply-demand gap is the magnitude of
unmet heating demand. The heat supply-demand gap was calculated based on data
for 2012, the most recent year for which heat supply information was available. The
Kyrgyz Republic had a substantially colder than average winter in 2012; there were 10
percent more heating degree-days than in a typical year. Therefore, in order to more
accurately calculate the supply gap that occurred in 2012, adjustments had to be made
to the demand numbers for an average year (as presented in Section 3.2) to account
for the colder temperatures. These adjusted demand numbers were then used in the
calculations to determine the heat supply-demand gap.
The heat supply gap for 2012 was estimated as follows:
 Total heat demand in residential buildings was estimated based on the
  characteristics of the building stock, taking into account the specific number of the
  degree days in Bishkek in 2012 and the normative requirements for indoor
  temperature.
 The amount of heat supplied in 2012 was then estimated based on supply data
  provided by heat and electricity companies. Estimates of the amount of electric
  ‘top-up heating’ were made based on available statistical data and data on
  electricity consumption patterns.
 The supply gap or unmet demand is assumed to be the difference between the
  calculated demand level and the amount of heat supplied as of 2012.
Table 3.14 below shows the amount of heat for space heating supplied to residential
buildings by each heating source in Bishkek in 2012, as previously shown in Section
3.1. Table 3.15 shows the difference between the amount of space heat demanded
(adjusted for 2012 from the baseline demand for an average year shown in Table 3.13)
and the amount of space heat supplied for residential buildings in Bishkek in that year.

This analysis shows that the estimated space heat supply gap was equal to 19 percent
of overall demand in residential buildings.27 The gap is greatest in individual family
houses, where an estimated 27 percent of space heat demand was not met. The gap
was lower in multi-family apartment buildings (three percent of demand).
The supply-demand gap is not presented for public buildings because the data for
2012 were found to be unreliable for this customer segment. Although anecdotal
evidence indicates that there was severe under-heating in public buildings in 2012, the
available data suggest that there was a very small space heat supply gap in public
buildings in that year. Because of this discrepancy between the observed situation and
the reported figures, the data for public buildings are assumed to be unreliable.




27   Hot water demand numbers were not available, so the heat supply gap analysis was performed only for space
     heat demand.

4      Heat Supply and Demand in Tokmok
Tokmok is located in Chui province in the northern part of the Kyrgyz Republic, about
60 km east of Bishkek. The official population was 54,000 as of 2012. The population
has decreased by almost 30 percent since 1989. Tokmok belongs to climatic region II
with 3,212 degree days and an average duration of the heating season of 150 days.
The residential building stock in Tokmok consists of 7,000 individual family homes that
house 56 percent of the population (54 percent of the residential floor space), and 234
apartment buildings (46 percent of the residential floor space). The city also has
around 40 public buildings. Residential and public buildings are characterized by poor
energy efficiency and high heat losses.
Similar to Bishkek, most of the space heating is provided by DH, while individual homes
use electric radiators and coal or wood stoves and boilers. An estimated 25 percent of
heat demand in residential buildings and more than 30 percent of heat demand in
individual family houses is not met. The gap, as in Bishkek, is the result of the poor
energy efficiency of most buildings and the poor condition of the heating
infrastructure. The heat supply infrastructure has suffered from years of under-
maintenance and under-investment resulting in poor supply reliability and service
quality. Tokmok’s DH system also has longer transmission pipes relative to load,
resulting in higher heat losses than on Bishkek’s networks.
4.1    Heating Systems in Tokmok
Heat in Tokmok is provided by the following systems:
        Seventeen large and small HOBs owned and operated by KZhK Tokmok SUE
         and Zhululuk SUE
        Individual heating systems
DH serves the majority of multi-apartment buildings and all public buildings. Individual
family houses rely primarily on individual heating solutions, but the majority of
households in multi-apartments reportedly also use individual heating systems to
supplement the heating from the DH system. Table 4.1 shows the coverage of public
and residential buildings by different heating systems.

4.1.1 DH in Tokmok
The DH system in Tokmok consists of two large HOBs (with eight boilers installed) and
three small HOBs (also with eight boilers installed) owned and operated by Tokmok
KZhK SUE. There is also one boiler house with two boilers, owned and operated by the
municipal company Zhululuk SUE. Each company owns and operates an associated
transmission and distribution network.
Tokmok KZhK SUE and Zhululuk SUE collectively provide 37 percent of all space heat
supplied to residential and public buildings in Tokmok. KZhK supplies approximately
90 percent of space heat for multi-apartment buildings and about 70 percent of the
space heat for public buildings. Zhululuk provides approximately five percent of the
multi-apartment building heat supply and 32 percent of the public building heat
supply. Table 4.2 shows the number of customers of each type and the amount of
space heat supplied by Tokmok KZhK SUE in 2012. Table 4.3 shows the number of
customers of each type as well as the amount of space heat supplied by Zhululuk SUE
in 2012.

The DH boiler houses of both companies are in poor condition. Tokmok KZhK’s boilers
were installed between 1971 and 1993 and have been poorly maintained due to lack
of funds. The Zhululuk SUE-owned boiler house was installed in 1975 and has not been
rehabilitated or refurbished since.
The DH transmission pipes and substations in Tokmok are also old and dilapidated
because funds have not been available for proper maintenance. The transmission
pipes lack insulation. They are long relative to the load they serve (the DH network in
Tokmok supplies 790 Gcal/km, compared to 4,400 Gcal/km over the Bishkek network).
Heat losses on the networks of both companies are estimated to be as high as 35
percent, owing to the condition of the network and its length relative to load. As in
Bishkek, Tokmok KZhK’s DH system pumps have only constant speed drives (instead




                                                53
of variable speed drives), which leads to excessive electricity consumption at the
pumps.
4.1.2 Individual Heating Systems in Tokmok
Individual heating systems supply about 62 percent of space heat in Tokmok. Table
4.5 shows the number of buildings heated with individual heat supply systems and the
estimated share of total space heat supply by each fuel type.

Note: Buildings may supplement DH-based heat supply with individual heating systems, which is why
      all buildings are shown in the “Total” column. Only those buildings listed in the “Using ind.
      systems as primary heating source” column rely exclusively on individual systems for heating.
      The supply column shows all heat supplied by individual systems, whether primary or
      supplementary (for “topping-up”).


As in Bishkek, increases in the use of electricity as a heating fuel in Tokmok has led to
progressively higher residential electricity consumption during the winter months. In
2012, residential electricity consumption in January and December was three times as
high as residential electricity consumption in June. Residential electricity consumption
has increased by almost 100 percent between 2010 and 2012. Figure 4.1 shows
monthly electricity consumption in the residential sector in Tokmok from 2010 to
2012.

4.2      Heat Demand in Tokmok
Heat demand was estimated for Tokmok based on the characteristics of the residential
and public building stock in the city. The housing stock in Tokmok includes 7,292
residential buildings with a total residential area of 1.1 million m2.
Table 4.6 provides a breakdown of Tokmok’s housing stock area, population and
households by type of building.

Notes: *Calculated value


In order to estimate total annual heat demand for each building type, a standardized
set of assumptions about the amount of heat demand per unit of floor space was
developed for each type of residential and public building described in Section 2.1.
Heat demand assumptions were created based on the results of the walk-through
energy audits of residential and public buildings.



                                                   56
Similar to Bishkek, buildings in Tokmok suffer poor energy performance due to
inefficient construction and under-maintenance.
Estimated heat demand for each building type and data on the area of each building
type in Tokmok were used to calculate the total heat demand and heat demand by
building type during a typical year. Table 4.7 and Table 4.8 show the heat demand
assumptions for different types of residential and public buildings for a typical year in
Tokmok.

The total demand for space heat and hot water in residential buildings in Tokmok
amounts to 247,598 Gcal per year, as shown in Table 4.7 above. Heat demand for hot
water accounts for about 10 percent of the total heat demand of the residential
sector. Individual houses account for about 70 percent of total present heat demand,
although they account for only 52 percent of the residential heated area.
Total demand for space heat and hot water in public buildings in Tokmok is 16,648
Gcal per year, as shown in Table 4.8. It is assumed that heat for hot water is only used
in hospitals and kindergartens. Educational buildings account for over half of heat
demand in public buildings.
Table 4.9 below summarizes the space heating demand by customer segment in a
typical year based on the analysis above.

4.3      Heat Supply-Demand Gap
As in Bishkek, heat demand figures for Tokmok in 2012 had to be adjusted to account
for the colder-than-average winter (see Section 3.3 for a more detailed methodology).
The only difference between the two analyses is that the amount of heat supplied to
public buildings was estimated for Tokmok, because the data for Tokmok were
considered to be more reliable than the data for Bishkek.
Table 4.10 below shows the amount of heat for space heating supplied to residential
and public buildings by each heating source in Tokmok, as previously shown in Section
4.1. Table 4.11 shows the difference between the amount of space heat demanded
(adjusted for 2012 from the baseline demand for an average year shown in Table 4.9)
and the amount of space heat supplied for residential and public buildings in Tokmok
in 2012.

The analysis shows that the estimated supply gap was equal to 24 percent of overall
demand in residential and public buildings. The gap is greatest in individual family
houses, where 32 percent of space heat demand is unmet each year. Overall, the gap
is higher in public buildings (36 percent of demand) and much lower in multi-
apartment buildings (one percent of demand).

5           Assessment of Measures to Improve the Heating
            Sectors of Bishkek and Tokmok
Based on the current infrastructure and fuel availability, the options for meeting space
heat demand in Bishkek and Tokmok range from the improvement of large-scale
heating systems—such as the rehabilitation of the DH infrastructure—to the
installation of small HOBs, the use of individual heating solutions and/or improved
energy efficiency in buildings.
This section evaluates the economic viability of the main heating options and
associated investment measures for meeting the space heat demand of residential
and public buildings in Bishkek and Tokmok. Technical, environmental and social
advantages and disadvantages of each measure follow. For each customer segment,
the applicable investment measures are prioritized based on the results of this multi-
criteria assessment to inform the recommendations outlined in Section 5.4.
5.1         Assessment Approach
Heating options and associated investment measures were evaluated in the following
way:
1. Identification of main supply- and demand-side options. The main supply- and
   demand-side options for meeting residential and public heat demand were
   identified based on the existing heating infrastructure and availability of fuels in
   each city. These options include: DH with CHP (Bishkek only); DH with coal/gas-
   fired large HOBs; small coal/gas-fired or electric HOBs; individual coal stoves;
   individual gas heaters or boilers; individual electric radiators; individual electric
   heat pumps; and energy efficiency in residential and public buildings.
2. Identification of investment measures. A comprehensive ‘long list’ of 30 specific
   investment measures associated with each supply- and demand-side option was
   identified.28
3. Development of short list of investment measures. An initial economic/technical
   viability screening was applied to the long list of measures. Measures found to
   have very high investment costs, low potential for improving the heat supply or
   limited technical feasibility were excluded in order to develop a ‘short list’ of the
   most viable investment measures.
4. Assessment of economic viability. The economic viability of the 20 short-listed
   investment measures was assessed in two stages: (i) a levelized cost assessment
   of the main heat supply- and demand-side options to determine the most viable
   options for meeting the heat demand of different types of residential and public
   buildings; and (ii) a cost efficiency analysis of the 20 short-listed investment
   measures associated with each of the main heating options.
5. Assessment of non-economic advantages and disadvantages. Non-economic
   advantages and disadvantages of the short-listed investment measures were also

28   The evaluation of the long listed measures was conducted as part of the technical background report prepared
     by Fichtner.

       evaluated. These non-economic considerations primarily include technical,
       institutional, environmental and social advantages and disadvantages.
6. Prioritization of investment measures. The investment measures were prioritized
   for each customer segment based on the results of the multi-criteria assessments.
   The most cost efficient investment measures associated with economically viable
   heating options and without major social and environmental disadvantages were
   recommended for implementation.
Table 5.1 lists the main heating options and associated investment measures included
in the long list29. Measures that were selected for the short list are highlighted in green
and given an identifying code.

Note: Although reliable and affordable gas supply is currently very limited in the Kyrgyz Republic, recent
developments in the gas sector (as described in Section 2.3) are expected to improve the availability of
natural gas and the gasification of urban areas. For this reason, gas-based heat supply options are also
evaluated.

The remainder of this section describes the evaluation of the main heating options
and related investment measures (Steps 4 through 6 above).


5.2      Analysis of the Economic Viability of Heating Options and
         Associated Specific Investment Measures
The most economically viable options were identified by analyzing the Levelized Cost
of Heat Supply (LCHS) of each heat supply option and the cost efficiency factor (CEF)
of specific investment measures. The analysis is presented in the subsections below.
5.2.1 Economic Viability of the Main Heating Options
The economic viability of the main heating options was estimated using the LCHS (see
description in Box 5.1 below). The assessment takes into account the current heating
infrastructure used by different customer segments as described in Sections 3 and 4
(e.g., individual family houses currently using different individual heating options,
multi-apartment buildings with/without DH connection, public buildings with/without
DH connection). The different heating options serving each customer segment were
compared to determine the most viable solution for that segment.




                                                   62
     Box 5.1: Levelized Cost of Heat Supply (LCHS)
     The LCHS is the cost of a unit of heat supplied (US$ per kWh of thermal energy), discounted
     over the life of the supply option. For demand-side heating options, the LCHS is the cost
     of reducing a unit of heat demand over the life of that option. The LCHS analysis takes into
     account all capital, operating and fuel costs associated with an option. The LCHS in this
     report has been calculated using international and regional cost benchmarks adjusted to
     local conditions (local suppliers, local fuel costs, etc.)

The first two rows of Table 5.2 show the types of heating systems in use for each
building type in Bishkek and Tokmok.30 The remaining rows show the alternative
options available in each case. The availability of different heating options also
depends on the availability of fuel. In order to avoid switching to inferior heating
solutions in terms of health and environmental impacts, it was assumed that the short-
term use of individual efficient coal-fired stoves is an option only for those houses
currently burning coal.




30   The pairing of building types and heating systems is referred to as a “customer segment” in Table 5.2 and in the
     subsequent text.

         The LCHS of CHP excludes generation costs given that the modernization of the CHP is already
         ongoing (and is therefore a sunk cost). However, the LCHS assumes some basic reliability and
         efficiency DH system upgrades, namely: (i) the replacement of BTS’ underground heat
         transmission and distribution lines older than 25 years, the replacement of 50 percent of BTS’
         over-ground transmission and distribution pipelines and the re-insulation of the remaining 50
         percent; (ii) the installation of automatic building-level DH substations at all multi-apartment
         and public buildings served by DH; and (iii) the deployment of variable speed drives at water
         pumps and network pumps. The LCHS of large HOBs assumes the aforementioned basic
         reliability and efficiency upgrades to the DH system in addition to the cost of replacing existing
         boilers.
         The coal price is assumed to be US$52.41/t for CHP, US$57.66/t for large HOBs and US$61.23/t
         for small HOBs; the gas price is estimated at US$330/thousand m3; cost estimates for electrical
         appliances are based on long-run average incremental cost of electricity (0.14 US$/kWh)
         The LCHS of energy saved from building energy efficiency measures is calculated as if the
         energy efficiency measures were an energy generating resource and the energy “generated”
         by that resource is the amount of energy saved by the energy efficiency measures, in other
         words the capital cost of the energy efficiency measures is levelized over the energy saved
         over the measures’ lifetime.

Economic Viability of Heating Options for Individual Family Houses
For individual family houses currently using coal stoves, the option with the lowest
LCHS is a more efficient and cleaner coal stove. Gas stoves could become economically
viable options as gas becomes available and affordable for use in individual family
houses. For individual houses currently using coal boilers, gas boilers will also become
economically viable with more widespread access to reticulated gas networks.
For individual family houses currently using electric boilers and radiators, switching to
gas-fired heaters and boilers or electric heat pumps would be more economically
viable. This assumes that the house is connected to the gas network. If gas is not yet
available, heat pumps still make much more efficient use of electricity for heat
production, and therefore have much lower operating costs, though their capital costs
are higher than the capital costs of electric radiators. Although heat pumps take
advantage of the heat in the outside air, they can operate in colder climates. Box 5.2
describes the applicability of air-to-air heat pumps in cold climates.

 Box 5.2: Applicability of heat pumps in cold climates
 Air-to-air heat pumps (the type of heat pumps evaluated in this report) use the heat
 present in the outside air to heat the air indoors. These devices use refrigerants that
 absorb heat from the outside air and release it indoors even when that air temperature is
 as low as -30°C (as shown in Table 2.1, the average winter ambient temperature in Bishkek
 and Tokmok is -1°C). For especially cold days, modern air-to-air heat pumps also typically
 have a built-in “peak load” heating element.
 Unlike electric resistance heaters that convert electric energy to heat energy, heat pumps
 use electricity to run compressors and circulate refrigerants that absorb the heat in
 outdoor air. Air-to-air heat pumps are therefore capable of generating more thermal
 energy than is required to operate them. For instance one kWh of electric energy can be
 used to generate three kWh of thermal energy (based on a realistic Coefficient of
 Performance of 3.0). While the efficiency of heat pumps decreases with lower ambient
 temperature, the coefficient of modern heat pumps does not drop below 1.5 even with
 very low temperatures, making them more efficient than traditional electric oil radiators.

Economic Viability of Heating Options for Multi-Apartment Buildings
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by a CHP via the DH system, heat
supply by CHP is clearly still the economically most viable option.
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by large HOBs, the analysis suggests
that switching to individual gas heaters/boilers or installing small gas-fired HOBs are
more viable than large HOBs. Energy efficiency measures are also an economically
viable option to help reduce the heat demand of this customer segment.
For multi-apartment buildings currently served by small HOBs, the analysis suggests
that individual gas heaters/boilers have slightly lower levelized costs than small HOBs.
However, the analysis of gas heaters/boilers does not take into account the
investments necessary to connect buildings and houses to a gas network. Therefore,
further analysis will be needed to verify this finding once gasification plans are
finalized.




                                             67
For multi-apartment buildings that rely on individual electric radiators, switching to
gas heaters would be the most economically viable option. If the building has no
access to natural gas, switching to individual heat pumps is more viable than using
electric radiators. When gas becomes available, installing small HOBs would also be a
more viable option than electric radiators.
Energy efficiency measures also appear to be an economically viable option to help
reduce demand in all multi-apartment buildings, but especially in those that are not
served by DH.
Economic Viability of Heating Options for Public Buildings
Public buildings have almost the same heating options available to them as multi-
apartment buildings, except it is not assumed that individual heating options (such as
individual gas heaters) should be deployed in these buildings. Under this assumption,
the most economically viable heating options for public buildings would be continued
use of the heating systems that currently serve them (DH with CHP or small HOBs),
with the exception of public buildings that are served by large HOBs. For public
buildings that are served by large HOBs, switching to small HOBs and implementing
energy efficiency measures appear to be more economically viable than using heat
from rebuilt large HOBs.
5.2.2 Economic Analysis of the Short List Investment Measures
The CEF was calculated for each specific investment measure, and the measures were
compared on the basis of their CEFs. The CEF of each measure was taken into account
when selecting measures for recommendations. Box 5.3 describes the CEF.

 Box 5.3: Cost Efficiency Factor (CEF)
 The CEF evaluates the investment cost per unit of energy saved or produced by a given
 measure. The CEF is calculated by dividing the total investment cost of a given measure by
 the total amount of energy that it will save or produce over that measure’s lifetime. The
 CEF provides a rough estimate of the cost of an energy infrastructure investment per unit
 of energy saved or produced. However, the CEF should be used with caution because it
 does not account for the operating costs of a given investment. Measures with low capital
 costs but high operating costs may therefore appear economically viable using the CEF.
 The CEF is useful nonetheless, because it provides insight into the economic viability of
 the non-heat producing measures (e.g., installation of variable speed drives, transition to
 consumption based-billing, etc.) compared with the heat producing measures.


Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 show the CEFs of all measures short-listed for Bishkek and
Tokmok, respectively. The analysis indicates that many of the rehabilitation measures
to improve the efficiency of the DH system are economically viable, in particular the
installation of variable speed drives, the re-insulation of overground distribution
pipes, the installation of building-level temperature and hydraulic regulation or the
installation of building-level substations, and a package of metering, temperature
regulation and consumption-based billing. The analysis also shows that individual coal
or gas stoves or gas heaters, small gas-fired HOBs and individual heat pumps are
economically viable. The building energy efficiency-related measures, on the other




                                             68
hand, have relatively high CEFs, which is largely because they are quite capital-
intensive, and the CEF only takes into account capital costs.

5.4     Summary of the Analysis of the Heating Options and Short List
        Measures
Based on the results of the economic assessment and the evaluation of other
advantages and disadvantages, the applicable investment measures for each
customer segment were prioritized to help inform the recommendations. The
prioritization was done taking into account (i) the economic viability of the main
heating options; (ii) the results of the cost efficiency analysis for the specific
investment measures; and (iii) the other advantages and disadvantages associated
with each measure. The weighting of the latter is a policy choice; for the purpose of
this report, advantages/disadvantages related to the impact on winter power
shortages and comfort levels were weighted the most. This multi-criteria approach
was used to determine priority heating options as well as fallback heating options for
each customer segment.
Figure 5.5 provides an overview of the priority and fallback heating options for each
customer segment in Bishkek and Tokmok, based on the multi-criteria assessment of
economic and non-economic benefits of each heating option.

Note: *Priority and fallback options for large HOBs would need to be determined based on the results
       of a feasibility study and depending on the specific operational condition of each boiler house.

6      Recommendation of Measures to Improve the
       Heating Sectors of Bishkek and Tokmok
The investment needs of the heating sectors in Bishkek and Tokmok are sizable, at an
estimated US$225 million in the short-term and an estimated US$550 million in the
medium- to long-term. The implementation of the investment measures will therefore
need to be adequately phased and prioritized. This could be achieved by preparing a
detailed investment plan for each of the heating companies based on the viable
investment measures recommended in this study. The investment plans could also be
used by the companies to ensure a well-planned and coordinated effort in mobilizing
funding from bilateral and multi-lateral development partners and from the private
sector. In addition, deployment of efficient autonomous and individual heating
solutions—such as switching to small HOBs or replacing inefficient coal stoves and
heaters by more efficient models—will require demand-driven programs supported
by public consultation and outreach campaigns. They also will require appropriate
implementation, financing and incentive mechanisms.
This section summarizes the recommended investment measures and related policy
actions needed to improve the reliability and efficiency of heat supply in Bishkek and
Tokmok. For each recommendation, the investment measures and the scope of their
implementation are described. Some of the most important implementation issues
are highlighted, and immediate next steps are outlined.
It is important to note that the implementation of some of the recommended priority
investment measures is subject to the availability of natural gas for the targeted
customer segments in the future. Alternatives are provided for residential and public
buildings without access to gas, but the development and implementation of a clear
and time-bound gasification plan will be critical to the heating options that are
recommended in this report.
6.1    Recommendation 1: Implementation of Tariff and Social
       Assistance Reforms
Tariff reforms are the single most important policy action needed to improve the
financial viability of the heating sector and to incentivize end-user energy efficiency.
As described in Section 2.4.3, below-cost recovery tariffs have resulted in severe
under-spending on maintenance and investment in the sector. They have accelerated
the deterioration of heat supply reliability and quality, and they have contributed to
the inefficient use of energy in residential and public buildings.
With the adoption of the MTTP and the enactment of higher end-user tariffs for
heating and electricity in 2014 and 2015, the Government has made a critical step
towards cost-reflective energy pricing. It is important to note, however, that heating
tariff increases should be implemented in parallel with increases to electricity tariffs.
Increasing heating tariffs without also increasing electricity tariffs may accelerate fuel
switching from DH to electricity, which will put further strain on the power grid during
peak winter months.
Going forward, the following tariff policy actions are recommended.



                                           75
Consistently implement tariff reforms: The enactment of annual tariff increases in
accordance with the MTTP will be critical to improve the sustainability of the heating
sector.
Adopt a clear and transparent tariff-setting methodology for sector companies and
non-residential end-users: Residential end-user tariffs until 2017 are defined in the
MTTP, but the State Regulatory Agency of the Fuel and Energy Complex should
develop and adopt a clear methodology to determine the revenue requirements for
heating companies. This would help to clearly determine the financing gap and
subsidies required to ensure adequate maintenance and investments of sector assets.
A transparent approach should be taken to allocate sector revenues between heating
companies (in the case of EPP and BTS, in particular) in order to enhance the
predictability of revenues for heating companies and improve sector transparency. In
addition, it is recommended that the tariff-setting approach for non-residential end-
user tariffs31 be simplified; one option would be to set non-residential end-user tariffs
for each heating company rather than for each individual boiler. Appendix A contains
further details on the regulatory arrangements in the sector.
Deregulate tariff-setting for small, greenfield HOBs: As indicated in Section 6.4, the
supply of heat through small, greenfield HOBs may present an opportunity for private
sector participation. To promote private sector participation and to eliminate the
excessive regulatory burden associated with setting tariffs for small HOBs, the
Government should consider deregulating tariffs for greenfield HOBs. Because
consumers have alternatives to the heat supply from the new, small HOBs, such an
arrangement does not constitute a natural monopoly activity that would need to be
regulated.
Transition to consumption-based billing: A transition to consumption-based billing
should accompany tariff reforms. This will ensure that consumers can control their
consumption and match it with what they can afford. Consumption-based billing will
also increase pressure on heating companies to show value-for-money by improving
service quality and reducing network losses. Experience from other countries in the
ECA region indicates that building-level heat metering and consumption-based billing
can generate substantial energy savings (around 25 to 30 percent of the heat
consumed). BTS’ experience also indicates that end-consumers paid up to 45 percent
less for heating after their bills were based on metered consumption at building-level
compared to previously norm-based billing practices. However, transitioning to
consumption-based billing especially at apartment-level is politically and
institutionally challenging to implement. It will require careful planning and phasing
and should be accompanied with extensive public outreach campaigns. The
investment measures recommended under Section 6.2 represent a first step in this
direction. A time-bound transition path towards consumption-based billing should be
developed, including the associated legal, regulatory and institutional reforms needed
(e.g., heat metering requirements, clearly assigned responsibilities for installing,
financing and maintaining meters and thermostatic valves, and revision of the design
of end-user tariffs for heating).


31   This only concerns non-residential tariffs for customers not served by the CHP plant in Bishkek.



                                                           76
Provide targeted support to poor customers: Mitigation measures must accompany
tariff increases to ensure that poor households can afford a basic level of heat
consumption. The Kyrgyz Republic has extensive yet poorly targeted social safety nets
that Government should consider restructuring. 32 Existing social assistance programs
targeting the poor could be topped-up while other programs aimed at categories of
consumers which may contain the non-poor should be phased out. Energy efficiency
retrofits should also be considered as a possible mitigation measure as tariffs move
closer to cost-recovery levels. A World Bank estimate in 2013 showed that energy
poverty for poor households in the Kyrgyz Republic could be reduced by more than 10
percent following the introduction of a basic energy efficiency program. 33
6.2         Recommendation 2: Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of the
            DH Network
Measures targeting efficiency improvements of the DH systems in Bishkek and
Tokmok have been identified among the most viable investment opportunities. Given
the extent of the DH system in each city, these measures have the potential to improve
the reliability and efficiency of heat supply for a large number of people.
6.2.1 Recommended Measures
It is recommended to implement a package of priority reliability and efficiency
investments. Overall, the investments in the DH network have the potential to reduce
losses by as much as 696,000 MWh per year in Bishkek and as much as 51,000 MWh
per year in Tokmok. The recommended priority measures are:
 Install building-level substations (M6). Modern substations with heat exchangers
  will allow supply to be matched with demand through better temperature control
  at the building level, and should be installed in all multi-apartment and public
  buildings. Transitioning to a ‘closed’ DH system (via heat exchangers at substations)
  will further enable an increase of the heat delivery to end-consumers, improved
  water quality, safer operation and less corrosion of network pipelines.
 Implement metering (M2), temperature regulation (M3) and consumption-based
  billing (M4). These measures will allow heat service companies to bill customers
  based on the amount of energy consumed, rather than simply on the area heated.
  The transition to consumption-based billing also enables households to control
  their heat consumption and bills and provide them with an incentive for more
  economic use of thermal energy. Given the limited resources, it is recommended
  to focus in a first step on the installation of building-level heat meters and
  apartment-level hot water meters. The second phase could then involve the
  installation of temperature regulation and heat cost allocators at apartment level.
 Replace priority transmission and distribution pipelines (M8) and re-insulate
  overground distribution pipelines (M9). Replacing worn-out pipelines with pre-

32   Public spending for social transfers in 2013 accounted for about 2 percent of GDP. However, one of the social
     assistance programs – the Monthly Benefit for Poor Families with Children – explicitly targets the poor but
     coverage is low (less than one third of the poorest 20 percent of the population and only about 8 percent of
     their total consumption is subsidized). Other programs are aimed at certain social categories (e.g., households
     with widows, veterans or disabled children) independent of their income levels.

                                                          77
  insulated and accurately dimensioned pipes and re-insulating overground pipelines
  would improve supply reliability and service quality, decrease heat losses within
  the network by up to 70 percent and reduce service interruptions.
 Install variable speed drives in DH substation pumps (M10). Variable speed drives
  allow the system to adjust the output of DH substation pumps to match the
  required fluid throughput, rather than running at a single, high throughput level all
  of the time. Estimates indicate that this would reduce electricity consumption in
  pumping stations by more than one third.
In principle, the measures listed above could be implemented separately. In best
practice, building-level substations (M6) should be implemented together with
metering (M2), temperature regulation (M3) and consumption-based billing (M4).
Combining these measures with the replacement or re-insulation of pipelines (M8 and
M9) and variable speed drives in DH substation pumps (M10) would further help to
ensure maximum efficiency gains and technical sustainability of investments at the
network level.
6.2.2 Scope of Implementation
As a priority, implementation of these reliability and efficiency measures is
recommended for the DH network operated by BTS. This would ensure that the
network is actually able to absorb the additional heat supplied by CHP 1 after its
modernization. In addition, in order to ensure the operational sustainability of the
investments, the generation facilities should be in good condition, which is not the
case for the majority of large HOBs (in Bishkek and Tokmok). Accordingly, the
investment package should only be implemented for large HOBs in good operational
condition.
6.2.3 Implementation Issues
Efficiency improvements at the apartment level: One of the most challenging
implementation issues will be the implementation of improvement measures within
individual apartments, such as thermostatic valves and heat cost allocators. This will
require: (i) careful planning; (ii) extensive information and public outreach campaigns
to inform customers about the benefits of these improvements; and (iii) adequate
financing/implementation arrangements (e.g., direct-to-consumer subsidy and
distribution programs through the heating utilities). Therefore, it is recommended to
prioritize the installation of building-level heat and apartment-level hot water meters
before moving to the institutionally more complex implementation of thermostatic
valves and heat cost allocators in individual apartments. Other issues related to the
transition to consumption-based billing are highlighted under Section 6.1.
Ensuring technical sustainability of investments: To ensure the technical
sustainability of efficiency measures, it is important to evaluate the total network
(over- and underground transmission and distribution). This will help to identify and
address urgent rehabilitation needs. This evaluation also should include internal heat
piping within buildings.
Financing: The current financial condition of DH companies, coupled with the low end-
user tariffs, means that DH companies will struggle to attract commercial financing for
the investments recommended above. DH companies and the Government may want


                                          78
to consider mobilizing different sources of concessional financing. As highlighted
above, the rehabilitation of the building- and apartment-level heating infrastructure
(usually not owned by the DH company) is expected to require special financing and
implementation schemes in addition to regulatory changes.
Box 6.1 describes how similar actions were implemented in Poland.

 Box 6.1: World Bank Program Supporting DH Reforms in Poland
 During the mid-1990s, Poland experienced many of the problems facing the Kyrgyz
 Republic today. In the early 1990s, the Government of Poland transferred ownership and
 responsibility for DH companies to the municipalities. The decentralization of ownership
 and a phasing out of investment subsidies meant DH companies lacked funds to effectively
 operate, maintain, and rehabilitate their infrastructure. This, in turn, led to high heat and
 hot water losses, which further deteriorated the financial sustainability of DH companies.
 The World Bank supported the Government in tackling some of the key issues in the DH
 sector. From 1991 to 2000, the World Bank provided US$340 million for the Heat Supply
 Restructuring and Conservation Project in Poland. The project included support for: (i)
 energy restructuring, commercialization of restructured enterprises, introduction of a
 transparent regulatory framework, and pricing policy reform; (ii) rehabilitation and
 modernization to extend DH infrastructure asset life; and (iii) energy conservation and
 pollution reduction through investments in energy efficiency improvements.
 The Government’s support for energy efficiency and conservation investments and pricing
 policies led to gradual increases in residential tariffs. The Government also reduced
 budget layouts for energy subsidies. These two efforts were key to the project’s success.
 Energy efficiency measures carried out by DH companies achieved a 50 percent reduction
 in heat transmission and distribution losses. This led to a 22 percent energy savings,
 equivalent to roughly US$55 million per year.
 Building-level heat metering was a crucial component of these energy efficiency
 improvements. Metering in the buildings covered by the five DH companies targeted in
 the project increased from 21 percent at the start of the project to 100 percent by project
 completion. Further evaluation of the project underlined the significance of metering.
 Without accurate measurement of the heat supply, DH companies often vastly
 underestimated the level of heat transmission losses in the network. Heat transmission
 losses can reach 20 percent of heat purchased and represent up to 17 percent of variable
 operating costs. As a result, the companies failed to properly prioritize heat loss mitigation
 and lost major opportunities for cost savings. Evaluation of the project concluded that:
 “Future Bank projects with DH companies should assign top priority to metering of total
 purchases and sales of heat as early as possible during project implementation.”

6.2.4 Next Steps
Detailed investment and implementation plan: BTS should develop a detailed
investment and implementation plan to improve the efficiency and reliability of the
distribution network. Based on a request from the Ministry of Energy and Industry,
the World Bank mobilized grant-funding to support BTS with technical assistance. The
investment and implementation plan will include: (i) scope of implementation and


                                               79
priorities for each measure; (ii) detailed cost estimates and economic-financial
analysis for each investment measure; (iii) estimated energy (cost) savings and other
benefits; and (iv) detailed sequencing and implementation.
Mobilizing resources: This could include a mix of the company’s own funds,
concessional financing and grants or government funds (in particular to support the
installation of heat cost allocators and thermostatic valves in apartments).
Revision of heat tariffs: Section 6.1 further describes next steps related to the
transition to cost-recovery tariffs and consumption-based billing.
6.3         Recommendation 3: Implementation of a Program for the
            Replacement of Inefficient Individual Heating Systems
The prevalence of inefficient individual heating systems represents a major challenge
for the urban heating sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. Coal-fired stoves and boilers are
inefficient, dirty and harmful to human health and the environment. Individual electric
heaters are an inefficient use of scarce electricity resources. Proliferation of individual
electric heaters has destabilized the power grid and increased the frequency of
blackouts and power shortages.
6.3.1 Recommended Measures
A scalable program for more efficient small heating technologies is needed, including
more efficient individual stoves, boilers and heat pumps. International experience
shows that such programs can bring substantial benefits to residential consumers in
terms of reduced fuel consumption and costs, lower indoor air pollution and higher
comfort levels. Such a program would also have a high replication potential in both
urban and rural areas given the large share of households currently relying on
inefficient individual heating solutions.
6.3.2 Scope of Implementation
Residential consumers relying on inefficient individual heating solutions (traditional
coal-fired stoves or boilers or inefficient electric oil radiators) as a primary heat source
should be targeted for this program. The following actions are recommended:
 Replace inefficient coal-fired stoves or boilers with more efficient models. For
  residential consumers with access to gas in the near term, inefficient coal-fired
  stoves or boilers should be replaced by individual gas heaters or boilers. For
  residential consumers without access to gas in the medium-term and currently
  using traditional coal-fired stoves, the deployment of more efficient coal-based
  models should be promoted. This could help to reduce coal consumption by up to
  25 percent, reduce indoor air pollution and improve comfort levels in buildings.34
  As gas becomes available, coal boilers and stoves should be replaced with gas-fired
  models.
 Replace inefficient electric oil radiators with heat pumps in buildings without
  access to centralized heat or gas. For residential consumers relying on electricity-


34   The coal-based stoves/boilers currently have a maximum efficiency of 50 percent and are not equipped with any
     filtering systems. Modern coal-fired models are estimated to have an average efficiency of around 70 percent.

   based resistance heaters and with access to natural gas, individual gas heaters or
   boilers should be promoted to help mitigate winter power shortages the country is
   facing. For residential consumers without future access to gas and currently relying
   on electric oil radiators, the deployment of efficient heat pumps could be
   promoted. Heat pumps used in place of electric resistance heaters can reduce
   household electricity consumption for heating by up to 70 percent (see Box 5.2 in
   Section 5). Night storage heaters should also be considered because they would
   help shift electricity demand for heating to off-peak times and decrease the burden
   on the power grid during peak hours.
6.3.3 Implementation Issues
Ensuring adequate equipment supply and efficient distribution channels: To ensure
that the individual heating technologies promoted as part of the program (i.e.,
coal/gas stoves and boilers, heat pumps) result in significant efficiency gains and
comply with safety and emission requirements, the supply chain for such equipment
needs to be strengthened. To this end, potential design elements for the program
should take into account: (i) adoption of technical, environmental and safety
performance standards for products; (ii) eligibility criteria for products and suppliers,
including supply capacity of producers; (iii) quality verification and enforcement
mechanisms to ensure adequate performance of products; (iv) regulating supply
chains and distribution channels to avoid non-compliant copy-cat models (e.g.,
through dedicated distribution centers); (v) eligibility criteria for households to ensure
targeted replacements and incentive schemes; (vi) organizing efficient return and
disposal systems for old equipment; and (vii) capacity building and technical assistance
for local producers as needed.
Enhancing demand through dedicated financing and incentive mechanisms and
public outreach campaigns: Financing and perception are major challenges to the
development and implementation of a program for efficient individual heating
technologies. Experience in the region suggests that households are reluctant or
unable to fund the higher upfront investment for new, individual heating solutions,
unless payback periods can be shortened. Given the relatively high unit price of more
efficient models compared to traditional options (stoves, boilers and electric heaters),
the market penetration of efficient technologies at scale would require dedicated
financing mechanisms, a well-targeted incentive program from the Government and
large public outreach and awareness raising campaigns. International experience from
countries with similar programs could offer useful lessons learned and design options
for implementation and financing schemes. Examples include the development of
dedicated (micro-) credit-lines for eligible households combined with targeted subsidy
schemes (e.g., disbursement after verified installation). The subsidy schemes could be
designed to: (i) reflect the affordability of target households; (ii) reward the use of
models with higher performance; and/or (iii) promote rapid penetration of new
equipment. Box 6.2 and Box 6.3 include examples of programs in Mongolia and
Armenia.

Box 6.2: Clean Stove Initiative in Mongolia
The Clean Stove Initiative for Mongolia (Mongolia-CSI) sold nearly 98,000 subsidized, low-
emission stoves in five districts in Ulaanbaatar between June 2011 and November 2012,
reaching 55 percent of all households in the target area. The program was funded by the
Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Mongolian Clean Air Fund, and followed a
number of smaller pilot programs that were financed by the Asian Development Bank,
Gesellschaft for Internationale Zusammernarbeit, Millennium Challenge Corporation, the
World Bank and World Vision.
In order to identify models of stoves to subsidize, the Mongolian University of Science and
Technology tested the emissions performance of 14 models of energy efficient solid fuel-
based stoves, and four were selected for the program. Two of the models were
manufactured in Turkey, and two were from China. Stoves were sold in “Product Centers”
in each administrative subdivision, and each household was eligible to purchase one
subsidized stove. Many of the product centers were operated by XacBank, a commercial
bank that supplied sales and support staff and offered micro-loans to households who
could not afford even the subsidized prices. Depending on the model of stove, subsidies
ranged from US$195 to US$319 per stove. After subsidies, the stove price to the consumer
was 60 to 75 percent below the market prices for the same stove. To receive the subsidy,
households were required to turn in their old stove. This ensured that polluting stoves
were no longer in use. New stoves were delivered to the household, and customers
completed a training program to learn proper use of the stove.
Mongolia’s program contains several key lessons and best practices that should be applied
to stove and heat pump subsidy programs in the Kyrgyz Republic. These are as follows:
 Subsidy programs should allow consumers to choose among several models, and
  subsidy payments should only be made after installation is confirmed.
 Final prices after subsidy should not be so low as to allow purchases by consumers who
  will not use and maintain the equipment properly.
 Equipment should be distributed through local product centers to ensure quality of the
  product and eligibility for the subsidies.
 Confirming installation of the equipment and training consumers ensures that
  equipment is used properly, and prevents re-selling of subsidized products.
 Removing old equipment from use ensures large and sustainable improvements in
  efficiency.
 Programs should be implemented in partnership with the private sector in order to
  provide good customer service and respond to market demands.

     Box 6.3: Efficient Gas Stove Subsidies in Armenia
     As its gas distribution network gradually expanded, Armenia launched a program to
     distribute efficient gas stoves to poor urban households with limited access to heating.
     The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid, the World Bank’s Urban Heating Project and
     the Government of Armenia funded the program.
     Families were eligible for participating in the subsidy program if they were enrolled in the
     Poverty Family Benefit Program, a social protection program for Armenia’s low-income
     households. In addition, families had to live in an urban multi-apartment building that was
     connected to a functioning gas network. Finally, the family had to contribute US$25 to 50.
     Armenia’s Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2) administered the
     program. The R2E2 Fund publicized the program and encouraged poor urban families to
     apply. After determining eligibility, the R2E2 Fund collected the family cash contribution
     and worked with the gas company to organize installation and connection of new stoves.
     The R2E2 Fund then independently verified the installation of the stoves and delivery of
     gas service. It refunded the payments made by the gas company to the contractors who
     installed the stoves.
     Armenia’s experience in subsidizing gas stove installations provides several key lessons
     that are worth noting if a similar program is implemented in the Kyrgyz Republic:
      Early preparation for implementation is crucial to adjust reporting and monitoring
       mechanisms to the program’s requirements.
      Households should be made to apply for the program and provide cash payment, as
       these activities foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the program.
      Procurement needs adequate planning, including the ability to allow contract
       extensions with the providers who win the bidding for the project.

6.3.4 Next Steps
The next steps for developing and implementing a program promoting efficient
individual stoves, boilers and heat pumps are described below:
Conduct a detailed market assessment. The scope of the market assessment should
include a review of: (i) the current use of inefficient coal stoves/boilers and electric
heaters, including the types of devices, average lifetime in use, market prices,
equipment suppliers and available products; (ii) the efficiency, environmental and
safeguard performance of internationally available efficient models; (iii) the supply
chain and local market for more efficient technologies; (iv) the energy savings
potential and pollution reduction benefits that are possible from the deployment of
more efficient models; and (v) for heat pumps, the evaluation of grid stability and
frequency fluctuations and their potential for damaging heat pump equipment and
measures to mitigate this risk.35


35   For instance, one potential mitigation option could be the installation of adequate protection devices such as
     surge protectors, power conditioners or Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).



                                                         83
Develop and design targeted implementation and financing schemes, including the
mobilization of grant resources. As indicated above, international experience from
countries with similar program could offer useful lessons learned and design options
for implementation and financing schemes. Potential financing/delivery instruments
include demand-side management programs, micro-credit lines, results-based
financing mechanisms or climate finance instruments, accompanied by targeted
subsidies for low income households.
Implement pilot projects. Pilot projects should be developed to: (i) demonstrate the
benefits of more efficient individual heating models in terms of energy (cost) savings,
indoor air pollution, and comfort levels; (ii) test the adequacy of the selected
implementation and financing schemes; and (iii) investigate the willingness of
consumers to adopt new stoves and boilers under the chosen implementation and
financing schemes.
Conduct early public outreach campaigns. International experience confirms that
extensive awareness and promotion campaigns help to educate the public about
benefits related to more efficient individual heating options. They also inform people
about the dedicated financing and implementation mechanisms.
6.4         Recommendation 4: Construction and Rehabilitation of Small
            HOBs
The levelized cost assessment indicates that small HOBs continue to be a cost-effective
heating solution and could also be a viable alternative for buildings currently served
by large HOBs in both Bishkek and Tokmok (see Section 6.5 below). As described in
Section 3, many of the small HOBs are in dilapidated condition with low efficiency
levels (as a result of their conversion from gas to coal) and/or run on electricity, which
aggravates power shortages in winter months.
6.4.1 Recommended Measures
It is recommended to gradually replace existing small HOBs in dilapidated condition36
with either more efficient gas-fired models or, in Bishkek, through an extension of the
DH network supplied by the CHP 1, if the buildings are close to BTS’ network. The
replacement of old and inefficient HOBs by efficient gas-fired models can reduce the
fuel consumption by 20 to 50 percent, improve heat supply reliability, enhance
comfort levels in buildings and either reduce pollution in urban areas (if replacing coal-
fired HOBs) or help mitigating winter power shortages (if replacing electricity-based
boilers).
In addition, the construction of new, small HOBs should be considered for buildings
currently served by large HOBs in poor condition or buildings located at the outskirts
of the service area supplied by large HOBs (see Section 6.5). Small, efficient HOBs
should also be considered as a viable heating option during the construction of new
multi-apartment buildings going forward.


36   There are currently about 74 small HOBs operated by BTE in Bishkek. Only one was recently constructed (2011)
     and is considered to be efficient. In most cases, the condition of the boilers is so poor that rehabilitation would
     technically result in dismantling and replacement of old boilers. Given that some of the existing structures and
     auxiliary equipment can be re-used, the investment costs would be reduced by around 10 percent.



                                                            84
The installation of small and efficient HOBs should be combined with energy efficiency
measures (see Section 6.6) and the installation of thermostatic valves and heat cost
allocators (see Section 6.2) in targeted buildings.
6.4.2 Scope of Implementation
In Bishkek, the replacement or construction of small HOBs is recommended for the
following building types: (i) all public buildings without access to the DH system, taking
into account future decisions on the continuation of large HOBs operated by BTE; (ii)
multi-apartment buildings with existing building-internal heating infrastructure (i.e.,
buildings currently served by large or small HOBs); and (iii) new multi-apartment
buildings that will be built in the future.
In Tokmok, the construction of small, efficient HOBs should be considered for new
public and multi-apartment buildings, or buildings currently served by large HOBs (see
Section 6.5).
6.4.3 Implementation Issues
Environmental impact: The replacement of coal-, fuel oil- or gas-fired HOBs with more
efficient and cleaner gas-fired models will have a positive environmental impact.
However, this will depend on access to gas in the short- or medium-term.
Building-internal heating infrastructure: All of the buildings targeted by this
recommendation have an internal building heating infrastructure or are under
construction. As small HOBs are replaced, the rehabilitation needs of the buildings’
internal heating networks should be assessed and thermostatic valves and heat cost
allocators should be installed in apartments. For new buildings, measures should be
taken to ensure that the internal heating network has a horizontal design to allow for
the disconnection of individual apartments (for non-payment) and individual
metering.
Financing: As described in Section 2, heating companies are in poor financial
condition. They lack the funding to pay for the up-front capital cost of new small HOBs.
Because the companies operate at a loss, their borrowing capacity is seriously
constrained. Securing sufficient financing for rehabilitation may be quite challenging
and is likely to require a mix of funding sources. However, greenfield installations in
newly constructed multi-apartment buildings, or replacement of boilers owned by
public institutions may offer new business opportunities for engaging private sector
participation (e.g., private heat suppliers or private maintenance companies).
6.4.4 Next Steps
A detailed investment and implementation plan should be developed for the
replacement of small HOBs operated by BTE to determine priorities, detailed
investment requirements and technical implementation aspects. This would include:
(i) assessing the condition of the boilers and internal heating infrastructure; (ii)
evaluating the fuel availability and space requirements for the boiler; (iii) conducting
an economic and financial analysis; (iv) clarifying ownership issues, in particular for
small HOBs in public buildings; (v) installing apartment-level temperature control and
heat cost allocators; and (vi) other issues.




                                           85
6.5    Recommendation 5: Replacement of Large HOBs
Large HOBs currently supply heat for 579 public and residential buildings in Bishkek
and 415 buildings in Tokmok. As described in Sections 3 and 4, many of the large HOBs
are in poor operational condition and in need of major rehabilitation. The levelized
cost assessment indicates that small HOBs are a more viable heating option than large
HOBs, in particular as the continued use of large HOBs would require substantial
upgrades to the boilers and the DH distribution network.
6.5.1 Recommended Measures
To determine whether it is economically and technically preferable to continue
operating large HOBs or to replace them with efficient centralized or individual gas-
fired heating options, it is recommended to conduct a detailed feasibility study for
each facility. As part of this assessment, the following options should be evaluated in
detail:
 For large HOBs that are in poor operational condition and in need of major
    rehabilitation, their replacement by either small, efficient HOBs or by efficient
    individual gas-based heating solutions.
 Redrawing the service areas of the three large HOBs operated by Tokmok KZhK to
  improve efficiency. The long distance between the boiler houses and end-
  consumers located at the outskirts of the service area results in unnecessarily high
  heat losses. Changing or decreasing the service area of large HOBs and constructing
  new, small HOBs for buildings removed from the DH system could reduce losses.
 Implementing the efficiency and reliability measures described under Section 6.2
  for large HOBs in good operational condition.
6.5.2 Scope of Implementation
The specific scope of implementation would depend on the results of a detailed
feasibility study. Currently, about 15 percent of the multi-apartment and nine percent
of the public buildings in Bishkek are served by large HOBs. Almost all multi-apartment
and public buildings in Tokmok are served by large HOBs.
6.5.3 Implementation Issues
Environmental impact: As described in Section 3.1.2, a number of large HOBs use fuel
oil as primary fuel (instead of gas) or have been converted from gas to coal with low
combustion efficiency. Their replacement by small, efficient gas-fired HOBs would
have a positive environmental impact. However, this will depend on the availability
and access to gas, and the results of the detailed feasibility study.
Efficiency gains of alternative heating solutions: The levelized cost assessment found
that individual heat pumps and individual gas boilers/heaters are slightly more cost-
effective than small HOBs. However, the customer segment targeted for this
intervention already relies on a centralized solution and has a functioning internal
heating system. For this reason, the installation of small HOBs should be considered
as a priority option. If households have to switch to individual heating solutions
(without some program promoting and subsidizing efficient models), they would likely
opt for inexpensive electric oil radiators or inefficient individual heating solutions.




                                          86
Other implementation issues: There are a number of other implementation issues,
such as the redundancy of existing generation, transmission and distribution
infrastructure, which will need to be assessed in detail as part of the feasibility study.
Specific implementation issues related to the installation of small HOBs are
highlighted in Section 6.4.3.
6.5.4 Next Steps
A detailed feasibility study should be conducted for the nine large HOBs operated by
BTE and the three large HOBs operated by Tokmok KZhK SUE in order to determine
whether their continued operation or their replacement by small HOBs or individual
gas-based heating solutions are the more viable investment. For each boiler house,
this should include (but not be limited to) an assessment of: (i) the operational
condition of the boiler house and related heat network; (ii) the heat load density of
the service area; (iii) rehabilitation or replacement costs, including the need for
rehabilitating the transmission and distribution network; (iv) investment costs to
replace large HOBs in poor condition with small HOBs/individual gas heaters or boilers
and related technical requirements; and (v) access to gas-fired options.
6.6    Recommendation 6: Implementation of an Energy Efficiency
       Program in Buildings
Improving the efficient use of energy in buildings is one of the most cost-effective and
environmentally friendly ways to help meet heat demand in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Estimates suggest that energy efficiency improvements could reduce energy
consumption by 30 to 50 percent, and generate savings of up to 480,000 MWh per
year in Bishkek and Tokmok alone. Given the poor energy performance of the majority
of buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic, this would also have a number of other co-benefits,
including improved comfort levels in buildings, reduced air pollution and reduced
energy expenditures for households and public institutions.
6.6.1 Recommended Measures
Energy efficiency retrofits in public and residential buildings are recommended in both
Bishkek and Tokmok. Depending on the conditions of the public and residential
buildings, recommended retrofit measures (besides improvements related to the
heating systems) to reduce heat demand/losses should include: (i) the insulation of
walls, basements and/or attics; (ii) repair/replacement of external doors and
windows; (iii) window optimization (partial replacement of existing windows with
walls while complying with daylight requirements); and (iv) improved operations and
maintenance practices.
6.6.2 Scope of Implementation
The economic analysis of heating options finds that in some multi-apartment buildings
energy efficiency has a lower LCHS than DH with large HOBs. Energy retrofits in all
building types appear to have an LCHS that is lower than individual electric radiators.
As a priority, energy efficiency measures should be implemented in all public and
residential buildings where the heating systems will be upgraded. The experience in
other ECA countries demonstrates that linking heating system improvements to
building energy efficiency measures generates significant operational and financial
synergies. In addition, the Government should consider developing a broader energy


                                           87
efficiency program for public and/or residential buildings. To streamline limited
resources, it is advisable to focus initially on a selected target segment (either public
or residential buildings). Factors for such a decision should include:
 the objective of the program;
 the potential for economically and financially viable energy efficiency investments
  – in this regard, the low heating and electricity tariffs will be one of the key barriers
  in incentivizing households to invest in energy saving measures; while the same is
  true for the public sector, the economic viability of investments is typically valued
  more highly in the public sector; and
 the ease of implementation – in ECA, many countries decided to start first with an
  energy efficiency program in the public buildings sector before moving to the more
  complex residential sector; reasons for this choice include: (i) the lack of well-
  functioning collective decision-making structures in multi-apartment buildings; (ii)
  insufficient financial incentives for private investments; (iii) the lack of access to
  affordable financing for many households; and (iv) the demonstration effect and
  social benefits of improved energy efficiency in public buildings, such as schools,
  hospitals and kindergartens, for a large segment of the population.
6.6.3 Implementation Issues
Energy efficiency building programs supported by the World Bank and other
development partners in ECA have demonstrated that substantial energy savings
(between 20 and 50 percent) and co-benefits (e.g., better comfort levels) can be
achieved. However, effective implementation requires a strong enabling environment
and targeted financing and implementation mechanisms. Decisive government
actions and long-term commitment are required to enact and enforce legislation,
adopt policy and regulatory enhancements, improve market conditions, build local
capacity and provide access to affordable financing. Priority actions and
implementation issues include:
Tariff reform: The key policy action to improve the financial viability of energy
efficiency investments is the transition to cost-reflective energy prices for both heat
and electricity. In addition, the introduction of consumption-based billing practices for
customers connected to the DH system is a pre-requisite for the generation of energy
cost savings for households and public institutions investing in energy efficiency.
Developing targeted financing and implementation mechanisms: The Government
should consider developing effective financing mechanisms to support the
implementation of an energy efficiency program targeted either for public or
residential buildings.
Financing mechanisms for public buildings: International experience indicates that
there are a number of different financing options ranging from public financing (e.g.,
grant-financed pilot programs) to commercial financing (e.g., credit lines, partial credit
guarantees, ESCO financing, etc.). Based on the local market capacity and the maturity
of the financial and credit markets in the Kyrgyz Republic, the following two
mechanisms may be the most suitable short-term financing options for energy
efficiency investments in public buildings:




                                            88
   Budget financing with piloting of more sustainable models: To build capacity,
    demonstrate energy efficiency benefits, reduce public energy cost spending and
    improve comfort levels in schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other public
    facilities, the Government may want to consider implementing a budget/grant-
    financed energy efficiency program for public buildings. Under such a program,
    the Government provides funding (e.g., as part of a project financed by
    development partners) to public facilities/municipalities to cover the upfront costs
    of energy efficiency investments. Gradually, the program could phase in more
    sustainable financing features, such as ‘budget capture models’. In this case, future
    (energy) budgetary provisions for the benefitting public institution are reduced
    until the loan has been (partially or fully) repaid. The Government could use some
    of the cash saved through the budget capture system to finance additional
    projects. Another option would be the phasing-in of co-financing arrangements
    with the beneficiaries. Budget/grant-financed energy efficiency programs are
    typically implemented through a project implementation unit (PIU), which
    provides support for selecting buildings, conducting technical preparatory
    activities and related procurements (e.g., energy audits, designs), supervising and
    implementing the energy efficiency measures and monitoring of results.
   Revolving Fund for energy efficiency: Some developing countries (e.g., Armenia,
    Bulgaria, India, Romania, Uruguay, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have
    created or are planning to create revolving funds to finance energy efficiency
    measures in public buildings. In this case, a Fund (typically an independent entity
    established by the government) provides the up-front investments and technical
    assistance for preparing and implementing energy efficiency measures. The
    benefitting public institution repays the investment costs based on the estimated
    or verified energy cost savings achieved. This allows the funds to revolve (by re-
    investing the repaid funds) while the benefitting public institution is able to
    maintain a positive cash flow. In most countries, the Fund offers different financial
    products and technical assistance services to cover the needs and capacity of
    different public institutions (e.g., loans, grants, guarantees for commercial bank
    loans, technical assistance for energy auditing, procurement, supervision, etc.).
    Key issues in the Kyrgyz Republic that could hamper implementation of a revolving
    fund scheme and would need to be taken into account include: (i) the low energy
    tariffs; (ii) the low comfort levels in public buildings reducing actual energy cost
    savings and repayment reflows; (iii) the limited technical and financial market
    capacity; and (iv) public budgeting/procurement rules. Box 6.4 provides an
    example of experience with a revolving energy efficiency fund in Armenia.

 Box 6.4: Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund in Armenia
 The R2E2 Fund was established in 2005 initially as a PIU for a World Bank-supported
 energy efficiency/renewable energy project. The Fund operates on a fully commercial
 basis and is governed by a board of trustees made up of representatives from the
 government, private sector, NGOs and academia. A government-appointed executive
 director, supported by technical and financial staff, manages day-to-day activities. The
 Fund currently implements a World Bank/GEF-supported energy efficiency program in
 public sector facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals, administration buildings, street lighting)
 using a revolving fund scheme. The Fund offers two financing products to eligible public
 entities:
 Energy Service Agreements (ESA) are used for schools and other public entities that are
 not legally or budget independent. Under the ESA, a public entity pays the Fund its
 baseline energy costs (with adjustments for energy prices, usage and other factors) over
 the 7-to-10- year contract period. The Fund designs the project, hires subcontractors,
 oversees construction and commissioning and monitors the subproject. In this case, the
 client entity incurs no debt. Rather, the Fund directly pays the energy bills to the utility on
 the client’s behalf. The Fund retains the balance to cover its investment cost and service
 fee. The ESA is designed so that the duration can be adjusted if the Fund recovers its full
 investment earlier (or later).
 For municipalities and public entities with revenue streams independent of the state
 budget, loans are provided. These loans count as municipal debt, with fixed repayment
 obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years. The repayment
 amounts are designed to allow clients to repay the investment costs and service fees from
 the estimated energy cost savings. The client can pay additional fees for the Fund to
 implement the project on its behalf.
 R2E2 uses simplified performance contracts to shift some performance risks to private
 construction firms/contractors. Under these contracts, firms are selected based on the net
 present value of the projects they propose. A portion of their final payment (around 30
 percent) is based on a commissioning test.
 The R2E2 Fund is expected to finance an estimated 85 projects worth about US$6 million
 between 2012 and 2015 and to demonstrate a sustainable financing and implementation
 model for the public sector. As of January 2014, the Fund signed 20 loans and ESAs valued
 at US$3.05 million since 2011.

Financing mechanisms for residential buildings: International experience indicates
that there are four major financing options for a residential energy efficiency program:
energy efficiency funds, commercial bank financing, partial credit guarantees and
utility energy efficiency programs. Energy efficiency funds and commercial bank
financing, combined with grant-based incentive schemes, appear to be the most
suitable financing options for kick-starting energy efficiency in residential buildings in
the Kyrgyz Republic. There is already a credit-line supported by EBRD, which provides
loans and grants (10 to 35 percent) for energy efficiency investments in residential
buildings and industrial enterprises. Industrial energy efficiency investments currently
account for the large majority of the investment volume. Instead of creating a new
financing instrument for residential buildings, the Government may want to consider


                                               90
focusing on evaluating the reasons for limited adoption in the residential sector. The
Government should explore ways to enhance the coverage of the credit-line and
pipeline development and to develop policy/program enhancements.
Utility energy efficiency programs may also be a viable option. Utilities are well-placed
to deliver energy efficiency programs because of their established relationships with
customers and knowledge of local energy use patterns. They also have billing systems
in place that can be used to recover costs from customers. Because utilities in the
Kyrgyz Republic currently lose money on each unit of heat supplied, they have financial
incentives to implement programs that reduce demand.
A program could be developed that would replace inefficient radiators with heat
pumps (for electric customers) or individual gas heaters (for gas customers) in
accordance with the recommendation on the replacement of inefficient individual
heating systems (see section 6.3). The electricity distribution companies or the gas
company could provide the equipment and use customers’ monthly bills for full or
partial recovery of the cost over multiple billing periods. Gazprom could implement a
similar program for new gas customers which provides efficient, high quality gas
heaters with the new connection, with Gazprom recovering the cost through the gas
bill.
Strengthening HOAs: Split incentives in multi-apartment buildings and weak HOAs are
key challenges to both energy efficiency investments and upgrades of collective
heating solutions (small HOBs or DH). If decision-making structures for investments
and mechanisms for financing more capital-intensive upgrades are not well
established, it will be very difficult in multi-apartment buildings to reach consensus
about upgrading/switching to collective heating solutions or implementing building-
level energy efficiency measures. Experience in the ECA region has shown that
governments can support the development of HOAs by drafting better legislation for
decision-making in multi-apartment buildings. For instance, the government can set
and enforce standards for apartment-building maintenance and provide training and
public outreach on collective decision-making, building management and
maintenance.
Experience in the region has also shown, however, that many efforts to strengthen
HOAs meet obstacles which prove difficult to overcome. Such obstacles include: 37
 The mix of residents from different economic levels living in the same building. This
  can result in poorer residents refusing to make contributions toward maintenance
  expenses, while wealthier residents subsidize their neighbors.
 The technical capacity of HOAs. It is difficult for apartment owners to establish and
  operate HOAs on their own, especially for low-income households, whose buildings
  are typically in the most need of repair. HOAs typically hire professional managers,
  but it is important for individual apartment owners to understand their rights and
  responsibilities as HOA members.

                                                        91
 The poor condition of the buildings. Residents may fear that they will not have
  enough money to address the magnitude of the problems.
 The absence of incentives. Low tariffs have kept services affordable, but have also
  led to poor service quality and reliability. Meanwhile, a lack of metering and
  controls gives residents no reason to cut their consumption.
 Limited access to financing. HOAs have difficulty borrowing because banks do not
  view them as creditworthy and are typically unwilling to lend on a project finance
  basis.
Given the difficulty of working through HOAs, the Kyrgyz Republic also should consider
other approaches. Lithuania offers an example of an alternative approach in which a
municipality initiated and managed energy efficiency improvements in buildings. The
program retrofitted more than 2,400 residential buildings between 1996 and 2013—
saving about 82.3 GWh per year—despite the lack of borrowing and technical capacity
on the part of homeowners and HOAs. Box 6.5 provides insight on improving
homeowner associations in Lithuania.

 Box 6.5: Approach to Address the Lack of Borrowing Capacity by Homeowners
 and HOAs in Lithuania
 The residential energy efficiency program in Lithuania, initiated in 1996, provided loans
 and subsidies, combined with technical assistance, to support energy efficiency
 investments in residential buildings. To address the limited technical and borrowing
 capacity, the lack of awareness and split incentives of homeowners and HOAs, the
 program allowed building renovations to be initiated by the municipality.1 The
 municipality appointed a project administrator for multi-apartment buildings with weak
 or inexistent HOAs. The appointed building administration company (mostly municipally
 owned) took loans on behalf of the homeowners to finance the energy efficiency
 investment costs. The company recovered the investment costs through a monthly
 building-management fee paid by homeowners based on the estimated energy cost
 savings achieved. Homeowners were not obliged to borrow. The municipal project
 administrator assumed the loan repayment risk. While the consent of homeowners was
 required to implement the energy efficient retrofits in their buildings, the program also
 provided additional incentives to facilitate consent from low-income households. After
 completion of the renovations, all low-income households received a subsidy covering 100
 percent of the preparation and renovation costs. The state reduced the heating subsidy
 by 50 to 100 percent over three years for low-income households that opposed the
 implementation of energy savings measures.

Ensuring enforcement of building codes for new buildings: The Kyrgyz Republic has
an advanced legislative framework for efficient energy performance standards.
However, less than 10 percent of the newly constructed buildings comply with these
building codes. If newly constructed buildings would comply with the enacted energy
performance standards, specific heat demand in those buildings could be reduced by




                                                92
15 to 25 percent (or about 50 Gcal per building per year).38 In order to establish an
enforcement system, the following components are typically needed: (i) a dedicated
unit/department with sufficient budget and staffing to administer and implement
building codes; (ii) a clear compliance process with administrative procedures,
compliance forms, checklists and procedures, user manuals or guidebooks,
compliance tools, etc.; (iii) awareness raising, training and capacity building among
officials, designers, architects, engineers, manufacturers and other key stakeholders;
and (iv) evaluation and monitoring arrangements.39
6.6.4 Next Steps
Select the target buildings for an energy efficiency investment program and define
the objective. As indicated above, in order to develop and design an effective energy
efficiency program, the Government would need to determine the objective and
scope of such a program (public or residential buildings).
Conduct a comprehensive market assessment. A market assessment is needed to: (i)
analyze the technical, economic and financial energy efficiency potential for various
building types; (ii) evaluate the energy efficiency supply market (e.g., energy auditors,
equipment suppliers, design and construction companies, etc.) to provide an overview
of the market capacity and quality of services/products; (iii) assess key policy,
regulatory, financial and institutional barriers to realize the energy efficiency potential
and identify specific ways that these barriers can be addressed; and (iv) inform the
selection and design of an adequate implementation and financing scheme.
Select and design a targeted implementation and financing mechanism for the
energy efficiency program. To incentivize energy efficiency investments, careful
design of effective implementation and financing schemes is needed. In addition,
broad stakeholder consultations are recommended to ensure that the selected
mechanism(s) and design features reflect the needs of the target market segment and
other stakeholders involved (e.g., engineering companies, energy auditors,
commercial banks, etc.). The Government may want to explore different financial
sources to support such a program, which could include bilateral and multilateral
development partners, GEF allocation, etc.


6.7         Action Plan for Bishkek and Tokmok
As the recommendation sections highlighted, a comprehensive package of policy
reforms and investment measures is needed to improve the operational and financial
performance of the heating sector, and adequately meet residential and public heat
demand. Table 6.1 recommends a roadmap with a timeframe in which actions should
be implemented, and demonstrates which challenge these actions will help address.

Appendix A: Problems with the Current Energy Tariff-
            Setting Process and Recent Tariff Reform
            Efforts
Improving the financial performance of the heating companies through tariff reform
has proven difficult due to several constraints in the tariff setting process and
regulatory structure. Specifically, the problems with the existing tariff approach
include:
 Unclear tariff methodology. The Regulatory Agency of the Fuel and Energy
  Complex does not currently have a clear tariff setting methodology and formal
  procedure for setting heat tariffs. Best practice regulation requires that regulators
  implement a tariff methodology that establishes the standard tariff setting
  approach they will follow. A tariff methodology provides utility companies and the
  public with a clear and transparent set of procedures for how tariffs are determined
  and specifies the role of the regulator. The methodology should define the costs
  that will be recovered through tariffs, the procedures for allocating these costs to
  different customer groups and the approach to designing end-user tariffs. In
  addition, a clear tariff methodology should lay out the tariff review process by
  defining the procedures for reporting costs, cost review and approval, public
  hearings and publication of tariff proceedings.
 Inefficient tariff design. The Regulatory Agency currently sets national residential
  heat and hot water tariffs and then approves tariffs for non-residential customers
  not served by the CHP separately for every boiler in the country. As a result, the
  regulator approves more than 80 sets of tariffs. This creates a burden on the
  regulator. It is an inefficient approach to tariff design. A more efficient approach
  would be to aggregate the costs of the individual boilers for each company, then
  set individual tariffs for each heating company. Companies with multiple boilers
  would be responsible for determining how to allocate the revenue among each of
  the facilities under their control.
 Overlapping regulatory responsibilities. One of the main barriers to tariff reform
  has been confusion over the jurisdiction of tariff setting between the Anti-
  Monopoly Agency and the Regulatory Department (the predecessor of the
  Regulatory Agency). While it was clear that the Regulatory Department was in
  charge of setting tariffs, it was unclear which organization had the responsibility for
  approving the costs that could be recovered. This issue was addressed by recent
  legal and regulatory changes, which assigned economic regulatory functions—
  including tariff regulation—exclusively to the Regulatory Agency. Giving the
  Regulatory Agency exclusive responsibility for tariff reform solves the problem of
  overlapping responsibilities. However, the Regulatory Agency now needs to make
  a concerted effort to establish public confidence in the regulatory process by
  establishing clear and consistent tariff setting procedures and conducting regular
  public hearings on key regulations to be adopted. A first step was made in
  December, when the Regulatory Agency adopted a methodology for setting



                                          101
  electricity tariffs. As a next step, the adoption of a transparent tariff setting
  methodology for the heating sector is needed.
 Use of normative tariffs. A lack of end-user metering in the heating sector requires
  the use of normative tariffs. Normative tariffs are fixed charges that are usually
  based on either some assumed number of family members in a household or the
  area (in m2) of the customer served. The existing approach for the majority of
  residential customers is to charge customers by area for heating and number of
  family members for hot water. A normative tariff thus assumes an average
  consumption pattern for all customers based on the size of the premise being
  heated (combined with building characteristics) or the number of people being
  served. The problem with normative tariffs is that the price paid for energy services
  is not connected to consumption. Customers have no incentive to conserve heat.
  As a result, heating companies also do not cover the costs to serve consumption
  that is outside the pattern assumed in the normative tariff. Heat meters,
  thermostatic valves and heat cost allocators need to be installed to gradually
  transition to consumption-based tariffs.
The Government and Regulatory Agency must account for these issues as they work
to reform tariffs and improve the financial condition of the heating companies. This
should include formal tariff methodology and more efficient tariff design.
Tariff Reform
The Government has recently embarked on electricity and heat tariff reforms aimed
at a phased increase of end-user tariffs. The draft MTTP for the power and heating
sectors for 2014-2017 envisions annual tariff increases for different consumer groups
to achieve short-term cost recovery by 2017. A more than two-fold increase for
residential DH and hot water tariffs is envisioned for 2014/2015. Appendix Table A.1
below shows the tariff rates for heat, hot water and electricity across different types
of consumer groups before and after the increases.
