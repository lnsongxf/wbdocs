               The East Asia Urban Sanitation Review: A Call for Action (World Bank 2013)

    FOREWORD   highlighted the importance of improving collection, treatment, and disposal of
               human waste in cost-effective ways in East Asian cities. It also recommended the
               systematic exploration of opportunities to use wastewater as a resource for the
               production of energy at treatment facilities and an increased emphasis on this
               approach, together with others, such as the generation of biosolids from sludge, as
               parts of a climate-smart sanitation strategy.

               This technical note explores in greater depth the production of energy in wastewater
               treatment plants as an option to save costs in the operation of these facilities. This
               is relevant for two reasons. First, in East Asia, where urban populations have
               been growing rapidly and becoming increasingly dense, an exclusive reliance on
               onsite sanitation services is not possible, which presents a clear need to invest in
               infrastructure to collect and treat wastewater. This infrastructure is expensive to
               build and run; however, identifying smart cost-saving measures can help relieve
               the burden of utilities that struggle to expand wastewater collection and treatment
               services in a financially sustainable manner.

               Second, research has traditionally focused on energy efficiency measures and
               energy generation with respect to wastewater treatment technologies that are
               energy intensive and work well in the cold climates usually found in developed
               countries. This leaves a knowledge gap that needs to be bridged to inform utility
               managers in developing countries about the factors that need to be in place for
               the adoption of options like “wastewater to energy,” particularly applied to low-
               cost treatment options and conditions in warm developing climates.

               With the urban wastewater sector in its early stages of development in many
               East Asian countries, the World Bank Group is committed to working with
               these countries to promote informed decisions and find innovative, cost-effective
               solutions that will contribute to improving the environmental conditions of
               rapidly growing cities and expanding sanitation services to increasing numbers of
               people, including the poor.

                           The task team leader for producing this report was Victor Vazquez, and the sector
                           managers were Charles Feinstein and Ousmane Dione. The main author was

                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



                             Sanitation services in many East Asian cities struggle to keep pace with
                             rapid urban growth. The East Asia Urban Sanitation Review (World Bank 2013)
                             showed the enormous challenges the sanitation sector faces in most urban areas
                             in the region, primarily excessive dependence on defective onsite sanitation in
                             cities with high population densities and persistently low wastewater collection
                             and treatment coverage levels (1 percent, 4 percent, and 10 percent in Indonesia,
                             the Philippines, and Vietnam, respectively).

                             In addition to upgrading existing onsite sanitation services, the growing population
                             densities necessitate expanding collection networks and building sustainable
                             treatment plants that prevent the accumulation of wastewater in the numerous
                             waterways and canals crossing the cities’ packed neighborhoods. Plans to invest
                             in scaled-up urban sanitation services and expanded wastewater collection and
                             treatment infrastructure are already in place. For instance, in Vietnam alone, more
                             than thirty new wastewater treatment plants are to be built in the coming years.

                             Meanwhile, existing wastewater utilities in East Asia are struggling to perform.
                             The high expense of operating modern sewerage collection networks and, more
                             in particular, wastewater treatment plants is often an obstacle to expanding
                             and improving services for a sector that usually has low cost recovery rates and
                             depends on unpredictable government transfers. Utilities tend to reduce costs
                             where they can, most notably by saving on maintenance and electricity supply.
                             The result is deteriorating treatment efficiencies, shortened lifespans for facilities,
                             which often fall into disuse, and wasted investments. In Indonesia, for instance,
                             only 47 percent of the treatment capacity installed in the 1990s is being used
                             today (World Bank 2013).

  It is common practice in many European countries to define WWTP design sizes according to their incoming pollution loads (expressed as PE), while in other
countries (particularly English-speaking ones), design size is often defined according to flow rate (expressed as MLD or MGD). In Germany, when BOD5 load
is used, 1 population equivalent (PE) is defined as 60 g BOD5 /PE/d; when COD is used, 1 PE is defined as 120 (sometimes also 110) g COD/PE/d. To indicate
the reference, PE is indexed with the number used. PExy should not be confused with actual (physical) population numbers Depending on lifestyle, use of in-sink
grinders, type of wastewater collection system (combined or separate), and so forth, the actual per capita pollution load emission reaching a WWTP can vary
considerably from region to region, typically within 30–80 g BOD5 /cap/d, and need not be exactly 60 g/cap/d.

  There are several options to produce electricity from biogas: fuel cells, Stirling motor, direct drive engines, co-generation or microturbines. Evaluations of
these options show that the combined production of electricity and heat (CHP) through co-generation or microturbines usually results as the most economical
option for biogas reuse at WWTPs. This has become the common international standard approach at WWTPs, which is also applied in all case studies of this
technical note. More details on these options are provided in annex 3, case study 1.

  The IWA Projects Innovation Awards chose as the winner of its Global Honor Awards in 2013 a WWTP in Batumi, Georgia, that combines anaerobic ponds
with trickling filters. This decision was justified by the “extremely low investment cost” and “low power consumption . . . [representing] less than 50 percent
of [that of] any process technology.” (IWA 2013). In biosolids treatment, a solar sludge drying facility in Managua, Nicaragua, was nominated for the Global
Water Award 2010 in the category of Environmental Contribution of the Year on the basis that “low-cost, low-energy systems such as this are going to be an
important part of the solution in developing countries.” At the time of startup, this facility was the largest of its kind worldwide. Since then, a proliferation of
similar and even larger plants in warm climate countries has been observed.

  A change would be possible if the price of carbon credits reflected the real costs. Annex 3, case study 1 indicates the real cost by presenting companies’
“internal carbon price” per ton of CO2e - about US$40 - which they use for planning purposes. If a price around this value were to materialize, CDM co-financing
could become a much more appealing funding instrument, both in general and specifically for wastewater-to-energy projects in the future.

     In Austria and Germany, the feed-in tariff is regulated by law, and equals roughly 50 percent of the electricity unit purchase price.

  Further assumptions are a twelve-year lifespan of installations with an availability of about 90 percent, discount factor of 5 percent, and conservative biogas
production assumptions (production of 10 L/cap/d, 62 percent methane, 30 percent electric efficiency of CHP). Similar total cost values are also cited in other
sources (U.S. EPA CHP Partnership 2011).
