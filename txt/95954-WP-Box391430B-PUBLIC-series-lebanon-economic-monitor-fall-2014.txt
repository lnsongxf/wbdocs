   As national accounts in Lebanon are only available with a significant time lag—e.g., the latest accounts are from 2011—World
Bank staff have developed two new indicators, a Coincident Indicator (WB-CI) and a Leading Indicator (WB-LI) to better assess recent
economic developments (for details, see Matta, S. (2014) “New Coincident and Leading Indicators for the Lebanese Economy,” World
Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 6950).

   The PMI is an indicator that is based on a monthly survey of business conditions in the Lebanese private sector. It is a composite
index calculated as a weighted average of five individual sub-components: New Orders (30%), Output (25%), Employment (20%),
Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%) and Stocks of Purchases (10%). A value of the PMI above 50.0 signals an improvement in business
conditions from the previous month, while a drop in the PMI below the 50.0 threshold indicates a slowdown in business activity
(BLOM Bank, 2013).

   Between 1997 and 2011, the services sector accounted, on average, for 73.5 percent of real GDP. In addition to its large share of
the Lebanese economy, the tertiary sector attracted more than two thirds (71.6 percent) of the Lebanese workforce as of 2009.

   The service sector’s contribution to growth declined from an average of 4.6 percentage points (pp) in the 2005-2010 period to only
0.9 pp in 2011.

   In 2012, Lebanon began importing fuel bound to Syria as Syria lost access to its own oil fields, increasing the volume of fuel imports
to Lebanon by 8 percent. Regarding this as support for the Syrian regime, anti-Syrian regime groups in Lebanon began attacking trucks
carrying fuel to Syria; this curtailed the volume of imported fuel to Lebanon by 0.5 percent in 2013. In 2014, a moderate rebound is
expected as the political noise around the issue has dissipated.

Lebanon’s inflation rate reached is lowest level
in a decade. According to the Consultation and
Research Institute (CRI) the headline CPI inflation
averaged 2.7 percent in 2013, representing a 3 pp
decrease relative to the same period in 2012 (Figure
11).16 The declining inflation rate reflects both
domestic factors and import inflation. The former
is illustrated by falling core inflation, resulting from
the sharp deceleration in economic activity, and the
latter by declining energy and food prices. Rent/
housing inflation is not adequately captured in the
various existing inflation measures in Lebanon.

    Inflation data in Lebanon are problematic. The CRI CPI index does not include rents and only collects price data for the Greater
Beirut area. As such, the Central Administration of Statistics’ CPI inflation, which does reflect infrequent measurement of rent inflation,
averaged 5.7 percent in 2013. The CAS inflation time series is relatively short and its methodology was recently changed (e.g., to better
capture rents). Additionally, CAS did not collect any price data between January and May 2013. These make the use of the CAS CPI
challenging for economic analysis.

   The last stimulus package was launched in January 2013 in the amount of USD1.46 billion and proved successful. As detailed in the
Spring 2013 issue of Lebanon Economic Monitor, the real estate sector benefited the most from the subsidized loans. Start-ups and
venture capital (relatively nascent in Lebanon) are also responding favorably to BdL’s subsidized loans.

     The main aim of the e-card food voucher

     the most extreme poor Lebanese as a means
     to mitigate the impact of the Syrian crisis.
     Rising food prices and the coping mechanisms
     with food vulnerability indicate a need to provide
     food assistance to help alleviate the impact of the
     crisis on the food security of poor Lebanese. To
     cope with increased expenditures and decreased
     incomes many Lebanese households are reducing
     savings, increasing debt, or cutting on meals.
     Beka’a residents, for instance, reported to mostly

     borrow food (42 percent), and are spending from

     “only afford to” food items (43 percent), reduce
     quality of meals (40 percent) and spend from
     savings (40 percent) (UNDP, 2012).36 Spending
     from savings indicates that Lebanese households
     might not be able to sustain the current situation
     in the near future.

an overview of the various types of SWFs that have
been established across countries, draws lessons
from these experiences, highlights some pitfalls, and
presents preliminary recommendations for Lebanon
as it moves towards establishing its SWF. Key
among these recommendations is that the Lebanese
SWF’s design should include (i) integration with
the budget system, (ii) some (limited) flexibility in
operational rules, (iii) no (or limited) earmarking but
no extra-budgetary spending, (iv) coherence with
country investment strategy, and (v) transparency
and accountability.

New Coincident and Leading Indicators for the
Lebanese Economy: (Special Focus 2) Weak economic
statistics in Lebanon impede economic analysis
and decision making. To remedy this, World Bank
staff developed two indicators of economic activity
for Lebanon: a coincident indicator (WB-CI) and a
leading indicator (WB-LI). These indicators, which
are based on an expanded NBER-Conference Board
methodology, reveal promising statistical properties
that should make them valuable coincident and

FALL 2013 LEM:
THE BRUNT OF THE
SYRIAN CONFLICT
Lebanon: Economic and Social Impact of the
Syrian Conflict: (Special Focus 1) During the 2012-
2014 period, the conflict in Syria is having a large,
negative, and rapidly growing impact on Lebanon’s
economy, its social fabric, and its public services.
On the economic front, the deteriorating security
situation is undermining consumption, investment
which is dragging down growth. The cumulative
losses in economic activity could reach an estimated
USD7.5 billion. On the social front, social cohesion
is rapidly deteriorating partly due to combination of
rising poverty—approximately 170,000 Lebanese
would be pushed into poverty (over and above the
1 million currently living below the poverty line)—a
worsening labor market which is estimated to result
in a doubling of the unemployment rate to above
20 percent, rising insecurity, amid deteriorating core
public services. Public services are under pressure
given the sudden and large increase in their demand
arising from the Syrian refugee influx. The fiscal cost
of Syrian conflict is estimated at USD2.6 billion,
of which USD1.5 billion stems from foregone
government revenue collection while the remaining
USD1.1 billion are expenditure incurred by the
government to meet some of the surge in demand
for public services. Across all core public services,
the surge in demand is currently being partly met
through a decline in both the access to and the
quality of public service delivery. It is estimated that
an additional spending of USD2.5 billion would be
required for stabilization, i.e., to reinstate the access
to and quality of public services to their pre-Syrian
conflict level.
