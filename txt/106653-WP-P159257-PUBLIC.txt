1.	 INTRODUCTION
Romania aims to be a country in which all citizens are provided with an equal opportunity to
participate in society, where their basic needs are met and their differences respected, and where
all people feel valued and can live in dignity.
Our society is still far from this ideal. One in every five Romanian people is income poor.1 Most of the
people living in relative poverty in Romania are in persistent poverty, meening that they have been
in poverty for at least the last three years. Despite its relatively low unemployment rate, the country
has a very high rate of poverty for in-work people, which is double the EU-27 rate (9 percent). Thirty
percent of the population is severely materially deprived,2 in that they are unable to afford items
considered desirable or necessary to lead an adequate live. About seven percent of the people live
in households with very low work intensity.3 In total, about 42 percent of the population is at risk of
poverty and social exclusion.4
As a response to this situation, the Government of Romania (GoR) has committed itself to lifting
580,000 people out of poverty by 20205 as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The decline in
poverty between 2008 and 2013 was only 0.9 percentage points (representing 211,000 people
rising out of poverty compared with the national target of 580,000). Consequently, in 2014, the
GoR asked World Bank for assistance to develop a National Strategy on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and a corresponding Action Plan.6 According to this Strategy,
the GoR is committed to making substantial progress in combating poverty and social exclusion
over the next few years. By 2020, Romania is committed to putting in place a set of policies and
programs to (i) lift at least 580,000 people out of relative income poverty by 2020, compared to
2008; (ii) break the inter-generational cycle of poverty; (iii) prevent the recurrence of poverty and
social exclusion; and (iv) ensure equal access to social assistance, cash transfers and services to
strengthen social cohesion.
From the set of policies and interventions covered by the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction 2015-2020, the GoR asked for the World Bank’s support to develop detailed

1  People at risk of relative poverty after receiving social transfers (the AROP indicator) are people whose annual income (including
social protection transfers) is lower than 60 percent of the median income as expressed per adult equivalent. Disposable income is
the sum of all revenues (including those from social protection) minus the amount of taxes (income or property-based) and social
insurance paid.
2  The indicator adopted by the Social Protection Committee (the EU advisory policy committee for the Employment and Social
Affairs Ministers in the Employment and Social Affairs Council) measures the percentage of the population that meets at least four
of the following nine criteria: (1) they cannot afford to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bills; (2) they cannot afford to keep their
home adequately warm; (3) they face unexpected expenses; (4) they cannot afford to eat meat or other protein regularly; (5) they
cannot afford to go on holiday; (6) they cannot afford to purchase a television set; (7) they cannot afford to purchase a washing
machine; (8) they cannot afford to run a car; and (9) they do not have a telephone. The indicator distinguishes between individuals
who cannot afford a certain item or service and those who do not have this item or service for another reason, for example, because
they do not want or need it.
3  According to this indicator, very low work intensity households are those in which adult members aged between 18 and 59 have
worked less than 20 percent of their maximum work potential during the year preceding the survey. Households comprised only of
children, of students under 25 years old, and/or people aged 60 or over were completely excluded from the indicator calculations
4  The broadest indicator (AROPE), which is also used to measure whether the European Union’s social inclusion target is being
met, tracks people at risk of poverty or social exclusion who are in at least one of the following three situations: (i) they are at risk of
poverty (AROP indicator), (ii) live in households with very low work intensity; and/or are (iii) they are suffering from severe material
deprivation.
5  Relative poverty (AROP) is the indicator that is used by the Government of Romania to monitor whether the poverty reduction
target is being met.

implementation plans for the 2015-2018 period in the form of nine Flagship Innitiatives7 that are
expected to have the greatest impact in terms of reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion.
This Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas and Local Human Development in Romania represents the
Flagship Initiative #6. Specifically the Bank’s technical assistance provided through this project has
helped the GoR to develop: (i) a methodology for defining different types of rural marginalized areas
based on a set of key criteria and indicators; (ii) detailed maps that present the spatial distribution
of the rural marginalized communities by county; (iii) a methodology for defining degrees of
local human development from low to comprehensive development, for rural and small urban
settlements; and (iv) detailed county-level maps of local human development.
This geographic targeting tool for rural marginalized areas is based on a methodology comparable
to that applied in the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas in 2014.8 The Local Human Development
Index (LHDI) was initially developed at the administrative unit level within a previous World Bank
project in 2013.9 In this Atlas, the LHDI has been extended and further developed to a finer degree
of granularity.
While this document presents the Atlas, the other eight Flagship Initiatives are complementary
and meant to form a single package. In short, the Atlas helps to define which rural areas are
marginalized, who lives in these areas (the profile of various disadvantaged groups), and where they
are located in Romania. The other Flagship Initiatives, particularly #3 on integrated social services
at the community level and #4 on disadvantaged schools, describe how to intervene in the poorest
rural areas in order to achieve the greatest impact in terms of reducing poverty and promoting social
inclusion.




7  The nine Flagship Initiatives are as follows: #1. Increase the employment of the poor and vulnerable by expanding active labor
market programs; #2. Increase income support for the poor and introduce pro-work incentives for program beneficiaries; #3.
Develop integrated social services at the community level; #4. Improve the instruments for identifying disadvantaged schools to
ensure that all children have access to equal opportunities; #5. Strengthen social services for child protection; #6. Develop an
instrument to identify poor villages and marginalized rural communities; #7. Invest in improving the current IT system to implement
a strong e-social assistance system; #8. Develop a modern payment system; and #9. Strengthen coordination mechanisms and
develop a monitoring and evaluation system.

A Tool for Targeting, Monitoring and Evaluating Interventions
Increasingly, top managers in ministries and donor agencies are recognizing that effective targeting
tools are needed to guide and evaluate programs. The current Atlas is a tool for the geographic
targeting, monitoring, and evaluation of interventions for reducing poverty and promoting social
inclusion. It provides the scientific and factual database essential to inform decision-making and the
choice of appropriate and effective public actions aimed at reduceing poverty and social exclusion
in the most deprived rural communities in Romania.

             Programs for reducing poverty                 A targeting tool becomes effective only if it is
             and promoting social inclusion                followed by action (a policy response). Therefore,
                                                           it is important to ensure that the Atlas is
                                                           disseminated to all central and local stakeholders,
           Policy                             Data         responsible for reducing poverty and promoting
        response                              collection   social inclusion (as shown in the adjacent figure).

Targeting
                                                           The main purpose of this Atlas is to enable these
     Tool                                                  stakeholders to target anti-poverty and pro-social
                                                           inclusion programs in an efficient way, mainly
                                                           to the poorest. It is especially useful for projects
               Data                       Data             that operate at the national, (micro-) regional and
      interpretation                      analysis
                                                           county levels.
Because the Atlas measures marginalization and local human development at the community
level, it can give policy makers a good indication of the places where the need for intervention is
greatest. However, it is also important to evaluate and measure the effects of interventions targeted
to the poorest communities, as is highlighted in Flagship Initiative #9 which contains a plan for
developing a monitoring and evaluation system for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction 2015-2020. Along with the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas, this current Atlas
   10 | INTRODUCTION




will also be a vital tool for monitoring and evaluating these interventions.
Because marginalization is not defined only in terms of income poverty but also in terms of human
capital (education and health) and housing conditions, the Atlas can also be used to inform and
assess programs related to education, health, infrastructure and social housing, including those
dealing with out-of-school children, early school leaving, primary healthcare services, family
planning, parental education, domestic violence and other risks/vulnerabilities that are widespread
in marginalized communities.
Both this Atlas and the Atlas on urban areas will be useful for measuring the effectiveness of the
other anti-poverty Flagship Initiatives. Marginalized areas (whether rural or urban, Roma or non-
Roma) are communities that contain a concentration of low-income households and, populations
with low levels of education and skills relevant to the labor market in areas that are exposed to
environmental hazards and have poor quality or no public services. As such, these marginalized
areas are „natural” target areas for:

•  The active labor market programs discussed in Flagship Initiative #1
•  and
   The integrated social services at the community level (SPOR - Social Program Opportunity
       Responsibility) described in Flagship Initiative #3
•  The programs targeted to disadvantaged schools presented in Flagship Initiative #4
•  under Flagship
   Programs   aimed at preventing children from being separated from their natural families
                  Initiative #5 given that marginalized areas send more children into the special
      protection system than any other communities.
•     Other programs aimed at the development of social services, especially day care centers and
      multifunctional amenities.
In addition, as mentioned above, the marginalized communities identified in the Atlas will be the
best places for applying the monitoring and evaluation system to be developed under Flagship
Initiative #9, particularly to measure the impact of the social benefits reform (and the future
Minimum Social Insertion Income benefit) that will be adopted under Flagship Initiative #2.
In relation to the European funded programs, this Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas and Local
Human Development in Romania will complement the information contained in the Atlas of
Urban Marginalized Areas.10 It will be a usefull tool for all ministries, managing authorities
and intermediary bodies of the operational programs, all regional and county institutions and
partnerships such as intercommunity development associations (IDAs), Local Action Groups
(LAGs)11 and Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAG) operating in rural areas and small towns 12 under
LEADER program or community-led local development (CLLD) programs. In addition, municipalities
and NGOs that initiate interventions in relevant sectors will be able to use the Atlas to target
different types of communities (either marginalized communities or those with different degrees of
local human development). For this purpose, Annex 2 presents the rates of marginalization for all
communes in Romania.

11  Local Action Groups (LAGs) are made up of public and private partners from rural areas (including towns under 20,000
inhabitants) and must include representatives from different socio-economic sectors. LAG membership is open to everyone
living within the LAG boundaries. Both private people and local public/private organizations can become members (http:/   /enrd.
ec.europa.eu/enrd-static/leader/leader/leader-tool-kit/the-local-action-group/en/what-is-the-lag-s-structure_en.html).
12  Both rural and small urban areas (those with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants) are eligible but only as members of a local
partnership (LAG) that might include one or more towns (only in exceptional cases), which however cannot have more than 20,000
inhabitants in total or have more than 25 percent of the total number of inhabitants living in the LAG (MARD, 2013: 396).

1.2 Objective, Research Methodology and
Scope
The main objective of this Atlas is to provide a tool for the geographic targeting, monitoring, and
evaluation of interventions aimed at reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion in the most
deprived rural communities in Romania.
This Atlas presents two complementary methodologies. The first methodology focuses on the
„pockets” of rural marginalization where poverty is multidimensional and most severe. The second
methodology not only focuses on communities where the need for intervention is the highest but
also screens all rural and small urban settlements for potential rural „development poles”.
The first key step in producing the Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas and Local Human
Development in Romania was to conduct a desk review of the existing criteria and indices used
to define “poor communities”, “segregated communities”, and “marginalized rural communities”
in Romania. Based on this review, in the second key step, the team developed a methodology to
identify rural marginalized areas using data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census. This
drew heavily on the methodology used in the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas13 but was adapted
to take account of the particular characteristics of rural communities. In the third step, the results
of the methodology for identifying rural marginalized areas were validated through extensive
field research based on qualitative methods. The aim of the validation study was to check the
quantitative results for both inclusion and exclusion errors. The field research took place in May
and June 2015 and covered villages in two counties, Călărași and Vaslui. It also further refined the
typology of rural marginalized communities by distinguishing two subtypes – communities that
are geographically isolated and those that are peripherally located within well-connected villages.
The qualitative research largely confirmed the results of the methodology based on quantitative
techniques, but it also highlighted several limitations of the approach. Finally, in the fourth step, the
main characteristics of each subtype of rural marginalized areas were determined and the mapping
was done.
Professor Dumitru Sandu resumed his work on the Local Human Development Index (LHDI) that
was carried out in previous World Bank study.14 For the current Atlas, Professor Sandu further
extended the LHDI to cover small towns with up to 30,000 inhabitants and increased its granularity
by extending it from the administrative unit (or SIRSUP) level (commune or city) to the locality
(SIRUTA) level (village or neighborhood). In the next key step, the team analyzed how local human
development in these SIRUTAs is affected by the large cities, urban connectivity, and endogenous
forces. Lastly, the team produced local human development maps.
The maps presented in this Atlas are complementary to other maps of Romania that have
recently been produced. First, the maps of rural marginalization complement the maps of
urban marginalization produced by the World Bank in 2014.15 Second, the maps of both rural
marginalization and local human development supplement the „poverty maps” that were created

by the World Bank and the European Commission in 2014. 16 All of these maps were drawn up
using 2011 census data, but the maps included in this Atlas are different from the „poverty maps” in
terms of the geographical level at which the analysis was conducted and the methodology that was
applied.17 While the poverty maps show the variations in poverty across regions and counties, the
rural marginalization maps go down to the census sector level and indicates „pockets” of extreme
destitution that need to be targeted with integrated interventions. The local human development
maps show the different degrees of local human development at the village level (SIRUTA unit),
including the most developed SIRUTAs that are candidates for becoming development poles within
the regions and counties.
The Atlas covers all rural or small urban (under 30,000 inhabitants) administrative units in the
country. The Atlas identifies marginalized areas only in rural units18 but it determines the degree of
local human development in both rural and small urban settlements.
The rural marginalization analysis was conducted at the lowest spatial level available. The 2011
Population Census provided the opportunity to conduct such an analysis at the level of census
sectors.19 For the analysis presented in this Atlas, the micro data from the 2011 Population Census
were aggregated at this level. A typical census sector consists of around 200 inhabitants in both
rural and urban areas. However, the variation is large ranging from a minimum of one person to a
maximum of over 4,200 inhabitants in rural areas, and 10,385 people in urban areas in each census
sector.

household disposable income levels for each household in the census. This information is then used to estimate the number and
proportion of people in each region or county whose consumption is below the risk of poverty line, using the standard EU threshold
of 60 percent of median national income.

Source: World Bank calculations using data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census.
Notes: The distribution of census sectors at the administrative unit level is presented in Annex 1. Table 1. *Small
towns are those with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants. Overall in Romania there are 253 small towns.

Rural areas in Romania are organized into 2,861 communes (administrative units) and these include
12,373 villages.20 The 2011 Population Census contains 46,547 census sectors in villages, of which
5.3 percent are very small (fewer than 50 inhabitants), while about 1 percent are large (with 500
inhabitants or more). The number of census sectors per village varies considerably according to
population size, from a minimum of one sector per village to a maximum of 41 sectors in two villages
(see Table 1).21 For reliability reasons, the analysis presented in the next sections used only the
census sectors with more than 50 inhabitants.
The human local development analysis was carried out at the village and component locality of
small towns (SIRUTA units) level. The analysis took into account only those units with more than
50 inhabitants. Consequently, the study included 11,531 villages22 and 1,008 component localities
within the 253 small towns with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants (Table 1).




20  As of January 2015, the Nomenclature of Territorial-Administrative Units (NIS) reported that there were 13,755 villages (SIRU-
TA units) nationwide grouped in 3,181 administrative units (communes and cities). However, 129 villages Census (114 rural and 15
urban) appear to be non-existent (in other words, have zero inhabitants) and no corresponding data on these villages exists in the
2011 Population and Housing. As the analysis presented in the following sections is based on the 2011 census data, we will refer
only to the 13,626 ‘valid’ SIRUTA units, of which 12,373 are in rural areas, 1,055 are in small urban settlements (those with fewer
than 30,000 inhabitants), and 198 are in urban areas of 30,000 inhabitants or more.
21  Over 26 percent of all villages have only one census sector. The two villages with the maximum number of census sectors
(41) are Valu lui Traian (commune Valu lui Traian, Constanta) and Poienile de Sub Munte (commune Poienile de Sub Munte, Mara-
mures).
22  Other five villages were not included in the analysis due to missing data for indicators that are not included in the 2011 census.

1.3 Audience
The primary audience for this Atlas is the leadership and staff of the Ministry of Labor, Family,
Social Protection and the Elderly (MLFSPE), which is in charge of implementing the National
Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and the corresponding Action
Plan and Flagship Initiatives. The Atlas presents a tool for the geographic targeting, monitoring,
and evaluation of interventions for reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion, with a focus
on the most deprived rural communities in Romania. It analyzes rural marginalization in Romania,
particularly its main characteristics and its spatial distribution at the county level. In addition, it
explores the extent of human development in localities in all rural and small urban administrative
units in order to identify potential „development poles” at the county level.
It is hoped that the methodology, analysis and maps presented in this Atlas will help the MLFSPE
leadership and staff, together with other decision-makers throughout the GoR, to establish an
effective framework for reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion that, ultimately, will
improve the lives of the poor and socially excluded from Romania, including the residents of all
marginalized communities.

                                                                                     INTRODUCTION | 15




1.4 Implementation Plan
This Atlas needs to be followed by a policy response at the national and sub-national levels in order
to become operational. For this reason, the implementation plan included in this Atlas is focused on
consultations, communication, and dissemination activities.
First, it will be critical to share the findings of the Atlas with local authorities throughout the country
and to collect their feedback. This will also be one way to collect information to reflect the likely
changes that may have occurred since the 2011 census data were collected. These consultations
will also serve as a way to inform local authorities of the need to target, monitor, and evaluate all
interventions for reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion that are developed and/or
implemented at the local level.
Second, it is crucial to ensure that the Atlas is seen as a tool that can be used by institutions in many
sectors. To this end, extensive consultations should be organized with all relevant ministries, as
well as the regional bodies that have responsibilities related to European-funded projects. The EU
operational programs now lead development policy in Romania, particularly in the social inclusion
field, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) through the National
Program for Rural Development dictates rural development policy. Consequently, the dialogue on
the Atlas should extend from the MLFSPE to the Ministry of European Funds (MEF), the Ministry
of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), and MARD, with a focus on how the
Atlas (and its indexes) can help sectoral policymakers to prioritize and target investments.
Third, the Atlas can be a vital input into the work of NGOs that develop and implement projects
in social sectors and also students, professors, and researchers in Romania who are helping to
generate new knowledge and ideas on the topic.
Finally, the European Commission has already shared the CLLD methodology developed for the
Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas with other EU countries and would probably be interested in
sharing the tool in this Atlas. Therefore, the Government should consider advertising the existence
of the Atlas to relevant institutions and officials in Brussels.

1.5 Structure of the Atlas
The rest of this document is organized in two parts. The first part consists of the Atlas of Rural
Marginalized Areas in Romania. It starts by defining the marginalized areas and describing the
methodology for identifying these areas in rural Romania. It then describes the steps taken
to validate the marginalized areas that were identified based on the 2011 census, as well as
highlighting the limitations of the approach. The document goes on to present the final typology
of the rural marginalized areas and their key characteristics, and subtypes as determined using
qualitative research techniques and as analyzed using 2011 census data. There follows a discussion
of the relationship between rural marginalization and rural poverty as defined by the EU (the AROP
indicator). Thereafter, Part I discusses the types of interventions that are being used in the European
Union to tackle segregation and to help marginalized communities. The last section presents the
maps of rural marginalization by county as well as tables listing villages with marginalized areas
and the number of residents of these areas to indicate the severity of marginalization in each village.
The second part of the document focuses on the degrees of local human development in rural
and small urban settlements in Romania. After the methodology has been discussed, the effects
of various factors on local human development are analyzed. Following a discussion of the
relationship between rural marginalization and rural local human development, the last section
presents maps illustrating the geographical distribution of villages with different degrees of local
human development across the country, as well as tables listing those villages that have the
potential to be „development poles”.
The annexes include the technical information needed to understand the work presented in this
Atlas in a comprehensive way and to replicate it as well as a list of rural municipalities and their
rates of marginalization.

2. PART I: RURAL MARGINALIZED AREAS
In Romania, the majority of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion live in rural areas.
However, rural poverty manifest itself in many different ways, from the poverty of small villages
and those with aging populations to marginalized communities characterized by low human
capital, low formal employment, and inadequate housing. The first part of this Atlas focuses on
the rural marginalized areas: how they are defined, how they can be identified, what are their key
characteristics, where they are located and what kinds of interventions have been developed in the
European Union for improving the lives of people living in these areas.




2.1 Defining and Assessing Rural
Marginalization in Romania

In Romania, there is no legal definition of “marginalized areas”. Therefore when we were reviewing
the relevant literature for this Atlas, we searched for existing studies and documents that dealt with
“poor communities”, “segregated communities”, and “marginalized communities” in Romania. Our
review showed that extreme poverty23 in Romania has been very well documented by research
studies24 since the 1990s. These studies have confirmed time and again that extreme poverty is not
only an individual or family phenomenon but is also geographical in that it tends to be concentrated
in marginalized areas (both urban and rural) within which extreme poverty is transmitted from a
generation to another.
Our review found that a large majority of studies on marginalization in Romania have focused
on rural areas and have estimated “community poverty” or “community deprivation” at the
administrative unit level (usually, the commune level).25 Only few studies have estimated poverty at
the locality (SIRUTA unit) level, and most of those were case studies based on qualitative research
techniques. Regardless of what research method was used, nearly all of the studies confirmed that
in Romania the main criteria for identifying and analyzing poverty, especially multidimensional
poverty and marginalization, are:

23 Extremely poor families face multiple constraints in addition to monetary poverty, including long-term adult unemployment or
joblessness, poor child nutrition, a high risk of child neglect and/or abuse (associated with parent alcohol abuse), poor parenting
practices, young or single parenthood, unstable marriages, poor health or disability, low school attendance or dropout, poor
or no housing, domestic violence, petty crime, and discrimination. There are also problems of low aspirations, low self-esteem,
and learned helplessness. Therefore, families in extreme poverty represent a particular challenge, not just in terms of skills and
physical capital but also in terms of psychological issues.

•  subsistence

               agriculture);
•  connection
   Housing conditions (especially regarding housing security, the quality of dwellings, and
              to public utilities).
This Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas draws most heavily on the World Bank’s recent work
on urban marginalized areas. Accordingly, this Atlas uses the term “rural marginalized areas”
which by definition are intra-locality compact zones (census sectors) inhabited by people with
disproportionately low human capital, limited formal employment, and inadequate housing
conditions compared with the residents of other rural areas. Using this definition, we devised an
identification methodology based on key indicators capable of reflecting the specific circumstances
of rural areas.


2.1.1 Methodology for Identifying Rural Marginalized
Areas

The methodology that we selected to identify rural marginalized areas is based on data from the
2011 census. Our analyses were done at the census sector level (see section 1.2 above). For each
of the three criteria used to define rural marginalized areas human capital, formal employment, and
housing conditions we selected six key indicators based on our review of literature and scrutiny of
2011 census data for rural population and households. One indicator is related to the human capital
criterion, another one to the employment criterion, and three to the housing quality criterion. The
key indicators for identifying rural marginalized areas are shown in the table below and mirror those
used in the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas.26
By definition, marginalized areas refer to the rural census sectors that are disadvantaged in all three
criteria. In the first step of our analysis, we calculated the value of each of the six key indicators
for each rural census sector. We then set a national rural threshold at the 80th percentile for the
human capital and employment criteria, and at the 90th percentile for the housing criterion.27 Then,
we determined whether the value for each rural census sector was above the threshold for each
indicator. The human capital and employment criteria were measured based on one key indicator
each. So a value higher than the threshold on the corresponding indicator qualified that census
sector as being “disadvantaged” in those criteria. The housing criterion was passed if any of the
three key indicators was higher than its corresponding threshold. Finally, any census sector that
qualified as “disadvantaged” on all three criteria was considered to be a “rural marginalized area”.




26 Swinkels et al (2014a).
27 We experimented with thresholds at 70th, 80th, and 90th percentiles for each of the six key indicators. Our final decision was
based on finding the percentile that resulted in population living in marginalized areas as a proportion of the total rural population
in order to identify communities that are most in need but simultaneously allow for a strong and sustainable public intervention in
these areas.

Overall, in Romania’s communes, 2,244 census sectors28 meet the criteria for being rural
marginalized areas, and more than 564,000 people live in those sectors. These rural areas are
severely deprived census sectors in which most of the population have completed only lower
secondary education at most, make a living in the informal sector (especially agriculture), and live
in housing conditions that are precarious even by the usual low standard in rural areas where most
people live in overcrowded houses and/or have no access to running water or electricity).
28 Out of all 46,547 census sectors in rural areas at the time of the 2011 census. An additional 2,523 census sectors were not
included in the analysis either because they have fewer than 50 inhabitants (2,473) or because they were consisting of buildings
other than residential households.

2.1.2 The Validation Study

The World Bank team carried out an extensive validation study to confirm the marginalized status
of the theoretically identified communites (through quantitative methods applied to the 2011 census
data) and checked for both inclusion and exclusion errors. The fieldwork research was conducted
in May to June 2015 in two counties: Călărași and Vaslui. The sample consisted of 68 communes
that incorporate 232 villages, respectively 1,123 census sectors, of which 82 census sectors are
theoretical rural marginalized areas. Part I. Table 2 presents the sample distribution by county.

Notes: Seven new areas were mentioned by the local informants but they were not able to specify the census sector.
Thus, the total number of areas increased from 1,123 to 1,130.

The field research was based on a mix of qualitative methods. In each selected commune, the team
first paid a visit to the mayoralty to conduct one or more interviews with the mayor, vice-mayor,
secretary, or a social worker from the local Social Assistance Public Service. In the interviews the
team described the study, the methodology that was used to identify rural marginalized areas, and
the theoretical results, and with reference to a map of the commune, asked the respondents their
opinion on the identified marginalized areas (see Part I. Table 3). In the next step, the team visited
the previously identified marginalized areas and organized group discussions on site with local
people, following the guide presented in Annex 4. At the same time the research team made their
own direct observations based on a list of indicators that are highly suggestive of marginalization in
Romania, which is shown in Part I. Table 3. In this way any inclusion errors were identified.
In order to identify any exclusion errors, the team asked the local authorities and local people about
those census sectors that have not been identified marginalized according to the 2011 census data.
If the respondents indicated that a certain additional area ought to be considered marginalized, the
team organized a field visit to that area where they conducted group discussions and made direct
observation. If no new marginalized area was mentioned by the respondents, the research team
randomly selected one or two villages per commune (particularly those located futherst from the
commune center) and visited them to check for any marginalized areas that had not previously
been identified using the 2011 census data.
All of the data collected during the validation study were coded using the fiche shown in Annex
  24 | RURAL MARGINALIZED AREAS




4 and were recorded in a dataset for a quasi-statistical analysis. In addition, the team took
photographs in all marginalized areas to help in the decision-making process. Based on all this
information, the research team using inter-rater comparisons decided which areas to validate as
marginalized and which newly identified marginalized areas to add to the list.

Notes: The seven new areas mentioned by the local respondents that could not be associated with a specific census
sector as they extended over several sectors are included. Thus, the total number of assessed areas is 1,130.

The rate of validation was high for both marginalized and non-marginalized areas and both in
Călărași and Vaslui, regardless whether the area was validated by the team or by local informants
(Part I. Figure 1). At the sample level, 98 percent of the non-marginalized areas were validated by
local informants (authorities or local people), while the research team confirmed all theoretical non-
marginalized areas that they visited. The rate of validated areas was also high for the theoretical
rural marginalized areas, with 89 percent being validated when the local informants did the
assessment and 74 percent when the research team did it.
Nonetheless, both inclusion and exclusion errors were identified. The inclusion errors accounted for
11 percent of all the rural marginalized areas assessed by local informants and 26 percent of the
areas assessed when the assessment is done by the research team. These errors were as follows:

   (a)       Some inclusion errors were the result of the existence of three or four large households
             with five members or more in small census sectors (50 to 80 persons) can lead to the
             sector being inappropriately classified as marginalized.

   (b)       Some inclusion errors occurred in areas mainly inhabited by people aged 50 or older,
             especially women who are not in education and have never been in formal employment
             and who live in old and poorly endowed houses. In most cases these areas are small
             depopulated villages, with many empty ruined houses with little chance of any
             community revival.

    (c)       Other inclusion errors occurred as a result of prejudice against Roma communities.
              Some local informants, especially mayors and vice-mayors, did not validate previously
              identified marginalized areas that had prominent Roma communities given as the
              reason that: “we do not have poor people here [within the commune], we have only lazy
              people (certati cu munca)”.

    (d)       Many inclusion errors were the result of the time lag between the 2011 census data and
              the time of the validation study (2015): The research team encountered two different
              situations in this regard.
              In the first situation, a community “was the poorest in the village in 2011 but are now the
              commune’s richest”29 as a result of a large number of community members migrating
              to the Nordic countries to work and sending remittances home. As of June 2015, these
              villages are flourishing, with numerous large and beautiful houses being newly built.
              The second situation relates to the public investments done in the last years. Thus,
              marginalized communities that in 2011 had been isolated within the commune because
              of distance and the lack of decent road by 2014 had an asphalted road providing
              children with access to education and adults with access to employment or markets.

    (e)       Other inclusion errors were the effect of Law 15/2003 which regulates the awarding
              of landplots30 by local authorities to young people aged between 18 and 35 years
              old to construct houses. These allocations of land plots has led to the growth of new
              neighborhoods on the outskirts of villages,31 of which some appear in the census data
              as being marginalized areas, mainly due to their lack of utilities and small number of
              population. However, the land plots are provided with no housing but with the right to
              build a house on the plot whithin two years. If in the two-year period the house is not
              built and is officially registered with the mayoralty, the land concession is canceled and
              the building plot is reassigned to the next family on the list. Most of these areas have no
              basic infrastructure, with only dirt roads with few or no electricity, water, and sewage
              systems. The infrastructure development process is extremely slow. Local budgets are
              low and required to cover all sorts of emergencies, and the funding necessary for the
              investments in these areas are not available.
    (f)       Some exclusion errors were the result of limited knowledge of the respondents,
              many of whom had no systematic knowledge of all areas in the commune, especially
              regarding the population’s level of education or employment. At best, they knew the
              2011 census results and were able to provide information to the research team only at
              the commune or village level, rather than at a more disaggregated level. Consequently,
              most of them tended to limit their assessment to the existence of infrastructure and/
              or public services, meaning that if an area was close to a road and had access to some
              infrastructure, they simply assumed that it was not marginalized.


Exclusion errors represent 2 percent of all previously identified non-marginalized areas. Out of
all 1,041 rural census sectors originally classified as non-marginalized in the analysis of the 2011
census data, 13 were invalidated by the local respondents. In addition, they mentioned seven
additional marginalized areas that could not be associated with a specific census sector as they
extended over the boundaries of two or three sectors. Thus, a total of 20 marginalized areas were

meters in cities, and 250 to 1,000 square meters in communes and villages. Data on these allocations are available only for urban
areas.

newly identified in the field by the local respondents. However, the research team validated only
seven as being rural marginalized areas. The exclusion errors were due to the following reasons:

   (a)    Some exclusion errors were due to the time lag between the 2011 census data and the
          time of the validation study (2015). Most of the marginalized areas newly identified by
          the local respondents were small or very small communities with only few households
          of young people who cannot afford a house and have settled on the outskirts of the
          village where they started a slum of poor shelters. These emerging communities may
          be the nucleus of a future rural marginalized area if these young families do not receive
          appropriate support at the local level. At the moment most of them are too small to be
          considered a marginalized community.

  (b)     Exclusion errors were the result of prejudice against Roma communities. Some local
          informants tend to equal Roma ethnicity with poverty and therefore automatically
          reacted to the term “marginalized areas” by identifying Roma communities. However,
          in the field the research team found a wide range of Roma communities from very poor
          ones to some that were quite well-off, such as those comprised of Roma musicians
          (lăutari).

   (c)    There were some exclusion errors that resulted from the way in which the 2011 census
          was carried out. In some communes, the local authorities mentioned that some new
          areas had not been properly recorded at the census due to various local circumstances.

  (d)     Some exclusion errors were due to the limited knowledge possessed by interviewees:
          The validation study was based on census sectors that in many cases are “artificial”
          rather than “natural” communities. In many communes, the census sectors have no
          meaning in the day-to-day lives of the local respondents, meaning that they found it
          difficult to visualize them. This was much easier for those communes where the census
          sectors coincided with village boundaries. Some local authorities no longer have the
          local maps created for the 2011 census, and so they made “blind” estimates, particularly
          of area related statistical data on, for example, the total population and the numbers of
          Roma households and dweelings.
          At the same time, because of their limited knowledge of details such as the number of
          single-parent families or of out-of-school children, local authority respondents tended
          to assess whole villages as being poor instead of defining a certain area as being
          marginalized.

The total population of the newly identified marginalized areas (those added by the local
respondents and validated by the World Bank team) represents about 0.6 percent of the total
population living in the previously identified non-marginalized areas. Therefore, the validation study
indicates that 6.2 percent rate of rural marginalization that we calculated using the 2011 census
may actually be higher at somewhere around 7 percent of the total rural population.
In conclusion, the validation study based on qualitative techniques highlighted a series of limitations
in the original approach. Nevertheless, it has also largely confirmed the results of the quantitative
methodology that we applied to the 2011 census data, thus confirming it to be robust and capable of
identifying the “pockets” of rural marginalization at a satisfactory level of accuracy.

2.1.3 The Main Characteristics of the Rural Marginalized
Areas in Romania

This section presents the main characteristics of the rural marginalized areas in Romania as
evidenced by our analysis of the 2011 census.
At the national level, 6.2 percent of the rural population, 5.3 percent of all households, and 5.2
percent of all dwellings are located in rural marginalized areas. By definition, these rural areas
are severely deprived census sectors in which most of the population have completed only lower
secondary education at most, make a living in the informal sector (especially agriculture), and
live in precarious dwellings even by the usual low standard for rural areas (in other words, they
live in overcrowded houses and/or have no access to running water or electricity). Part I. Figure 2
compares the profile of rural marginalized areas with that of non-marginalized areas.
These marginalized areas are considered to be “problematic” specifically because they are
characterized by low-income households, populations with low levels of education and labor
market skills, a preponderance of single mothers, large numbers of children, and a high rate of petty
crime. Children (those between 0 and 17 years old) represent more than one-third (34 percent) of
the total population in rural marginalized areas, while the elderly account for only 13 percent (for
comparison, the average shares for rural non-marginalized areas are 22 percent for children and 19
percent for people aged 65 or older). One in every four households in rural marginalized areas has
five members or more compared with only 15 percent in non-marginalized areas, while 16 percent
of households have three children or more compared with only 5 percent in non-marginalized
areas. The proportion of teenage mothers is more than three times higher in rural marginalized
communities than in non-marginalized ones (4.6 percent of girls aged between 13 and 17 years old
compared with 1.3 percent). Extremely worrying is the fact that children and households with three
or more children from rural areas have a very high risk of living in a marginalized area - 10 percent
and as high as 21 percent respectively - compared to the national rural average of 6.2 percent (see
also Annex 1. Table 2).
As many as 80 percent of the adult residents of the rural marginalized communities have
completed less than eight years of school, of whom 35 percent have only a primary education,
while in the non-marginalized communities the proportions drop to 45 percent and 8 percent
respectively. The percentage of people neither working as employees nor in education or training is
twice as high among youths aged between 15 and 19 years old living in rural marginalized areas as
among youths in non-marginalized ones (51 percent as opposed to 23 percent in non-marginalized
areas). The proportion of people who are neither working as employees nor in education among
the population aged between 20 and 64 years old is almost 64 percent in rural non-marginalized
areas, but this increases to 88 percent in rural marginalized areas, with this indicator being highest
for Roma women living in rural marginalized areas (95 percent) (see also Annex 1. Table 3).
Even more than in the case in other rural communities, marginalized areas have unpaved streets
and bad housing, are exposed to environmental hazards (such as floods and landslides), and have
poor quality or no public services. For example, Annex 1. Table 4 shows that in Romania’s rural areas
the share of people living in dwellings with no piped water supply from the public network increases
from 65 percent of non-Roma living in non-marginalized areas to 75 percent of Roma people from
non-marginalized areas, and reaches a high of 88 percent of non-Roma living in marginalized

areas. Similarly, the share of population living in dwellings not connected to electricity jumps from
0.6 percent of non-Roma in non-marginalized areas to over 10 percent of Roma people living in
marginalized areas.

In 42 percent of the rural marginalized census sectors, high proportions of residents belong to the
Roma ethnic minority. According to the National Survey on Roma conducted by the Research
Institute for Quality of Life in 1998 in the rural areas of Romania out of every 100 individuals
identified by the authorities as being Roma, 64 people self-identify as Roma.32 As self-identified
Roma people represent, on average, 27 percent of all residents of rural marginalized areas,
according to our analysis of the 2011 census data, then this appears to indicate that the true
proportion of the Roma population in these communities is about 42 percent (see also Annex 1.
Table 2).


2.1.4 Living Conditions in Rural Marginalized Areas

The data collected for the validation study provides some additional information on the living
conditions in rural marginalized areas in Romania. For this purpose, we used only the interviews

32 Zamfir and Preda (coord., 2002).
  30 | RURAL MARGINALIZED AREAS




conducted in the 68 validated areas (61 originaly identified areas and the 7 newly identified in the
field). These data showed that:
•     Almost a half of the rural marginalized areas are communities of Roma people, popularly
      called țigănie, rudărie or mahala (slum). The communities of venetici (in-migrants within the
      commune) are very few and can be found only in communes where a former communist
      agricultural enterprise used to operate before 1990.33 The third group of areas comprises
      communities of local people who used to work in a factory in a nearby city. As the factories
      were closed down, they lost their jobs, fell into poverty and have started to work in agriculture.
      These communities are most often named after the village or after a geographical element
      like a valley, a meadow, or a forest. These findings regarding the sub-types of marginalized
      communities confirm the findings of previous qualitative research.34
•     Most marginalized areas are inhabited by stable communities who lived in the same commune
      before 1990. Less than one in every 10 rural marginalized areas is either a community
      established after 1990 or an emerging one.
•     Most of the marginalized communities consist of young families with children who make a
      living from agriculture, informal day labour and social benefits, particularly the child allowance,
      the guaranteed minimum income, and or farmers’ pensions.
•     In almost half of the rural marginalized areas respondents reported the frequent occurrence of
      small thefts, excess noise, quarrels, fights, scandals, domestic violence, and disorder related to
      large numbers of children and a lack of fences between dwellings.
•     Nearly all houses in marginalized areas are made of adobe or are improvised shelters, and
      most of them are in a deteriorated condition and need capital repairs. Respondents in about
      half of the marginalized areas reported having experienced problems related to ownership
      documents for their land or house, and one in every 10 reported that many inhabitants had no
      identity papers.
•     In some areas there is only limited access to potable water, and waste management services
      are very rare. The risk of floods and land-slides seems to be widespread.
•     However, in most rural marginalized areas, the local respondents reported that the main
      community problem by far is the lack of job opportunities. This is the result of the low
      education level of the adult population, children’s low participation in school, income poverty
      and a lack of local infrastructure, particularly roads and water.


2.1.5 Subtypes of Rural Marginalized Communities
Based on Qualitative Research

The validation study has deepened the knowledge of rural marginalized communities by
distinguishing two subtypes, one related to geographic isolation and the second related to the
location of these communities on the outskirts of well-connected villages.


33 The venetici communities were formed by in-migrants who came before 1989 and settled in a village because cities were
near. The state provided them with an apartment in the block areas built in the 1980s or in former state-owned farms or workers’
colonies, and they worked either in the village agricultural enterprise or in a state-owned industrial enterprise in a nearby town.
After 1990, many of them were made redundant. Being in-migrants, they were not granted any reinstated land although they
remained in the village. Accordingly, large numbers of these households fell into poverty.

Rural Marginalization Due to Geographic Isolation
The isolated type of rural marginalized areas was identified among villages in Vaslui county.
It consist of remote villages inhabited by Romanian ethnic groups and that are located “after
four hills”, “down in the valley, on the riverside”, “beyond a forest” from the central village of the
commune. Usually, the only link between these communities and the rest of the area is an earth
or graveled road that during the cold season is impassable. The situation of these communities is
exacerbated by minimal access to potable water.
Low school participation, early school leaving, and school dropout are key challenges in these
isolated communities. The lack of a passable road is often the main reason behind low school
attendance, poor school performances and high dropout rates after the 4th grade for the children
in these communities. Even in those communes that have a school bus, this service cannot access
remote marginalized communities unfavorable weather.
Besides the road that connect the area to other villages, the streets within the marginalized area
itself are often very narrow (ulițe) so that the fire truck and the ambulance cannot reach many
houses. However, the general aspect of these communities tends to be rather bucolic, consisting
of poor but organized households living in low-quality houses painted with lime with clean yards
and simple well-maintained wells. The entire area has an agricultural nature, including sheep, cows
and chickens walking around freely, and vegetables and fruit trees growing in all yards. Horses and
carts are the main means of transportation. Even small children drive the cart, work in the fields, and
take care of animals. In many of these areas, there is no phone signal.

Rural Marginalization on the Outskirts of Well-connected Villages
The study identified this peripheral type of rural marginalized areas mainly in Călărași county.
This type of marginalized area is predominantly located on the outskirts of a village that is well-
connected either to the central village of the commune or to a national or European road.
Local respondents tend to refer to these areas as Roma communities. Most often, the residents
referred to themselves as ”Roma”, ”țigan” or ”rudar”. These areas are more clearly demarcated from
the rest of the village than the isolated marginalized areas which are much better integrated into the
village landscape. Usually, at the entrance to a peripheral marginalized area, an asphalt road stops
abruptly and is replaced by a graveled road. As a rule, most utilities within the village are available
in the main streets of this type of marginalized areas but rarely in people’s homes, either because
the residents are not interested in using that service or utility, or because they cannot afford it or
have been disconnected because they are in debt to the supplier. For example, even in villages with
a local water system, most residents of the marginalized areas fetch water from a public fountain.
Although public services are accessible to people in this kind of marginalized community,
their use of these services is low. Early school leaving and school dropout rates are high even if
a school is only 10 minutes walk away from the community. The main reason given by parents
for their children not attending school is a lack of proper clothes, shoes, or school supplies, with
discrimination being the second reason.
The general aspect of these communities tends to be rather untidy, with many houses having
deteriorated roofs, lacking windows or a door and no fences. Carpets and blankets are hung all
around. Children and adults are in the streets. The vegetable gardens and livestock are rare. Dogs
and pigs are the predominant animals seen walking freely in the community. A lot of garbage is
thrown at the areas’ margins by all villagers, not only by the residents of the marginalized area.
However, because these areas are located in well-connected villages, the population has access
to an informal employment market and can find day labor. Most of them collect and sell scrap iron,
collect pets or are self-employed peddlers. Also, because the road to town is accessible, some of
them work for construction or sanitation companies.

2.1.6 The Ethnical Dimension of Marginalization

As seen in the previous section, the validation study conducted for this Atlas revealed that almost
one half of all marginalized areas in Vaslui and Călărași counties are communities of Roma
people, according to both local authorities and residents of these areas. The remaining areas are
communities of impoverished local people (non-Roma), and very few are communities of venetici
(in-migrants to the commune).
The 2011 census data show that in about one half of all rural territorial units (census sectors,
villages, or communes) in Romania that contain marginalized communities, there is at least one
resident of the respective area who self-identify as Roma. However, Roma communities (defined as
those with 20 percent or more inhabitants who self-identify as Roma) exist in 27 percent of villages,
29 percent of census sectors, and 35 percent of communes with marginalized areas.

Most rural marginalized areas are small communities with no residents who self-declare as
Roma (Part I. Figure 3). Out of all rural marginalized areas in the country, 85 percent are small
communities with between 50 and 375 residents. Out of the 564,000 people living in rural
marginalized areas, 71 percent live in such small communities.
People who self-identify as Roma represent about 27 percent of all residents of rural marginalized
areas. Thus, Roma are highly over-represented among the residents of rural marginalized areas
as this proportion is almost 10 times the national proportion of self-identified Roma in the total
population. However, even in the marginalized areas, Roma tend to be segregated, since nearly
all35 of them live in Roma communities (defined as those with 20 percent or more inhabitants who
have self-identified Roma) that represent only 29 percent of all rural marginalized census sectors.
Furthermore, whereas most rural marginalized areas are small, Roma communities tend to be
larger. On average, Roma rural marginalized communities have 350 residents, whereas non-Roma
communities (with no self-identified as Roma) have about 200 residents.36 Out of the total 151
thousand Roma people living in marginalized areas, 86 percent live Roma communities with more
than 250 inhabitants.37

35 Specifically, 146,000 of the total of 151,000 people self-identified Roma live in Roma communities.
36 Ethnically mixed rural marginalized communities (those with fewer than 20 percent residents who self-identify as Roma)
consist of an average of 250 residents.
37 Specifically, 56 percent live in Roma communities with more than 375 people, while 31 percent live in Roma communities with
more than 500 residents.

as Roma. Ethnically mixed communities are defined as marginalized areas where fewer than 20 percent of residents

as Roma.

In conclusion, the two dominant sub-types of rural marginalized communities seem to be confirmed
in terms of ethnicity and population numbers - small communities of non-Roma population as
opposed to large communities of Roma people.


2.1.7 Geospatial Analysis of Rural Marginalization

This section analysis the geographical dimensionof the typology (isolated versus well-connected
villages).

Regional Level
Rural marginalized communities are spread across 992 communes (35 percent of all communes
in the country), though with significant regional differences (see Annex 1. Table 5). The marginalized
census sectors are located in 1,605 villages (12 percent of all villages) in all counties and regions
of the country (Part I. Map 1). However, the proportion of the population living in rural marginalized
areas (census sectors) is almost twice as high in the North-East as the national rural average (11.3
versus 6.2 percent). The Center region (8 percent) has also a higher than average marginalization
rate. At the other extreme, the West (1.2 percent) and Bucharest-Ilfov (0.6 percent) regions have
very low marginalization rates.
Regarding the subtypes of marginalized areas, Annex 1. Table 6 shows that three regional
patterns exist. In the North-East region, rural marginalization consists mainly of small non-Roma
                                                                RURAL MARGINALIZED AREAS | 35




communities. In the Center region and also in the South-Muntenia, North-West and Bucharest-Ilfov
regions, rural marginalization is strongly associated with larger Roma communities (those were 20
percent or more inhabitants self-identify as Roma). Finally, in the other three regions - South-East,
South-West, and West - rural marginalization is a mix of both non-Roma and Roma communities.

County Level

At the county level, there are also considerable discrepancies. Vaslui has the highest rate of rural
marginalization in the country, almost 23 percent (near four times higher than the national average).
Thus, almost one in every four people in rural Vaslui county lives in a marginalized area. High rates
of rural marginalization (between 9 and 15 percent of the total rural population in each county) have
been recorded in eight other counties, namely Iasi, Covasna, Brasov, Botosani, Galati, Bacau, Sibiu,
and Mehedinti. At the other extreme, Ilfov and Timis have rates of rural marginalization of only about
0.5 percent (see also Annex 1. Table 7).
The rate of rural marginalization for Roma communities is substantial (between 5 and 8 percent of
the total rural population in each county) in Brasov, Covasna, Mures, Ialomita, Sibiu, Salaj, Galati,
and Bihor. At the same time, in some other counties that have low rates of marginalization, (such
as Dambovita, Satu Mare, Prahova, Alba, Arad, Cluj, and Calarasi), most rural marginalized areas
are Roma communities. Conversely, in Vaslui, Botosani, Iasi, and Harghita counties, most rural
marginalized areas are non-Roma communities.

Village (SIRUTA Unit) Level
At the village level, the World Bank background study38 for the National Strategy on Social
Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 has already shown that most Romanian villages
contain between 100 and 2,000 inhabitants. At one extreme, small villages (those with fewer than
500 inhabitants) and especially very small villages (those with fewer than 200 inhabitants) are the
most disadvantaged, particularly those with an elderly population and/or those that are located in
remote areas. At the other extreme, large villages (those with more than 2,000 inhabitants) tend
to be the most developed. Thus, the size of village population is a strong determinant of its general
level of development or potential.
In terms of rural marginalization, we mentioned above that only 1,605 villages in the country have
one or more marginalized areas (census sectors), as shown in Annex 1. Table 8.39 Most of them (62
percent) are medium or large villages. The majority of them (72 percent) has one rural marginalized
area inhabited by a non-Roma community (in 59 percent of villages, no resident of the marginalized
area self-identifies as Roma). As Part I. Figure 4 shows, in very small and small villages there is
usually a small non-Roma community living in one marginalized area, while in medium and large
cities the number of marginalized areas varies between 1 and 9 census sectors where all types of
communities live. Most Roma communities located in marginalized areas live in medium or large
villages. Furthermore, while the population of two-thirds of all villages with marginalized non-Roma
communities is declining, the population of most villages with marginalized Roma communities (72
percent) has grew between 2002 and 2011 (the last two censuses)

39 In these villages, between 2 and 100 percent of the total village population lives in the marginalized areas. In 737 villages, this
proportion is below 40 percent. In 198 villages, 40 to 49 percent of the total population lives in marginalized areas. In 315 villages,
the proportion increases to 50 to 99 percent, and in 355 villages, the entire population lives in the marginalized areas.

Village accessibility, measured by geographic distance40 to the nearest city, is a highly relevant
indicator from the social and economic point of view. Transportation services tend not to exist in
areas where they are unlikely to be profitable because of long distances and poor-quality roads.
Consequently, the remoteness of these communities is exacerbated, the large distance becomes
remoteness especially during rainy seasons when the access roads are often impassible. Few
doctors and teachers who live outside the commune agree to work in remote villages primarily
because of the extreme difficulty involved in getting there. Therefore, geographical isolation comes
together with institutional marginalization. In addition, villagers have little opportunity to reach
urban markets to sell their food products, which deepens the economic weakness of individuals and
community.
Proximity to the nearest city is highly correlated with existence of a railway or a bus station. It
represents a proxy for being located close to the nearest high school and university. It is also
correlated with a high level of development of village infrastructure: the shorter the distance to a
city, the more kilometers of modernized road a village has, the more houses are endowed with
running water, and the more households have a telephone. In addition, the shorter the distance to
the nearest city, the more newspapers subscriptions the village has, the higher the education stock
of its population,41 and the more people it has who can speak a foreign language.42
The distance from villages to the nearest city varies between 0.5 and 82 kilometers (with the
exception of villages with access to water from the Danube Delta), with an average of 21 kilometers
and a standard variation of 11 kilometers. Thus, in Romania, a village can be considered as being
close to city if it is located to less than 10 kilometers from it, while 10 to 32 kilometers represents a
moderate distance, while a village can be considered remote if it is more than 32 kilometers away
from the nearest urban area.
In rural areas, being located far from the nearest city is a strong correlate of marginalization. Only
3.5 percent of the rural population in villages close to a city is marginalized, but this share is more
than three times higher for people living in remote villages (11.3 percent compared to the national
average of 6.2 percent). The share of villages with marginalized areas increases from 9 percent
of villages close to a city to 14 percent of villages at a moderate distance from a city, and almost
20 percent of the villages that are located far from a city. Annex 1. Table 9 shows that, among all
villages with marginalized areas, Roma communities predominate in villages close to a city (0.5 to
10 kilometers) while non-Roma communities are prevalent in isolated villages (those more than 32
kilometers away from the nearest city). In fact, out of all Roma people living in marginalized Roma
communities, fewer than 10 percent live in remote villages.43
Within each commune, some villages are located centrally and some are located on the periphery.44
The share of peripheral villages is about 75 percent in all rural SIRUTA units. Nonetheless, the
proportion of population living in peripheral villages represents only 48 percent of the total rural
population. Central villages are usually where the administrative and institutional resources of
the commune are located, including the mayoralty, post office, health clinic, church, coordinating
school, police, House of Culture and so on. In contrast, in most peripheral villages there are only

43 For comparison, 21 percent of people living in marginalized areas who do not self-identify as Roma (non-Roma) live in remote
villages.
44 Specifically, 88 percent of communes consist of at least two villages, one central and one or more peripheral villages. The other
12 percent of communes comprise only one central village.

two institutions – a church and a school. Furthermore, the public infrastructure is significantly less
developed in peripheral villages, which are usually characterized by dirt roads, a lack of running
water, and a lack of communications.
In rural areas, the location of the village within the commune is another significant correlate of
marginalization. The rate of marginalization is almost two times higher in peripheral villages than
in central ones (8 percent of population compared to 4.5 percent, the national average being 6.2
percent). Similar to the general situation that prevails in rural areas, peripheral villages constitute
the majority of villages with marginalized areas (Annex 1. Table 9). However, unlike in those other
villages, the population of marginalized communities within peripheral villages represent 62
percent of the total population in marginalized rural areas. At the same time, as shown in Annex
1. Table 9 Roma communities predominate in the marginalized areas within central villages,
whereas in peripheral villages, non-Roma communities prevail. In fact, out of all Roma people living
in marginalized areas, Roma communities are evenly distributed among peripheral and central
villages.45 However, the validation study showed that Roma communities are usually located on the
outskirts of the village (whether the village is peripherally or centrally located in the commune).
The geographical terrain of the land also affects rural marginalization. More than 15 percent of the
population of rural villages on the plain is marginalized compared to 3 to 5 percent in other villages
and the national average of 6.2 percent. At the same time, villages located on a plain are more than
three times as likely to contain a marginalized area as mountain and hilly-mountain villages. The
share of villages with one or more marginalized areas is 7 to 8 percent among mountain and hilly-
mountain villages, 11 percent among hilly-plain villages, and over 29 percent among villages on
the plain. It is noteworthy that Roma communities are much more numerous in rural marginalized
areas in mountain and hilly-mountain villages, while non-Roma communities predominate in
marginalized areas in hilly-plain and plain villages (see Annex 1. Table 9).
In conclusion, Roma people living in marginalized areas tend to be concentrated in larger
Roma communities46 (with an average of 350 residents) located in medium and large villages,
either centrally or peripherally located, on non-plain land, either in the vicinity of or at moderate
distance from a city (between 0.5 and 20 kilometers). By contrast, rural marginalized non-Roma
communities47 are more likely to be small (on average 200 residents) and situated in small or
medium villages peripherally located on a plain and far from any city. These two distinct types
of rural marginalized areas overlap to a large extent with the subtypes of communities that we
identified using qualitative techniques during the validation study that were described in section
2.1.5.

Commune (Territorial-Administrative Unit) Level
In terms of rural marginalization, we have already mentioned that 992 communes in the country
have one or more marginalized areas (census sectors). In these communes, between 1 and 100
percent of the total commune population lives in the marginalized areas. In 160 communes
(representing 5.6 percent of the total number of communes in the country),48 more than one-third of

45 For comparison, out of all people living in marginalized areas who do not self-identify as Roma (non-Roma) 64 percent live in
peripheral villages and 36 percent live in central villages.
46 Areas where more than 20 percent of residents self-identify as Roma.
47 Areas with no residents who self-identify as Roma.
48 The four communes with the highest shares of marginalized populations (more than 80 percent of total commune population)
are: Bărbulești (Ialomița county), Lipovu (Dolj county), Ibănești (Vaslui county), and Voinești (Vaslui county).

the populations live in marginalized communities.49
In the rural Romania, marginalized communities have emerged mainly in the medium-large and
more developed communes.50 Small communes51 with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants account
for 26 percent of all rural territorial-administrative units in the country and for 19 percent of all
communes with marginalized areas (see Annex 1. Table 10). These communes are almost equally
distributed between those with one and those with two or more marginalized areas, which are most
often ethnically mixed, especially in large communes with over 5,000 inhabitants.52 Only in small
communes is there usually only one marginalized area that is inhabited by a non-Roma community
(see also Part I. Figure 5 and Annex 1. Table 11).

Ethnically mixed communities are defined as communes with one marginalized area inhabited by an ethnically
mixed community (where fewer than 20 percent of residents self-identify as Roma) or with two or more marginalized

At the village level, being located far from the nearest city is strongly correlated with
marginalization. For communes, which are clusters of villages, this correlation is much attenuated

(Annex 1. Table 11). Actually there is no association between the urban connectivity53 of a commune
and the likelihood that it contains marginalized areas.54 The only significant finding is the fact that
communes in which all marginalized areas are inhabited by Roma communities are more likely to
have high urban connectivity than other marginalized communes. A better indicator is the existence
within the commune of one or more remote villages (those located at more than 32 kilimeters from
the nearest city). These communes are heavily overrepresented among those with marginalized
areas.55 At the same time, those communes in which all marginalized areas are inhabited by Roma
communities are likely to contain no remote villages.
Being located close to the county boundary is also slightly associated with marginalization
for communes. Not only do slightly more communes located close to county boundaries have
marginalized areas than other communes, but also more of them are located more than 50 minutes
away trip from the county capital city.56 Marginalized areas in communes located near the county
boundary are most likely to be ethnically mixed (Annex 1. Table 11).

Partnerships between localities
European Union financing is key for financing projects in Romania’s marginalized areas (in
small infrastructure, employment, education, health, and other social areas), especially as rural
municipalities generally have insufficient local budgets.

For the period 2014 to 2020, both rural and small urban municipalities have greater access to

(LAG) or a Fisheries Local Action Group (FLAG). For this reason, it is relevant to distinguish between




53 See more details on urban connectivity in section 3.1.3.
54 Both communes with low urban connectivity (remote communes) and those with high urban connectivity are slightly
underrepresented among communes with marginalized areas. Furthermore, the share of communes with marginalized areas is
about 30 to 31 percent both for communes with low urban connectivity and those with high connectivity compared with 39 percent
for communes with medium connectivity and 35 percent for all communes in the country.
55 Sixty percent of all communes with marginalized areas have one or more remote villages (those that are more than 32
kilometers from the nearest city) compared with 51 percent of all communes in the country. In addition, the share of communes
with marginalized areas is 40 percent of all communes including remote villages compared with only 29 percent of communes
without such villages.
56 On the one hand, almost one half (48 percent) of all communes with marginalized areas are located near the county boundary
compared with 45 percent of all communes in the country. On the other hand, among communes located near county boundaries,
35 percent are communes with marginalized areas that are less than 50 minutes away from the county capital city (equal to
the national average), but about 40 percent are communes with marginalized areas that are more than 50 minutes away from
the county capital city. Overall, communes with marginalized areas constitute 37 percent of all communes located near county
boundaries.

municipalities that are part of a LAG/FLAG and those that are not.57
The World Bank background study58 for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty
Reduction 2015-2020 has already shown that communes with the smallest self-generated
revenues in their local budget and more extended poverty have a higher propensity to be members
in LAGs/FLAGs.59 Also, a high proportion of the communes with marginalized areas (72 percent) are
members of a LAG/FLAG (Part I. Table 5). Thus, three of every four communes with marginalized
areas have the opportunity to apply to the European funds for financing to develop and implement
projects targeted to their marginalized communities. Annex 1. Table 12 shows that these communes
include all types of marginalized communities Roma, non-Roma, and ethnically mixed.


2.1.8 Rural Marginalization and Rural Poverty

As mentioned above, the maps of rural marginalization presented in this Atlas are complementary
to the “poverty maps” that were produced by the World Bank and the European Commission in
2014.60 Marginalization defined as cumulated disadvantages in terms of human capital, formal
employment, and housing conditions is highly correlated with poverty. Actually, marginalized areas
are intra-locality “pockets” of destitution which means that marginalization is linked to “extreme”
“unacceptable” poverty. Thus, there can be expected to be significant overlaps between the maps
of rural marginalization and those of rural poverty. However, the relation is not direct because of
differences in the geographical level at which the analysis is conducted and the methodology that is
applied.61 We explored marginalization at census sector (small area) level, while the poverty maps
were estimated at the commune level. Consequently, it is possible to have a “rich” commune that
contains a marginalized community. At the same time, it is possible to have a “poor” commune with
no marginalized community because the inhabitants, although income poor, have not accumulated
disadvantages in human capital, formal employment, and housing conditions. Therefore, in order
to design effective interventions in marginalized areas, it is very relevant to explore the type of
communes in which marginalized communities have developed.

58 Teșliuc et al (2015).
59 By contrast, small communes (those with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants) and remote communes (those with low urban
connectivity) face difficulties in taking part in local partnerships. The rate of participation in a LAG/FLAG is 54 percent among the
small and remote communes compared to 63 percent among of the small non-remote communes, 69 percent among remote
communes with more than 2,000 inhabitants, and 62 percent among the other communes.

61 The poverty maps combine information from the 2011 population census and the EU‐SILC household survey to estimate
household disposable income levels for each household in the census. This information was then used to estimate the number
and proportion of people in each region or county whose consumption was below the risk of poverty line, using the standard EU
threshold of 60 percent of median national income (AROP indicator).

poor in terms of the share of their population that is at risk of relative poverty. Only 5 percent of all
communes with marginalized areas are developed. On the other hand, the share of communes with
marginalized areas increases incrementally from 8 percent of developed communes to 31 percent
of medium-developed communes (close to the national average of 35 percent), and to a high of 72
percent of poor communes. Thus, the likelihood of containing a marginalized area is almost 10 times
higher in poor communes as in developed ones.
Only Roma marginalized communities are considerably more likely to be located in developed
communes (with low poverty rates), as shown in Part I. Figure 6 and Annex 1. Table 13. In the poor
communes there is usually more than one marginalized community that can be either Roma or non-
Roma. By contrast, in the medium-developed communes, there is usually only one marginalized
community, which can be either non-Roma or Roma.



2.2 Tackling Segregation and Marginalized
  Communities in the European Union
This section focuses on the most appropriate types of interventions that have been developed to
tackle segregation and marginalization across the European Union and in Romania. The first
section discusses the main policy options that have been promoted in the European member states.
The second section presents the multi-sectoral integrated area-based approach that is the most
appropriate for ensuring the integration of marginalized communities and discusses lessons learned
from previous interventions that have been piloted by various local authorities or NGOs in Romania.


2.2.1 Fighting segregation in The European Union

Segregation is again at the top of the European agenda as it affects almost all European areas,
whether prosperous and growing or shrinking. Residential segregation relates to how people are
separated in terms of where they live, but segregation can also occur in terms of schools, jobs,
or public services and can affect people in all social and demographic dimensions, including
age, ethnicity, religion, income, or social class (the rich in one place, the poor in another) or in
combination. Segregation is closely related to concentration, which implies that there is a statistical
over-representation of one group and an under-representation of one or more other groups in
a certain space. It is also related to the fragmentation of space into areas with visible differences.
“If these fragments become inaccessible, then we encounter segregation into ghettoes, gated
communities, and other manifestations of hyper-segregation. The most extreme examples of
segregation might take the form of polarization, in which different parts of the city fight against each
other.” 62
Segregation can be a deliberate choice, such as when better-off groups choose to self-segregate
into gentrified areas or gated communities, or can be a separation forced on people by outside
factors, such as when marginalized populations are concentrated in poor areas. A ghetto is the most

extreme form of forced segregation.
The most common type of segregation in Romania is related to economic and financial inequalities.
This aspect has received little attention in the segregation literature compared with the racial-
ethnic dimension. The factors that have led to Romania’s segregation issues include the structural
changes involved in the country’s transition to a market economy, unemployment, growing
economic precariousness, and weaker welfare systems as well as the housing and urban planning
policies promoted during the communist period and the first post-communist decade.
Typically, the policies that are in place at the EU level and at the national and local levels in Romania
encourage area-based interventions in areas that policymakers consider to be “problematic.” Area-
based interventions are usually divided into “hard” and “soft” measures63 as follows:

•  demolished
   Hard interventions often consist of physical restructuring programs in which buildings are
              and new infrastructure and housing developments are built or the housing stock is
      refurbished, new public facilities are created (such as social or cultural facilities and parks), and
      public transport is improved.
•     Soft interventions strengthen networks and interactions between people in the area (for
      example, through work integration and training programs in specific areas, field work to find
      solutions for the immediate problems of the homeless or other types of people in extreme
      situations, and local festivals where the community can gather) and help individuals to access
      the labor market through training, work experience, and job placement.
However, these initiatives often do not address the driving forces behind segregation such as the
deregulation of housing markets or the shrinking welfare state. Instead, urban neighborhood
regeneration projects tend to focus on buildings and infrastructure rather than people and do
not challenge the rising land values and house prices that force the relocation of less affluent
inhabitants. Regeneration projects, at least in theory, have yet to find a balance between social
inclusion and economic competitiveness and need to be supported by a broad range of public
and private actors (public agencies, landlords, residents, and businesses) to be effective. While
politicians often favor quick and visible interventions that have immediate visible results,
neighborhood change takes time and often softer, incremental measures would be more effective
in the long term. Also, at least in Romania, many marginalized communities and deprived
neighborhoods have a bad reputation with the general population, so local administrators and
politicians who attempt to regenerate them can often lose political support.
Both area-based (spatial) and people-based (sectoral) interventions are crucial for fighting
segregation in marginalized areas. The relevant policies and programs should be coordinated
among all levels of governance (vertical policy integration) and across sectors (horizontal policy
integration):

•  to
   Vertical policy integration can be initiated in many ways. One way is for national policymakers
      make strong national policies, selecting the areas of intervention and requiring the
      cooperation of the regional and local authorities. This model prevails in England, France,
      the Netherlands, and Sweden. In other countries, such as Hungary and Spain, the rules and
      conditions for deprived areas are selected at the national or regional level, but local authorities
      decide which areas are in need of these interventions.

•  development
   Horizontal policy integration means coordinating all policies that are relevant for the
                of an area. Other than physical interventions, key sectoral policy areas are
     housing, public transport, education, employment, culture, and the provision of social services.
     Horizontal policy integration requires adapting existing services and organizations to the
     specific needs of the area and increasing coordination between the different service providers.
At the European level, the segregation and integration of marginalized or deprived neighborhoods
has so far mainly been discussed, analyzed, and acted on in relation to urban areas and in the
context of urban regeneration and development policies. However, in Romania a large share of the
population lives in rural areas. Out of the 3,181 administrative units within the country, only 320
are urban settlements, while 2,861 are rural communes. Segregated and marginalized communities
are emerging, especially in urban areas, consisting of concentrations of people who have fallen
into extreme poverty as a result of the structural changes associated with Romania’s transition to
a market economy that resulted in unemployment, growing precariousness, and weaker welfare
systems. Nevertheless, the current Atlas shows that marginalized communities can also be found
in rural areas, although to a lesser extent than in cities.


2.2.2 Adopting an Integrated, Cross-sectoral,
Area-based Approach to Rural Marginalized Areas
in Romania

Integrated, cross-sectoral regeneration projects that balance social inclusion with economic
competitiveness are the best way to reduce geographically concentrated poverty in marginalized
urban areas, in Roma communities, and in certain remote rural areas. These interventions need to
be supported by a broad range of public and private players (public agencies, landlords, residents,
and businesses) in order to be effective. Policies against segregation can relate to a particular
geographical area (area-based interventions) or to specific policy sectors (people-based policies).
“Problematic” areas need high-quality, accessible services – affordable housing, education,
employment, childcare, healthcare services, and public transport – in order to achieve levels of
integration on a par with other areas. To this end, policymakers should consider adopting sectoral or
people-based policies that are tailored to improving the circumstances of individuals or households
with low incomes and specific needs in these “problematic” areas.
These policies might include:

•  Specific  efforts to provide public services in “problematic” areas.
•  and to achieve
   Education    and school policies that aim to improve the quality of education across the board
                    an ethnic and socioeconomic mix of students in all schools.
•  training opportunities. to increase employment, support business start-ups, and enhance
   Economic     interventions


•  Planning   regulations that prevent the development of gated communities.
•  by
   A mobility policy that guarantees equal opportunity of access to job centers and major facilities
       public transport from all parts of the city.
Area-based and people-based interventions must be integrated in a framework of participative
community development in order to fight segregation effectively. For the 2014 to 2020
                                                                RURAL MARGINALIZED AREAS | 47




programming period, LEADER and the EMFF will provide Romania with community-led local
development funds for rural areas and very small cities, and the ERDF and the ESF will provide
funds for urban areas. This support will increase the total budget available for local development
and will enable local authorities to consider a broader range of interventions for marginalized
areas. Nonetheless, programs that are financed from several different sources are complex to
design and implement, while the relevant local partners need to have already established working
relationships with each other. The European Commission has warned that it “could prove difficult
to implement for groups experimenting with local development for the first time. It will therefore be
crucial to analyze the capacity of LAGs (local action groups) and to choose an appropriate division
of tasks between the LAGs and the authorities responsible for the design and implementation of the
program... Solid preparation and capacity-building actions should be organized to enhance their
administrative capacity.”64
Local and central capacity to develop and implement integrated projects is vital for improving the
living conditions of Roma and of marginalized communities. To date, Romanian policymakers
have had no incentives to tackle marginalized and segregated areas, and the general provisions
associated with EU funding have offered very limited opportunities to do so. Also, there has been
no attempt to take an integrated approach to the design of interventions. Although several different
approaches to reducing the segregation of disadvantaged communities have been tried in Romania,
no comprehensive review has been done of the success or failure of these approaches. As a result,
there is little information on how the few integration policies and programs in Romania have actually
performed in the field, on what practices seem particularly successful and why, and on what ways
exist to circumvent the often overly rigid government systems in order to ensure that integration
programs are delivered responsively and effectively.


PART I. BOX 1

 Lessons Learned From Previous Integration Interventions in Romania

 Various lessons have emerged from previous integration interventions that have been
 implemented in Romania.
 1. There is a need for a national legislative framework to govern policies related to marginalized
 communities. This framework should provide regulations related to:

 •  A national housing policy (which has yet to be developed).
 •  The enforcement
    Regulations  related to properties in slum areas.
 •  to local people forofconstruction
                          Law 15/2003 (according to which mayoralties may lease public land
                                      purposes with proposals selected on the basis of a set of
       criteria).
 •     Investment in buildings owned partly by the municipality and partly by the residents.
 •     Changes in the fiscal rules for calculating the interest and penalties for unpaid taxes owed
       to state or local budgets by social tenants.
 •     The settlement of historical debts related to social housing services.

 2. Interventions in marginalized areas should be integrated in order to combine investment projects
 in housing and infrastructure with projects related to employment, the education of children and
 adults, sanitation services, parental education courses, family planning, the provision of hot meals
 for children, life skills development (for teenagers), the fight against discrimination, community
 empowerment, and other social, medical, or cultural activities. A national scheme of vocational
 training needs to be developed for adults who have little or no formal education (eight grades of
 schooling at most) and who live in marginalized areas.
 3. Policymakers must search for innovative solutions to the problems of marginalized areas that
 are affordable for the poor but that also aim to raise family incomes within the community. Only in
 this way can an intervention be sustainable and the quality of life enhanced.
 4. In order to make the community accountable, the intervention must have clear, predictable,
 and transparent rules and procedures that are publicly debated, agreed on by all stakeholders,
 and put into action.
 5. Interventions in marginalized areas need to be medium-term or long-term, with a preparatory
 phase of one to two years during which both the local authority and the marginalized community
 learn to communicate, build an equal partnership, and create a participatory environment with a
 well-defined, predictable, and transparent set of rules.
 6. Interventions in marginalized areas should include components targeted to neighboring
 non-marginalized areas to foster social integration and increase the odds of the project being
 acceptable to all citizens.
 7. Interventions in rural areas should be designed to take into account differences in:

 •  strong
    Leadership (communities with strong informal leaders as opposed to communities with no
           leaders).
 •  The  history of the area (old traditional neighborhoods as opposed to new neighborhoods).
 8. Interventions targeted to children are likely to have positive spillovers at the community level
 and thus to increase support from residents who do not benefit directly from the project.

The absence of consultation between central policymakers and local communities can limit the
relevance and sustainability of policies and initiatives aimed at increasing the social inclusion of
Roma and marginalized communities by failing to take account of local needs and opportunities.
Moreover, the discriminatory attitudes of some officials toward Roma can deter them from
participating in the design and implementation of inclusion programs.
Therefore, local communities should be involved in the design and delivery of interventions.
To support this, local authorities could offer training to community members in areas such as
participatory decision-making, accounting, and basic financial literacy. In addition, involving local
populations in efforts to upgrade local infrastructure could increase their sense of ownership,
while providing them with opportunities to work and develop skills. It is important to ensure that
these improvements to local infrastructure and housing will not lead to increased concentration or
further physical isolation and segregation of marginalized groups. This non-segregation principle is
reflected in Article 7 of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Regulation, which was
amended in May 2010 to encourage the use of ERDF funds for housing interventions as long as
these interventions promote integration and prevent the isolation and exclusion of marginalized
communities.

Having well-coordinated institutional mechanisms is a prerequisite for developing effective policies,
implementing priority interventions, and reducing service delivery gaps. We recommend that the
government of Romania clarify the responsibilities of the various institutions involved in the effort
to reduce geographically concentrated poverty. This can be done through both legislation and the
establishment of cooperative working arrangements at the local level. The government should
enact a framework law that sets out the functional relationships between various bodies as well
as their budgetary sources. It should also support the building of capacity at the local authority
level, which will be essential to make the most effective use of EU funds. Policymakers should also
formulate a methodology for gathering stakeholder feedback, encouraging local participation in the
design and operation of interventions, and developing partnerships with Roma and marginalized
communities. Finally, simplifying the procedures for local communities to apply for EU funds is
likely to increase demand and foster local initiatives.

3. PART II: LOCAL HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
IN RURAL AND SMALL URBAN ROMANIA

3.1 Defining and Assessing Local Human
Development in Romania

This section explores the diversity of Romanian small settlements – both rural and small urban
(those with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants) - from the point of view of local human development.
We measured the human development of a village or of a town sublocality (or SIRUTA unit) in terms
of its stock of community capital65 as represented by education, employment, housing, the size of
the working age population, and the mobility experience of its population. This is a comprehensive
take on human development similar to the approach taken in the UNDP’s Human Development
Index,66 the multiple deprivation index in the UK,67 and some Romanian applications at the census
sector68 and village levels.69


3.1.1 Methodology of Local Human Development in
Rural and Small Urban Settlements

The World Bank constructed a local human development index (LHDI) that made it possible to
compare all of the sublocalities (SIRUTA units) from all communes and all towns with fewer than
30,000 inhabitants (Part II. Figure 1). The villages and sublocalities from towns with less than 50
inhabitants were not included in the computation algorithm for the LHDI.70
Three out of the six indicators that we used to build the LHDI – education, employment and housing
– are frequently used to measure development, poverty, or deprivation71 in small territorial units.
They have previously been used to compute LHDI measures in Romania at the commune and city
levels72 and were tested for validity.

66 UNDP (2013).
67 McLennan et al (2011).
68 Swinkels et al (2014a).
69 Sandu (2005).
70 SIRUTA units smaller than 50 inhabitants could not be included in our computations because of the high instability of measures
related to such small territorial units.
71 The algorithms used in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in the United Kingdom in 2007 and 2010 used seven domains
related to employment, income, education, housing, health, crime, and environment. The 38 indicators that defined the seven do-
mains were selected to meet a set of criteria: ”domain specific and appropriate for the purpose (as direct as possible measures of
that form of deprivation), measuring major features of that deprivation (not conditions just experienced by a very small number of
people or areas), up-to-date, capable of being updated on a regular basis, statistically robust at the small area level and available
for the whole of England at a small area level in a consistent form” (McLennan et al, 2014: 14). When we constructed our procedure
for the LHDI, we also used factor analysis as an aggregation method as in the IMD.
72 Ionescu-Heroiu et al (2014).

PART II. FIGURE 1: Dimensions and Indicators for Measuring the Local Human Development of
Small Settlements (villages of more than 50 inhabitants and component localities for towns with
less than 30,000 inhabitants)




Why adding to index measures working age share of the local population, mobility experience of
the population and a measure of development at basic administrative unit including the settlement
(commune or small town)? A high percentage of working age population is a precondition for
higher education and employment capital in Romania.73 Also, previous research has proved that
mobility experience of a community (meaning commuting, return migration, and immigration)
is a significant predictor of LHDI in communes and cities in Romania.74 In particular, remittances
entering community and the network capital of former and current migrants are key variables that
favor local development. The reason for including a measure of commune or town development in
the evaluation of development for villages or sublocalities is twofold. On the one hand, communes
and towns are the immediate environments that influence the quality of life in their different
sublocalities. The better that environment is, the greater the chances of the sublocalities having
access to good services and local institutions. The second reason is that the LHDI for communes

73 Computations for the LHDI in small communities, as indicated in Part II. Figure 1, support this assertion.
74 Ionescu-Heroiu et al (2014: 405).
   156 | THE ATLAS OF LOCAL HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN ROMANIA




includes information that cannot be measured at the village level in the Romanian statistical
system, such as life expectancy at birth.
We did not include public services (such as schools, health institutions, and public transportation)
in our measurement of the LHDI. While these are important factors in defining local well-being
or poverty, unfortunately data on the existence of public services and on access to them are not
available at such a disaggregated level.


PART II. BOX 1

  Local Human Development Index (LHDI)

  The LHDI was computed using a factor analysis of six variables (three of which were factor
  scores and three of which were single indicators). The index represents a modification of the
  algorithm used in the early versions of the background study for the National Strategy on Social
  Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020. Changes were made in the following respects
  (Teșliuc et al., 2015):

  •  and
     The current algorithm of the index includes all villages that have more than 49 inhabitants
         all sublocalities of towns with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants, while in the initial version
         the index referred to villages of over 100 inhabitants and sublocalities of towns with fewer
         than 20,000 inhabitants.
  •      There are six dimensions in the new version compared to five in the previous one.
  •      Employment is measured by a single indicator here, compared to a factor score with a KMO
         value of less than 0.50 in the previous version.
  The LHDI as a factor score was transformed by a Hull score as to have a variation between
  about 0 (low development) to about 100 (high development). The criterion of validity for the new
  measure is consistently higher than for the previous one.


There are about 12,300 rural villages75 within 2,861 rural communes in which about 9.3 million
people are living. The main reason for focusing on villages is that, despite their diversity (Part II.
Table 1) they are the most “natural” units of community in rural Romania.

75 The term ”village” will be used in this section to refer to villages within rural communes. There are also some villages that are
component localities in cities but their situation is different. Some of them still have the characteristics of a traditional village, but
others have simply retained the designation.

Small settlements differ not only by their levels of development but also by their types
of development. A village is comprehensively developed if it has high stocks of all five
dimensions of community capital (education, housing, employment, working age, and
mobility experience) in the national context. Villages can be considered to have upper-
middle development in two ways: (i) structural as related mainly to education, working age
population, and housing or (ii) mainly based on the mobility experience of the population.76


PART II. TABLE 2: Romania’s Small Settlements by Levels and Types of Developmen




Source: World Bank calculations using data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census.
Note: Only 10 percent of the rural population lives in villages with a higher level of development compared to 40
percent of the total population of small towns. This lower level of development means that poverty is higher in
villages than in small cities.

As one can see from Part II. Table 2, the seven categories in the typography of local development
are strongly differentiated in terms of their average levels of development. The fact that localities
are differentiated not only by their level of development but also by their type of development is an
indication of their high degree of structuring. As such or regrouped in five categories, they could be a
basis for designing development policies at the territorial level.


3.1.2 Large Cities and Urban Connectivity in Local
Human Development

The local human development of small settlements of Romania is highly dependent on their
location (for example, in the regional urban system, in historical and geographic regions, or
within a communication system etc.) and their internal characteristics (such as the population
composition, the cultural type of the locality, the demographic size of the locality, or the
territorial form of settlement). The location of a village or small urban settlement within an urban

76 The construction of the typology was guided by a series of hypotheses specifying the profile for seven classes on all the six
indicators of local human development – education, employment, working age, housing, mobility experience, and development
level of commune or town. They state that in rural areas one can expect to find cumulative versus segmented or specialized de-
velopment/ poverty and, to record a difference between working-age and housing poverty and also differences between structural
development and development based on mobility experience. The tool that we used to construct the typology was a k-means clus-
ter analysis in SPSS with predetermined clusters.
   158 | THE ATLAS OF LOCAL HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN ROMANIA




regional space seems to be fundamentally associated with local human development (see
Annex 3. Table 1). This is consistent with the theory of distance, density, and division,77
 according to which the most important factors influencing local human development is not
the proximity of the village to a large city with high economic density (those with more than
200,000 inhabitants) but also the connectivity of the commune or small town including reference
settlements and, the development level of the large city itself.


PART II. MAP 1: The Analytical Map of Convergence Areas towards Large Cities

The nine urban regions of great cities are shown, in the map below (Part II. Map 1). In reality, the
borders are not as precise as shown by the map which was constructed using Euclidean distances.
A reference locality is considered to be part of the urban region of the largest city of 200,000
inhabitants, function of its minimal distance of location versus the large nine cities. The new urban
analytical regions overlap to a large degree with parts or subparts of historical and development
regions. For example, the Iași and Craiova urban regions are very close to the configurations of
North-East and South-West development regions and large parts of the Moldova and Oltenia
historical regions. Also, Galați and Constanța are close to the configuration of South-East
development region.
As expected, the most developed small localities are in the two Transylvanian urban regions
of Timișoara and Brașov (where average LHDI is equal to 66). For localities with high urban

connectivity, the effect of being a historical region is no longer a factor. Small settlements from the
Constanța and Ploiești areas (from the Old Kingdom historical regions) have an average level of
development that is equal to those in Brașov and Cluj, which are in the Transylvanian region. This
finding shows that the high local development level in Transylvania is not due to effect of being a
historical region but is a direct consequence of higher urban connectivity in Transylvania.


PART II. TABLE 3: Local Human Development Index for Small Settlements by Urban Region and
Urban Connectivity

Urban connectivity tends to increase local human development in small settlements, except in
Iași and Ploiești urban regions where LHDI is lower for medium urban connectivity than for low
connectivity.
One aspect of urban connectedness is the proximity of the locality to a European road which
is well-maintained road that leads to large cities, whether in Romania within or abroad. The data
presented in this Atlas show clearly that small settlements that are close to European roads tend to
be characterized by comprehensive development and upper-middle levels of development.
As showed in the table below, the best place to live from the point of view of human development is
in a town in the Bucharest urban region that is located close to a European road. These towns have
an average LHDI that is eight points higher than that of towns in the same region that are located far
from a European road.

PART II. TABLE 4: Local Human Development Index by Urban region, Proximity to European
Roads and Type of Residency

The impact of proximity to a European road is consistently higher in rural areas than in urban areas
(nine points on the scale of local development for villages and only four points in the case of small
towns). The policy implication is clear: in Romania good roads seem to contribute to promoting
development much more in villages than in towns.
Types of local human development differ not only among localities but also among counties (see
Annex 3. Table 2):

•  development
   The counties where the largest shares of the population live in localities with comprehensive
                are Ilfov, Timiș, Brașov, Sibiu, Cluj and Arad. All of these are counties that are in
     or are in immediate proximity to large urban centers.
•    At the other extreme, the lowest development levels can be found in Vaslui, Botoșani and
     Mehedinți counties with a low degree of urbanization that are not close to a large city. The
     same counties also have the most housing poverty.

3.1.3 Local Human Development Between Density
Centers and Distance-Division Peripheries

Local human development in small settlements is not only affected by their proximity and
connectivity to large towns, but is also influenced by proximity to administrative centers, population
composition and population modernity. The simplified causal matrix in Annex 3. Table 1 clearly
indicates that local development is higher in central villages within communes and in settlements
that are not at the periphery of the county. This pattern is evident in each urban region (Part II.
Table 5). In the Timișoara urban region, for example, villages that are commune centers and are not
located at the periphery of the county are much more developed (with an LHDI score of 70), than
villages that are peripheral within the commune and the county (with an LHDI score of 54).


PART II. TABLE 5: Local Human Development of the Villages by Urban Region and Centrality of
Location




Source: World Bank calculations using data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census.

The nine large urban centers in Romania vary widely in terms of their impact on village
development. Timisoara, Cluj and Brașov have the most positive effect on village development (Part
II. Figure 2), whereas Galați and Iași are at the other extreme, with a predominantly negative effect
on rural development.
The ethnic composition of the population also affects local development. Settlements with larger
shares of Roma tends to be poorer and those with more Germans and Hungarians tend to be richer.
The modernity of the population is both a cause and effect of local development. It tends to be
higher in more developed localities, irrespective of their size and residential type.78




78 This statement is based on a regression analysis that is not showed here and that had the general fertility rate as a dependent
variable. Lower fertility has a significant positive effect in terms of increasing individual modernity.

Notes: The figures indicate the values of regression coefficients. The control variables were population size, ethnic
composition, and distance to different categories of cities.

The analysis reveals that small settlements tend to have a development dynamics that goes
between the effects of urban and administrative centers, on the one hand, and divisions associated
with distance, administration and communication, on the other hand.


3.1.4 Marginalization and Local Human Development
in Rural Romania

As shown in section 2.1.8, rural marginalization is highly correlated with rural poverty at the
commune level. Nonetheless, most marginalized areas are in medium-developed communes
rather than in the poor ones. In this section, we analyze the relation between rural marginalization
and local human development at the village level using the levels and types of local human
development (as estimated based on LHDI) shown in Part II. Table 2.
The next table (Part II. Table 6) shows that marginalized areas are spread across all villages
with all different levels of local human development. However, 65 percent of all villages with
marginalized areas are underdeveloped, having either the lowest development or the lowest
housing development.79 Only 7 percent of villages with marginalized areas have a medium-
high level of LHDI. On the other hand, the share of villages with marginalized areas decreases
sharply from 39 percent of the lowest developed villages to 26 percent of those with low housing
development, 14 percent of the medium developed villages, and only 1 percent of those with
mobility or comprehensive development. So rural marginalization is highly associated with low
local human development (LHDI). It is noteworthy that, in villages with high mobility capital, there is
little opportunity for marginalized areas to form.



79 This is partly the result of the common indicators used to estimate rural marginalization and LHDI.

Notes: On levels and types of LHDI see Part II. Table 2. Marginalized communities exist in 1,605 villages, but in 40
cases data on LHDI are missing. The cells marked in color indicate the dominant patterns.

Roma marginalized communities are considerably more likely to be located in medium or medium-
high developed villages than in villages with low levels of development, as shown in Part II. Figure
3 and Annex 3. Table 3. In the low developed villages, non-Roma marginalized communities
predominate.

Notes: Roma communities are defined as rural marginalized areas where more than 20 percent of residents who
self-identify as Roma. Ethnically mixed communities are defined as rural marginalized areas where fewer than 20
percent of residents self-identify as Roma. Non-Roma communities are defined as rural marginalized areas with no
residents who self-identify as Roma. For levels and types of LHDI, see Part II. Table 2. Villages with comprehensive
development or with mobility development are not included due to the small number of these cases.

Notes: ONLY non-Roma communities are defined as communes in which all rural marginalized areas have
no residents who self-identify as Roma. ONLY Roma communities are defined as communes in which all
rural marginalized areas have more than 20 percent of residents who self-identify as Roma. Ethnically mixed
communities (one in which more than 20 percent of residents self-identify as Roma) with two or more marginalized
areas containing both non-Roma and Roma communities. Urban connectivity is estimated based on an index
(IURCON) that uses a set of distances between each commune and its neighboring small, medium, large, and very
large cities. The higher the IURCON value, the better connected the commune is to a city. Remote communes (those
with low urban connectivity) are those localities in the lowest quintile of IURCON. High urban connectivity refers to
the highest quintile of IURCON. The cells marked in color indicate the dominant patterns.
