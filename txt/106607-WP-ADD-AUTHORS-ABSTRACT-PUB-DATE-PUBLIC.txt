This report represents part of a joint study by the World Bank and the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, Seattle (IHME) of the global eco-
nomic costs of air pollution. The study, supported by the World Bank’s Pollution Management
and Environmental Health (PMEH) program, aims to raise awareness about the severity of air
pollution around the world and to strengthen the business case for countries to take action in
reducing pollution.

The report was written together by Urvashi Narain (Senior Environmental Economist, World

series of working-group meetings with the community of environmental economists at the
World Bank, chaired by Carter Brandon (Lead Economist, World Bank) and Kseniya Lvovsky
(Practice Manager, World Bank), which focused on developing a consistent and updated
framework across World Bank operations for estimating the health impacts and economic
costs of air pollution. The authors are grateful for all those who contributed their valuable

1. Introduction
This discussion note is meant to inform a joint publication by the World Bank and Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on the economic costs of air pollution. Air pol-
lution is a global challenge and one that is acutely felt in developing countries. Illnesses
caused by ambient and household air pollution claim the lives of nearly 6 million people
each year, with a disproportionate majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income
countries. The goal of the joint World Bank–IHME report is to raise awareness about the
severity of this challenge and to strengthen the business case for countries to take action on
reducing air pollution. To that end, the report will present new evidence on the health
impacts of air pollution from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study (GBD 2013), provide
estimates of the economic costs that societies bear as a result of these impacts, and highlight
the potential for economic benefits resulting from air quality management and emissions
reductions.

A secondary goal of the joint World Bank–IHME report is to further the development of
a consistent framework for valuing the costs of air pollution in World Bank operations.
Whether in assessing potential investments or in advising client governments on policy,
the World Bank undertakes a variety of activities that require it to estimate the economic
costs of pollution. In recent decades, tremendous progress has been made in understand-
ing both the epidemiology and the economics of health risks from pollution. The joint
World Bank–IHME report provides an opportunity to assess what has been done and to
bring more uniformity and consistency to the way pollution costs are valued across World
Bank operations. The need for greater consistency was noted, for example, in a 2014
review by Cropper and Khanna of the World Bank’s methodology for estimating damages
from particulate emissions for the adjusted net savings (ANS) indicator (Cropper and
Khanna 2014).

The joint report with the IHME will explore several alternative approaches to valuing health
risks from air pollution and will provide guidance on key issues in implementing these
approaches, including when certain approaches may be more appropriate than others. This
discussion note serves as a background paper for the joint report and provides a detailed
discussion of the key methodological choices that must be made in valuing the health
impacts of pollution. This note also makes recommendations on how these challenges can
be addressed. Although past efforts to value the health impacts of pollution have greatly
contributed to the discussion of challenges and potential solutions, analysts have tended to
make some methodological choices on an ad hoc basis. The hope in developing this note is
to bring greater clarity to what the issues are and to provide guidance on how the issues can
be addressed consistently. The note provides clear recommendations where possible and a
framing of issues where the literature or the context does not yet provide clarity on potential
solutions. Lastly, although the primary purpose of this note is to serve as a background
paper for the joint report and therefore to make recommendations for the methodological

choices that are relevant in that context, this note also, to the extent possible, discusses how
these choices may differ in different contexts (project analysis, for example). The note should
nevertheless be treated as a living document—one that will need to be updated regularly
as applications and consultations highlight other challenges and provide greater clarity on

2. Decisions on What Is to Be Valued:
Metrics of Health Impacts
The choice of what metric to use to quantify health outcomes attributable to pollution has
important implications for how the economic costs of these outcomes are valued and for their
magnitude. This section discusses two key questions in the choice of metrics:
1.	 Should both mortality and morbidity impacts be valued together in terms of disability-­
    adjusted life years (DALYs) lost?
2.	 Should mortality impacts be measured as the number of deaths or number of years of
    life lost?




Metrics of Health Impacts
Metrics of the health burden of pollution estimated for GBD 2013 include deaths, years of life
lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and DALYs. Deaths and YLLs are mortality
metrics, YLDs measure morbidity, and DALYs are a measure of total mortality and morbidity.
DALYs are commonly used in the epidemiology literature as a summary measure of health
loss, taking into account both fatal and nonfatal conditions. Under certain assumptions,
DALYs are equivalent to the inverse measure of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)—a con-
cept that was developed a couple of decades before the concept of DALYs and that is widely
used in cost-effectiveness studies of alternative disease prevention and control strategies. These
metrics (or a subset of them) are found in most studies that estimate the health impacts of
pollution.

In GBD 2013, for each country and cause of death, YLLs are calculated against a standard
life table, which was updated by GBD researchers to account for recent demographic
changes and population projections (GBD 2013 Collaborators 2015a). In calculating
YLLs for GBD 2013, the GBD researchers do not discount for years of life lost at later ages,
a procedure that contrasts with that used by the World Health Organization (WHO).
(WHO originally calculated only discounted YLLs but now reports both discounted and
undiscounted versions.) Also, the life expectancy for men and women is assumed to be the
same (Murray et al. 2012).1 YLDs per health outcome are calculated as the number of prev-
alent cases multiplied by a disability weight, which is “the general public’s assessment of the
severity of health loss” associated with that condition (GBD 2013 Collaborators 2015b:
743). Disability weights are a relative measure of different health states, ranging from
0 (no health loss) to 1 (equivalent to death). Weights for the GBD 2013 were assigned on the
basis of face-to-face surveys in Bangladesh, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands,
Peru, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States as well as an open Internet survey (GBD
2013 Collaborators 2015b, 743; Salomon et al. 2012). Finally, DALYs are calculated as the
sum of YLLs and YLDs.

Valuing Mortality and Morbidity Together
 Although DALYs are a useful summary measure of health impacts, they may be problematic
 for the purposes of economic valuation. The disability weights used to calculate YLDs (and
 thus DALYs) are meant to be a universal, value-neutral, and context-independent measure
 of health loss. Although the GBD survey results indicate consistency in the rankings of dis-
 ability weights across countries and levels of development, disability weights are not intended
 to be a measure of welfare (that is, lost utility or value) or a reflection of the social conse-
 quences of various health states. This makes DALYs problematic for use in economic
­valuation,2 particularly when aggregated across different health outcomes. As an example,3
 consider two patients suffering from vision loss. One is in a society in which corrective
 lenses are readily available and people with impaired vision have good job prospects. The
 other is in a society in which corrective lenses are not available or are prohibitively expensive
 and job opportunities are limited. When measured in terms of YLDs and DALYs, both peo-
 ple are considered to have suffered an equal reduction in health; however, the consequences
 of impaired vision are vastly different and would likely be valued differently by individuals
 in the two societies.4 From this perspective, Hammitt (2002) argues that DALYs are incon-
 sistent with the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) approach (discussed in the next section) under
 which characteristics such as wealth and age may influence how individuals value health
 risks. By the same logic, DALYs are also inconsistent with the forgone output approach
 (also discussed in the next section) because the effect of health loss on an individual’s capac-
 ity to perform work may depend on her profession, the industry in which she works, and
 other context-specific factors, including how households adjust labor inputs in response to
 death or illness.

Using DALYs as a metric of health impacts for economic valuation requires some additional
restrictive assumptions about individual preferences (Pliskin et al. 1980, cited in Hubbell 2002;
Hammitt 2002, 2013). First, longevity and the quality of life must be independent in the indi-
vidual’s utility function, meaning that someone’s preference to live longer does not depend on
how healthy she is and that preferences for health are not influenced by age or remaining life-
span. Second, there must be constant proportionality in tradeoffs between the quantity and
quality of life, such that an individual would trade living 20 years in “fair” health over 10 years
in “good” health the same way she would trade 10 years in “fair” health over 5 years in “good”
health. Third, the individual must be risk neutral with respect to years of life such that she will
prefer living longer given equal odds and that she will not take a gamble to extend her life
expectancy if the odds are not as good. Fourth, there must be independence in utility func-
tions over time, meaning that an individual’s health state in previous periods will not influence
her preferences in subsequent periods. Yet, empirical WTP studies have shown that (a) people
disproportionately prefer reduced fatality risks over improvements in quality of health,
(b) WTP for reducing mortality risks is disproportionately affected by the duration and sever-
ity of illness, and (c) WTP for reducing mortality risks varies little with age or may decline
only later in life (Hammitt and Haninger 2011; Krupnick 2007).

Similar assumptions apply in monetizing the cost of YLLs as with DALYs. Assigning a
­
single monetary value per YLL implies that individual preferences to extend life are inde-
pendent of age (for example, a 30-year-old would value a year of life the same way a


4	                                       Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
75-year-old would) and that WTP is proportional to the gain in life expectancy (in other
words, that WTP for 10 years of additional life should be 10 times that for 1 year of life
gained). As noted, economic studies of how people value changes in the probability of
death suggest that WTP is not proportional to age. However, as will be discussed more
later, relatively few studies have explicitly looked at how people value changes in life expec-
tancy. Also, although changes in mortality risks and life expectancy are mathematically
related, people may not think about them in the same way and may not attach the same
monetary value to one versus the other.

Despite criticisms on theoretical grounds, it is nonetheless common international prac-
tice  to measure both fatal and nonfatal health outcomes in terms of DALYs in assessing
their economic cost (Cropper and Khanna 2014). Recent cost of environmental degrada-
tion (COED) studies by the World Bank that evaluate health outcomes in terms of DALYs
include those done in Colombia (Golub et al. 2014), India (World Bank 2013), Jordan
(Croitoru et al. 2010), Kosovo (World Bank 2013c), Macedonia (Meisner et al. 2015), and
Nicaragua (Klytchnikova et al. 2013). Table 2.1, drawn from the India study, shows how
DALYs are used to quantify premature mortality risks as well as other health endpoints.
In the India study, each premature death from air pollution is assumed to result in a loss of
7.5  DALYs for adults and 70.0 DALYs for children, while each nonfatal case of chronic
bronchitis leads to a loss of 4.0 DALYs (0.2 x 20 = 4). Note in table 2.1 that other nonfatal
­
health endpoints such as hospital admissions or outpatient visits to the emergency room are
also translated into terms of DALYs (but these are very small, with the time lost measured
in days).

Note: DALYs represent the sum of YLLs for fatal outcomes plus years lived with disability (YLDs) for nonfatal outcomes. In the
tables above, the calculation of DALYs follows the method originally used for the 1990 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study by
the World Health Organization and subsequent updates for 2000 and 2004. Under this method, YLDs = incident cases x disability
weight x average duration. GBD 2010 and GBD 2013, on the other hand, calculate YLDs as the number of prevalent cases x
disability weight. Disability weights for lower respiratory illness and chronic bronchitis are those used by the National Institutes of
Health in the United States. Weights for other endpoints are drawn from Larsen (2004). Average years of life lost per death from
air pollution are calculated by applying age weights and have been discounted at 3 percent per year. DALY = disability-adjusted
life-year; YLL = years of life lost.

     Box 2.1  Question: Should Mortality and Morbidity Impacts Be
     Valued Together in Terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years?

     Proposal: Given the problems associated with disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) when used
     in economic valuation, the fact that mortality is easier to explain, and the fact that deaths (or
     years of life lost—YLLs) represent the bulk of the overall health burden of pollution in the Global
     Burden of Disease study, it is recommended that only mortality impacts be valued while measur-
     ing the economic costs of air pollution for the joint report.

     Outside the context of this report, both the morbidity and mortality outcomes will be relevant
     for the economic analysis in other situations. For example, and as recommended by the World
     Health Organization, both fatal and nonfatal health outcomes should be used in assessments
     of cost-­effectiveness of particular projects or policies. Or when morbidity impacts are a non-
             proportion of the total health impacts of air pollution, researchers may want to value
     trivial ­
     DALYs and not just YLLs, problems associated with DALYs when used in economic valuation
     notwithstanding.




It is also important to note that morbidity represents a very small share of the total health
impacts of air pollution in the context of the GBD analysis. The shares of YLLs and YLDs
in total DALYs from exposure to ambient and household PM2.5 (particulate matter less than
2.5 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter) are shown in table 2.2, as estimated for GBD 2013.
Because YLLs contribute 97 percent of DALYs from ambient PM2.5 exposure and 93 percent of
DALYs from household air pollution exposure, valuing health losses in the form of DALYs
yields practically the same results as valuing premature mortality risks in the form of reduced
life expectancy (YLLs).5 (See box 2.1.)



Measuring Premature Mortality
Theoretical issues aside, whether premature mortality is measured in terms of excess deaths
or lost life expectancy raises important ethical questions about how health impacts suffered
by the very old and very young should be weighted. According to the GBD 2013 estimates,
62 percent of deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 and 59 percent of deaths from household
air pollution in 2013 were suffered by the over age 65 population. Children under the age


6	                                                     Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
 of 15, meanwhile, accounted for only 4 percent of deaths from ambient PM2.5 and 8 percent
 of deaths from household air pollution in 2013. When expressed in terms of YLLs, the pro-
 file of health impacts looks much different. YLLs among the over age 65 population repre-
 sented 34 percent of total YLLs due to ambient PM2.5 and 30 percent of YLLs due to
 household air pollution. About 16 percent of YLLs from ambient PM2.5 and 26 percent of
 YLLs from household air pollution were among children under the age of 15. The differ-
 ences in the age profile of premature deaths and YLLs due to household air pollution are
 illustrated in figures 2.1 and 2.2.

 Although YLLs per death are greater for young people, they are not the same as life expec-
 tancy, and their usefulness may be limited for the purposes of economic valuation.
 Because YLLs are calculated against a standard life table, YLLs per death are assumed to
 be the same for similar-age people around the world, regardless of actual life expectancy.
 For example, life expectancy in Swaziland was 21 years at age 50. The calculated number
 of YLLs per death for a person of that age is 35 years for all countries. Thus, valuing the
 economic benefit of an avoided death from air pollution due to ischemic heart disease for
 a 50-year-old in Swaziland using YLLs may lead to overestimates because YLLs ignore
 competing risks and use a lower overall risk profile for all causes of death in that country.

                                Box 2.2  Question: Should Mortality Impacts Be Measured as
                                Number of Deaths or Number of Life Years Lost?

                                Proposal: The literature offers almost no guidance as to whether it is better to measure number
                                of deaths or reduced life expectancy when evaluating the economic costs of premature mortality
                                from air pollution. Both deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) are common in the medical litera-
                                ture, though the usefulness of YLLs versus actual life expectancy increases may be limited for the
                                purposes of economic valuation. The choice between valuing deaths or reduced life expectancy in
                                assessing the burden of disease from air pollution hinges on whether impacts among children or
                                older people should be weighted more heavily in the calculation. This is as much an ethical ques-
                                tion as it is an economic one. For the purposes of assessing the global burden of disease, separate
                                calculations will be made in valuing both deaths and reduced life expectancy. In other contexts,
                                the choice of metric may be guided by the context of the project or policy at hand.

3. Approaches to Valuing the Economic
Costs of Premature Mortality
This section considers the different approaches to valuing the economic costs of premature
mortality and the methodological challenges in implementing them. In particular, it tries to
provide answers to the following questions:
1.	 When should the willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach be used versus the forgone-output
    approach?
2.	 Should value of statistical life (VSL) be adjusted for age differences, health status, income,
    or risk characteristics?
3.	 How should deaths among children be valued?
4.	 Should VSL or value per statistical life year (VSLY) be used? How should VSLY be
    estimated?
5.	 What base VSL should be used, and how should the VSL be transferred between countries?
6.	 How should working age, future growth rates, and discount rates be defined when imple-
    menting the forgone-output approach?



Willingness-to-Pay Approach
By causing illness, pollution is a detriment to the things that individuals fundamentally value,
including consumption, leisure, good health, and life itself. Individuals make tradeoffs between
things of value every day. For example, they sacrifice leisure by going to work so that they can
increase consumption. In valuing the increased risk of death due to pollution, the task of the
economist then is to weigh the tradeoffs that individuals would be willing to make to reduce
their chances of dying. What the economist seeks to measure is the individual’s willingness to
pay (WTP) in exchange for a reduced chance of dying—or willingness to accept (WTA) com-
pensation in exchange for an increased fatality risk—to maintain the same level of utility.1
Graphically, the marginal rate of substitution between wealth and the probability of survival
(or risk of death) is depicted in figure 3.1 as the slope of an individual’s indifference curve (see
Cropper et al 2011, 315–316). Supposing that pollution reduces the probability of survival
from P1 to P2, the cost to the individual would be equal to the vertical distance from W1 to W2.
The economist would monetize the loss of value suffered by the individual due to pollution by
assigning a dollar amount to ΔW, which is what the individual would be willing to pay to avoid
such an increase in mortality risk and thereby sustain the same level of utility.

The value of statistical life (VSL) represents an aggregate of individuals’ willingness to pay
(WTP) for marginal reductions in their mortality risks (R). It is not the value of any single
person’s life or death, nor does it represent a society’s judgment as to what that value should be.
In figure 3.1, for small changes in survival probability, the VSL can be approximated as VSL =
ΔW/ΔP. As a stylized example of how the VSL is derived and how it relates to the cost of
pollution, suppose that pollution increases the odds that any given individual would die in a
­
year on average from 2 in 10,000 to 3 in 10,000.2 This is ΔP. Probability implies that among
10,000 people, 1 person dies each year due to the increased risk from pollution. Suppose fur-
ther that individuals in this society are willing to pay US$30 on average to reduce their risk of

death by a margin of 1 in 10,000. This is ΔW. Summing this average WTP value over 10,000
individuals, the value of one statistical life would be equal to US$300,000.

Empirically, the VSL is derived from studies of people’s stated preferences or revealed prefer-
ences (actual behavior). In stated-preference studies, individuals are presented with hypothet-
ical scenarios and asked to make choices. For example, they might be asked about how much
they would be willing to pay for a new medical treatment that would reduce their risk of dying
from cancer, or they might be asked to choose between paying for different programs to reduce
the risk of traffic fatalities in their city. In any case, researchers must: (a) present respondents
with information about their baseline risk of death and the nature of the risk; (b) describe the
context; (c) define how much their risk will be reduced (or increased) and who exactly will
benefit from the risk reduction (for example, adult individuals or their children); (d) clarify
the time period over which risks will be reduced (for example, now or 10 years later); (e) explain
who will be expected to pay (for example, the individual or general public); and (f) provide
other relevant information (Kling et al. 2012).

For the purposes of evaluating the costs of pollution, the appeal of stated-preference studies is
that they enable researchers to investigate the preferences of a broad array of individuals,
including those most affected by pollution, and to ask about health risks similar to those actu-
ally experienced by people exposed to pollution. The main disadvantage of such studies is that

they are based on hypothetical situations in which respondents may disregard their actual
budget constraints or make spurious choices without real consequences (Cropper et al. 2011;
OECD 2012). Also, respondents may be asked about small changes in survival probability that
are difficult to comprehend, and their choices may be influenced by how those choices are
embedded (for example, whether a hypothetical program is presented by itself, in comparison
with another program, or bundled in a package) or the order in which choices of different
magnitude are posed. Whether such differences lead to systematic bias or unreliability in VSL
estimates derived from stated-preference studies is open to debate (see Carson 2012; Hausman
2012; Kling et al. 2012). For some goods, individuals tend to overstate their WTP when asked
in surveys; for reducing illness-related risks, however, previous reviews have found that indi-
viduals often understate their WTP when survey results are compared with revealed market
behavior (Cropper et al. 2011; Kochi et al. 2006).3

In revealed-preference studies, researchers investigate individuals’ WTP by observing their
behavior in actual markets. The most common approach in estimating the VSL has been to
examine differences in wages for more or less risky occupations (see Viscusi 2004). This is the
approach that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has primarily taken in valuing
mortality risk reductions (Robinson 2007). Other approaches may value pollution costs
by  looking at differences in real estate prices between more and less polluted areas (see
Zheng et al. 2014), or gauge individuals’ willingness to spend on protective measures such as
face masks that limit their exposure to air pollution (see Zheng et al. 2015).

Although revealed-preference studies of wage-risk differentials are often seen as more credi-
ble, they face drawbacks that may limit their usefulness for valuing pollution-related health
risks. Wage-risk studies used to estimate the VSL assume that workers are well informed about
their actual risk of on-the-job injury and that they are in a competitive labor market in which
they are perfectly mobile and can negotiate higher wages with employers for taking riskier
jobs. These conditions do not hold for workers in many developing countries. Furthermore,
because wage-risk studies focus on working adults, they do not capture the preferences of
people outside the labor force “whether because of illness, retirement, child raising, or other
reasons” (Cropper et al. 2011, 317). Studies of wage differentials for morality risks also face a
host of econometric issues, such as determining how to account for unobserved characteris-
tics of workers that incline some to take more or less risky jobs for reasons other than pay
(Cropper et al. 2011, 317; Kniesner and Viscusi 2005).



Other Approaches to Valuing Health Impacts
Alternative approaches to valuing health impacts include the cost of illness (COI) approach. The
COI approach seeks to account for the direct and indirect financial costs of death and i       ­llness.
Direct financial costs include ambulance costs, medical expenses, wages lost by sick workers,
and time spent caring for ill family members, among others. Indirect financial costs include
such costs as productivity losses to firms from declining customer service quality and missed
business opportunities because of sick employees. The COI approach could be used to value the
financial costs of health impacts arising from either acute or chronic exposure. As an example of
the COI approach in practice, the U.K. Department for Transport includes direct and indirect
financial costs in valuing the costs of road traffic fatalities. It counts these financial costs apart

12	                                        Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
from what the agency calls “human costs,” which “are based on willingness to pay to avoid pain,
grief and suffering to the casualty, relatives and friends, as well as intrinsic loss of enjoyment of
life” (U.K. DFT 2012, 2). The COI approach is also frequently used in measuring the costs of
morbidity (nonfatal health outcomes), as will be discussed in greater detail in a later section.

The forgone output (FO) approach, sometimes referred to as the human capital approach, is
related to the COI approach. It is an income-based approach and equates the financial cost of
premature mortality with the present value of forgone lifetime earnings. The Ministry of Social
Development (MDS) in Chile, for example, has adopted the FO approach in its guidelines for
valuing premature mortality. MDS estimates the average cost of an early death at UF 12,868
(Chile MDS 2014). A common criticism of this approach is that it excludes losses suffered by
individuals outside the labor force, including retirees. The income-based approach also raises
questions about how unpaid work that contributes to the economy, such as subsistence farm-
ing and domestic activities, should be valued. An adjusted approach seen in countries such as
China is to value mortality among all individuals regardless of participation in the labor force
using gross domestic product (GDP) per capita discounted over remaining life expectancy
(see World Bank–SEPA 2007).

Although the FO approach accounts specifically for reduced labor output due to the loss of
individuals’ time endowment, computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling may be
applied to measure the wider productivity losses to the economy. These models simulate how
the effects of premature deaths and nonfatal health outcomes are propagated across sectors
and over time, leading to changes in overall economic activity and consumption. For example,
Matus and coauthors (2012) use an expanded version of the Emissions Prediction and Policy
Analysis (EPPA) model developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to simulate
the broader economic impacts caused by air pollution exposure in China as a result of divert-
ing labor from productive activities and reducing the time for leisure. Tracking the effects of
exposure to PM10 and ozone in major cities from 1970 to 2005, they estimate that air pollution
reduced annual consumption in China in 2005 by 7 percent, or US$69.0 billion (1997 prices).
Including welfare losses—estimated in terms of lost leisure time and valued at the wage rate,
not the WTP to avoid mortality risk—they figure total economic losses due to air pollution in
2005 to be US$184.5 billion. Similar analyses using the health-adjusted EPPA model have been
done for the United States (Matus et al. 2008) and Europe (Nam et al. 2009). Analysis by the
World Bank in India has used CGE modeling to estimate the GDP impacts of reducing air
pollution emissions through the use of a tax on coal or emissions (World Bank 2013b).




Use of the Willing-to-Pay–Based Approach versus
the Forgone Output Approach
The WTP-based approach is best suited for analyses of economic welfare and has become
the standard approach in high-income countries for valuing mortality risks associated with
pollution (see Cropper 2000; OECD 2012; Viscusi 1993). The forgone output approach
­
continues to be used for policy analysis by public agencies in some countries such as Chile
and China. Both the WTP-based approach and forgone output approach may be applicable
for cross-country comparisons of health impacts and costs or other applications depending

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                      13
on the scope of the application. In theory, the present value of lifetime earnings should be less
than the VSL, which captures the utility derived from intangibles such as being alive and
spending time with loved ones in addition to consumption (Hammitt and Robinson 2011).

The forgone output provides an income-based measure of health impacts and may be more
appropriate for financial analysis and accounting, for example, in calculating pollution costs as
a component of adjusted net savings (ANS) within the System of National Accounts frame-
work. ANS, or “genuine savings,” is a measure of the change in the value of a nation’s assets,
including manufactured capital as well as natural and human capital (see Hamilton and
Clemens 1999; World Bank 2005, 2011). Positive savings represent an investment in future
well-being as a nation accumulates the assets needed to drive economic growth and at least
sustain current levels of consumption. Within the ANS framework, premature mortality due
to pollution represents a disinvestment in a nation’s human capital stock. As with the degrada-
tion of other forms of capital, the value of this disinvestment would be valued according to an
expected loss of income over the lifetime of the asset.4

Losses valued under a FO approach are typically much smaller than those valued under a
WTP approach. Because of this, in COED studies by the World Bank, the FO approach is still
frequently used to estimate the lower bound of losses in economic welfare due to pollution.5
FO may represent to the lower bounds of WTP so long as average utility of consumption is
greater than marginal utility of consumption, which is true for strictly concave utility func-
tions (Cropper 2000). However, although welfare-based and income-based measures typically
provide a range of health costs, they should not be averaged and presented as a single measure.
Also, in COED studies, welfare-based estimates of damages should not be added to other pro-
ductivity-based measures of environmental degradation that are presented as a percentage loss
of GDP, as GDP is an income-based measure. If presenting the welfare-based estimate as a
percentage of GDP, appropriate language should be added to explain to readers how they
should interpret this measure.

Finally, both types of approaches can be used in project analysis: income-based measures in proj-
ect financial analysis, and welfare-based measures in project economic analysis. (See box 3.1)



  Box 3.1  Question: When Should the Willingness-to-Pay Approach
  Be Used Instead of the Forgone Output Approach?

  Proposal: Both the willingness to pay (WTP) approach and forgone output (FO) approach may
  be applicable for cross-country comparisons of health impacts or other applications, depending
  on the scope of the applications. Estimates based on both approaches will be provided for the joint
  study. FO is more appropriate for financial analysis and accounting, as in calculating pollution
  costs as a component of adjusted net savings or in project financial analysis. The WTP approach,
  on the other hand, should be used in project economic analysis. Both approaches can be used in
  cost of environmental degradation studies. Although welfare-based and income-based measures
  typically provide a range of health costs, they should not be averaged and presented as a single
  measure. Welfare-based estimates of health damages should also not be presented as a percentage
  of gross domestic product without appropriate language to clarify that the comparison is only
  being made for convenience as a benchmark of magnitude.

Factors Influencing the Value of Statistical Life
A variety of factors influence the VSL, including the income, wealth, age, life expectancy, cul-
tural beliefs, and health status of the affected individuals who make up a society. Moreover, as
Cropper and coauthors write, an individual has no single VSL: “Different people have different
preferences, and for an individual, the value of a 1-in-10,000 risk reduction may depend on
whether death results immediately from injury or from a lingering illness, whether it is caused
by a hazard viewed as particularly fearsome, whether one is rich or poor or old or young, and
other factors” (Cropper et al. 2011, 316).

The following section describes salient population and risk characteristics that affect the VSL.
Population characteristics discussed include age, health status, and income.


Age
The relationship between age and the value of mortality risk reductions is a complex and con-
tentious issue. As noted above, the age question is important because of how the health impacts
of air pollution are distributed.

Experts and public agencies around the world are split as to whether the VSL should be
adjusted in assessing health benefits and costs for people of different ages. The US EPA, OMB,
and DOT have discontinued the practice of discounting the VSL for the elderly or making
other adjustments for age in valuing mortality risks, with the expert panels advising these
agencies citing a lack of consistent empirical support (Morgan et al. 2007; NRC 2008; U.S. EPA
2014; U.S. OMB 2003). The Organisation for Co-operation and Development (OECD) also
disfavors making age adjustments to the VSL (OECD 2012). Meanwhile, the Canadian
­
government has regularly applied a 25 percent discount to monetize reduced mortality risks
for the over age 65 population (Chestnut and Civita 2009). The European Commission
Directorate-General for Environment (EC DG Environment) has recommended that the VSL
be discounted by 30 percent for the elderly (Hurley et al. 2005). Previous studies by the
World Bank of the health costs of pollution have also applied age discounting to value prema-
ture mortality, either directly or implicitly through the use of a constant VSLY to monetize
DALYs (Hammitt and Robinson 2011). If the VSLY is used to monetize health impacts rather
than the VSL, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has recommended a higher
VSLY be used for older adults (U.S. OMB 2003).

The effect of age on the VSL is theoretically indeterminate (Morgan et al. 2007; Hammitt 2007;
Hammitt and Robinson 2014). As people age, their life expectancy shortens, but they may also
be wealthier. As their preferences evolve, they may place a greater value on longevity or pre-
serving their health. Stated-preference studies have found some evidence of a lower VSL only
among the very old.6 For example, in a survey by Alberini and coauthors (2004), respondents
in Canada who were over the age of 70 were willing to pay about 33 percent less than younger
respondents to reduce their risk of dying over the next 10 years. Respondents in the United
States over the age of 70 were willing to pay about 20 percent less than younger respondents,
although the difference in WTP for the U.S. sample was statistically insignificant. Similarly, in
another stated-preference study, Krupnick and coauthors (2010) observed that WTP among
respondents over the age of 70 in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Nanning, and Jiujiang declined

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                  15
by 20 percent for contemporaneous risk reductions, after controlling for differences in health
and other factors. Reviewing the results from more than 20 other stated-preference studies,
Krupnick concludes that “the evidence for a senior discount is too thin to be relied on for pol-
icy purposes” (Krupnick 2007, 262).

Blomquist and coauthors (2011) posit that the relationship between age and the VSL may be
nonmonotonic. The authors conducted two separate surveys in the United States in which
adults weighed the tradeoffs between drugs that better control asthma symptoms but also
increase fatality risks. In the first survey, parents with asthmatic children between the ages
of 4 to 17 were asked to make choices to treat their children. In the second survey, adults
in the general population ages 23 and older were asked about their own preferences. The
survey results show that the VSL for children is about 1.7 times higher than the average
adult VSL. The VSL gradually declines for young people between the ages of 4 and 30, rises
for adults over 30, and then declines again for people in retirement age. Another study
by  Hammitt and Haninger (2010) estimated that the WTP of parents to reduce risks to
their children is 1.5 to 2.0 times larger than the WTP to reduce their own mortality risks
or  the risks faced by other adults. Not only does the higher VSL for young children
reflect  the  altruistic concerns of parents, but also it is influenced by the fact that parents
tend  to be more affluent than young people in their teens and twenties with lower VSLs
(Viscusi 2010).

The practice of assigning higher values to mortality risk reductions among children has tended
to be less controversial than discounting the VSL for older adults (Hammitt and Robinson
2014; Viscusi 2010). Normally, the VSL should reflect the aggregate of affected individuals’
own WTP for reducing their risk of death, but children represent a special case. Children have
little concept of risk and are usually not held responsible for making decisions affecting their
well-being or chance of death. The U.S. EPA has endorsed the use of parent surveys to value
costs and benefits to children’s health, finding that “the parental perspective provides value
estimates from individuals likely to have the child’s best interest at heart, incorporates the
household context into the estimation approaches, and can be implemented using a variety of
valuation techniques” (U.S. EPA 2003, 2–11). Although the EPA does not find sufficient evi-
dence to derive age-specific VSLs for children (U.S. EPA 2014), it does suggest that these val-
ues are systematically higher (U.S. EPA 2003). The U.S. OMB recommends the use of monetary
values that are at least as large as those used for adults (U.S. OMB 2003). The OECD has rec-
ommended that the VSL for children should be 1.5 to 2.0 times higher than the mean adult
VSL when assessing public health risks that mainly affect children or evaluating programs that
specifically target children (OECD 2012).

Virtually all of the COED studies by the World Bank in recent years have forgone the use of a
VSL in monetizing impacts on children’s health from pollution and instead have taken a for-
gone output approach.7 The commonly cited reason for this approach is that no VSL studies
have been done for children, and children have poorly defined risk preferences. An exception
is the 2007 study of pollution damages in China by the World Bank and the Chinese environ-
mental protection authority, which applies the adult VSL to value child mortality following
U.S. EPA guidance (World Bank—SEPA 2007). Under a forgone output approach, children’s
deaths are monetized as the discounted value of their expected lifetime earnings (see box 3.3
and box 3.11.)

   Box 3.2  Question: When Using the Value of Statistical Life,
   Should the Value of Statistical Life Be Adjusted for Age Differences
   in the Adult Population Affected by Air Pollution?

   Proposal: Given that the effect of age on VSL is theoretically indeterminate and that the empirical
   evidence is mixed, experts and public agencies around the world are split as to whether the VSL
   should be adjusted in assessing health benefits and costs for people of different ages. Consequently,
   conditional on using VSL, an age-independent VSL will be used for adults, though sensitivity
   analysis may be done to compare the effect of discounting the VSL by 20–30 percent for persons
   aged 70 and older, corresponding roughly to the differences in WTP observed by Alberini and
   coauthors (2004), Krupnick and coauthors (2010), and the rate used by the European Commission
   Directorate-General for the Environment. Note that use of a VSLY, as opposed to the VSL, implic-
   itly discounts health impacts among older people with shorter remaining lifetimes. The choice
   to use an age-invariant VSL in other contexts will depend on the nature of the health risk being
   evaluated and whether a particular policy or project targets people in a specific age group.




   Box 3.3  Question: How Should Deaths among Children
   Be Monetized?

   Proposal: The VSL for children should be set according to what adults are willing to pay to reduce
   risks to children in the country where the health impacts are taking place. If such an estimate
   is not available, then it is recommended that the default be to use the adult VSL as the existing
   empirical evidence on what parents are willing to pay is mixed. Furthermore, use of the forgone
   income approach to value deaths among children while using a WTP-based approach to value
   deaths among adults is also not recommended as this implicitly discounts the value of children’s
   deaths, and also mixes welfare-based measures and income-based measures in a single indicator.



Health Status
As noted by the U.S. EPA, individual health status “is an especially relevant factor for valuation
of environmental risks because individuals with impaired health are often the most vulnerable
to mortality risks from environmental causes. For example, particulate air pollution appears to
disproportionately affect individuals in an already impaired state of health” (U.S. EPA 2014,
B-5). However, the empirical evidence for how individual health status influences the VSL is
mixed at best. A study by Tsevat and coauthors (1998) of elderly hospitalized patients found
that patients placed a higher premium on extending life than did medical care providers and
family members. Stated-preference studies in the United States and Canada by Krupnick and
coauthors (2002) and Alberini and coauthors (2004) showed that individuals in poor health
did not have a significantly different WTP for mortality risk reductions than others. A more
recent survey of people’s WTP to avoid air pollution in Beijing and Shanghai similarly did not
reveal any difference in WTP among respondents suffering from respiratory disease versus
those who reported good health (Tan and Zhao 2014).

As with the influence of age on the VSL, the EPA finds insufficient theoretical and empiri-
cal support to warrant the use of a health-adjusted VSL for policy purposes (U.S. EPA 2014).

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                               17
This advice mirrors that of earlier expert panels (Morgan et al. 2007; NRC 2008). The OECD
also has avoided making adjustments for varying health status between countries in its esti-
mates of the costs of air pollution (OECD 2014; WHO-OECD 2015). None of the COED
studies by the World Bank have adjusted the VSL for an affected population’s general state of
health. (See box 3.4.)

Income
Both theory and the available body of empirical evidence support the notion that the value
attached to mortality risk reductions increases for individuals with higher incomes. For equity
concerns, governments have typically not adjusted VSLs to reflect cross-sectional differences
between poorer and richer citizens. In country-level policy analysis, a single VSL is typically
used for the entire country despite pronounced differences in income between people living in
different regions (see World Bank-SEPA 2007). The reasoning behind this choice is that the
costs of pollution should be aggregated at the societal level at which the collective economic
burden is typically shared and the policies to control pollution are typically made: the nation
state (WHO-OECD 2015).

Although the notion that the VSL should rise with income is commonly accepted, the extent
to which the VSL varies with income is the subject of debate. Lindhjem and coauthors (2011)
conducted a meta-regression analysis for the OECD of VSL estimates from more than 80
stated-preference studies done in 38 countries between 1970 and 2008. They estimate an
­
income elasticity of between 1.17 and 1.31 for the entire sample set.8 This finding suggests
that WTP for mortality risk reductions would increase more quickly than would income and
that the ratio of the VSL to per capita income would be greater in high-income countries than
in low-income or middle-income countries.9 After screening for studies that meet certain
quality standards,10 however, the elasticity estimated by Lindhjem and coauthors falls to
between 0.77 and 0.88, implying that the VSL is income inelastic. Imposing further restric-
tions to include only studies that satisfy validity tests reduces the elasticity to between 0.33
and 0.75.11 Although this restricted sample is composed mainly of VSL estimates from stud-
ies in high-income OECD countries, it does include estimates from a number of middle-​
income countries. Attempting to eliminate the effect of methodological differences, Lindhjem
and coauthors proceed to use an even more restricted sample of estimates drawn from stud-
ies that employ the best-practice survey instrument developed by Krupnick and coauthors
(2002). This set yields income elasticities in the range of 0.30 to 0.44. Using the same ques-
tionnaire, a more recent WTP study by Hoffmann and coauthors (2012) in Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia, estimates an average within-sample income elasticity of 0.38 to 0.60 for WTP for




  Box 3.4  Question: Should Mortality Risks Be Valued Differently
  for People in Different Health States?

  Proposal: Although individuals in poor health may be more susceptible to the health effects
  of pollution, theoretical and empirical evidence are insufficient to suggest that their WTP for
  reduced mortality risk is any different. The VSL, therefore, need not be adjusted to reflect differ-
  ences in health status.


18	                                        Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
contemporaneous risk reductions and 0.38 to 0.52 for longer-term risk reductions. Also
using the same survey instrument, Krupnick and coauthors (2010) estimate an even lower
average income elasticity in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 for respondents in the Chinese cities of
Shanghai, Jiujiang, and Nanning.

Others argue that income elasticity of the VSL should be greater than 1, as suggested by the
literature on risk aversion (see Kaplow 2005). Kniesner and coauthors (2010), for example, use
data on wages, occupational risks, and demographics in the United States. Rather than looking
at the average effect of wage difference, they employ a quantile regression model to capture
how people at different income levels value mortality risk reductions. They find that income
elasticity ranges from 1.23 for people in the top 10th percentile of wages to 2.24 for people in
the bottom 10th percentile. In a meta-analysis of VSL estimates from stated-preference stud-
ies, Biausque (2012) takes a similar methodological approach to explore differences in income
elasticities estimated from studies in poorer versus richer countries. He estimates income elas-
ticities above 1 for countries in the bottom 40th percentile of income and below 1 for countries
at higher income levels. Viscusi (2010) argues that it is reasonable to assume an elasticity of at
least 1 in assessing costs and benefits to the general public—well above the values of 0.5–0.6
estimated from wage-risk studies of people of working age and in decent health (Aldy and
Viscusi 2007).

The paucity of contingent valuation studies in low-income countries makes it difficult to say
whether the observed relationship between the VSL and income in middle-income and
high-income countries also holds for poorer countries. Robinson and Hammitt (2009),
Hammitt and Robinson (2011), and Cropper and Sahin (2009) argue that basic economic
reasons explain why the income elasticity of WTP for risk reductions is likely higher in
low-income countries than in richer countries and may be greater than one. In low-income
countries, survival probabilities are lower, private discount rates are higher, and a larger
share of consumption expenditure is devoted to satisfying basic needs. In such an environ-
ment where baseline health risks are often higher and basic social services and safety nets
lacking, individuals’ attitudes toward risk are also likely different. Given that, it seems rea-
sonable that WTP for relatively small reductions in mortality risk, such as those commonly
posed in stated-preference studies, would represent a smaller percentage of income for
people in lower-income countries than in more affluent countries such as the United States.
­
Comparing the ratio of the VSL to per capita income as estimated from previous meta-­
analyses of empirical WTP studies in developing countries, Cropper and Sahin (2009) find
this to indeed be the case.

Further support for the claim that income elasticity of the VSL is higher in developing coun-
tries is provided by longitudinal studies. These studies gauge how WTP for mortality risk
reductions has varied at different stages of economic development. For example, using wage-
risk data from 1982 to 1997 in Taiwan, Hammitt, Liu, and Liu (2000) estimate the income
elasticity of the VSL to be in the range of 2.0–3.0. Using wage-risk data from 1940 to 1980,
Costa and Kahn (2004) estimate the elasticity for the United States at 1.5–1.7. There are no
longitudinal estimates of the VSL from stated-preference studies.

Moreover, little consensus exists on how the VSL should be adjusted to account for the effect
of income growth over time. The U.S. EPA has recommended making an adjustment for

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                   19
  Box 3.5  Question: Should the Value of Statistical Life Be Adjusted
  for Differences in Income?

  Proposal: For the purposes of the global assessment, for which most assessments are at the
  national level, a single country-level VSL will be used. For country-level assessments, subnational
  VSL may be applied. This decision should be made in consultation with local stakeholders.

  The VSL should, however, be adjusted for cross-sectional differences in income between coun-
  tries as well as for income growth over time. Although the empirical evidence from many stated-­
  preference studies suggests an income elasticity value of less than one, a low elasticity produces
  estimates of VSL for low-income countries that are often not credible. Other empirical studies
  have provided support for elasticity values above one. Consequently, it is suggested that a range of
  elasticity values be considered, especially for situations in which large differences in income exist
  among the affected population and in which mortality risks are being valued over a long time
  period. Especially when the VSL is transferred to a different context from the one in which it was
  originally estimated, the choice of elasticity value could have a material influence on the resulting
  cost estimates. This choice should be communicated clearly and discussed with local stakeholders
  involved in the analysis.

  For the World Bank–IHME report, differentiated elasticity values will be assumed for countries of
  different income levels. The value of 0.8 recommended by the OECD (2012, 2014) will be assumed
  for high-income countries, with a range of 0.6–1.0 for sensitivity analysis. For low-­    income and
  middle-income countries, a higher central value of 1.2 will be assumed, with a range of 1.0–1.4
  for sensitivity analysis. The choice of elasticity values for the global assessment is tied closely to
  the choice of the base VSL and will be discussed in greater detail in a later section of this report
  on benefit-transfer methods (see “Transferring base estimates of the VSL to value health impacts
  in other countries”).




income growth when assessing the potential benefits of reducing mortality risks in future
years (U.S. EPA 2014). A prospective study done by the EPA in 2000, for example, examined
the benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1990 to 2010. In the study, the agency assumed a wide
range of income elasticities (0.08, 0.40, and 1.00). The U.S. Department of Transportation,
meanwhile, assumes an income elasticity of 1 to project the VSL in assessing costs and benefits
in future years (U.S. DOT 2015) (see box 3.5).

Risk Characteristics
Whether different estimates of the VSL should be applied for different risks or causes of
death is another contentious issue. Dimensions of risk that affect the VSL include whether
a risk is voluntary or involuntary, ordinary or catastrophic, immediate or delayed, natural
or constructed, old or new, controllable or uncontrollable, necessary or unnecessary, and
occasional or continuous (U.S. EPA 2010, B-3). For example, in the European Union and
United Kingdom, economic assessments by public agencies may use higher values to mon-
etize cancer risks because of the dread that people feel toward cancer (cited in Cropper
et al. 2011, 330). Empirical evidence of a “cancer premium” is mixed. Hammitt and Haninger
(2011) find little difference in WTP for reduced risk of death from cancers, other diseases,
and traffic accidents. Alberini and Ščańy (2013), on the other hand, observe that the VSL

   Box 3.6  Question: Should the Value of Statistical Life Be Adjusted
   to Reflect the Nature of Different Health Risks from Pollution?

   Proposal: A single VSL will be used to value mortality from air pollution regardless of the cause of
   death. There is not enough evidence to suggest that values other than the default should be used.
   The same holds for the size of the risk and for baseline risks.




increases with dread, exposure to risk, and respondents’ perceptions of their baseline level
of risk. They estimate that the WTP for avoided cancer deaths and respiratory illnesses is
significantly higher than that for motor crashes. In a nationally representative stated-­
preference study in the United States, Viscusi, Huber, and Bell (2014) found evidence of
a  21 percent premium in WTP for avoiding the latent risk of cancer compared with
acute fatality risks. As standard practice, the United Kingdom typically doubles the VSL
in  estimating the economic benefits of asbestos removal compared with traffic safety
(U.K. Treasury 2011, 62).

WTP should increase with the magnitude of risk, and Cropper and coauthors (2011) rec-
ommend that this assumption be used as a minimum criterion for acceptability of VSL
studies. In theory, WTP should increase proportionally to the size of the risk reduction, but
this has not been borne out by many empirical studies. For example, Alberini and coau-
thors (2004) find that the mean WTP among U.S. respondents of reducing the annual risk
of mortality by a factor of 10-in-10,000 is about 1.6 times that for a 5-in-10,000 risk
reduction. Hoffmann and coauthors (2012) estimate that the mean VSL in Ulaanbaatar,
­
Mongolia, for reducing annual mortality risks by 10 in 10,000 is only 1.15 times the WTP
for a risk reduction of 5 in 10,000.

Individuals living in riskier environments, with lower baseline survival rates and other kinds
of competing risks, may value health risks differently from those in less risky environments,
all else being equal. Eeckhoudt and Hammitt (2001) have shown that the higher level of
background mortality or competing financial risks faced by an individual, the lower the
WTP to reduce any one risk. If the competing risk is much larger than the target risk, the
result may be a “why bother?” effect (Eeckhoudt and Hammitt 2001, 274). Because the indi-
vidual is unlikely to survive the competing risk anyway, WTP to reduce a target risk may be
much lower. However, for smaller changes in baseline mortality rates, such as those com-
monly posed by competing environmental risk factors, the overall effect is usually negligible.
(See box 3.6.)



The Value per Statistical Life Year
In the United States and other OECD countries, the WTP-based approach using the VSL is the
standard method for monetizing the economic costs of premature mortality (WHO-OECD
2015). An alternative approach, which is found in international practice, is to monetize pre-
mature mortality in the form of reduced life expectancy using a value per statistical life year

(VSLY) (Cropper and Khanna 2014).12 The VSLY is commonly used to value the cost of DALYs
or YLLs, while the VSL is used to monetize the number of statistical deaths. But the issue of
how the VSLY should be appropriately estimated is contentious.

In practice, the VSLY is usually derived by dividing the VSL by the discounted number of
years remaining in the average person’s expected lifespan (Cropper and Khanna 2014).
In  the World Bank’s 2013 study of pollution costs in India, for example, the discounted
remaining life expectancy for the average adult is assumed to be 7.5 years. Previously, in
the World Bank’s calculation of air pollution damages as part of adjusted net savings, it was
assumed to be 22 years. This method for deriving a constant VSLY implies that that
individuals’ WTP for mortality risk reductions, and hence the VSL, should decline propor-
­
tionally with age. As previously discussed in the section on age and the VSL, however,
this assumption is not borne out by empirical evidence, and there is little support for using
a single VSLY to value life years for people of all age groups (Aldy and Viscusi 2007;
Cropper and Khanna 2014; Hammitt 2013; Krupnick 2007; Morgan et al. 2007; NRC 2008;
Ryen and Svensson 2015; U.S. EPA 2014; Viscusi 2014). Valuing health impacts in the
form  of DALYs or YLL using a constant VSLY further implies that that the VSL should
decline proportionally with the state of an individual’s health. However, in comparing the
VSLY for smokers and nonsmokers, Viscusi and Hersch (2008) have found this not to be
the case. Smokers have similar VSLY values as nonsmokers despite generally being in
poorer health.

Relatively few studies have attempted to determine the VSLY empirically (OECD 2012).13
Desaigues and coauthors (2007, 2011) have produced two recent examples. The authors con-
ducted a contingent valuation study in nine European countries to estimate a policy-relevant
VSLY for the European Union as part of an European Commission–funded effort. In the sur-
vey, adult respondents were asked about hypothetical air pollution control measures that
would lead to small gains in life expectancy of three to six months but would also increase the
cost of living. As explained to respondents, this gain in life expectancy does not mean “addi-
tional months of misery at the end of one’s life” (Desaigues et al. 2011, 905); rather it is more
like decelerated aging. The authors argue that these marginal changes in life expectancy are
easier to understand and provide better results than asking respondents about small reduc-
tions in the probability of dying (see also Morris and Hammitt 2001). The results indicate an
appropriate VSLY for cost-benefit analysis of air pollution policies in the EU-25 of around
€40,000, with a confidence interval of €25,000 to €100,000 (PPP-adjusted, year 2005 prices).14
The authors find that respondents’ WTP for marginal gains in life expectancy did not vary
significantly by age.

The VSLY estimated by the Desaigues et al. study is below the range of values that has been
used by the EC DG Environment elsewhere for cost-benefit analysis of environmental poli-
cies. Analyses of the Clean Air for Europe Programme (CAFE) and the EU Clean Air Package
have employed a base VSLY of €59,000 to €133,000 (PPP-adjusted, year 2005 prices) (Hurley
et al. 2005; Holland 2014).15 The lower and upper values of this range correspond to the
median and mean VSLY from a three-country study in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom
by Alberini, Hunt, and Markandya (2004, 2006), adjusted for price inflation. This study
employed a survey instrument similar to that originally developed by Alberini, Krupnick,
and others in the United States and Canada (see Alberini et al. 2004 and Krupnick et al. 2002).

In the survey, respondents were asked about their WTP for marginal reductions in fatality
risks over the next 10 years. Alberini, Hunt, and Markandya then computed the VSLY by
dividing respondents’ WTP by the gain in life expectancy implied by an annual risk reduction
of 5 in 10,000. In other words, respondents were not asked directly about how they valued life
expectancy. Gains in life expectancy were calculated using the life tables for the three coun-
tries. To gauge whether there was a difference between the life tables and subjective percep-
tions of remaining life expectancy, the authors also asked respondents to self-assess their
remaining life expectancy. Using this subjective measure of life expectancy, the median and
mean values for the VSLY are just slightly higher at €62,000 and €151,000 (PPP-adjusted, year
2005 prices).16 The authors also find the VSLY increases with age, peaking among 60- to
69-year-olds before declining thereafter. The median and mean VSL calculated from the
sample for an annual risk reduction of 5 in 10,000 are €1.122 million and €2.414 million
­
(PPP-adjusted, year 2005 prices).17

Use of the VSLY to monetize YLLs introduces additional uncertainties into the analysis.18 One
issue is whether individuals who are more susceptible to pollution-related illnesses have the
same life expectancy as the general population. The presence of co-morbid conditions and
multiple hazards may further complicate matters. An individual’s life expectancy could be
influenced by any number of shocks to the individual’s survival curve, both now and into the
future (Hammitt 2007; Jones-Lee et al 2015).

Another issue with applying the VSLY to monetize YLLs is the implicit rate of discount with
respect to remaining life expectancy. Moore and Viscusi (1990) estimate discount rates for
deferred health losses and health benefits in the range of 1–14 percent using labor market data,
and Dreyfus and Viscusi (1995) estimate a higher range of 11–17 percent by looking at prices
paid for cars with higher fuel efficiency and better safety features. The rate of time preference
may vary with individual characteristics, such as education level and state of health (Scharff
and Viscusi 2011). Jones-Lee and coauthors (2015) point out the importance of ensuring con-
sistency between the discount rate used to calculate health impacts (YLLs or DALYs) and the
rate used to discount life expectancy in deriving the VSLY from the VSL.

Finally, there is the question of when the undiscounted VSLY should be allowed to vary for
YLLs suffered by people of different ages and at different periods of time. Whereas the study
by Desaigues and coauthors (2011) did not find significant variation of WTP for extended
life expectancy among adults of different ages, the study by Alberini, Hunt, and Markandya
(2004, 2006) estimated an age-varying VSLY for adults over age 40. As noted, the literature
on the relationship between WTP for mortality risk reductions is inconclusive, though there
is some evidence that WTP may decline only late in life. This situation would also suggest
that the adult VSLY should increase with age. To that effect, the U.S. EPA had previously
used a two-tiered VSLY of US$163,000 and US$258,000 (year 1999 prices) for people ages
65 and below and for people over age 65, respectively, to evaluate the benefits of the Clear
Skies Initiative (U.S. EPA 2002, 36). The U.S. OMB has also recommended that the VSLY be
allowed to increase with age (U.S. OMB 2003), though it has not said how this should be
done. The European Commission’s cost-benefit analyses of Europe’s air pollution control
strategies assume an age-invariant VSLY and VSL (Hurley et al. 2005; Holland 2014). They
also make no adjustment to the undiscounted base VSLY for YLLs lost in future periods.

  Box 3.7  Question: Should the Value of Statistical Life or Value per
  Statistical Life Year Be Applied in Monetizing Premature Mortality
  Costs? How Should the Value Per Statistical Life Be Estimated?

  Proposal: The choice between using VSL versus VSLY depends in part on the metric of health
  impacts being used. The VSL is used for valuing the number of deaths and the VSLY is used for
  valuing YLLs or reduced life expectancy. As noted, this study will value both deaths and effects on
  life expectancy, so both the VSL and VSLY will be used.

  The empirical basis for estimating the VSLY from WTP for gains in life expectancy is less devel-
  oped, and there are fewer studies from which to derive a base value for the VSLY than there are
  for the VSL. Although it is common practice to derive the VSLY from the VSL by dividing the VSL
  by average remaining life expectancy, this practice is not really consistent with the empirical lit-
  erature on mortality risks and on the levels at which adults of different ages value risk reductions.

  Because no basis of evidence is robust enough to determine how WTP for gains in life expectancy
  varies with age, for the purposes of this study a constant VSLY will be used. This is common prac-
  tice in the literature and in policy analysis using the VSLY. Also, given the limited guidance from
  the literature, a range of VSLY values will be used (1) from the Desaigues et al. study, (2) from the
  Alberini et al. study, and (3) by deriving the VSLY indirectly from the VSL (see the next section
  for choice of VSL and box 3.8 for details). For country-level analysis, if the VSLY is used, choices
  about such issues as a relevant base value, discounting, and adjusting the VSLY for age should be
  made in consultation with local stakeholders.




Base Value of Statistical Life Estimates for
Policy Analysis
Table 3.1 illustrates guideline values for the VSL that have been used by public agencies in
different countries and regions for policy analysis. In the table, all amounts have been con-
verted into PPP-adjusted U.S. dollars at year 2011 prices. The VSL estimates in the table are
                                                                                     ­ onsumer
first adjusted for inflation to 2011 prices in local currency units according to the c
price index (CPI) in the respective country or region and then converted to U.S. dollars at
purchasing power parity (PPP) using exchange rates for 2011 based on actual individual con-
sumption (AIC) (Lindhjem et al. 2011; OECD 2012). Most of the agencies in the developing
countries listed in table 3.1 have derived VSL estimates for policy analysis by transferring
values from studies performed in other countries, mainly the United States.

Table 3.2 shows estimates of the VSL from stated-preference studies in middle-income coun-
tries, drawing primarily from the database assembled by the OECD (see Lindhjem et al. 2011).
Table 3.3 shows highlighted VSL estimates from meta-analyses of stated-preference studies.
The review by Kochi and coauthors (2006) only included studies from high-income countries,
whereas the analyses by Dekker and coauthors (2011) and Lindhjem and coauthors (2011)
include studies from a number of middle-income countries such as China, Malaysia, and
Thailand. The WTP studies in the meta-analyses are for environmental, traffic-related, and
general health risks. Table 3.4 provides a more detailed breakdown of descriptive statistics for

Only a few governments have set guidelines for baseline estimates of the VSLY (Table 3.5). As
noted, the EC DG Environment uses a range of €59,000 to €133,000 (PPP-adjusted, year 2005
prices) (Hurley et al. 2005; Holland 2014). The United Kingdom recommends a VSLY of
£35,000 for chronic mortality and £18,000 for acute mortality in evaluating the costs and ben-
efits of air pollution regulations (2012 prices) (U.K. Defra 2007, 2013). The U.K. values are
drawn from a domestic survey by Chilton and coauthors (2004),19 which asked respondents
about their WTP for gains in life expectancy of one, three, and six months in “poor” versus
“good” health. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance recommends a VSLY of NKr 425,000 (year
2005 prices) (cited in OECD 2012, 29). Best-practice guidelines by the Australian government

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                                                         27
  Box 3.8  Question: What Base Value of Statistical Life and Value
  per Statistical Life Year Values Should Be Used?

  Proposal: The choice of base value of statistical life (VSL) depends on the risk and context being
  evaluated. Ideally, a global assessment of premature mortality costs in different countries would
  use empirically estimated VSLs from those countries. However, studies on willingness to pay
  for mortality risk reductions are still lacking in many countries, so this approach is not feasible.
  Instead, for the World Bank–IHME report, the mean VSL estimate from the quality-screened
  sample of studies in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) coun-
  tries that pass some form of a scope test for internal or external consistency will be used as a base
  value: US$3.83 million (2011 U.S. dollars, purchasing power parity) (see table 3.4). For sensitivity
  analysis, a range of base VSL estimates from the distribution of stated-preference study estimates
  in different countries will be tested.

  For deriving the base value per statistical life year from the base VSL in the World Bank–IHME
  report, the VSL estimates in the database of stated-preference studies are divided by remaining
  life expectancy for the study population. Table 3.10 provides descriptive statistics for the subsam-
  ple of stated-preference studies from OECD countries for which the average age of respondents
  is reported. The mean VSL for the subsample is US$3.5 million (2011 U.S. dollars, purchasing
  power parity), which is slightly lower than the mean VSL for the larger sample. Associated gross
  domestic product per capita for the surveys and countries included in the subsample of OECD
  country studies is US$37,350. Respondents in this subsample are 50 years old on average, with
  a remaining life expectancy of 33 years. Discounting remaining life expectancy by an annual
  rate of 4 percent would imply that the VSLY is US$189,706. As noted, empirical studies provide
  little support for deriving the VSLY in this way, but it is nevertheless common practice and so is
  repeated in the World Bank–IHME report solely for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.


highlight the usefulness of the VSLY in evaluating policies that are designed to prevent injuries
and disease that are not immediately fatal and suggest adjusting the VSLY to monetize nonfa-
tal conditions using disability weights (Australia OBPR 2014; Australia ASCC 2008). Australia’s
guideline value for the VSLY for use in policy analysis is $A 182,000 (2014 prices). The U.S.
OMB has also advised government agencies to present both VSL and VSLY-based estimates
when valuing mortality risks (U.S. OMB 2003); however, no U.S. agency currently stipulates a
guideline value for the VSLY. (See box 3.8.)



Transferring Base Estimates Of The Value Of Statistical
Life To Value Health Impacts In Other Countries
VSL values are often transferred from the context in which they were originally estimated to a
new context for policy analysis where it may be either impractical or cost-prohibitive to con-
duct a WTP study. This approach is called benefit transfer. This section discusses two approaches
to benefit transfer: unit value transfer and function-based transfer.

Unit Value Transfer
A common method for benefit transfer (BT) is unit value transfer, which involves taking
an estimate from one study or an average value from several studies and applying it directly

28	                                         Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
to the policy context. The OECD recommends this method “as the simplest and most trans-
parent way of transfer between countries” (OECD 2012, 118). Unit value transfer assumes
that individuals in the study context and policy setting have similar tastes and characteris-
tics and that the type of risk being valued is the same, yielding a similar utility for mar-
ginal  risk reductions (OECD 2012; U.S. EPA 2014). To capture population differences
between the study and policy setting, the transferred VSL may be adjusted for salient char-
acteristics such as per capita income. Use of the method thus requires discretion on the
part of the analyst in screening high-quality studies for transfer and making appropri-
ate adjustments for the policy case. Under these conditions, unit value transfer can be as
accurate as more complex meta-regression analyses and other methods (Lindhjem and
Navrud 2015).

Recent analyses by the OECD have relied on unit value transfer in estimating country-specific
VSLs to assess the public health costs of air pollution in Europe, China, and India (OECD
2014; WHO-OECD 2015). The authors begin by selecting a base VSL of about US$3 million
(year 2005, PPP), the median VSL from a quality-screened sample of VSL estimates from
studies in OECD countries analyzed by Lindhjem and coauthors (2011).20 They then make
­
the  following adjustment for cross-sectional differences in income between countries and
post-2005 growth:

                                                            b
                                                  Y           
                    VSLc ,2010 = VSLOECD ,2005 ×  c ,2005  × (1 + %ΔP + %ΔY )b
                                                  YOECD ,2005 


where VSLc,2010 is the VSL for country C in 2010; VSLOECD,2005 is the base value (VSL for OECD
countries in 2005); Y is GDP per capita (in PPP terms); b is the income elasticity of the VSL,
assumed by the authors to be 0.8, the midpoint of the best estimate of 0.7–0.9 (OECD 2012);
%DP represents price inflation, as estimated by the consumer price index; and %DY is post-
2005 income growth. Several studies by the World Bank have also used VSL estimates derived
from such a method, including analyses of Ecuador (Sander, Mira-Salama, and Feuerbacher
2015), Georgia (World Bank 2015b), and Nicaragua (Klytchnikova et al. 2013). In the Ecuador
and Georgia examples, the base VSL estimated for OECD countries is transferred to the policy
context assuming the same income elasticity of 0.8. The Nicaragua example uses a lower and
upper base VSL from two other meta-analyses, which is transferred assuming an income elas-
ticity of unity (1.0).


Function-Based Transfer
Another method commonly used for BT is function-based transfer, which proposes that the
WTP may be described as a function of quantifiable characteristics in the study case and trans-
ferred to the policy case using the estimated function. This method is demonstrated in a recent
COED study of Kosovo by the World Bank (2013c), which applies a BT function derived from
the meta-regression analysis of the OECD’s VSL database by Biausque (2012).21 The VSL is
formulated as

                                     VSL = 1.044 · Y1.022 · r−0.445

Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution	                                29
 where Y is per capita GDP (in PPP terms, as above), and r is the change in risk mortality. For
 the Kosovo example, an annual change in risk mortality of 1 in 10,000 is assumed. A similar
 analysis by the World Bank of the costs of air pollution in Argentina uses the same func-
 tional form to specify the VSL but presents a range of VSLs assuming different rates of annual
 change in mortality risks, from 1 in 10,000 to 5 in 10,000. Note that the BT function used by
 the World Bank in its assessments of Kosovo and Argentina assumes that the VSL is
 income-elastic, unlike studies done by the World Bank in other middle-income countries
 that have used a lower elasticity. This difference implies that the WTP for mortality risk
 reductions when compared as a percentage of income is lower for people in Kosovo and
 Argentina than it is for those in Georgia, for example, where an elasticity coefficient of 0.8 is
 assumed. The BT function proposed in the Biausque (2012) meta-analysis is illustrated
 graphically in figure 3.2.

 In their meta-analysis, Milligan and coauthors (2014) tailor a BT function specifically for
 low-income and middle-income countries. The function’s parameters are estimated using
 the OECD database of quality-screened VSL estimates from stated-preference studies,22
 with some additional observations from middle-income and high-income countries (India,
 Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Sweden, and the United States). Including observations from
 all income levels (n = 410), they estimate an income elasticity of 0.6. Restricting the sample

to only lower-middle and middle income countries (n = 152), they calculate a much higher
elasticity of 2.5. Although Milligan and coauthors (2014) specify the BT function in the
context of evaluating road safety, the VSL estimates they use from the OECD database are
also taken from environmental and health-related studies. The BT functions they estimate
for road safety are:

                                  VSLT,HIC= 67.088 · Y 0.693 · r−0.481
                                 VSLT,LMC = 2.226 · 10−7 · Y 2.478 · r −0.698

Where VSLT,HIC is the transferred VSL for traffic safety in high-income countries, VSLT,LMC
is the transferred VSL for low-income and middle-income countries, Y is GDP per capita
(at PPP exchange rates), and r is the change in risk mortality. Milligan and coauthors
assume a  threshold of US$14,000 (PPP-adjusted, 2005 prices) for GDP per capita in
high-income countries. In tailoring the BT function for road safety, they set r equal to one-
half the crude death rate for traffic accidents in high-income countries and developing
countries. Using data for 2011 from the WHO, they estimate the rate of traffic fatalities at
9.0 and 19.9 per 100,000 people in high-income countries and developing countries,
respectively (cited in Milligan et al. 2014, 245). Inserting the assumed r values, the authors
simplify the BT functions as

                                   VSLT,HIC = 8.2474 · 103 · Y 0.693
                                  VSLT,LMC = 1.3732 · 10−4 · Y 2.478

Milligan and coauthors suggest that the BT function can be adjusted to value environmental
and health-related risks in the same way (Milligan et al. 2014, 246). Re-estimating the BT
functions for contemporaneous reductions in noncancer fatality risks related to general
health using the VSL estimates from the OECD database and additional studies summarized
in table 3.4 yields

                                  VSLHIC = 933.555 · Y 0.729 · r−0.088
                                 VSLLMC = 0.058 · Y 1.792 · r −0.022

According to the GBD 2013 data, fatality rates in 2013 attributed to ambient PM2.5 exposure
were 47 and 56 deaths per 100,000 people in high-income countries and developing countries,
respectively. Assuming a baseline risk reduction equal to half the crude mortality rate, as done
by Milligan and coauthors, simplifies the BT functions this way:

                                     VSLHIC = 1,947.645 · Y 0.729
                                    VSLLMC = 0.069 · Y 1.792

Figure 3.3 illustrates the estimated VSLs transferred using the piece-wise BT functions for
countries of different income levels, along with the BT function estimated by Biausque. For the
Biausque function, annual risk changes of 1.0 in 10,000, 2.5 in 10,000, and 5.0 in 10,000 are
assumed.

  Credibility Testing
  The fact that fewer empirical studies of the VSL have been done in low-income and middle-­
  income countries raises questions about the credibility of the VSL when it is transferred
  between countries with large differences in average income and vastly disparate social ­contexts.
  Although there is little empirical basis for judging the reasonableness of the transferred VSL
  where in-country studies are lacking, several rule-of-thumb methods have been proposed.

  One method is to benchmark the VSL against GDP per capita. The International Road
  Assessment Programme (IRAP) and World Bank have recommended this method to estimate
  a rough VSL for the purpose of assessing traffic safety benefits. The logic behind comparing the
  VSL to GDP per capita stems from the relationship commonly assumed in BT functions such
  that differences in the VSL are proportional to income differences:

                                                                   VSLtransfer = VSLstudy * (Ytransfer /Ystudy)

  32	                                                                          Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
where transfer denotes the country for which the VSL is being transferred, study refers to the
study context from which the original base value is estimated, and Y is GDP per capita. The
function implies

                                  VSLstudy /Ystudy = VSLtransfer /Ytransfer.

Cropper and Sahin (2009) suggest that a reasonable VSL/Y ratio for middle-income coun-
tries is 80:1. IRAP and the World Bank employ a value of 70 times GDP per capita (Dahdah
and McMahon 2008). Larsen (2015) suggests a lower ratio of 50:1 for low-income and
middle-income countries. By comparison, Miller (2000) has reported a ratio of 120:1 from
a meta-analysis of WTP studies in 13 high-income countries. The VSL/Y ratio reported by
Miller is more or less in line with the average ratio for the stated-preference studies from
OECD countries shown in table 3.4, which is between 102:1 and 116:1. The average ratio
for VSL estimates from stated preference countries in middle-income countries in table 3.4
is between 55:1 and 76:1.23 The difference in means between the VSL/Y ratios of middle-
and high-income countries is statistically significant,24 further suggesting that the income
elasticity of the VSL is higher in the poorer countries than in the richer countries included
in the database of studies.

Figure 3.4 illustrates the spread of VSL/Y ratios for countries in different income groups for
different assumed values of e using the chosen base VSL for the World Bank–IHME report:
US$3.8 million (2011 US$, PPP). Average GDP per capita associated with this base value is
about US$37,000 (2011 US$, PPP). Each observation in figure 3.4 represents a country and
year for which the VSL is transferred. The distribution for e = 1 is not shown in the figure
because when this elasticity is assumed, the ratio of VSL to Y is the same for all countries
regardless of income (104:1). As figure 3.4 shows, values of e below 1 imply that the ratio of the
VSL to Y is larger for poorer countries than for richer ones. The opposite is true for elasticities
that are higher than 1. The ratio of the VSL to Y is lower for poorer countries, as seen with the
VSL/Y ratios in the stated preference studies in table 3.4. The resulting VSL/Y ratios for differ-
ent values of e are summarized in table 3.6.

As an alternative to benchmarking the VSL against GDP per capita, Hammitt and Robinson
(2011) have suggested comparing the VSL to expected lifetime income and consumption. The
authors take this approach to test the assumption that the income elasticity is above 1 in trans-
ferring VSL estimates from studies in high-income countries to low-income countries in
Africa. Their approach is guided by the economic theory behind the VSL, which tells us that
the amount individuals are willing to pay to reduce their risk of dying should reflect the utility
they will experience over their remaining lifetimes. The level of utility, in turn, depends on
such factors as age, life expectancy, survival probability, and their level of consumption.25
From a simple point of view, how much individuals can consume is typically limited by their
earnings.26 This implies that the VSL should be at least the discounted present value of future
income and consumption.

In table 3.7, transferred VSL estimates using a range of values for e are compared to the value
of future income. The present value of labor income is discounted over the remaining working
life for the average adult between the ages of 15 and 69. Remaining working life takes into
account survival probabilities and labor participation rates for adults of different ages. As with

Tables 3.8 and 3.9 illustrate how the estimates of VSLs for different countries and years ­ compare
with the present value of future consumption for the average adult between the ages of 40 and 44
and 45 and 49. These age groups correspond with the median ages of survey respondents in
­
middle-income and high-income countries, respectively, in the OECD database of VSL studies
(see table 3.10). Life expectancy for respondents in the year of survey is estimated using data from
the GBD 2013. On average, survey respondents had a remaining life expectancy of 33–36 years.

Note: Base VSL of US$3.8 million and GDP per capita of US$37,000 are assumed (2011 US$, PPP); Remaining lifetime consumption
is estimated assuming constant per capita consumption in real terms, discounted into the future at a rate of 4 percent per year
for high-income countries and 6 percent per year for low-income and middle-income countries; table made of a balanced sample
of countries for which data are available for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013; each observation is a country and year.
VSL = value of statistical life.




By comparison, life expectancy for the average adult ages 40–44 in the low-income countries was
32 years in 2013. Conservatively, in comparing the ratio of the VSL with future consumption in
the tables, real consumption per capita is assumed to be constant and is discounted into the
future at a rate of 4 percent for high-income countries and 6 percent for low-income and
­middle-income countries.

For the World Bank–IHME report, in which a base VSL of US$3.8 million and GDP per
capita of around US$37,000 (2011 US$, PPP) is assumed, the tables demonstrate that apply-
ing income elasticity values of 1 or lower may lead to VSL/Y ratios in low-income and
middle-income countries beyond those observed in stated preference studies to date. At the
­
same time, elasticity values of 1.4 or greater would result in VSL estimates that are lower than
the expected future earnings for the average working adult in the majority of low-income
countries and years. For elasticity values of 1.6 or greater, the present value of future
consumption for adults between the ages of 40 and 49 would exceed the VSL in about
­
­one-third of low-income countries in 2013. Elasticity values of 1.6 or greater would also cause
 expected future earnings to be greater than the estimated VSL for the majority of lower-­
 middle income countries.27

In figure 3.5, transferred VSLs using the base VSL for the World Bank–IHME report and the
range of elasticity values for middle-income countries are compared with the empirical esti-
mates of the VSL in the database of stated preference studies (see table 3.4). As figure 3.5
shows, the empirically estimated VSL is within the range of transferred VSLs for half of the
studies in the database. GDP per capita in these countries ranges from US$3,419 (China in
1999) to US$17,864 (Malaysia in 2004). However, the range of transferred VSLs is still above
the empirical estimates for the two poorest countries, Bangladesh in 2003 and India in 2005,
with GDP per capita of US$1,781 and US$3,213, respectively. The average transfer error is
smallest when the central elasticity value of 1.2 is assumed.

Choice of Exchange Rate
Transferring the VSL by comparing GDP per capita in the study country with the policy
­country, the choice of exchange rate is particularly important. In general, VSL estimates in local
 currency units are converted into US$ at PPP rates rather than market exchange rates in
 making comparisons between countries because PPP rates are a better reflection of opportu-
 ­
 nity costs in the economy (Krupnick, Hoffmann, and Qin 2010, 23). However, as Cropper and
 Khanna (2014) note in their review of the World Bank’s methodology for calculating air pollu-
 tion damages, if health costs are reported as a percentage of GNI—as they are in the World
 Bank’s adjusted net savings database—and GNI is measured at market exchange rates, then the
 estimated VSL should be transferred using market rates, too. Also, for economic analysis of
 pollution reduction projects and policies, benefits and costs should be estimated on the same
 basis using either the PPP or market exchange rate. Although the benefits of pollution reduc-
 tion policies in terms of avoided health impacts are typically monetized on a PPP basis, it is
 more common to report costs at market exchange rates, leading to potential inconsistencies
 when calculating net benefits over costs. (See box 3.9.)

   Box 3.9  Question: How Should the Base Value of Statistical Life
   Be Transferred between Countries?

   Proposal: Country-specific values of statistical life (VSLs) may be derived from a base VSL
   following two methods: (1) a simple unit-value transfer adjusting for cross-sectional dif-
   ferences in income, price inflation, and growth over time; and (2) a function-based trans-
   fer, with  parameters estimated from a meta-regression analysis using the Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development database, as in figure 3.2. For the unit value trans-
   fer, and as previously discussed, a range of income elasticities should be used for the sensitivity
   analysis. For each country, the ratio of the estimated VSL to gross domestic product (GDP) or
   expected lifetime income should also be used as a benchmark to judge the reasonableness of
   the VSL.

   Unit-value transfer has the advantage of being the most straightforward transfer method, though
   it requires stricter assumptions about the comparability of individual tastes and characteristics in
   the study context versus the policy setting and about the nature of the risk being valued. It is the
   method that will be applied for the global assessment, assuming the range of income elasticity val-
   ues previously noted (0.6–1.0 for high-income countries, with a central value of 0.8, and 1.0–1.4
   for low-income and middle-income countries, with a central value of 1.2). Function-based trans-
   fers, on the other hand, may be highly sensitive to how the function is specified and to what vari-
   ables are included. Re-estimating a base VSL or transfer function may be too time intensive and
   burdensome for individual project analysis. If functions from other analyses or contexts are used,
   they should be carefully examined and compared to rule-of-thumb measures such as the ratio of
   the estimated VSL to GDP to judge their reliability.

   For the purposes of valuing the global burden of disease associated with air pollution, transferring
   the base VSL at PPP rates is appropriate for cross-country comparisons. For cost-benefit analy-
   sis of specific projects or policies to reduce pollution, however, using market rates may be more
   appropriate for the calculation of net benefits. This is because costs are usually taken at market
   rates, so the monetary basis for comparing costs and benefits should be consistent.




Implementing the Forgone Output Approach
The following section discusses some of the practical issues in implementing a forgone
labor output approach for the financial accounting of pollution health costs, including defin-
ing the workforce, valuing child mortality, and accounting for future income growth.
Under this approach, the expected loss of income for the average person in each age group
is typically valued as

                                                 T
                                     PV (I ) =   ∑ I (1 + g )i /(1+ r )i
                                                 i =0



where I is average per capita labor income in the present year; T is the expected number of
working years for the average person in a particular age group (conditional on survival prob-
abilities and labor force participation rates); g is the annual rate of income growth; and r is the
social discount rate. Ideally, I would be differentiated by age groups, as people of different ages

may have varying levels of education, experience, and other characteristics that affect their
average earning potential. However, a lack of detailed wage data in many countries does not
allow for this level of disaggregation as part of a global assessment.


Defining the Workforce
For the sake of convenience, in estimating forgone labor output, one typically assumes
working age to be 15–64 for cross-country analyses.28 Defining the scope of the workforce in
­
this way excludes the contribution of persons aged 65 and over to the economy. According to
data from the International Labor Organization (ILO), about 25 percent of the population
ages 65 and over in middle-income countries were economically active in 2013. For low-​
income countries, the figure was even higher, around 56 percent.29 As noted, the 65-and-over
population suffers a disproportionate share of health impacts from pollution. Out of con-
cerns for equity, analysts may use an adjusted form of the FO approach that values YLLs
among the 65-and-over population using the economywide average for GDP per capita, as is
often done in countries such as China. However, this practice does not really capture the
value of lost income or reduced labor productivity in the economy and would be contrary to
the purposes of financial accounting for the ANS indicator, for which the FO approach is
proposed. Also, although retired people contribute to the economy as consumers of goods
and services, these sorts of losses beyond the individual’s time endowment are outside the
scope of the FO approach.


Working Life Expectancy
Working life expectancy, T, may be calculated by adjusting life expectancy during working age
by the probability that an individual will be active in the labor force:

                                                  M
                                        Tj =     ∑        s j ,t ⋅ t − 1
                                               t = j +1


where sj,t is the probability that a person of age j will survive to the beginning of age t; is the
labor force participation rate;30 and M is the end of working age. Survival probabilities, s, may
be calculated from mean death rates as

                                s j ,t = (1 − d j )(1 − d j +1 )...(1 − dt −1 )

                                         sj,t = sj · sj+1 · … · st-1


where dj is the portion of individuals alive at the beginning of year j who die during that year,
and the probability of survival is 1 – d.

The calculation of T is done recursively, starting with the oldest age group. For example, if
maximum working age is assumed to be 79, (such that all individuals stop working once
they turn 80)

                                             T79 = s79,80 · ℓ 79

40	                                          Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
                        80
               T78 =    ∑ s78,t ⋅    t −1   = s78,79 ⋅ 78 + s78,80 ⋅ 79 = s78,79 ( 78 + T79 )
                       t = 79


                                                T15 = s15,16 (ℓ15 + T16)

Because working age is typically assumed to begin at 15, children represent a special case.
Using ages 13 and 14 as an example, T would be

                             80
                  T14 =      ∑ s14,t ⋅   t −1   = s14,15 ⋅ s15,16 ( 15 + T16 ) = (s14,15 ⋅T15 )
                          t = 16


                                                 80
                                    T13 =       ∑ s13,t ⋅   t −1   = s13,14 ⋅T14
                                                t =16


Of course, not all individuals begin working as soon as they are 15, and not all individuals will
work until they are 80. Weighting T by labor force participation is one way of accounting for
variation in the demographic makeup of the labor force, including delayed entry until later age
and retirement.

Workforce participation rates vary widely by region, and there is longstanding evidence that
participation by women is frequently underestimated (see Boserup 1970; Benería 1982, 1992;
Benería, Berik, and Floro 2015). Low participation rates among women are the main reason
that overall participation rates for both sexes in some regions are much lower than in others.
These estimates of labor force participation by the ILO are based on reported rates in nation-
ally representative labor force surveys and population censuses. Over the past decades, the
statistical definition of employment used in these surveys has expanded to account for greater
diversity in the way in which people work, and data collection has greatly improved. However,
labor force statistics are still prone to measurement error, particularly in capturing work by
people in the informal sector. In countries with high levels of informality in the labor market,
this measurement bias particularly affects women, whose work may be intermittent, tempo-
rary, short term, or home based and who may have multiple work arrangements, such as car-
ing for children as well as engaging in market activities. Also, although international standards
for employment and labor force statistics have evolved to be more inclusive, definitions and
reporting by agencies in different countries vary.

Hirway and Jose (2011) provide evidence of the potential magnitude of bias in the labor force
participation statistics for India. According to data from India’s national labor force survey of
1999–2000, only 25 percent of rural women and 13 percent of urban women were active in the
workforce in the states of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, and
Meghalaya. By comparison, 51 percent of men in rural and urban areas were estimated to be
active. However, using data from a large-scale time-use survey from 1998 to 1999 in these
states, Hirway and Jose take advantage of more detailed information about how people spend
their time and to accurately distinguish between work and nonwork. With these data, they
find that 58 percent of rural women and 31 percent of urban women were actually active in the

  be much smaller than reflected in labor force survey and population census data. To illustrate
  the size of this gap in the ILO estimates of participation using labor force survey and popula-
  tion census data, average rates of participation for men and women in South Asia in 2013 are
  shown in figure 3.6.

  By lowering working life expectancy, gender bias in the labor force participation data would
  bias the overall estimates of forgone labor output due to air pollution exposure. This oversight
  would suggest that women are much less productive and would, in effect, assume zero loss of
  income for a large share of the working-age population that no doubt contributes to the econ-
  omy. On the flip side, failing to account for labor force participation rates as part of working
  life expectancy would lead to overestimates of forgone labor output by assuming that all indi-
  viduals will work from the moment they turn 15 until they are 79, as long as they are still alive.

  Faced with this dilemma, a reasonable compromise is to assume that estimated rates of labor
  force participation for men apply to both men and women. This option addresses concerns
  about gender bias in the labor force participation data while also accounting for varying work
  life patterns between countries. Indeed, there is precedence for this approach in the real world,
  and courts have sometimes assumed the average working life of men in calculating the lost
  earnings capacity of women. For example, in establishing a special fund for the victims of the
  9/11 attacks, the U.S. Justice Department used the average working life of men to determine

   compensation amounts for both men and women “to avoid gender bias … and to ensure
   consistency” (Feinberg 2004). Adopting this approach for a global assessment of forgone
   ­
   labor output would imply labor force participation rates for the general population such as
   those illustrated in figure 3.7. (See box 3.10.)

   Child Mortality
   In previous COED studies by the World Bank, the forgone output approach has been used to
   value of the cost of child mortality by taking the present value of wages beginning 10 or 15
   years in the future, when those children would be expected to enter the workforce.31 As Larsen
   (2015) has argued, this approach assumes zero replacement of lost children, an approach
   which may be inconsistent with actual household decision making and family planning, par-
   ticularly in countries with high baseline rates of child mortality. Families in these settings may
   take into account higher levels of health risk when planning the desired number of children in
   their households, especially if death occurs at a very young age. If this is the case, the actual
   loss in terms of labor productivity would be less than predicted. Furthermore, because the
   majority of YLLs among children are suffered in countries with higher rates of solid fuel use

  Box 3.10  Question: How Should the Workforce and Working Life
  Be Defined?

  Proposal: Defining working age as 15–64 is arbitrary. Excluding the population ages 65 and
  over can be avoided by accounting for country-specific labor force participation rates among the
  elderly conditional on survival probability when specifying T. This approach is seen in the eco-
  nomic literature on human capital accounting. (See the United Nations University International
  Human Dimensions Programme on Environmental Change and United Nations Environment
  Programme estimates of human capital for the Inclusive Wealth Report 2014, for example.)
  However, although the International Labor Organization provides data on labor force participa-
  tion among the population ages 65 and over in 185 countries, there are no comparable data on
  average retirement age for the subset of the older population that is economically active. Although
  this makes it difficult to avoid imposing an arbitrary cap on maximum working age altogether,
  given the high rates of labor participation among older persons in low-income and medium-­
  income countries, a compromise would be to raise the maximum age to 79 and to discount work-
  ing life expectancy for labor participation.

  On grounds of equity, an analysis could alternatively value years of life lost at gross domestic
  product per capita for people of all ages. Though simpler to implement, strictly speaking this
  alternative approach would represent a departure from an income-based measure of forgone
  output for financial accounting purposes.
  ­

  Adjusting life expectancy by rates of labor force participation introduces possible bias in the esti-
  mates of forgone labor output for regions where workforce participation by women is underre-
  ported. The possibility of bias in the labor statistics is especially a problem in contexts in which
  women tend to work outside the formal labor market. For the global assessment in the World
  Bank–IHME report, a compromise approach is taken by assuming the same rates of labor force
  participation for both men and women.




  Box 3.11  Question: How Should Deaths among Children Be
  Valued under the Forgone Output Approach?

  Proposal: As done in previous cost of environmental degradation studies, for this study the pres-
  ent value of forgone income among children will be calculated by discounting average wages into
  the future, assuming that working age begins at 15. Again, although this definition of the start of
  working age is somewhat arbitrary, it is conventional practice. The term T may be conditioned
  on survival probability and average working-life expectancy for persons in each age group, to
  avoid overstating damages in countries with high baseline rates of child mortality (and lower
  life expectancies). This has the same effect as discounting expected lifetime income for children
  more heavily into the future. At present, there is insufficient evidence to make any adjustments
  for household family planning decisions and child replacement rates, which might partially offset
  expected losses in labor output.

for cooking and a greater burden from household air pollution—and the average damage cost
for the loss of a child under the forgone output approach is significantly higher than that for
adults in their late 50s and 60s—this has the effect of amplifying damage estimates in low-­
income countries. (See box 3.11.)

Accounting for Income Growth
Currently, in the World Bank’s global estimates of air pollution damages for the ANS indicator, a
constant annual income growth rate of 2.5 percent is assumed for all countries and years.
Country-specific studies in fast-growing developing countries have used higher rates, for exam-
ple, 6–8 percent in the World Bank–SEPA study of pollution costs in China (2007). For the United
States, the U.S. EPA typically assumes an annual income growth rate of 1 percent. (box 3.12.)

Discount Rate
Related to the assumed rate of future income growth is the discount rate. In The Changing
Wealth of Nations, the World Bank estimates human capital for China using a lifetime income
approach and sets the discount rate of 8.26 percent (World Bank 2011). This rate is assumed
on the basis of the Ramsey formula:

                                                          C
                                               r = r +h
                                                          C

where the discount rate, r, is equal to the pure rate of time preference, ρ, plus the elasticity of
utility with respect to consumption. For the World Bank’s human capital accounts in China, the
pure rate of time preference is assumed to be 1.5 and utility is assumed to be iso-elastic with
respect to consumption (h = 1). With average annual growth in real annual per capita consump-
tion of 6.76 percent between 1970 and 2008, the social discount rate equals 8.26 percent (8.26 =
1.50 + 6.76). This is close to the discount rate of 8.5 percent assumed in the United Nations
University International Human Dimensions Programme on Environmental Change and United
Nations Environment Programme’s human capital accounts for the Inclusive Wealth Report (see
UNU-IHDP and UNEP 2012). However, for slower-growing economies, setting r at 8.5 percent
would be too high. For most assets included in the World Bank’s comprehensive wealth accounts
and ANS calculation, a social discount rate of 4 percent is chosen. (See box 3.13.)




   Box 3.12  Question: What Assumptions Should Be Made about
   Future Income Growth?

   Proposal: Under a forgone output approach, assuming a constant income growth rate of 2.5 percent
   may understate damages in fast-growing economies such as China and India. It may also overstate
   damages in high-income countries with lower rates of growth. Yet, any assumption about long-term
   income growth, especially in valuing health impacts among young people with long working-life
   expectancies, involves significant uncertainty. For the global assessment, and to the extent possible,
   a constant rate of 3 percent will be assumed for low-income and middle-­   income countries in keep-
   ing with recent guidance by the World Bank for estimating long-term rates of growth in project
   economic analysis. A growth rate of 2 percent will be assumed for high-income countries.

   for low-income and middle-income countries in keeping with recent guidance by the World Bank
   on setting social discount rates for project economic analysis. A rate of 4 percent will be assumed
   for high-income countries.




Notes
	1.	Neoclassical economic theory suggests that people’s WTP and WTA for nonmarket goods should
      be equal, but this is often not the case. The contrast suggests that people’s WTP and WTA are influ-
      enced by behavioral factors and by differences in the properties of welfare measures that depend on
      how public goods are provided (see Carson 2012 and Kling et al. 2012).

	 3.	 This claim is based on reviews of wage-risk studies and stated-preference studies in North America.
      In their review of the more recent literature, Robinson and Hammitt (2015) find that “high-quality”
      stated-preference studies tend to yield VSL estimates close to those from wage-risk studies.
	4.	 Similarly, in the literature on human capital accounting, the accumulation of human capital is often
      valued in terms of the expected gain in lifetime earnings potential due to higher levels of schooling
      among workers, following the approach first developed in the United States by Dale Jorgenson and
      Barbara Fraumeni (1992).

      2015 (Ecuador).
	6.	In contrast with the stated-preference studies, wage-risk studies have more consistently demon-
      strated an inverted U-shaped relationship between the VSL and age such that the VSL rises with age
      for younger workers, peaks for workers around the age of 50, and then declines (Aldy and Viscusi
      2007, 2008; Kniesner, Viscusi, and Ziliak 2006; Viscusi 2014). However, as noted, these wage-risk
      studies deal mainly with the working-age population in decent health considering occupational
      injuries rather than illness-related health risks, so they do not reflect the preferences of individuals
      across the broad swath of age groups affected by pollution, particularly the elderly.

4. Valuing Morbidity Costs
No standard method exists for monetizing the costs of nonfatal health outcomes (OECD
2014). Hunt and Ferguson (2010) propose that the economic cost of morbidity equals the sum
of the following:
••    Resource costs: direct financial costs for avoiding or protecting against exposure or for the
      care and treatment of pollution-associated illness;
••    Opportunity costs: indirect costs from the loss of time for work and leisure; and
••    Disutility costs: the cost of pain, suffering, discomfort, or inconvenience.

The difficulty in aggregating morbidity costs owes to the complex nature of nonfatal out-
comes, as noted by the WHO and OECD in their study of air pollution costs in Europe
(WHO-OECD 2015). Morbidity involves a plurality of health endpoints (lost work days,
hospital admissions, expenditures for long-term medical treatment, and so on) suffered by
a plurality of agents (the patient as well as the patient’s friends, family, coworkers, and so
on). This raises the possibility of double counting or inconsistency in cost estimation meth-
ods for different outcomes. Data may be missing on health expenditures and medical treat-
ment costs for a wide array of countries. Differences in health care systems between
countries—and how health care costs are allocated to patients, care providers, and the pub-
lic treasury—is also a problem. Finally, there are fewer studies of WTP to avoid different
kinds of illnesses and other medical conditions associated with pollution exposure than
there are of WTP to avoid mortality risk, so measuring disutility costs is more difficult.
Expressed WTP to avoid pain and suffering from illness may also be entangled with
other costs (such as expensive or lengthy medical treatment) that individuals associate with
conditions such as chronic bronchitis.

Hunt and coauthors (2016) have further proposed a core set of health endpoints that could
potentially be used to value the disutility, resource, and opportunity costs associated with air
pollution:
••    Respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions related to PM or ozone exposure
••    Restricted activity days and days of lost work due to PM and ozone exposure
••    Chronic bronchitis in adults due to PM exposure
••    Acute bronchitis in children ages 6 to 18 due to PM exposure
••    Acute lower respiratory illness in children ages 5 and under due to PM exposure

The common set of endpoints is the result of an extensive review of regulatory analysis in
Europe, the United States, and non-OECD countries such as China, as well as the GBD. Despite
this, Hunt and coauthors note that “the empirical evidence for these pollutant-health out-
comes remains limited” (Hunt et al. 2016, 5). Furthermore, some outcomes such as lost work-
days are “strongly socio-culturally determined” and “point to major uncertainties about
transferability” (Hunt et al. 2016, 39).

The question of the transferability is especially thorny. Because they are strongly influenced by
social context and are often measured in different ways, unit cost values for different morbidity



48	                                       Methodology for Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
endpoints vary widely, even among countries of similar income levels. For example, in their
review of the literature, Hunt and coauthors (2016) find that estimates of WTP to avoid chronic
bronchitis range from around US$40,000 to US$90,000 in European countries to US$880,000
to US$2.03 million in the United States. Hospital treatment costs for respiratory and cardio-
vascular conditions associated with air pollution range from US$1,500 to US$2,600 per case in
European countries and to US$20,000 to US$40,000 per case in the United States. Though
disutility costs represent the largest and arguably the most easily transferable component of
morbidity costs, it is unclear whether they can be transferred from one country to another in
the same way as the VSL.

Confronting these problems of measurement, the OECD has taken the pragmatic stance that
morbidity costs are at least greater than nothing and so can be estimated provisionally as a
small percentage of mortality costs (see OECD 2012 and 2014 and Hunt et al. 2016). As a
benchmark value, the OECD has proposed a 10 percent markup of mortality costs to account
for morbidity on the basis of the relative share of avoided morbidity costs in the total health
benefits of air pollution control as estimated in regulatory analyses by the U.S. EPA and EC DG
Environment. Whether this benchmark value holds for countries outside the OECD is ques-
tionable. As shown in table 3.6, previous studies by the World Bank in middle-income coun-
tries have estimated a wide range of morbidity costs. Studies in Nicaragua and China, for
instance, have found that morbidity costs may be as great as 44 percent of total health costs
(World Ban–SEPA 2007; Golub et al. 2014). However, because the studies included in table 4.1
take differing approaches to estimating morbidity costs, these figures are not really compara-
ble. (See box 4.1.)

  Box 4.1  Question: How Should Morbidity Costs Be Valued?

  Proposal: Standard approaches to measuring the costs of morbidity across countries are still in
  an early stage of development, and consistency is still lacking. The most common approach is to
  value resource and opportunity costs using country-specific data on medical treatment costs and
  wages. Disutility costs of nonfatal health outcomes are also sometimes valued in terms of years
  lived with disability (YLDs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using a value per statistical
  life year (VSLY), though issues with the use of YLDs and DALYs for economic valuation and the
  derivation of the VSLY remain.

  For the World Bank–IHME study, the goal is to provide estimates of the overall economic costs of
  the health burden from air pollution in countries around the world. As has been shown, nonfatal
  health outcomes represent a relatively small fraction of the total health burden. Because there is
  still no standard approach for valuing morbidity costs and gathering country-specific data on
  resource costs would be prohibitive, it may be reasonable for the World Bank–IHME study to
  exclude morbidity costs. Mortality costs may be presented with the caveat that total health costs
  including morbidity may be at least another 10 percent, on the basis of expert judgment and pre-
  vious studies by the World Bank and OECD.
