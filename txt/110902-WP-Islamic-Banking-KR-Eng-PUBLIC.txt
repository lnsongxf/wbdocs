Foreword
Islamic banking refers to a system of banking consonant with the basic principles of Islamic Shariah (the rules and values
set by Islam). Essentially this means interest-free financing. Shariah principles disallow ‘riba’ or interest on the lending
of money. Islamic banking offers the same facilities as the conventional banking system does globally. The difference is
Islamic banking’s strict adherence to Shariah rules or Fiqh al Muamlat (Islamic commercial jurisprudence). Until now,
however, the presence and reach of Islamic banking institutions is not as widespread as that of conventional banks. This can
pose a supply gap issue for Islamic products and services.

The World Bank Group has conducted several studies to more exactly define and quantify this financing gap, and the
overall use of banking services among businesses in the Kyrgyz Republic. In fact, though, little clarity has been achieved in
determining how many of these businesses have been excluded owing to the unavailability of Shariah-compliant banking
products.

To correct this lack of information, IFC commissioned this study to better understand the levels of actual business demand
that exist (especially among MSMEs) and the supply of Islamic banking products (asset and liability products along with
other banking services) that are available to address it. The scope comprises: (i) gaps in the banking needs of businesses
(particularly MSMEs) in the Islamic products space; (ii) supply-side benchmarking to review the current capacity of financial
institutions to offer Islamic products to businesses; (iii) demand-side benchmarking to identify key MSME needs for Islamic
products to see how well they are being served; and (iv) the current enabling environment, reviewing its readiness levels
taking into consideration its regulatory framework and the legislation in place to govern Islamic banking and Shariah
compliance.

In particular the report reveals an emergent ‘new-to-bank’ Kyrgyz Islamic funding and depository opportunity, highlighting
the un-served and underserved MSMEs who do not borrow from conventional banks owing to the unavailability of Shariah-
compliant banking products. In other words, even though there is very strong latent demand for Islamic banking products,
this potential is untapped because banks and financial institutions lack the necessary operational capabilities with the extra
burden of having to deal with other constraints such as narrow product offerings, limited outreach, and high costs. This
report offers recommendations as to what Islamic banks and other financial institutions need to do in order to capitalize on
the nascent opportunities represented by the country’s MSME sector.

Almost 80 percent of the country’s MSMEs have indicated their strong preference for and interest in Islamic banking
products and services. Thus if banks successfully implement customer acquisition strategies by focusing on financially un-
served and underserved MSMEs, they can capitalize on this “new-to-bank” potential, as quantified below:

In addition to the “new-to-bank” potential there is also a conversion/cannibalization opportunity for “well-served” MSMEs
which have access to the formal financing system. This opportunity could be worth an estimated $38.3-51.1 million over
the next few years, understanding that these MSMEs might shift their loyalties once Shariah-compliant products are readily
available.

Preface
Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are the drivers of Kyrgyz economic growth and key contributors to
sustainable gross domestic product (GDP). Since the country achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991,
MSMEs became one of the prime supports of the economy as the number of industrial enterprises declined. Most MSMEs
are engaged in the trade and trade-related sectors. These generate significant employment opportunities for skilled and
unskilled labor alike.

Despite their importance to economic development, however, the growth of the country's MSMEs has been hindered by
their limited access to banking services, along with high tax rates, and inconsistent policies. Thus, government support
programs and assistance from multilateral agencies and policy makers are essential to MSME growth.

The Bank Advisory Services of IFC’s Financial Institutions Group provides advisory services to banks in aid of strengthening
their capacity and increasing their outreach to the MSME sector. This is achieved through capacity building, training,
knowledge sharing, and dissemination of best practices in MSME banking and risk management. IFC’s primary goal is to
increase the number of banks that offer banking services to MSMEs in a profitable and sustainable manner. The organization
is globally recognized as a market leader in MSME banking, through its various regional engagements. IFC is also recognized
for its global expertise and knowledge in this area.

In response to growing market demand, IFC has recently enhanced its advisory services to include Islamic financing. In
this respect, the National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic has also expressed an interest in exploring this segment of the market.
Indeed, the NBKR is already looking at the possibility of putting regulations for Islamic banking in place.

As a first step, IFC commissioned this study to better understand the demand for and supply of Islamic banking products
(asset, liability, and other banking products and services) for the MSME sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. In this study,
demand-side benchmarking was conducted to identify key MSME needs for Islamic products and to gauge how well they
are being served. Furthermore, IFC made a quick review of the current enabling environment and readiness levels in the
country in terms of its regulatory framework and Shariah compliance. Also surveyed were the current capacity of Kyrgyz
financial institutions to offer Islamic products to MSMEs.

The study reveals a funding potential of $342.2 to 456.3 million for Islamic financing to MSMEs, with a corresponding
depository potential of $402.6–536.9 million over the next few years. This funding potential exists due to the ‘new-to-bank’
funding opportunity within the un-served and underserved MSME segments. These are either partially served by financial
institutions or do not borrow at all for various reasons. Findings include ‘new-to-bank’ funding potential of $309.6–412.9
million, which is untapped as banks and other financial institutions lack adequate the strategic focus needed on this segment
to offer Shariah-compliant products.

In addition to the ‘new-to-bank’ funding and depository potential, Islamic banks could convert or cannibalize the existing
funding/lending and deposit portfolios of conventional banks that serve MSMEs (primarily mid-sized enterprises). These
mid-sized enterprises deal with conventional banks mostly because of the unavailability of the appropriate Islamic banking
products. The funding potential within this category of well-served MSMEs could be around $30.1 to 41.1 million.

     Islamic Banking and Finance. Opportunities across MSMEs in the Kyrgyz republic                             7

Executive Summary
     Given the fact that just one bank offers Shariah-compliant products in the Kyrgyz
     Republic despite the strong preference for Islamic finance by a large segment of
     the business clientele there, this study aims to determine the number of businesses
     (particularly MSMEs) that do not borrow from financial institutions due to this
     preference, and simply because of limited availability; this would seem to underscore
     an unmet need. How many of these enterprises prefer Islamic banking, but opt for
     conventional banks due to the limited availability of adequate Islamic banking
     products? What is the potential for Islamic finance in the country once Islamic
     banking regulations are strengthened? This study objectively qualifies and quantifies
     such aspects.




The importance of MSMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic grew significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, primarily
because MSMEs generated considerable numbers of employment opportunities for the local population. As well, though,
MSMEs can be characterized as the major drivers of economic development. The country’s mountainous terrain limits
industrial growth. This, in turn, increases the society’s dependence on smaller businesses. In 2014, MSMEs employed
more than 19 percent of the total Kyrgyz population, a significant rise from the 14.8 percent reported in 2010. The MSME
contribution to the country’s GDP has been almost constant at around 29 percent since 2010, and the sector accounted for
31.61 percent of total exports in 20112.

Although a number of initiatives have been undertaken to promote MSME development, however, a number of challenges
remain, preventing companies in this sector from capitalizing on their full potential. The biggest are inadequate access to
finance, corruption and bureaucratic sand traps.

Bank lending to SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic remained fairly stable at around 10 percent3 between 2010 and 2014. And in
the latter year, total SME lending in Kyrgyzstan stood at $148.1 million, while deposits from SMEs totaled $174.2 million4.
Over the same period, MFIs advanced loans to more than 500,000 borrowers, with an aggregate value $370.1 million.
Nevertheless, the banking sector’s low penetration of the MSME subsector and the small ticket size of MSME loans have
restricted bank lending to these small businesses over the years. Banks perceive MSMEs as risky and unattractive, given
that MSMEs typically find it difficult to present adequate credit histories, collateral, guarantees, and cash flow projections,
all of which are essential for procuring funds from formal financial institutions.

Moreover, although 80 percent5 of Kyrgyz MSMEs are interested in borrowing under the aegis of Islamic principles, most
refrain from approaching any banks (conventional or Islamic) to help with their funding needs because of the reasons cited
in Figure 2 below.

         While the general perception of the nascent Islamic banking industry is positive, the high cost of credit and limited                          8
 lic     knowledge of Islamic banking products are the major factors contributing to weak MSME access to Islamic finance                                9
                                                                                                                                                        10
          Almost 86 percent of the Kyrgyz population is Muslim. Furthermore, about 80 percent7 of MSMEs have expressed a
          desire to acquire the financial assistance they need under Islamic principles. Statistically, the demand for Islamic finance
          is estimated at 5–6 percent of the total banking industry. Considering this untapped potential, many conventional banks
          in the country, such as Kyrgyzkommertsbank), RosinBank and Bai-Tushum Bank had expressed interest in setting up
          Islamic operations as of April 2015. However, high borrowing cost and collateral requirements are restricting development
          of the sector. The average lending rate charged by banks is about 22.4 percent, whereas that offered by microfinance
          organizations is 38.5 percent8. Furthermore, according to the results of the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey, 89
          percent of those MSMEs that received loans in the Kyrgyz Republic had to provide collateral averaging 187 percent9 of
          their loan’s value. MSMEs are even more credit-constrained as their average collateral requirement is usually around 1.5
          times that of large corporates10. Also, the terms associated with collateral requirements are rigid and strictly enforced.

Additionally, Islamic leasing attracts double taxation, increasing the applicant’s borrowing costs. This acts to hinder the
development of new Islamic banking products. Most MSMEs do not have the capacity to incur such high costs and thus
refrain from all banking (conventional as well as Islamic).

Nearly a tenth of Kyrgyz MSMEs prefer not to deal with conventional banks because they believe that paying interest on
loans is fundamentally at odds with their values:

Although many of these MSMEs are creditworthy, they are excluded from being able to access funds from Islamic financial
institutions because Shariah-compliant products are either not available or not properly understood by the owners of these
businesses; and either way they involve lengthy processes. Executing Islamic transactions tends to be cumbersome. The
recommendations regarding Islamic finance products to be introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic is available on page 45 of the
report.

Applying for Shariah-compliant products as compared to conventional banking products can be a lengthy process due to the
documentation; the amount of agreements and the sequence of signing these documents often prolong the overall approval
and process time as compared to a Conventional bank’s process.

Banking institutions in the country face obstacles in servicing MSMEs

Their informal way of conducting business: A significant number of MSMEs operate informally (which is to say without
registering the business and lacking proper documentation). As well most under-report or simply do not report revenue
to regulating bodies. Furthermore, operations of these MSMEs generally lack transparency and have virtually no internal
controls.

As a result, they are unable to secure financing since banks insist on verifying a business’ financial health through registration,
title documents and tax reporting. Banks tend to avoid lending to such businesses because the risk of default on such loans
is very high. This drives such enterprises to depend on informal channels such as moneylenders, friends, and family to
meet their financing needs. It is recommended that MSMEs follow formal business practices by reporting accurate revenue
information to regulatory authorities. This would allow for more transparency.

Accessibility issues hinder expansion: The country’s mountainous terrain also amounts to a major hurdle for banks as it
restricts their efforts to expand beyond large accessible cities. Adding to the obstacles, poor financial infrastructure prohibits
the country’s commercial banks from effectively utilizing technology to implement mobile or branchless banking services.
As a consequence, banks are unable to service the majority of MSMEs operating outside the major urban centers.

The limited capacities of Kyrgyz banks: Due to low financial literacy, MSMEs in Kyrgyzstan lack the necessary knowledge
and information regarding financial products and solutions, especially in terms of Shariah-compliant products. Also, the
banking sector has not increased its investment in marketing activities and consumer education to address the issue. For
instance, investment in marketing activities by EcoIslamicBank, the only Islamic bank operating in the country, is very low.
This directly translates into its slow pace of customer acquisition.

These banks also do not have an adequate number of skilled employees or the technological resources required to either
scale-up operations or improve operational efficiency.

Limitations on the availability of shariah-compliant products also restricts the generation of MSME business by Islamic
financial institutions

Shariah-compliant products offered by Islamic financial institutions are largely restricted to working capital and trade
financing based on Mudarabah and Murabaha principles. However, other financing products based on more complex Shariah
structures such as Istisna'a, Ijara, Diminishing Musharaka are not available. For instance, Supply Chain Financing (SCF) is a
short-term credit facility that optimizes working capital by allowing businesses to lengthen payment terms to their suppliers.
It facilitates business expansion and mitigates payment risk benefiting international and local trade.

                                                                                                                                11
Non-availability of complex products is due to lack of knowledge and expertise in structuring such products. Consequently,
MSMEs must either approach conventional financial institutions to access a wider range of financing options or rely on
informal channels to meet their financing needs.

The growth in demand for Islamic finance in the MSME sector could result in a funding opportunity of $342.2–456.3 million
over the next few years

Currently, 70-75 percent of the MSMEs operating in the Kyrgyz Republic do not have any access to finance from formal
                                only
financial institutions. And of the   able to partially

Strategic operational   Executive    help both conventional and Islamic banks to target MSMEs more effectively
                                 canSummary

Regulatory and legislative framework: The Kyrgyz banking laws were amended in 2009 and 2013 through the creation
of the normative and legal acts of the NBKR which discuss: licensing, corporate governance, risk management, model
agreements standardization and procedures for specific types of transactions, which comply with Islamic finance principles.

These principles discuss the creation of a Shariah Council within Islamic banks and those that would like to establish Islamic
windows in their existing conventional bank operations. The Shariah Council is responsible for conformity of transactions
(contracts) of the bank with the Islamic principles of banking and financing.

However, the Shariah Governance Regulatory Framework (SGRF) in the Kyrgyz Republic remains under development due
to the amendment being silent on the governance of such committees. In large Islamic finance markets such as Pakistan and
Malaysia, banking regulators have set up Shariah Advisory Councils at the Central Bank level for effective monitoring and
governance of Shariah councils at individual banks. These advisory councils are positioned as apex bodies to interpret Shariah
principles and ascertain adherence to these principles by Islamic banks in the country. From a practitioners’ perspective,
developed Islamic Economies follow a best practice approach where governing parties create a working partnership with
banks. Due to the lack of Robust Islamic banks in Kyrgyzstan, this partnership is still in an early stage of development.

Thus, it is recommended that the SGRF sets out specific Shariah governance policies to regulate and monitor Islamic
financial institutions in the Kyrgyz Republic. It should provide a comprehensive guidance to the governing bodies, Shariah
committees and bank management in discharging duties in matters related to offering Islamic banking products. The SGRF
should define policy formulation and directives in addition to the guidelines for compliance of policies required by the
Central bank. The deadlines for each Islamic financial institution to comply with the framework should also be elaborated
in the SGRF.

The Kyrgyz Republic, being a relatively new entrant into the Islamic Finance Market, can look to more developed Islamic
Banking Economies in order to formalize an eco system that promotes Islamic finance in the country.

Human capital and talent development: There is a shortage of quality talent in the Kyrgyz Islamic finance industry. Banks
must, therefore, focus on developing the right talent, offering developmental opportunities, providing adequate training, and
on retaining their human capital.

Reducing loan-processing times: The time taken by banks to process and disburse loans (from 2 weeks to 1.5 months on
average) in the Kyrgyz Republic is a major hurdle that inhibits quick access to finance for MSMEs. Streamlining the
administrative process using predictive tools and back-end support would ensure that the loan application procedure is less
cumbersome.

Effective targeting and evaluation of MSMEs: Rather than resorting to a one-size-fits-all model, banks must adopt a

                                                                                                                           13
differentiated customized process for MSMEs. Branch staff need to proactively approach and engage MSME entrepreneurs
rather than relying on them to approach the banks. Moreover, banks need to develop a more MSME-specific risk assessment
model in assessing the credibility of MSMEs, adding non-financial approaches such as behavioral scoring.

Increased focus on extended services: To help MSMEs overcome the challenges they face (for instance, a lack of adequate
knowledge of financial products, and inefficient financial management), banks should consider providing increased
assistance in the form of extended services. For instance, MSME toolkits, helping them to frame their business plans, and
providing guidance on legal issues would help MSMEs to function more effectively, and at the same time improve their
creditworthiness.

Expanding branch networks and offering non-loan products and services: Branch penetration in the Kyrgyz Republic
is relatively low, meaning smaller towns and rural areas often do not have bank branches in their immediate vicinities.
Moreover, there is a shortage of quality talent in the Kyrgyz Islamic finance industry. By addressing these issues, banks
would realize a significant part of the untapped potential cited above. In addition, banks should also expand their non-
borrowing banking services and products, such as current and savings accounts, cash management services and other fee-
based transaction banking services.

Overview of Business and MSME sector in Kyrgyz Republic
 Commercial establishments, particularly MSMEs, are an important driver
 of the Kyrgyz Republic’s economy. They also play an important role in its
 development. In the years following the country’s independence in 1991,
 MSMEs supported the economy while the number of industrial enterprises
 dwindled.

 The development of the MSME sector is supported by the government’s
 regulatory reforms and various other initiatives. However, challenges such as
 inadequate access to finance are hampering its growth.




Definitions
Like most other countries, the Kyrgyz Republic does not have a standard definition by which it classifies micro, small, and
medium enterprises (MSMEs). Even though the criteria used in defining these enterprises are similar (for example, metrics
detailing the numbers of employees and turnover), various government bodies and ministries have different definitions.
For the purposes of this study, we have considered the legislative interpretation provided by the National Statistical Office
(NSO).

Structure of Kyrgyz’s commercial establishments
The MSME sector now accounts for approximately 99 percent of commercial establishments in the country; and
microenterprises dominate the MSME sector

The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 had a severe impact on large industries in the Kyrgyz Republic. Most filed for bankruptcy
and were forced to either shut down or drastically reduce the scale of their operations. This was largely due to the fact that
the country’s economy and that of the Soviet Union were closely interlinked. Most of the industrial facilities in the country
had major clients in other Soviet republics, especially Russia.




                                                                                                                              15
With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, however, MSMEs started to play a major economic role in the Kyrgyz
Republic by generating employment opportunities for the local population and upholding the country’s economy. In 2014,
around 11,500 registered small and medium entities, approximately 350,000 individual entrepreneurs11, and 2,42712 large
corporations operated in the Kyrgyz Republic. Of all enterprises in the country, 97.8 percent are privately owned; another
2.2 percent are state-owned13.

The Kyrgyz government also adopted a more business- and investment-friendly tax regime (effective January 2009). Under
this code, a unified sales tax replaced several previous taxes while many others were either reduced or abolished. For
instance, the value-added tax (VAT) was reduced to 12 percent from 20 percent29. The new code also improved provisions
related to collection of duties, introduced automation and e-filing, and established the presumption of innocence regarding
taxpayers. As a result, the IFC-World Bank Doing Business Report ranked the Kirgyz Republic the third- and second-best
reformer status globally in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

IFC has consistently extended its development support for the Kyrgyz private sector through various investment and advisory
support initiatives

IFC’s main priority in the Kyrgyz Republic is to support the development and diversification of the private sector. The
overriding goal in this is increasing the country’s competitiveness and employment opportunities. IFC aims to improve
corporate businesses practices the better to be able to forge a favorable business environment for private businesses, and
especially to provide MSMEs with increased access to the finance they need.

As of June 30, 2015, IFC’s Kyrgyz portfolio was valued at some $27.4 million, with the bulk of that investment deployed in
the financial sectorand real sectors30.

To improve financial education standards and ensure better access to funds, IFC has focused on MSMEs in the country,
and especially those in rural areas. The organization has done this by encouraging microfinance organizations to reach
out to a larger number of MSMEs. It has also collaborated with major lenders such as the Kyrgyz Investment and Credit
Bank (KICB) and Kompanion Financial Group (KFG). These collaborations aim to improve financial access by expanding
the portfolio of financial products available to MSMEs, including savings plans, money transfers, and cash management

Key concerns for businesses
Political instability ranked as the biggest hurdle for businesses

The Kyrgyz Republic has experienced significant political tension since independence. Its first two post-Soviet presidents
were ousted in the wake of popular discontent in 2005 and 2010. The Kyrgyz Republic had a political instability index31 of
7.1 in 2009–10, and according to the Economist Intelligence Unit,, a rank of 3 in 2013; both underscored its high political
risk32.

Businesses, especially MSMEs, have been severely affected by this political tension. Among other uncertainties, they have
produced a demand slump. This has been particularly true in the trade segment, plus the real estate and tourism sectors,
which together account for the majority of MSMEs. A high crime rate and inventory carrying costs during periods of
political instability have also had a negative effect on competitiveness. And taken together, these things have generally
dissuaded entrepreneurs from expanding their businesses.

Limited access to finance has constrained the development of businesses, especially micro and small enterprises, in the
Kyrgyz Republic

           Kyrgyz MSMEs find it difficult to procure finance for medium- and long-term investment. This limits their expansion. The
           high collateral requirement (which on an average was pegged at 187 percent in 2013, but in fact has gone as high as 237
           percent), plus, the lending rates charged by commercial banks (~22.4% on average) has put a decided damper on private
           entrepreneurs approaching banks in aid of securing credit. Instead, they prefer informal sources of funds, such as traditional
           moneylenders, regardless of the interest rates such lenders demand, which can be as high as 2 percent per month.

The current Status of Islamic banking in the Kyrgyz Republic
 The Islamic banking industry has a strong positive image, especially among
 the country’s MSMEs. Fully 80 percent of them are interested in obtaining
 Shariah-compliant products to address their financing needs. However,
 the development of Islamic banking in the country depends on increased
 penetration, as well as the development of a strong regulatory regime.




Overview of the Kyrgyz banking sector
Since independence, the Kyrgyz banking sector has overcome significant challenges, such as the Russian and global financial
crises, domestic political turmoil, and corruption within the sector. Owing to these events, growth has been sluggish and
the sector remains underdeveloped.

The Kyrgyz banking system has undergone several important stages of development since the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic (NBKR), the country’s central bank, was established after independence in 1991. Over the period from 1991–95,
the country’s transition into a market economy had a direct impact on the banking sector, and led to the establishment of
several commercial banks.

In 1996, the government introduced the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC) program, with funding support from
the World Bank. This was mandated to reform the Kyrgyz banking system. The program downsized the banking system,
restructured state-owned banks, and implemented several administrative reforms aimed at increasing operational efficiency.
However, in 1998, the Russian financial crisis adversely affected the Kyrgyz banking sector, largely due to the huge foreign
currency (mainly Russian ruble) loan portfolios of Kyrgyz commercial banks.

These measures sparked an initial credit boom. However, the Tulip Revolution of 2005 -- which led to the ouster of President
Askar Akayev – bolstered by the global economic crisis of 2008–09, delivered a heavy blow to the country’s banking system.
To prevent any further crisis development and improve its overall health, the NBKR, in cooperation with the government,
introduced the Banking System Development Strategy in 2009. This strategy was activated to enhance the overall growth of
the banking sector by means of restructuring insolvent banks and strengthening bank credit policies.

In 2010, despite facing political turmoil after the overthrow of the government led by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, the
interim government initiated some further decisive measures to improve the operations and internal controls of banks
reeling under the influence of widespread corruption and the lack of corporate governance. Special regimes were introduced,
placing the country’s then-largest bank, Asia Universal Bank, and several smaller banks, under NBKR control. This led
to the uncovering of numerous irregularities and legislative violations by these banks, such as the distortion of financial
statements, to conceal suspicious transactions. The result, in 2011, was that the central bank tabled measures to prevent
commercial banks from engaging in such unhealthy practices.



                                                                                                                         23
In 2012, the newly-elected parliamentary government undertook several measures once again intended to improve the
banking system. The most significant was the introduction of the Medium-Term Development Program, which primarily
focused on:

   •	        Enhancing the sustainability of the banking system, and extending overall accessibility to its financial services;
   •	Improving this new accessibility through the introduction of various new financial instruments, including Islamic
      finance instruments;
   •	        Preparing the Banking Code of the Kyrgyz Republic; and
   •	Developing a strategy for the privatization of state-owned banks – among them Zalkar Bank, RSK Bank, and Aiyl
      Bank – to assure their better management.

The result was improved stability with positive growth among major performance indicators:

   •	        The total assets of the Kyrgyz banking system increased 8.7 percent YoY to $2.5bn in 2014 38.
   •	As well the banking sector’s capital adequacy and liquidity    ratios,

The last few years have seen a significant rise in the number of branches plus stationary and field cash offices of the various
commercial banks. By the end of 2014, there were 293 branches and nearly 800 commercial bank cash offices nationwide41.

This noted, however, the concentration of bank branches remains low with just 7.98 branches per 100,000 adults, compared
with 39.8 and 10.3 branches in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, respectively42. Moreover, Kyrgyz banking facilities are mostly
centered in urban areas.

Additionally, in March 2013 the Kyrgyz Investment Credit Bank introduced mobile banking services to the country for the
first time. Nevertheless, mobile banking penetration is still quite low, especially in rural areas.

This explains why a considerable part of the country’s economy – and most notably in rural areas – still relies on the
financial services offered by the informal banking sector, the most common being currency exchange and ex-officio lending.

SME lending forms only a small part of both the conventional and Islamic banking loan portfolios at present. SME segment
loans make up approximately 10 percent50 of the total loans disbursed by commercial banks each year. This is mainly due to
the small ticket size of SME lending. The average amount borrowed by SMEs is about $1,50051.

In 2012 the government launched a three-year program under which MSMEs were provided with loans at lower-than-market
interest rates. From 2012 until 2015, preferential loans52 collectively valued at more than $150 million53 were issued to over
11,000 MSMEs. However, the coverage of this program was limited as only about 3 percent54 of the total number of SMEs
could acquire loans on these preferential terms. That is why the program has been extended to 2016–17, to encourage more
SMEs to borrow from formal sources.

Islamic banking in the Kyrgyz Republic
Certain divine restrictions have been imposed on economic activities as per Islamic principles. The intent is to ensure that
balance is maintained in the economy, and the concentration of wealth into the hands of a few is avoided

Islamic finance does not negate active market forces nor the natural ebb and flow of the economy. The profit motive is
considered acceptable, albeit with some limitations. Private ownership is likewise not totally negated.

There is a basic difference, however, between a capitalist and Islamic economy, namely that in secular capitalism the profit
motive or private ownership are given unrestrained power to make economic decisions. Their liberty is not constrained
by any divine caveats. And if there are some restrictions, they are those imposed by the society and thus always subject to
change through democratically determined legislation.

This has generated a number of practices which result in social imbalances: for example, interest, gambling, and speculative
transactions tend to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few. Human instincts are exploited to gain through immoral and
injurious products or activities. Furthermore, uncontrolled profit seeking creates monopolies which ultimately paralyze
market forces or, at least, hinder their natural operation. Thus, the natural ebb and flow of supply and demand is disturbed
as these forces can only function properly in an atmosphere of free competition. They are antithetical to a monopolistic
environment.

After the tacit recognition of private ownership, the profit motive and market forces, therefore, certain divine restrictions
have been input as per Islamic principles. These cover economic activities in particular and economic structures in general.
Believers hold, as an article of faith, that such restrictions are imposed by Allah the Almighty, whose knowledge has
no limits, and so cannot be abridged or removed by any human authority. The prohibition of riba (usury or interest),
gambling, hoarding, dealing in unlawful goods or services, short sales and speculative transactions are some examples of
these divine restrictions. And taken together, all have the cumulative effect of maintaining the balance, justice and equality
of opportunities.

Asset-backed financing is one of the most important characteristics of Islamic finance

Conventional financing assumes that the banks and financial institutions deal in money and monetary papers only. That is
why they are forbidden, in most countries, from trading in goods and accumulating inventories.

Islamic finance, on the other hand, does not recognize money as the subject matter of trade, except in some special instances.
Money has no fundamental utility; it is only a medium of exchange. Each unit of money is 100 percent equal to another
unit of the same denomination; therefore, there is no scope for making profit through the exchange of these units. Profit is
generated when something having an intrinsic utility is sold for money, or when different currencies are exchanged, one for
another. The profit earned through dealing in money (of the same currency) or the papers representing them is interest, and
hence prohibited.

The real and ideal instruments of financing in Shariah-compliant banking are Musharakah and Mudarabah. When a financier
contributes money on the basis of these two instruments, it is bound to be converted into the assets. Profits are generated
through the sale of these real assets.

Financing on the basis of Salam and Istisna also creates real assets. The financier, in the case of the former, receives real
goods and can profit by selling them in the market. In the latter instance, financing is affected through the manufacture of
real assets; and as a reward for doing this the financier earns his or her profit.

The instruments of leasing, Ijara and Murabahah, are likewise fully backed by assets and financing through these instruments,
and are therefore clearly distinguishable from interest-based financing.

It is evident that every financing in an Islamic system creates real assets. It is known, on the other hand, that interest-based
financing does not necessarily create real assets. Hence, the supply of money via loans advanced by financial institutions,
does not normally equate with the real goods and services produced in the society. This alludes to loans creating the illusion
of an increase in money, without creating real assets in the same quantity. This gap between the supply of money and
production of real assets creates and fuels inflation. Hence, financing in an Islamic system is always backed by real assets.

The success of Islamic finance in several Asian and Middle Eastern countries encouraged EcoIslamicBank launched Islamic
financing services in 2006. However, the country’s Islamic banking sector is still relatively nascent.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Kyrgyz Republic became the first Central Asian country to join the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) in 1993. Nevertheless, this introduction of Islamic banking in the country faced obstacles that were.
mainly due to initial apprehensions concerning Islamic finance among the secular elite population and government officials.
Nevertheless, the success attained by Islamic finance principles in other Asian and Middle Eastern countries, particularly
Malaysia, encouraged the government to introduce Islamic banking in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2007. Furthermore, IDB,
which has funded several key Kyrgyz projects, has manifestly assisted the country in implementing a dual banking system
(namely Islamic banking in conjunction with traditional banking).

The Kyrgyz Republic signed a memorandum of understanding with IDB and Eco Bank to develop the country’s Islamic
banking system back in 2007. The MoU was specifically aimed at introducing and implementing the principles of Shariah-
compliant finance in the country. Following the signing of the MoU, EcoIslamicBank was established as the pilot project for
Islamic banking in the Kyrgyz Republic.

A positive perception of Islamic banking: Almost 86 percent64 of Kyrgyzstan’s population follows Islam. Potential customers
are mostly private businesses, with their natural need for banking products. However these generally seek to avoid the
offerings and services of conventional banks because they see paying interest as not being aligned with their values.

Around 80 percent of the MSMEs surveyed expressed a desire to borrow, or obtain financing, under the aegis of Islamic
principles. This amounts to significant untapped potential, as there is just one Islamic bank operating in the Kyrgyz Republic
at present, and it accounts for only 1.6 percent65 of all commercial bank lending.

Conventional bank interest in Islamic banking is growing: Considering this untapped potential, many conventional banks
in the country, such as Kyrgyzkommertsbank), RosinBank, and Bai-Tushum Bank, had expressed their interest in setting up
Islamic banking operations in the Kyrgyz Republic as of April 2015. In fact these banks have already started the process,
conducting relevant feasibility studies and appointing experts on regulatory compliance.

Additionally, some foreign banks operating in the country already have significant experience in setting up and operating
Islamic banking windows in their home countries. And many of them have been exploring ways to leverage this experience
to set up Shariah-complaint Kyrgyz banking operations. Additionally, several traditional banks in the country are looking to
attract funds from wealthy Russian Muslims seeking to invest in Shariah-compliant products/opportunities outside of their
home country.

IDB’s contribution to Islamic finance’s development: IDB has contributed to the development of Islamic finance in the
country through various initiatives dating back to when the Kyrgyz Republic became a member in 1993. These development
initiatives are aimed at forging a suitable regulatory environment likely to increase the presence of Islamic banking and
finance. They include:

  •	Reviewing the existing legal framework pertaining to banking and financial activities, and proposing amendments
     or drafting a new stand-alone law to enable Islamic finance to operate efficiently;

  •	     Assisting EcoIslamicBank to introduce new Islamic banking products;

  •	Widespread training at EcoIslamicBank, NBKR, the Ministry Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry
     of Justice as well as at the Financial Market & Supervision Service covering the operation and supervision of
     Islamic banking; and

  •	Creating a suitable environment in which to launch Sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of bonds) and Takaful (contributory
     communal insurance for members against future loss or damage) as further aids in the development of Islamic
     products in the country.

IDB has been active in financing the construction of Islamic schools and vocational centers. Furthermore, IDB has been an
active participant in the social and economic development of the country, and is involved in co-financing important projects
in various sectors such as energy, transport infrastructure and agriculture, while at the same time providing credit lines to
Kyrgyz banks.


                    Expansion of the Kyrgyz Islamic financial industry is a key IDB strategic thrust

Challenges facing Islamic banking
As Islamic banking expands, the sector must compete with established conventional banks already entrenched in the Kyrgyz
banking system. At the same time they have no choice but to deal with a weak regulatory environment and a shortage of
products and funds

Taking steps towards the development of a robust regulatory environment: Due to regulatory provisions for Islamic finance
in the Kyrgyz Republic, being in the developmental stages, it has restricted growth of the sector. Although the first Islamic
bank was established in 2007, EcoIslamicBank had to include operational governance provisions for Shariah compliance in
its Articles of Association, due to lack of specific governance laws and local knowledge of Islamic Finance.

Also, the bank currently operates as a pilot project on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding between Kyrgyz
Republic, Islamic Development Bank and EcoIslamicBank which was signed in 2006 with a view to introduce and develop
Islamic banking in the country. However, the necessary procedures to convert it into a full-fledged Islamic bank were never
implemented due to lack of reflection of the Islamic principles.

Certain amendments to the banking law were introduced in 2009 and 2013 to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic known as the
normative legal acts of NBKR. These laws provided detailed instructions and regulations relating to Islamic finance, credit
institutions and transactions.

Given the low market share Islamic banking has garnered to date, regulators have not paid much attention to this issue. Even
the Kyrgyz taxation system does not have provisions to support Islamic banking. Moreover, Islamic leasing attracts double
taxation, which naturally increases the applicant’s borrowing costs. This, in turn, translates into another hindrance in terms
of developing new Islamic banking products.

Limited reach and lack of competitive products: Just one Islamic bank services the entire country’s Islamic finance
requirements. And that bank’s reach is limited because of its few branches and the inadequacy of its menu of fully Shariah-
compliant products. Thus, in the absence of more operators, Islamic banking growth potential in the country is limited.
There is a clear need to increase the number of banks offering the critical mass of Shariah-compliant products required to
establish a strong presence for this kind of banking in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Effective profit is usually higher in Islamic banks compared with interest rates charged by conventional banks. So despite
the strong demand for Shariah-compliant products, customers are deterred by the higher costs involved. This disparity of
costs is bound up with the high cost of structuring Islamic products. Furthermore, the Islamic finance products now offered
in the country cannot compete with the product portfolio of the conventional banks.

Shortage of working capital: Obtaining Shariah-compliant funds for working capital requirements has proven a challenge
for EcoIslamicBank, since Islamic banks cannot use non-Shariah-compliant funds. Such funds now come from donors and/
or other international financial institutions such as IDB. This limits Islamic bank flexibility in terms of financial operations
and the replenishment of funds.

Shortage in the skilled workforce: Additionally, Kyrgyz banks and financial institutions find it difficult to hire qualified
managers and staff with some level of expertise in Islamic banking. In some instances, recruiting experts, such as accountants
and product managers, among others, is challenging because such personnel are simply unavailable locally.

Without the necessary know-how and skilled workforce capability at their disposal, Islamic banks cannot maximize their
product portfolio by developing.




                                                                                                                             33
      The Kyrgyz Islamic banking industry is underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of legislative and regulatory
      support from the government and the country’s central bank. Although the latter amended its banking rules to
      permit the operation of Islamic banks and windows, it has not yet been able to establish the stand-alone legislation
      which would encourage development of the sector. The current banking rules -- created for conventional banks --
      also need to be followed by Islamic banks, restricting their ability to manage investments and raise capital through
      avenues that are compliant with Shariah principles.
      Although several existing foreign banks operating in the country have been evaluating the possibility of setting up
      an Islamic bank (or window), the present environment does little to encourage them in accelerating their plans.



Overview of micro-finance institutions in the Kyrgyz Republic
The establishment of FINCA in 1995 signaled the arrival of microfinance in the Kyrgyz Republic. Even so, the industry was
largely characterized by foreign institutions providing grants on the basis of international agreements until August 2002,
when the government adopted the legislation ‘On Microfinance Organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic’.

Historically, microfinance developed swiftly dating back to the latter part of 1990s; in fact, the country is among Central Asia’s
leaders in this segment. Since 1995, international financial institutions and donor organizations, such as The Foundation
for International Community Assistance (FINCA), have been focused on improving the loan access which would enable
many more micro enterprises to obtain financing. Microfinance institutions are an important part of the Kyrgyz credit sector
as they are generally the sole finance providers in rural areas. This is mainly because MFIs offer unsecured loans, whereas
banks focus on urban borrowers who can put up collateral.

Kyrgyz MFIs are well-regulated; the NBKR is responsible for licensing and supervising all MFIs in the country. The law
‘On Microfinance Organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic’, introduced in June 2002, led to the mandatory registration of
all MFIs and the need for appropriate certification or a license from NBKR for all legal entities conducting microfinance
activities.

Furthermore, the Kyrgyz government passed a law in 2012 to address the parallel loans issue (multiple borrowings by the
same customer) in the MFI sector. This piece of legislation was intended to limit such parallel loans by mandating the MFIs
providing them to make clients aware of the possible negative effects. The regulation also mandated MFIs to regularly
report loan details to the Credit Bureau. This resulted in an 8 percent66 reduction in the number of parallel loans, yet without
disrupting MFI operations.

To address growing concerns over rising interest rates, the government passed a Law On Restrictions on Usury Activities in
the Kyrgyz Republic in 2013 to protect the rights of borrowers by capping interest rates in excess of the maximum allowable
percentage as prescribed by the NBKR. This sparked a sharp decline in the interest rates charged by MFIs, to 31.0 percent
in 2013, down from 38.8 percent in 2010.67 This law has also affected the number of MFIs in the country.

The Kyrgyz MFI sector is highly concentrated; around 5 percent of the total 277 licensed micro finance institutions account
for more than 85 percent of total MFI loans, and boast of having about 90 percent of the total number of borrowers

277 MFIs have been operating in the Kyrgyz Republic since October 2013,. That is a considerable reduction from the 454
reported in 2011. Of these, 21268 were microcredit companies (MCCs)69, among which two were Islamic institutions, while
6570 were microcredit agencies (MCA)71.

Kyrgyz MFIs now service over 500,000 borrowers; and an estimated 16 percent of these borrow from more than one MFI.
The 15 largest institutions account for 87 percent of the total MFI loan portfolio and 93 percent of the total number of
micro borrowers.72 The top MFIs are relatively well-capitalized, having access to wholesale funding from domestic and
international markets.

MFI assets and loans have been growing since 2012, largely in lock-step with an expanding customer base

From 2012–14, MFI assets grew at an average annual rate of 8.4 percent to $467 million. Despite strong growth, however,
MFIs currently account for a modest 20 percent market share in the Kyrgyz financial sector by asset value. MFI assets
amounted to 6.8 percent of Kyrgyz GDP in 2013.

During the 2012–14 period, the value of loans provided by such institutions increased at an average annual rate of 11.4
percent, up to $370.1 million. This growth was mainly driven by the expansion of the MFI customer base, given that the
average individual loan size has remained fairly flat.

The quality of loans disbursed by MFIs have also improved in recent years, as evidenced by the marked decline seen in the
NPL rate from 11 percent in 2012 to 7 percent in 2014.

Islamic Banking Opportunities among MSMEs
  Because 95% of MSMEs are unable to meet their financial needs through
  formal channels, a significant opportunity for Islamic banks exists in the
  Kyrgyz Republic. And over the next few years, the Islamic financing
  opportunity represented by these MSMEs is projected to be worth $342.2
  to $456.3 million, with deposit potential in the range of $402.6 to $536.9
  million.




Access to finance for the MSME sector
MSME penetration of formal financing channels in the country is low. Moreover, the banking facilities are largely concentrated
in urban areas. Thus, easy access to finance is a major constraint for the MSME sector

Kyrgyz MSME lending has picked up momentum over the last few years, driven by certain government initiatives, such as
the introduction of preferential loans. Nevertheless, banking activity in the country remains weak because of the relatively
small number of bank branches and ATMs. In addition, a pronounced lack of financial literacy and low confidence in the
banking system has led the majority of the Kyrgyz population to opt for keeping their money at home rather than in banks.

Bank funding in the country is among the lowest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. According to a 2011 World Bank
Group study, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked 24th among 2973 Eastern European and Central Asian countries pertaining to its
access to bank credit for investment. Moreover, the country had the lowest levels of credit provided to the private sector
over the same vast region (12.9 percent of GDP in 201174). Simply put, businesses rely less on bank financing and more on
internal sources of funding.

As a consequence, access to finance is a major issue for MSMEs in the country. Only 5 percent75 of MSMEs are able to
adequately meet their financing needs through banks and other formal financial institutions. Moreover, those MSMEs able
to do so are generally mid-sized enterprises concentrated in urban centers. The other two MSME categories, classified by
their access to finance, are as follows:

    Under served MSMEs: Barring a few small enterprises with established track records, the financing needs of a
  •	
    significant portion of the country’s MSMEs are only partially met. These enterprises (representing 20–25 percent76
    of the total number of MSMEs) avail themselves of formal financing (Islamic or conventional), which amounts to
    less than 20 percent of their requirements.

    Unserved MSMEs: These are the mostly small enterprises in either rural or urban areas with no access to formal
  •	
    sources for loans and funding. That is simply a result of banking products and services being unavailable in their
    locales. Thus this category of MSMEs largely relies on informal sources, such as family and friends. And it represents
    some 70–75 percent77 of the MSME population, who do not borrow at all for various reasons. Included among these
    is the fact that their Islamic beliefs prohibit them from paying interest on loans.

           Although many of these MSMEs are creditworthy, they are excluded from being readily able to obtain funds from Islamic

           transactions cumbersome.

That is because few MSMEs from other sectors are profitable enough to afford the country’s high financing costs. Moreover,
with bank loan terms averaging about two years, only frequent cash-flow investment projects (typically for those engaged
in trade) are able to repay this type of short-term loan. Thus, the majority of MSMEs in other sectors are overlooked for
financing by the formal financial institutions in the country.

Obstacles for financial institutions in lending to MSMEs
Their informal manner of conducting business

A large number of Kyrgyz MSMEs operate in the informal sector. Most of them either do not report. or under-report
revenues to regulating bodies. This effectively bars such businesses from accessing the financing they need since banks need
to verify a business’ financial viability through registration, title documents and tax reporting.

Most MSMEs (formal as well as informal) are owned and operated by a single individual or their family members. Such
businesses rarely have a long-term plan or business strategy. They also tend to lack transparency and internal controls.

All of this inclines banks to avoid lending to them, given the perception that the risk of loan defaults is high.

Accessibility issues hinder expansion

Banks in the Kyrgyz Republic face another major hurdle in the form of the country’s mountainous terrain. This has
prevented several of the country’s banks from expanding beyond the few large accessible cities. Additionally, poor financial
infrastructure prohibits commercial bank usage of the full technological suite in launching the most effective mobile or
branchless banking services in more remote areas. In effect this means that banks are simply unable to service the majority
of MSMEs, who operate outside of the major urban centers.

Limited capacities of Kyrgyz banks

Due to their limited financial literacy, Kyrgyz MSMEs do not have sufficient knowledge and information regarding financial
products and solutions, particularly Shariah-compliant products. As well, the banking sector has not increased its investment
in marketing activities and consumer education to counter this limitation. For instance, the investment in marketing activities
by EcoIslamicBank (the only Islamic bank operating in the country) is noticeably low, as is reflected in its slow rate of
customer acquisition.

Also, the banking sector generally does not have an adequate number of skilled employees or the technological resources
needed to scale up operations or improve operational efficiency.




Supply side analysis – penetration of Islamic Banking into the MSME sector
The Islamic banking sector in the Kyrgyz Republic is underdeveloped. As noted above, there is only one fully-fledged
Shariah-compliant bank along with three Islamic MFIs operating in the country. Thus despite the favorable perception such
lenders enjoy (especially among MSMEs), their product portfolio does not match conventional bank offerings.

Shariah-compliant bank along with three Islamic MFIs operating in the country. Thus despite the favorable perception such
lenders enjoy (especially among MSMEs), their product portfolio does not match conventional bank offerings.

EcoIslamicBank's banking products are focused on both individual (retail segment) and corporate (especially small
businesses) customers. And within the corporate banking segment, the bank concentrates on the MSME group in particular,


40
as is evidenced by the bulk of the loans in its portfolio being small loans. Other products offered include deposit accounts,
safety desposit boxes, and currency exchange services plus product financing. The bank also provides trade finance and bank
guarantees to businesses operating in the country

MFIs, by comparison, offer group loans (the minimum amount being $65 for 3-18 months), unsecured loans (up to $3,200
over the maximum tenure of a year), secured loans (up to $31,200 for 3 months to 3 years), home purchase and home
improvement loans (up to $15,500 for a maximum of 10 years), and education loans (in collaboration with USAID).

Most of these products are structured based on Mudarabah and Murabaha principles. Other Shariah- compliant financing
products based on more complex structures are not available, though, due to the under-developed banking infrastructure and
lack of personnel with sufficient know-how pertaining to Islamic banking principles and structures.



Islamic banking potential in the MSME sector
The Islamic banking sector could potentially fill a funding gap ranging between $342.2 and $456.3 million.

At present, there are a total of 362,16384 MSMEs operating in the Kyrgyz Republic. Of these, only 5 percent (generally mid-
sized) have sufficient access to finance through formal channels to be considered financially well-served. By contrast, 20-25
percent85 of these enterprises (generally small businesses) have limited financial access and are financially underserved,
while another 70-75 percent86 (generally micro and small businesses) have little access to finance to be deemed financially
un-served, at least by formal financial institutions.

The funding potential for Islamic banking in the MSME sector seen from both bull and bear case standpoints:

The bull case scenario: This rests on the assumption that Islamic banking institutions prove capable of implementing a
model which extends branch networks to all areas, urban and rural alike; and that they further, improve understanding and
knowledge of Shariah-compliant products amongst SMEs, while hiring skilled professionals who can structure Islamic
products, and offer competitive Shariah-compliant products under more favorable conditions (for instance with flexible
tenure and collateral requirements, at lower cost, and with less documentation) compared to conventional banks. In such
a scenario, approximately 80 percent87 of MSMEs have already exhibited their interest in availing themselves of Shariah-
compliant financing.

  •	In the above scenario, Islamic bank penetration over the next few years is estimated as capable of reaching 80
     percent of the un-served and underserved MSME market (which, again, represents 95 percent of the total number
     of MSMEs). At an average loan size of $1500 each, the resulting aggregate value would be $412.9 million.

The bear case scenario: Assumes that the penetration of Islamic banking remains primarily limited to urban areas, offering
more diversity in Islamic-structured products while making loan processing easier for MSMEs.

  •	Given the above conditions, Islamic banking institutions have been estimated as capable of tapping into at least 60
     percent of the un-served and under-served market (meaning 95 percent of the total number of MSMEs); thus, with
     an average loan size of $1500 each, the resulting value would total $309.6 million.

Islamic banks may also expect to cannibalize or convert the existing well-served MSME portfolios of conventional banks
anticipating that these MSMEs might migrate elsewhere for better products or quality of services. To be able to achieve
this, however, Islamic financial institutions would have to ensure that they are able to diversify their product portfolios and

The regulatory and legislative framework: The government has made efforts to strengthen the regulatory environment
by way of amendments that laid down key principles of Islamic Banking in 2009 and 2013. Detailed instructions and
regulations relating to Islamic finance, credit institutions and transactions are provided in the normative and legal acts of
the NBKR (30 normative and legal acts). As of today, the normative and legal acts of NBKR stipulate requirements on
licensing, corporate governance, risk management, model agreements standardization and Procedure for specific types
of transactions, which comply with the Islamic principles of financing. To implement the pilot project on introduction of
Islamic banking and finance principles, a separate package in normative and legal acts, including taxation issues, has been
developed since 2006 for EcoIslamicBank. To address the issue, certain amendments were made in normative and legal
acts of NBKR, which mandated the establishment of a Shariah Council at Islamic banks and those banks that would like to
establish Islamic windows in their existing conventional bank operations. This council would be responsible for compliance
of banking operations with Islamic principles.

However, the Shariah Governance Regulatory Framework (SGRF) in Kyrgyzstan is still in the development phase. As
discussed earlier, in comparatively matured Islamic finance markets such as Pakistan and Malaysia, regulatory bodies
assisted the Central Banks by establishing Shariah Advisory Councils to monitor Shariah operations of banks. This has
allowed Central Banks and their Shariah Council to implement the principles of Islamic Banking.

A robust and comprehensive SGRF is required to communicate Shariah governing policies to the Islamic financial institutions
and closely monitor all operations from management to product development of the Islamic financial institutions assuring
strict adherence to its regulations and policies. The framework should also develop a roadmap for policy formulation and
implementation, in addition to drafting guidelines for compliance of policies required by the central bank.

From a practitioners’ perspective, the Kyrgyz Republic is accurately following the roadmap to building a Robust Islamic
Banking eco system. By looking at more developed Islamic Banking economies the Kyrgyz Republic can build on its
existing Islamic Banking regulations and work closely with banks in order to formalize said ecosystem.

Human capital and talent development: Unsurprisingly, there is a shortage of quality talent in the Kyrgyz Islamic finance
industry. Well-educated and experienced human resources within it are, unsurprisingly, in high demand. That is why banks
must focus on developing the right talent, offering development opportunities, and providing adequate training if they are
to stand the best chance of retaining their human capital. By addressing these issues, they should also be able to realize a
significant part of their untapped potential.

Reduction of loan-processing time: The time taken by banks to process and disburse loans is a major hurdle miring access
to MSME financing. Thus banks need to streamline their administrative processes to ensure that loan application procedures
become less cumbersome in terms of both the documents required and processing time taken. To accomplish this, frontline
staff need to be provided with predictive tools, and back-end support to ensure faster loan processing.

Effective segmentation, targeting and evaluation of MSMEs: Banks need to frame better methods of segmenting and
targeting potential MSME customers and evaluating the lending risk they represent. Rather than resorting to a one-size-fits-
all business model, they must adopt differentiated customized business models and processes for varied MSME targets. In
addition, their branch staff needs to proactively approach and engage MSME entrepreneurs rather than passively relying on
these people to approach the banks.

In particular, banks need to develop a more MSME-specific risk assessment and underwriting model to assess the credibility
of MSMEs via bank statements, utility payments, property lease agreements, technology and/or other such methods. There
is also a need to apply cash flow forecasting tools, and non-financial approaches, such as behavioral scoring, to better
understand the risks. Effective targeting should parallel continuous monitoring of asset (borrower MSME) quality bolstered
by an effective collections mechanism to ensure low default rates.


                                                                                                                          43
Increased focus on non-financial extension services: To help MSMEs overcome the challenges they face (for instance their
lack of knowledge regarding financial products, their informal methods of conducting business and inefficient financial
management), banks should consider providing increased assistance in the form of non-financial extension services.
For instance, MSME toolkits, assistance in framing business plans, guidance on legal and tax rules and regulations, and
information on other related topics, such as finance and management, would help these MSMEs function effectively while
improving their creditworthiness.

Expanding branch networks and offering non-borrowing products and services: Branch penetration in the country is relatively
low, meaning smaller towns and rural areas often do not have bank branches in their immediate vicinities. Therefore,
increasing the number of branches is essential to increase banking opportunities in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Additionally, banks should evaluate the viability of offering non-borrowing banking services and products such as current
and savings accounts, cash management or payment management, payroll management, and other fee-based transaction
banking services.

Widen the range of products available: As Kyrgyz MSME sector develops further, the range of Islamic products available in
the country would have to become broader. A few examples of Islamic banking products are explained below:

 •	     Simple products: Trade finance products such as LC (letter of credit) Musharkah and letter of guarantee which
         will promote international trading and allow banks to act as guarantors and help facilitate businesses; asset finance
         products such as securitized loans and lease finance which will allow MSMEs to participate in economic development
         as well as infrastructure development of the country.

   Complex products: Complex working capital loans such as supply chain financing (SCF) on Bai Ajal or Murabaha.
 •	
   SCF is a short-term credit facility that optimizes working capital by allowing businesses to lengthen payment terms
   to their suppliers. It facilitates business expansion and mitigates payment risk.

Conclusion
  Although Islamic banking in the Kyrgyz Republic is still in its infancy,
  there is strong interest in Shariah-compliant financing, particularly among
  MSMEs. With continued development and improvement in the regulatory
  and legislative environment, and in strengthening institutional capacities to
  meet growing MSME demand, the Islamic financing market opportunity is
  estimated to reach between $342.2 and $456.3 million going forward.




Despite the political upheavals and volatility within Kyrgyz banking generally as a result of irregularities and legislative
violations, the sector stabilized in recent years after the implementation of regulatory measures by the NBKR and the
introduction of an effective development initiative (the Medium-Term Development Program) by the government. At
present there are 24 commercial banks operating in the country, with a combined asset base of $2.5 billion (as of 2014).
Foreign banks account for 45 percent of the total assets. These are followed by private domestic banks (with 34 percent) and
state-controlled banks (with 18 percent). Meanwhile, the only Shariah-complaint bank, EcoIslamicBank, accounts for the
remaining 3 percent of the assets88.

Although the level of banking sector activity from 2009 through 2011 remained stagnant due to structural deficiencies,
regulatory and legislative reforms continued apace, strengthening the system as a whole. This resulted in a significant
increase in banking activity during 2013 and 2014, with both the industry’s loan book and deposit base growing at an
average annualized rate of more 20 percent.

The Islamic banking sector, in particular, has likewise witnessed strong growth over the past few years. Its financing activity
increased at a CAGR of 18.9 percent, while its deposit base grew at an even more rigorous CAGR of 42.1 percent from
2010 to 201489. Although the Kyrgyz authorities introduced certain changes to the banking law (in 2006, 2009 and 2013)
to facilitate the functioning of Islamic banks, the government should attempt to improve the regulatory landscape to boost
development of the sector in view of the increasing demand for Islamic finance by local businesses. About 5–6 percent of
the total population (about 10 percent in the southern provinces and 5.4 percent in the north)90 have signaled their interest in
Shariah-compliant financing. This is even higher among businesses, with 80 percent91 of MSMEs expressing strong interest
in borrowing from Islamic financing institutions. As a result, several conventional banks, such as Kyrgyzkommertsbank),
RosinBank, and Bai -Tushum Bank, are now evaluating the feasibility of setting up Islamic banking operations within their
businesses in the country.

At the same time, high costs and their lack of capacities have curtailed penetration of MSMEs by the Islamic banking sector.
In fact, even the large conventional banks have not been active in lending to SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic. Total lending by
the banking system to SMEs stands at only about 10 percent of the total ($148.1 million in loans and $174.2 in deposits),
despite the remarkable fact that the segment accounts for approximately 99 percent of all commercial establishments in the
country.

At the present time, only 5 percent93 of the 362,163 MSMEs have adequate access to formal financing. Otherwise, the
financing requirements of the remaining MSMEs are either only partially met by financial institutions (20-25 percent of
these businesses are financially under-served) or not met at all (70-75 percent of the total number of MSMEs do not have
any access to financial support)94.

To effectively target the MSME sector, Islamic banks need to focus on expanding their reach while diversifying product
offerings, training their workforces regarding Islamic banking products and MSME banking, and implementing SME-specific
risk assessment tools while simplifying loan procedures. However, if Islamic financing institutions are able to capitalize on
the positive interest in Shariah-compliant banking through such initiatives, then they stand to tap into a funding opportunity
estimated at $342.2 to 456.3 million within these un-served, underserved, and, indeed, well-served categories of MSMEs
over the next few years.

The primary objective of this report is to enable IFC to determine the market opportunity for Islamic finance in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The main questions the report addresses are:
• What is the overall number of MSMEs and businesses in the country and how are these establishments structured?
  Is Islamic banking there mature enough to adequately cater to the finance and banking needs of MSMEs and other
• 
  businesses?
• What are the products and services that MSMEs want from banks?
• What is the size of the MSME market opportunity for Islamic finance?
To get data on the above, we devised a questionnaire to be used in discussions with industry experts (Appendix – II).

Appendix

Fundamental Concept behind Islamic Laws & Principles

The basic belief around which all Islamic laws and principles revolve is that the whole universe has been created and is
controlled by only one God. He created man and appointed him as His vice-regent on Earth to fulfill certain objectives.

The assumption behind this belief is that human reason, despite its immense capabilities, cannot claim to have the unlimited
power needed to reach absolute truth and justice. Rather it has definite limits beyond which it either cannot function fully
or is bound to make mistakes.

 It is thus evident that the sphere of the work delegated to humanity by its Creator is not unlimited. There are areas where
human reason simply cannot give appropriate guidance or may fall prey to errors. And it is in these areas that Allah Almighty,
the Creator of the universe, has provided guidance through His revelations sent down to His prophets. On the basis of these
divine revelations it is the firm belief of every Muslim that the commands given through the last Messenger are to be
followed and cannot be violated or ignored on the basis of one's rational arguments or inner desires.

Therefore, all human activities must always be subject to these commands and must work within the limits prescribed for
them. Islam is not confined to some moral teachings, some rituals or some modes of worship. Rather it contains guidance
pertaining to every sphere of life, including socio-economic fields and activities. Obedience by the servants of Allah is
required not only in worship, but also extends to their economic activities, even though this may be at the expense of some
apparent benefits -- because these apparent benefits may go against the collective interest of the society.

The origin of the Islamic banking system can be traced back to the advent of Islam when the Prophet himself carried out
trading operations for his wife. The “Mudarbah” or Islamic partnerships have been widely appreciated by the Muslim
business community for centuries; but the concept of “Riba”, or interest, gained very little traction in regular or day-to-day
transactions.
Early experiments with Islamic banking took place in Malaysia in the mid-1940s and in Pakistan in the late 1950s. However,
the first Islamic banking model was introduced by Mit Ghamr Savings Bank in Egypt in 1963. Ahmad Al Najjar was the chief
founder of this bank and the key features it introduced were profit sharing on the non-interest based Shariah philosophy. In
1974, the Organization of Islamic Countries established the first fully Islamic bank called the Islamic Development Bank.
Its basic business model was to provide financial assistance and support on profit sharing.

By the end of 1970s, several Islamic banking systems had been established throughout the world, including the first private
commercial bank in Dubai (1975), followed by the Bahrain Islamic Bank (1979) and the Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan
(1977). By 2003 Islamic banks had become increasingly popular in the Arab world and in countries like Malaysia.

In more recent times, Shariah-compliant finance has been the fastest-growing area of finance globally and has evolved into
two forms:

 •	     Restructuring of the whole financial system of the country in accordance with Shariah principles.

 •	Islamic financial institutions operating alongside conventional financial institutions, either autonomously or as
    ‘windows’ within conventional banking set-ups.

By April 2013, there were more than 500 financial institutions worldwide that were either fully Islamic or provided Islamic
financial products to their customers. Beyond these, there are several hundred Islamic investment banks and insurance
companies, or takaful,

48
The following products are available under Islamic finance:

Islamic forms of deposits

Mudarabah: This is a partnership between the "capital provider" and the "entrepreneur," whereby the former receives a share
of the profit against his capital and the latter receives a share of the profit against his labor and management.

Wakala: This is one of the contracts used in Islamic banks to invest money. Under Wakala, the client gives the bank the
authorization to invest his money in Islamic activities for a certain percentage of the capital to be deducted from realized
profit.

Islamic types of financing

Murabha: This is defined as ‘a sale at the original price plus a profit’. In Murabaha, the bank buys and owns the commodities
identified by the customer, including consumer goods and production assets according to specifications determined by the
customer. After assuming ownership, the bank sells these goods to the client for a price including the purchase cost plus a
determined profit against the efforts exerted for the purchase and the expenses borne by the bank. The commodity is then
delivered to the customer within the required specifications.

The client pays for the commodity in periodic installments, subject to the contract of sale. Murabaha sale is offered to
companies by providing local or foreign raw materials, equipments and machinery with the aim of establishing and expanding
production lines.

Musharkah: In Musharkah financing, the client requests financing for a particular project where the bank shares the anticipated
profits or losses of the project with the client. The Musharakah contract is done according to a previously arranged, mutually
agreed upon set of distribution rules and principles, in compliance with Shariah. Unlike the case of loans, in Musharkah
financing, there are no interest rates.

The concept of ‘Musharkah financing’ is based on the idea that the bank provides the financing required by the client for a
particular project without a fixed interest rate, contrary to loans. The realized financial outcome is shared between the bank
and the customer, as per the percentages they have mutually agreed.

Ijara: An Ijara lease is defined as a contract that allows the customer to lease a particular asset and utilize it for a specific
period of time. After completion of the specified period, the asset can be owned by the customer. This financial lease is
adopted in response to the customer's inability to buy a particular asset in cash.

Istisna'a: This is a contract under which the client asks the bank for construction of a manufacturing unit with certain
specifications. The bank has to meet the desire of the client and to provide that unit according to specifications set by the
client who then pays the price in installments.

The above products have various applications in diverse fields, including within the corporate sector. Of these, Murabaha
and Ijara are particularly used by retail customers for buying or leasing cars, home, electronic appliances and home furniture.
