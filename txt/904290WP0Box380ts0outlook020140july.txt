         Box 1               Price volatility for most commodities has returned to historical norms


        The elevated price volatility in the aftermath of the 2005-08 commodity boom has been (and still is) a key concern among
        policy makers and multilateral institutions (e.g. World Bank 2012, UNCTAD 2012). To examine whether such concerns are
        consistent with the recent evidence, this box analyzes daily price movements of 18 commodities traded at futures exchang-
        es, based on the 1997-2014 period. It concludes that price volatility for almost all commodities reached historical highs dur-
        ing 2008-09 (which also coincided with the financial crisis), but volatility returned to historical norms after 2010. The box also
        provides evidence of a causal relationship between S&P 500 returns (a proxy for expectations on overall macroeconomic
        conditions) and commodity price returns during the financial crisis. However, such a relationship is significantly weaker in
        periods before 2005 and after 2009. Taken together, the findings suggest that the elevated volatility during 2008-09 was
        largely temporary and was driven mostly by cyclical macroeconomic factors rather than changes in the fundamentals of
        global commodity markets as has been often argued (e.g., expansion of biofuels, demand growth by emerging economies,
        or changing weather patterns).
        Price volatility during 2008-09 has been, on average, more than 50 percent higher than other periods (figure B1.1 depicts
        price volatility for oil Brent copper, and wheat). A simple difference in means test confirms that volatility was significantly
        higher during the 2008-09 than in other periods for 17 of the 18 commodities analyzed here. For example, daily crude oil
        price volatility was 2% during 2008-09 and 2.9% in other periods. Likewise, copper and wheat price volatility was higher by
        1.11 and 1.03 percentage points.
        Of the 18 commodities examined here, 17 commodities exhibited price volatility that was 25 percent higher than its aver-
        age—coffee being the sole exception, most likely because coffee exhibits high price volatility throughout the entire period.
        This further confirms that volatility was abnormally high during 2008-09 across the entire commodity spectrum, but also that
        it has returned to historical levels after 2010 (figure B1.2).
        Price volatility in the past quarter was lower than the average volatility during the second quarter of the 1997-05 period
        across 16 out of 18 commodities—coffee and natural rubber are exceptions (table B1.1). Furthermore, volatility has re-
        mained stable over the last two quarters for most commodities. Again, these results are consistent with the view that price
        volatility for the most recent quarter has been at very low levels across a broad range of commodities. (Maize price volatility
        was elevated during 2013Q2 and 2013Q3 because of exceptionally adverse weather conditions in the US, which is the ma-
        jor maize exporter).
        Several authors (e.g. Bloom 2013) have noted that macroeconomic shocks associated with recessions—such as the
        2008/09 financial crisis—are more uncertain than positive shocks because large recessions are rare events with no clear
        consensus on their likely depth and duration, often amplified by policy uncertainty, they tend to cause greater market volatili-
        ty than positive shocks. To examine the effect of the macroeconomic conditions on commodity price volatility, Granger-
        causality tests were run between daily commodity price returns and the returns on the S&P 500 index (figure B1.3 depicts

Energy prices, as measured by the World Bank energy
index, were up 1 percent in 2014Q2 an acceleration from
0.5 percent growth in the previous quarter squarely due
to increase in crude oil prices (up 2.6 percent for the
quarter) given that coal and natural prices declined in
2014Q2 by 5.7 and 9.6 percent respectively. After reach-
ing $100/bbl in early 2011 for the first time since the
2008 financial crisis, crude oil prices have fluctuated
within a remarkably tight band around $105/bbl, which
is also within OPEC’s “desired range” (figure 3). In fact,
2011-13 has been one of the least volatile 3-year periods
of the recent history of the oil market. This pattern con-
tinued in the 2014Q2, when crude oil price averaged                  Source: World Bank, International Energy Agency.

political concerns and output disruptions (Ukraine, Libya
and Iraq) on the supply side, and changing developing-
country growth prospects on the demand side. Geopoliti-
cal risks have reemerged as the main driver of oil prices in
2014Q2 with events in Iraq and Ukraine playing a signifi-
cant part in the price increases during the quarter. Howev-
er, after peaking at $111/bbl in late June, prices reversed
course to $105/bbl by early July as production was not
disrupted in Iraq and Libya announced reopening of ex-
port ports that have been shut for nearly a year.

from tar sands, combined with rapidly rising U.S. shale liq-

natural gas supplies are increasing rapidly. The stock build-
up caused West Texas Intermediate (WTI, the U.S. mid-
continent price) to diverge from Brent (the international
marker) since early 2011. Although the spread reached a
high of 30 percent late that year, it narrowed to 6 percent in

Outlook and risks
Nominal oil prices are expected to average $106/bbl in
2014, $2/bbl higher than 2013 (table 1). This forecast is
$3/bbl higher than the April Global Market Outlook edi-
tion and for the most part reflects the geopolitical ten-
sions in Iraq. Oil prices are expected to ease to $104/bbl           Source: International Energy Agency.
in 2015. In the longer term, real prices are expected to
fall due to growing supplies of unconventional oil, effi-
ciency gains, and (less so) substitution away from oil. The          Figure 10       Energy prices
key assumption underpinning these projections reflects
the upper-end cost of developing additional oil capacity
from Canadian oil sands, currently estimated at $90/bbl
in constant 2014 dollars.

World demand for crude oil is expected to grow at less
than 1.5 percent annually over the projection period, with
all the growth coming from non-OECD countries, as has
been the case in recent years (figure 9). Consumption
growth in OECD economies will continue to be subdued
by slow economic growth and efficiency improvements
in vehicle transport induced by high prices—including a
switch to hybrid, natural gas, and electrically powered
transport. Pressure to reduce emissions due to environ-
mental concerns is expected to dampen demand growth                  Source: World Bank.
at the global level as well.

On the supply side, non-OPEC oil production is expected              Figure 11       Natural gas prices
to continue its upward climb, as high prices have prompt-
ed increased use of innovative exploration techniques
(including deep-water offshore drilling and extraction of
shale liquids) and the implementation of new extractive
technologies to increase the output from existing wells.

Last, prices of natural gas (in the U.S.) and coal are ex-
pected to remain low relative to crude oil and European
and Japanese natural gas prices as has been the case dur-
ing the past few years (figures 10 & 11). Some conver-

         Box 2         Although the ISIS insurgency did not disrupt Iraqi oil supplies, the country’s expected long term capacity
                       growth may not materialize

       Iraq, OPEC’s second (and the world’s seventh) largest producer, holds 140-150 billion barrels of world’s proven reserves
       which are also some of the least costly to extract. Iraq’s oil production reached 3.6 mb/d in February 2014, the largest output
       since 1979 (figure B2.1). A Sunni insurgency in June 2014 threated Iraqi oil supplies, causing a temporary spike in oil prices.
       Although prices quickly returned to pre-insurgency levels, longer term supply disruptions cannot be ruled out.

       A military campaign by the radical Sunni fighters (the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Sham, ISIS) that began in June has
       threatened the very foundation of Iraq. ISIS forces took over Mosul, Iraq’ second largest city on June 10 and continued their
       advance towards Baghdad. After controlling large areas in the North and West of the country, it appeared that they could
       advance on Baghdad. The territory captured contained Iraq’s largest refinery, two gas fields and two oil fields. Some of the
       international oil companies operating in Iraq evacuated non-essential staff. As the insurgency unfolded, the price of oil
       spiked to $111/bbl. After the ISIS advance stalled, it became clear that the turmoil has not affected Iraq’s oil production in
       the Shia dominated areas of the South and Kurdish areas of the North. The price of oil retreated below $105/bbl, effectively
       eliminating the “insurgency” risk premium.

       Iraq’s production in the first half of 2014 averaged 3.3 mb/d, up from the 3.1 mb/d in 2013. Of this, some 2.6 mb/d were ex-
       ported. June output fell to 3.2 mb/d as production from the Kirkuk oil field was shut—the refinery it feeds was taken over by
       ISIS. Exports from the Southern oil terminals near Basra were slightly down to 2.4 mb/d in June on logistical difficulties. Bar-
       ring any technical problems, oil exports are expected to return to 2.6 mb/d by the end of July.

       However, the unrest in Iraq has long-term implications as most of OPEC’s capacity growth is expected to come from Iraq.
       The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that Iraq will account for 60 percent of additional capacity during 2013-
       19. Even though these forecasts have been revised down, in its most recent Medium-term Oil Market Report, the IEA still
       expects Iraq to reach 4.5 mb/d of capacity by 2019, from the current 3.3 mb/d (figure B2.2 shows the additional capacity
       in 2019 expected by each OPEC member, which for Iraq is 1.2 mb/d). Iraq’s government has been even more ambi-
       tious—it plans to achieve output of 8.5-9.0 mb/d by 2020. While achievement of the government’s targets was questioned
       even before the insurgency took place, infrastructure bottlenecks along with labor and water shortages, as well as sec-
       tarian fighting could make even the IEA target of 4.5 mb/d ambitious.

       Although most of the current oil production capacity remained untouched by the insurgency, the risk remains that oil
       infrastructure might be targeted, causing significant and lengthy crude supply disruption. Such disruptions could have
       a significant effect on the global oil markets as some 2.5-3.0 mb/d of capacity is already off the market from other
       countries in the Middle East. So far, these outages have been counterbalanced almost barrel for barrel by rapid ex-
       pansion of unconventional oil production in North America (Energy section, figure 4). In such tightly balanced market,
       any additional outages could induce sharp price spikes. Some 60 percent of the Iraqi exports go to Asia with China
       and India, as the two largest consumers would likely be the ones affected the most. Europe and the US import rela-
       tively smaller amounts of Iraqi oil.

Agricultural prices moved very little and in a mixed man-
ner in 2014Q2. The overall agricultural price index is up
0.9 percent for the quarter but 0.8 percent lower than a
year ago. Among key sub-indices, grains are up less than
1 percent for the quarter (20 percent lower than a year
ago). Edible oils and meals declined more than 3 percent
in 2014Q2 but they are up 3 percent since a year ago.
Other food items increased 3 percent in the quarter
(figure 16). Beverages prices gained 11 percent in
2014Q2 (up 26 percent from a year ago), due to a weath-
er-induced rally in coffee (Arabica) prices.

underpin the agricultural commodity outlook. They in-               Figure 21       Raw material prices
clude crop conditions, energy prices, biofuels, and trade
policies. On crop conditions, it is assumed that the
2014/15 season’s outlook will be along normal trends. In
its July 2014 assessment, the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture estimated the 2014/14 crop season’s grain supplies
(production plus stocks of maize, wheat, and rice) at 2.65
billion tons, similar to current season’s crop and 5 per-
cent higher than last season’s crop. The level of supplies
is deemed adequate to maintain S/U ratios at normal
levels, following the historical lows reached a few years
ago. Yet, upside price risks exist, especially towards the
end of the calendar year, should 2014 become an El
Nino year. If so, the markets of rice, wheat, and some
edible oils may experience production shortfalls.
                                                                    Source: World Bank.
Although oil prices will remain elevated at $106/bbl in
2014 (declining to $104/bbl in 2015), fertilizer prices are
expected to decline considerably, 15 percent this year              Figure 22       Biofuels production
followed by another (marginal) decline next year. Given
the high energy intensity of agriculture (it is estimated to
be 4 to 5 times more energy intensive than manufacture),
the easing of fertilizer prices (some of which are closely
linked to natural gas prices) will relieve some of the input
price pressure that most food commodities have been
subjected during the past decade.

The outlook also assumes that biofuels will continue to
play a key role in the behavior of agricultural commodity
markets but less so than in the recent past. Currently,
production of biofuels corresponds to about 1.3 mb/d of
crude oil in energy-equivalent terms, up from 0.3 mb/s a
decade ago (figure 22). Biofuels are projected to grow
moderately over the projection period (much slower than             Source: International Energy Agency, BP.
earlier assessments) as policy makers realize that the
environmental and energy independence benefits of bio-
fuels do not outweigh their costs. Indeed, global produc-           Figure 23       Assets under management
tion of biofuels increased little during the past 3 years.

The outlook assumes that policy responses (especially
export bans) are unlikely to affect agricultural markets,
especially if they are well-supplied, which is currently the
case. If the baseline outlook for production materializes,
then policy actions are unlikely and, if they take place,
they will be isolated events with minimal impact.

Last investment fund activity which was on the rise until
2012, has stabilized (figure 23). According to Barclayhedge,
which tracks developments in the hedge fund industry,
assets under management in commodities (most of which
have been invested in energy and agricultural markets) have
been remarkably stable during the past three years. In fact,        Source: Barklayhedge.

 Box 3                Domestic drivers play a much more important role in Tanzania’s maize prices than external factors

This box examines the key drivers of maize prices in 18 Tanzanian markets. It concludes that, in the long run, domestic pric-
es are weakly influenced by external markets (proxied by Nairobi) but short-run price movements are driven by a number of
domestic factors. Discretionary trade policies delay in the adjustment of maize prices towards long-run equilibrium. The short
-run influence of weather shocks on local prices is also more pronounced during periods in which an export ban is imposed.
Harvest cycles, which have a strong influence on maize prices, signal the importance of improving storage and transporta-
tion in order to reduce seasonal price fluctuations which currently vary by 40 percent from trough to peak. Urban inflation
(proxy for non-energy input costs) and (less so) fuel prices were also found to be key drivers of maize prices.

External drivers

An econometric model examined the relationship between the 18 Tanzania maize markets and three external (“world”) pric-
es, namely, Nairobi, South Africa, and U.S. Gulf. Results show that the relationship between Tanzanian and Nairobi maize
prices is the strongest of the three external markets (table B3.1 shows the econometric results and figure B3.1 depicts the
19 Tanzania maize markets). U.S. Gulf maize prices were also found to have significant impacts on Tanzanian prices alt-
hough not as strong as Nairobi. The price relationship between Tanzanian and South African markets was weaker than for
the other markets (only results with Nairobi are reported in this box). An exception to the relationship between Tanzanian
and Nairobi maize prices were the southern regions of Tanzania where prices were more influenced by prices in Nampula,
the key maize market in northern Mozambique (Tschirley and Jayne 2009, Haggblade 2013). The price adjustments with
Nampula were much stronger than for Nairobi for regions in the southern zone and especially for the coastal regions of
Mtwara and Lindi. This confirms earlier findings that coastal trade is an important transmission mechanism connecting north-
ern Mozambique with the southern markets (Iliffe 1979).

Notes: The dependent variable is the change in the nominal price in market i. All regressions employ a fixed effects methodology with bootstrapped stand-
ard errors (100 replications). Z statistics are reported below the coefficients (in parenthesis). All regressions have market dummies. Significance levels: *** p
< 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. pti and p tw denote the nominal price in domestic market i and the world at time t ; p tF and ptI denote the price of fuel and
urban consumer price index; SEASON t1 and SEASON 2          t denote seasonality and are set to SINE [2πt/12] and COSINE [2πt/12]. BAN is the export ban
taking the value of one when effective and zero otherwise. NDVI t represents the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index anomaly, a weather proxy.
Last, μ and the γ ’ s are parameters to be estimated while ε ti denotes the error term. All prices have been expressed in logarithms. Detailed results on
individual markets along with robustness tests can be found in Baffes, Kshirsagar and Mitchell (2014). Regions (markets) are as follows: Central
(Dodoma, Singida, Tabora); Coastal (Dar es Salaam, Lindi, Morogoro, Mtwara); Lake (Bukoba, Musoma, Mwanza, Shinyanga); Northern (Arusha, Moshi,
Tanga); and Southern (Iringa, Mbeya, Songea, Sumbawanga). The analysis, which is based on an error-correction model (Baffes and Gardner 2003), was
applied to 18 Tanzanian maize prices and uses monthly data from January 2005 to October 2013.

Figure B3.2, which shows the cumulative price adjustment taking place within the first three months due to an external shock
confirms the slow nature of the adjustment process. For example, in only two markets (Bukoba and Musoma) the adjustment
exceeds 50 percent while in another four markets (Tanga, Arusha, Dar es Salaam, and Moshi) it exceeds 35 percent. Although
the six markets are mixed in terms of whether the respective region is surplus or deficit, they all share the characteristic of being
in proximity to Nairobi or having access to a port. There is considerable regional variation as well—the cumulative 3-month adjust-
ment ranges from 65 percent in Bukoba (Lake region) to 14 percent in Morogoro and Dodoma (both in the Southern region).

A number of key conclusions emerge from the price transmission analysis. First, of the three external markets considered,
only Nairobi exerts (a moderate) influence on Tanzanian prices in the long term. Second, the southern regions are more
closely linked to markets in northern Mozambique than Nairobi. Third, the markets that adjust most quickly to external price
changes all are in proximity to Nairobi or have access to a port. From a policy perspective, the results imply that concerns
emanating from the impact of short term and temporary spikes in world prices on domestic food markets of developing coun-
tries suggest a different interpretation.

Domestic drivers

During 2005-13 the government of Tanzania imposed five export bans. The first and second bans spanned January 2005 to
January 2007 with only a 3-month hiatus at the beginning of 2006. A 5-month export ban was in place in 2008, and a ban
which lasted almost 2-years was in effect during 2009 and 2010. The duration of the last ban during this period was less
clear—it was announced in March 2011, but only became effective in July and its removal was announced in October 2011
but ended in December 2011. The export bans (with the exception of the first one) appear to have been introduced at times
of high maize prices, and their removal took place when prices were low (figure B3.3). This is consistent with trade policy
responses undertaken by numerous developing countries during the past decade’s elevated food prices.

The parameter estimate of the export ban was highly significant in all six regions, with the coefficient of the Northern markets
being almost twice as large as the Southern markets (-4.48 versus -2.68). The estimate was not significantly different from
zero in six markets (based on market-specific regressions, not reported here). Three of these six markets where the export
ban was not found to be effective (Iringa, Mbeya, Mtwara, Singida, Songea, and Tabora) are located in the South, implying
that the ban may be not be effective in these markets, most likely due to inadequate monitoring of trade routes. The results
of the effect of the export ban are consistent with earlier literature (see, for example, Ihle, von Cramon-Taubadel, and Zorya
(2009) for Tanzania; Götz, Glauben, and Brümmer (2013) for Russia).

An export ban—which is more effective in the North—
amplifies local price movements. In contrast, it appears to
