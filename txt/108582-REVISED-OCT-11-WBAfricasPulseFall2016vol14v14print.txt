Summary
u	 After slowing to 3 percent in 2015, economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to fall
   to 1.6 percent in 2016, the lowest level in over two decades. Low commodity prices and tight
   financial conditions, exacerbated by domestic headwinds from policy uncertainty, droughts,
   and political and security concerns, continued to weigh on activity across the region. The overall
   slowdown in Sub-Saharan Africa’s growth reflects economic deterioration in the region’s largest
   economies. Economic performance was notably weak across oil exporters. At the same time, in
   about a quarter of the countries, economic growth is showing signs of resilience.
u	 Indeed,  the pattern of growth across countries is far from homogeneous, suggesting that Sub-
   Saharan Africa is growing at diverging speeds. While many countries are registering a sharp
   slippage in economic growth, some countries—Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania—are continuing
   to post annual average growth rates of over 6 percent, exceeding the top tercile of the regional
   distribution; and several other countries—including Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal—have moved into
   the top tercile of performers. The “established” and “improved” performers tend to have stronger
   quality of monetary and fiscal policies, better business regulatory environment, more diverse
   structure of exports, and more effective public institutions.
u	 Commodity    prices are expected to remain largely below their 2011–14 peaks, despite a recent
   pickup, reflecting the weak global recovery. Faced with growing financing needs, commodity
   exporters have begun to adjust, but the adjustment efforts remain uneven and insufficient.
   Against this backdrop, a modest rebound is foreseen in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2017. Economic
   growth is forecast to rise to 2.9 percent, before strengthening somewhat to 3.6 percent in 2018.
   Again, the regional average hides considerable heterogeneity among countries. The region’s
   largest economies and other commodity exporters are expected to see a modest increase in
   output growth as commodity prices continue to stabilize and inflationary pressures decline, lifting
   growth of private consumption and investment. Elsewhere, activity should continue to expand at
   a robust pace, supported in part by infrastructure investments.
u	 Risksto the outlook remain tilted to the downside. On the external front, old risks remain salient
   and include slower improvements in commodity prices and tighter global financial conditions. On
   the domestic front, policy makers may not enact the reforms needed to rebuild policy buffers and
   achieve macroeconomic stability. Uncertainties around upcoming elections, referenda, and policy
   direction in a number of countries represent risks as well. In some countries, security threats pose
   an additional source of risk.




                                                                                           A f r i c a’ s P u l s e   >   5
               u	 Adjustments  to macroeconomic policy are needed in many countries to address fiscal vulnerabilities,
                   improve domestic resource mobilization, and build adequate buffers to withstand periods of global
                   economic turbulence and tighter external finance conditions. In tandem, as countries look to bolster
                   medium-term growth prospects, accelerating the pace of structural reforms will remain key.
               u	 Increasing  agricultural productivity is central to transforming Sub-Saharan African economies and
                   promoting sustained and inclusive growth. However, agriculture output growth in the region has
                   largely been a result of expanding the area under cultivation rather than productivity gains: the
                   contribution of area expansion accounted for more than three times as much of the growth in
                   agriculture in the region relative to other developing countries.
               u	 Yet, conditions are in place for boosting the productivity of African agriculture and for sustainable
                   agricultural growth. African regional markets are growing rapidly—driven by population,
                   urbanization, and income growth—providing demand incentives and import substitution potential.
                   On the supply side, the prospects are promising as well, thanks to untapped yield potential and a
                   supportive political environment.
               u	 Unleashing    productivity improvements requires public investments in rural public goods. Although
                   investments to strengthen markets, develop and disseminate improved technologies, promote input
                   use, and build an agricultural information base have increased, they remain well under targets and
                   needs. Addressing the quality of public spending and the efficiency of resource use is even more
                   critical than addressing the level of spending. Sub-Saharan African countries grossly underfund
                   high-return investments, and rebalancing the composition of public agricultural spending could reap
                   massive payoffs. Most importantly, experience teaches us that investments need to tackle constraints
                   on different fronts. For reforms to be sustainable, they need to be anchored in managing political
                   pressures and use external processes as commitment devices.

Section 1: Recent Developments and Trends

  u	Against  a backdrop of stalling global trade, weak productivity performance, and rising policy
     uncertainty, global growth is expected to remain lackluster, falling to a projected 2.3 percent in
     2016 from 2.6 percent in 2015. Growth in advanced economies is expected to slow to 1.5 percent,
     and that across emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is projected to stay flat at
     3.5 percent, as activity remains depressed among commodity-exporting EMDEs.
  u	Economic    growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to decelerate to 1.6 percent in 2016,
     pulled down by unfavorable external conditions and domestic headwinds, and the outlook for
     2017 and beyond is only slightly favorable. Countries are growing at diverging speeds, with
     the region’s largest economies and oil exporters experiencing notably weak performance,
     and about a quarter of countries growing at a robust pace. The challenge for countries
     across the region is to adjust their monetary and fiscal policies so as to address mounting
     macroeconomic vulnerabilities and rebuild policy buffers. Yet, this adjustment has been
     uneven and insufficient so far.



The Global Economy
The global economy remains fragile. World growth in 2016 looks set to be softer than anticipated, reflecting
in large part further evidence of weak underlying momentum in major advanced economies (figure 1.1). In
particular, growth prospects in the Euro Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States, major destinations
for Sub-Saharan Africa’s exports, have deteriorated since June. In addition, commodity-exporting emerging
market and developing economies (EMDEs) continue to struggle to adjust to low commodity prices
and domestic headwinds. Growth in these economies is likely to be near zero again this year. In contrast,
commodity importers are generally proving to be resilient. In particular, growth in India remained robust,
with consumption bolstered by low commodity prices and sentiment lifted by the government’s efforts to
implement its reform agenda. In China, growth continues to slow gradually toward more sustainable levels,
as private investment decelerates

               Beyond demographic pressures, productivity growth has slowed in the post-crisis period, most
               noticeably in advanced economies, but also among large emerging markets. Failure to reverse this
               trend could have far-reaching implications for the outlook for the global economy. Productivity is the
               main driver of growth over the medium term, and is a key factor affecting expected returns and current
               investment decisions.

               Global trade has remained stagnant. Weak aggregate demand in advanced economies, the transition to
               slower and more domestically-oriented growth in China, and contraction in major commodity exporters
               continued to weigh on global trade in the first half of the year. These factors compounded more
               structural forces such as a slower pace of trade liberalization and global value chain integration. Global
               goods trade stagnated throughout the first half of 2016, its weakest pace since the Euro Area crisis in
               2012. Goods imports from major advanced economies as well as EMDEs were subdued, especially from
               commodity-exporting regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Available quarterly
               national accounts data suggest that goods and services trade continued to grow in the first half of the
               year, suggesting that services trade showed greater resilience.

               Capital flows declined noticeably in 2015, driven by concerns about slowing activity in large emerging
               economies, continued declines in commodity prices, a significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar,
               and fragile liquidity conditions. Capital flows, especially portfolio investment flows, have stabilized in
               recent months, as persistently low long-term interest rates in major advanced economies, as well as a
               bottoming out in commodity prices helped drive investors back into emerging market assets. However,
               a sustained recovery in capital flows might prove elusive in the absence of improving economic
               fundamentals. The low commodity price environment has negatively impacted the creditworthiness of
               commodity-exporting EMDEs, and reduced the attractiveness of investment in mining and exploration
               that supported foreign direct investment flows in the past. Crude oil prices are projected to average
               $43/bbl in 2016, which is close to prevailing levels, but down 15 percent from 2015. The oil market is
               gradually rebalancing, which is expected to drive prices to an estimated $53/bbl average in 2017.

               Orderly adjustments to the unexpected Brexit vote in June, and tentative signs of stabilization among
               systemically large commodity exporters (Brazil and the Russian Federation) have somewhat reduced
               tail risks in the short term. However, the global economy is fragile and facing pronounced downside
               risks. Short-term risks include a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China; monetary policy tightening
               by the U.S. Federal Reserve that surprises markets; uncertainty around upcoming elections, referenda,
               and policy direction in several countries; as well as security challenges. Borrowing costs remained
               low during the summer, but financial market conditions are fragile and subject to sudden bouts of
               volatility, especially given the perceived erosion of the monetary policy space that would be available
               to counteract further negative shocks. Emerging markets with preexisting vulnerabilities as a result of
               external imbalances, large financing needs, and unsustainable debt dynamics would likely be the most
               affected by financial market disruptions. Unstable security conditions in the Middle East continue to
               present the risk of a renewed wave of refugees, further protectionist tendencies, and policy uncertainty.
               Medium-term risks include those arising from mounting populist sentiment and slowing potential
               growth, including due to declining productivity growth and aging populations. Unless these challenges
               are addressed by robust policy actions, a broad-based slowdown in productivity growth amid rising


8   >   A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
demographic pressures could further hamper global growth potential. The materialization of some of
these risks could set back efforts to reduce poverty.

The latest economic indicators are, on balance, consistent with a slowdown in global activity in 2016 and
a modest pickup in 2017. Against a backdrop of stalling global trade, weak productivity, and rising policy
uncertainty, global growth is projected to fall to 2.3 percent in 2016 from 2.6 percent in 2015. Prospects
across most advanced economies have continued to deteriorate, with growth expected to slow to 1.5
percent from 2.1 percent in 2015. Growth across emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is
expected to stay flat in 2016, at 3.5 percent, as activity remains depressed among commodity-exporting
EMDEs. For 2017, global growth is projected to reach 2.7 percent, reflecting mainly a pickup of growth
in EMDEs. Growth in EMDEs is forecast to rise to 4.4 percent as a gradual recovery in commodity prices
helps boost activity in commodity-exporting EMDEs. Growth in advanced economies is projected to
rise slightly to 1.7 percent in 2017, reflecting a modest strengthening of activity in the United States.
Global activity is expected to continue to expand at a moderate pace of 2.9 percent in 2018, as growth in
advanced economies remains muted.

slow further in 2016 (figure 1.2). Shocks from collapsed commodity prices and tighter financial conditions,
exacerbated by domestic pressures arising from policy uncertainties, adverse weather conditions, and
political and security concerns, have continued to weigh on activity in the region. But the economic
performance of countries in the region is far from homogeneous. While many countries have registered a
sharp slippage in economic growth, a handful of countries have continued to post annual average growth
rates that exceed the top tercile

                Underlying the weak aggregate regional performance is deteriorating economic performance in Sub-
                Saharan Africa’s largest economies: Nigeria and South Africa—which together account for 50 percent of
                the region’s output. Both countries faced challenging macroeconomic conditions in the first half of the
                year. In Nigeria, the region’s largest oil exporter, GDP contracted by 2.1 percent (year-over-year, y/y) in
                the second quarter, following a 0.4 percent contraction in the first quarter. Low oil revenues, disruptions
                to oil production, delayed implementation of the 2016 budget, and a fall in manufacturing combined
                to push the economy into recession. South Africa’s GDP contracted by 0.1 percent (y/y) in the first
                quarter, weighed down by a deterioration in the mining sector and the effect of drought on agricultural
                production. Owing to an increase in manufacturing output and sustained growth in commerce and
                finance, which more than offset weaker retail sales, GDP growth rebounded to 0.6 percent (y/y) in the
                second quarter.

                More generally, oil exporters (Angola, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and South Sudan) have been
                severely affected by the decline in commodity prices, reflecting the limited diversification of their
                economies. In addition to the pullback in economic activity in Nigeria, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and
                South Sudan remained in deep recession in 2016. Although other commodity exporters are struggling
                as well, they have fared relatively better than the region’s oil exporters. While remaining positive,
                growth in Mozambique has decelerated significantly in the first half of the year. The discovery of
                previously undisclosed information on external debt guarantees of the government led to a significant
                deterioration in investor sentiment toward the economy. GDP rebounded in Botswana and Namibia,
                following a contraction in the fourth quarter of 2015, as the decline in mining production moderated.
                In many commodity-importing countries, activity has been resilient. In Rwanda, economic activity was
                strong in the first quarter, supported by growth in fixed investment, although it eased in the second
                quarter. Kenya and Mauritius also experienced sustained rates of GDP growth in the same period. Some
                commodity importers, such as Uganda, had a slow start to the year, with GDP growth decelerating in
                the first quarter due to weaker agricultural output as El Niño–related drought conditions resulted in a
                poor harvest.

                Growth remained under pressure in commodity-exporting countries in the third quarter of the year.
                In Angola, production has slowed as the national oil company continued to restructure its operations
                and revise its investment plans. In Nigeria, the composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to
                a record low 46.3 in August, remaining below the 50-mark—which denotes contraction—for the
                sixth consecutive month (figure 1.3). The low PMI reading signaled that the economic contraction
                that Nigeria experienced in the first half of the year may continue. Following a brief recovery in July,
                oil production fell sharply in August, owing in part to security problems in the oil-producing region.
                Foreign exchange shortages persist across the country as the adjustment toward a more flexible regime
                continues. Although the wedge between the official and parallel market rates has declined, it is still
                large as some administrative controls have remained in place. The foreign exchange shortages, coupled
                with delays in budgetary execution and intermittent electricity outages, continue to hamper activity
                in the country’s non-oil sector. In South Africa, manufacturing production increased by just 0.4 percent
                (y/y) in July, compared with 4.7 percent in June, while mining output decreased by 5.4 percent (y/y)
                following a 3.0 percent contraction in June. The PMI dropped by 6.2 points to 46.3 in August, driven by

commodity prices moderated
following a solid rebound in the second quarter. After rising 37 percent above the first quarter average
to an average of $47.70 a barrel in June, oil prices eased substantially in July on recovery of disrupted
oil supply. Against this backdrop and the expected reduction in inventories in the second half of
the year, the World Bank slightly raised its oil price forecast for 2016, from $41 per barrel in the April

Mounting vulnerabilities

While commodity prices have begun to recover, the improvements are insufficient to allow commodity
exporters to begin to rebuild substantially their eroded policy buffers. With internal and external
imbalances remaining large, there continues to be pressure on currencies, reserve positions,
and inflation.

                    offset the decline in oil exports. However, Angola saw a sharp contraction in export earnings that is
                    expected to widen its current account deficit to over 11 percent of GDP in 2016 from 8.5 percent of GDP
                    in 2015. Other oil exporters such as Cameroon and Gabon are also facing a deterioration of their current
                    account deficits as production declines compound the impact of oil prices. Among non-oil commodity
                    exporters, Mozambique is expected to see its current account deficit widen slightly, despite a significant
                    contraction in imports. In South Africa, an upswing in export growth in the second quarter, helped in
                    part by a weak rand, pushed the trade balance into surplus from a deficit in the first quarter. However,
                    outflows, including foreign direct investment (FDI) related dividend payments, and weak factor income
                    from operations of South African companies kept the current account deficit at more than 4 percent
                    of GDP in the first half of the year. Current account deficits are also expected to remain elevated in
                    most commodity importers in 2016, as the growth of imports of capital goods stays strong to meet the
                    demands of infrastructure investments. This is the case in Rwanda, where the current account deficit is
                    projected to edge up above 2015 levels of 13.6 percent of GDP, and in Togo, where the current account
                    deficit is expected to ease in 2016 but remain elevated at around 10 percent of GDP.

                    At the same time, capital inflows in the region have slowed, indicating that external financing has
                    become more challenging. In Nigeria, sharp declines in portfolio investment and FDI pulled capital
                    inflows down by 55 percent in the first quarter of the year, and outflows more than doubled. FDI flows
                    into Mozambique slowed on weakening investor sentiment, putting pressure on the country’s balance
                    of payments.

                    Eurobond issuance in the region has also dropped sharply (figure 1.6). So far this year, only Ghana and
                    South Africa have tapped the international bond market. Investors’ demand for higher yields has forced
                    other countries to postpone plans to issue Eurobonds. Yet, in contrast to developments observed at the
                    beginning of 2016, global financial markets experienced a period of relative tranquility between early
                    March and early June, following improvements in the global economy. Reflecting these developments,
                    sovereign bond spreads in the region fell from their February-March high (figure 1.7). Nevertheless,

                     much a real shock as a financial one,
                     the transmission of the real shock was
                     via the trade channel—affecting countries with stronger trade links with the European Union and, to a
                     lesser extent, with the United Kingdom. Overall, the effect of the Brexit was generally milder on African
                     economies than on other regions, because of the Africa region’s relatively weaker trade links with the
                     European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as the region’s relatively lower financial integration
                     with the rest of the world.

                     The large current account deficits put pressure on currencies. Amid tight financing conditions, increased
                     external strains were met in part with reserve drawdowns to support currencies, especially among oil-
                     exporting countries. The cumulative decline in international reserves in these countries was more than
                     30 percent between end-June 2014 and March 2016 (figure 1.8). Over this period, reserves decreased
                     by around 24 percent in Angola and 26 percent in Nigeria. Reserves also declined in other commodity
                     exporters, including by over 35 percent in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo as
                     export receipts and FDI flows fell sharply. Among commodity importers, the decline in reserves was most
                     pronounced in Tanzania (15 percent) and Uganda (over 19 percent). Weaker reserve positions mean less
                     room for monetary authorities to respond to foreign currency pressures.

                       needs continue to rise. In contrast, South Africa saw the rand rebound on the back of solid export
                       growth that helped improve the trade balance. Export growth has also remained resilient in Kenya,
                       helping to keep the Kenyan shilling stable. In real effective terms, most currencies have remained
                       relatively stable. With abandonment of the peg, the Nigerian naira has been depreciating in real terms,
                       which should help support some economic restructuring and boost exports.

                       Pass-through of deep currency depreciations contributed to a surge in inflation in Angola, Mozambique,
                       and Nigeria. In August, headline inflation reached 17.6 percent (y/y) in Nigeria, 38 percent (y/y) in
                       Angola, and over 20 percent (y/y) in Mozambique (figure 1.10). The surge in inflation in these countries
                       has forced central banks to tighten monetary policy aggressively. In Nigeria, the central bank raised the

keep inflation within the central
bank target in Kenya and Uganda. In recent months headline inflation has eased in Ghana and Zambia,
and moved within the central bank target in South Africa. Elsewhere, inflation continued to stay low in
CFA franc zone countries in West and Central Africa, reflecting the stable peg to the Euro. In September,
the Central Bank of Kenya cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10 percent, while the Central
Bank of Nigeria left the monetary policy rate unchanged. The South African Reserve Bank also kept its
benchmark repurchase rate steady at 7 percent, despite an improvement in the inflation outlook and the
weak growth outlook for the economy.

in oil exporters are expected to
deteriorate noticeably in 2016. In
many of these countries (Angola, Chad, Equatorial Guinea) the fiscal consolidation efforts that began in
2015 slowed in 2016, even though oil revenues remained depressed (figure 1.12). In 2015, in response
to the decline in oil prices, Angola reduced fuel subsidies, raised taxes and cut expenditures. However,
the country undertook no significant adjustment this year. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to
rise sharply, driven by a large public sector wage bill. In other countries (Cameroon, Chad, South Sudan),


                                                                                                                                  A f r i c a’ s P u l s e     >    15
                 public expenditure rose, with no commensurate increase in government revenue. In South Sudan, a
                 collapse in revenues and sharp rise in military spending amid a political conflict are expected to result in
                 an exceptionally large fiscal deficit in 2016.

                 However, efforts to reduce spending and increase revenue to stabilize government debt are helping to
                 bring the fiscal deficit down in some countries. In Ghana, for example, where the fiscal deficit reached
                 over 10 percent of GDP in 2014, adjustment under an International Monetary Fund program is expected
                 to bring the deficit down further in 2016, after it was cut to 5 percent of GDP in 2015. Fiscal deficits are
                 also expected to narrow in commodity exporters such as Botswana, Guinea, Namibia, and Niger. In South
                 Africa, policy makers’ efforts to mobilize revenues are expected to narrow the fiscal deficit. Where remedial
                 actions have been limited (Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe), fiscal deficits have deteriorated. By contrast, fiscal
                 balances have improved in a few commodity importers (Benin and Senegal), helped by a slowdown in the
                 pace of fiscal spending. However, in several commodity importers where growth has been robust, fiscal
                 policies have not been sufficiently countercyclical (box 1.2). As a result, in these countries, fiscal deficits
                 have remained elevated (Kenya and Togo) or increased (Ethiopia, Mali, Rwanda, and Uganda). Fiscal
                 deficits are also expected to rise in some fragile countries (the Central African Republic and the Comoros)
                 because of the government’s increased spending to improve security conditions.

                 Government debt has continued to rise in the region amid large fiscal deficits (figure 1.13). There are
                 wide variations across countries, however. Excluding Nigeria, where debt ratios have remained low,
                 government debt indicators in oil exporters are expected to worsen in 2016. In this group, the largest
                 rise in government debt relative to GDP is expected in Angola. Among other commodity exporters,
                 Mozambique is expected to see its public debt exceed 100 percent of GDP after new information
                 exposed government guarantees on debt by several state-owned enterprises. Angola, Mozambique,
                 and the Republic of Congo saw their credit ratings cut because of concerns about debt sustainability.
                 By contrast, reflecting ongoing efforts to stabilize the economy, government debt is expected to
                 increase only slightly in Ghana. Among commodity importers, Ethiopia could see a notable increase
                                                                                                                                  in government debt, as the

weak global demand (figure
1.15). Although commodity
exporters across the region have begun to adjust to lower commodity revenues, the adjustment
remains incomplete and at varying speeds. Against this backdrop, a modest recovery is expected in the
region. Real GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to grow 2.9 percent in 2017, before rising moderately
to 3.6 percent in 2018. However, these aggregate growth rates will continue to hide considerable
heterogeneity across the region—continuing the pattern of divergent growth speeds. While the larger
economies and other commodity exporters are expected to see a modest uptick in growth, activity is
expected to continue to expand at a solid pace in the rest of the region.

Private consumption growth in commodity exporters, which weakened significantly over the past two
years, is expected to improve gradually. The increase in headline inflation and hike in the interest rate
by the Central Bank of Nigeria, which have accompanied the shift to a more flexible exchange rate,
have weighed on private consumption in the country. However, the exchange rate policy adjustment,


                                                                                                                                             A f r i c a’ s P u l s e     >     17
                coupled with the modest improvement in oil prices, should help boost oil revenues in naira terms. This,
                in turn, should enable the federal and state governments to meet their financial obligations, including
                the clearance of salary arrears, and help boost demand. In South Africa, the easing of inflationary
                pressures and a moderate improvement in employment should help improve consumer confidence.
                Stable currencies, lower inflation, and improved agricultural production should support real incomes and
                consumer spending in commodity importers. However, food price inflation due to droughts in several
                countries, high unemployment as in South Africa and Nigeria, and the price-level impact of currency
                depreciation, combined with interest rate increases, could moderate these effects.

                Investment growth is also expected to pick up gradually in commodity exporters in 2017, following a sharp
                slowdown in 2016. In Nigeria, policy reforms are helping to improve the environment for private investment.
                The fuel shortages that had severely impacted activity in the first half of 2016 have eased following an
                increase in fuel prices. The tightening of monetary policy should help stabilize the naira, strengthen real
                interest rates, and encourage a return of international investment in the economy. Meanwhile, the move
                toward looser monetary policy in advanced economies has helped bolster the rand. This has tempered
                import price pressures in South Africa and prompted the Reserve Bank to pause the interest rate hiking
                cycle, which should help improve investor sentiment. In several low-income, non-oil commodity exporters,
                governments are expected to continue their program of infrastructure development, with a large number of
                projects beginning construction this year and in 2017 in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. For
                example, the construction of the oil pipeline between Uganda and Tanzania is scheduled to begin in early
                2017. To finance these projects, these countries continue to draw on public-private partnerships (Rwanda),
                donor aid (Rwanda and Tanzania), and financing from Chinese entities (Ethiopia and Tanzania).

                A prudent fiscal policy stance in commodity exporters is expected to underpin a gradual shift toward growth-
                enhancing public spending, as the continued stabilization of commodity prices helps improve fiscal balances.
                Nigeria’s shift to a more flexible exchange rate regime, coupled with the stabilization of oil prices, is expected
                to give a boost to government revenue and alleviate public investment cuts, while phasing out fuel subsidies
                should help contain current expenditures. In South Africa, the 2016/17 budget introduced fiscal measures
                that should strengthen consolidation efforts. Ongoing efforts across the region to rein in public spending
                while boosting domestic revenue so as to stabilize public debt are also expected to continue.

                However, net exports will continue to exert a drag on growth in the region. Low commodity prices,
                despite recent improvements, will continue to weigh on export revenues. External demand from advanced
                economies is expected to remain subdued, given their moderate prospects for medium-term growth.
                In commodity importers, private consumption will boost demand for imported products, including
                food and fuels, while investment spending will keep capital goods imports high. However, the drag on
                growth should ease gradually as commodity prices rise and import growth slows on the back of maturing
                investment projects.

                Against this backdrop, the following trends are expected across the region:

                u	Among       the region’s three largest economies, Nigeria is expected to endure an economic contraction
                    in 2016, as declining oil production and manufacturing weigh on activity. Although challenges



18   >   A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
  remain, the economy is expected to rebound moderately in 2017 as the long-delayed expansionary
  budget begins to be implemented, oil prices stabilize, and oil production increases. The shift to a
  more flexible exchange rate regime is also expected to encourage some FDI to return. In South Africa,
  GDP is expected to grow marginally in 2016 and pick up moderately in 2017. Private consumption is
  expected to remain weak owing to rising unemployment, high household indebtedness, and elevated
  inflation. Investment growth is expected to remain sluggish because of policy uncertainty and long-
  standing structural issues, including unstable power supplies. Angola will continue to struggle with
  slow economic growth, as a combination of low oil prices, high inflation, and tight policy weighs on
  private consumption and investment.

u	In   the region’s frontier markets, the outlook is relatively more favorable. Growth in Ghana could slow in
  2016 due to oil production outages. However, the outlook for 2017 is largely positive. The launch of a
  new oil field in the second half of 2016 should help improve fiscal and external positions. Investment
  is expected to rise as macroeconomic conditions continue to improve and energy supply increases.
  Private consumption should benefit from falling inflation as policy becomes more accommodative.
  Economic activity will bottom out in Zambia in 2016 and begin a modest recovery in 2017. Improving
  rainfall, as El Niño abates, will help support an increase agricultural output and hydroelectricity
  production. Copper mining sector activity is also expected to begin to pick up gradually as improving
  copper prices encourage companies to raise production. By contrast, growth will remain strong in
  Côte d’Ivoire in 2016 and 2017, boosted by government investment projects. Activity in Kenya is also
  expected to continue to expand at a steady and robust pace, driven by private consumption and
  public infrastructure investment. As a large commodity importer, Kenya continues to benefit from low
  oil prices, which have helped stabilize the Kenyan shilling and keep inflation within the target.

u	The   outlook for the region’s low-income countries includes a modest pickup in growth in oil and
  mineral exporters as they continue to adjust to low commodity prices. Growth will remain weak
  among oil exporters over the next two years. Declining production due to maturing oil fields
  will compound low oil prices in Chad, while conflict will reduce consumption and investment in
  South Sudan. Many other non-oil exporters will continue to struggle, with activity expanding at
  a moderate pace. In Mozambique, after slowing in 2016 on the back of declining investment and
  weak commodity prices, activity is expected to rebound gradually in 2017 as recent progress in
  developing the nascent energy sector helps boost investment in the country’s huge gas sector.
  Growth will remain below trend in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as weak investment due to
  political tensions compounds the effects of low copper prices, and as inflation driven by a weakening
  exchange rate weighs on private sector demand. A slow post-Ebola recovery is foreseen in Guinea,
  Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as low commodity prices weigh on growth, pushing back investment plans
  and reducing exports. Political uncertainties will continue to exert a drag on economic growth in
  Burundi, the Comoros, and Zimbabwe. For most other low-income countries, including Rwanda,
  Senegal, and Tanzania, growth is expected to remain robust, supported by public investment. In
  Ethiopia, the government’s commitment to the second phase of its Growth and Transformation Plan
  will see continued state infrastructure buoy growth despite adverse weather conditions.

                Risks to the outlook

                The balance of risks to the outlook remains heavily tilted to the downside.

                u	On    the external front, an earlier-than-anticipated tightening cycle in the Unites States or the Euro Area
                    could trigger a strong decline in capital flows to emerging and frontier markets in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    The environment of lower-for-longer yields in advanced economies has seen a surge of capital flows
                    into the region in recent years. A sustained reversal of such flows could likely hit hard the more heavily
                    traded currencies, such as the South Africa rand. This would also have significant adverse corporate
                    balance sheet effects as well as repercussions for banking systems.

                u	The    baseline assumes a smooth transition to sustainable growth in China. However, a sharper-than-
                    expected slowdown in China could weigh on demand for export commodities and undermine their
                    prices. Slower-than-expected improvements in commodity prices will affect revenue growth, which
                    would continue to strain fiscal and current account balances, forcing deeper expenditure cuts that
                    could weaken the growth recovery. The Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia stand out as the
                    most vulnerable to a significant slowdown in Chinese growth.

                u	The    uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union has introduced a
                    new downside risk to growth across Sub-Saharan Africa. Recent activity data appear to suggest that
                    the impact of the Brexit vote has been so far mild and localized in the United Kingdom. However, in
                    an environment of increased uncertainty and rising risks to growth, investment flows from European
                    firms could slow, which would exacerbate the adverse impact of the decline in commodity prices
                    on FDI flows into the region. Weaker tourist arrivals could hurt the economies of some countries,
                    such as Mauritius and the Seychelles, which benefit significantly from tourism as a major driver of
                    employment and growth.

                These risks would be exacerbated if, on the domestic front, policy makers do not adjust to the
                commodity price shock, policy uncertainties deepen, severe weather conditions continue, political
                uncertainties persist, and security conditions deteriorate.

                u	Although      several commodity exporters have begun to adjust to low commodity revenues, the
                    adjustment has been limited even as vulnerabilities have mounted. With commodity prices remaining
                    low, deeper adjustment would be needed to contain fiscal and current account deficits and rebuild
                    policy buffers. The risk is that this adjustment may not be forthcoming if economic conditions
                    continue to deteriorate. This would likely extend the period of weak growth across the region,
                    especially among oil exporters. Weak fiscal management will keep borrowing requirements high,
                    making financing fiscal deficits challenging. In some countries, credit downgrades remain a significant
                    risk if ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts are not sustained. In some countries, political divisions
                    present an added risk, as they may prompt the adoption of populist policies by the governing party or
                    lead to a protracted legal and political crisis, hampering efforts to tackle important fiscal challenges.

u	The   adjustment to the commodity price shock will need to include stronger efforts to strengthen
  domestic resource mobilization, to reduce overdependence on revenue from the resource sector.
  In particular, resource-rich countries would benefit from improving their non-resource tax systems.
  Stronger efforts to broaden the tax base, strengthen tax administration, and boost efficiency would
  help increase domestic revenue.

u	Meanwhile,   continued severe weather conditions would undermine food security in the region
  and exacerbate inflationary pressures. After severe drought decimated crop harvests and curtailed
  hydroelectricity generation in parts of Southern and Eastern Africa, a return to normal weather
  conditions is expected in 2017. However, a stronger-than-expected La Niña weather cycle could bring
  severe flooding that would be as damaging as the recent droughts were.

u	Among    other risks, an increase in militant insurgencies and terrorist attacks would adversely affect
  activity in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, and Nigeria.

As countries look to rebuild growth momentum, urgent attention is needed to accelerate structural
reforms that will boost productivity and provide the basis for sustainable and inclusive growth. In this
context, increasing agricultural productivity is central to transforming African economies and improving
livelihoods. Section 3 of the report includes a focus on enhancing agricultural productivity through
improving the quality of public spending on agriculture, complemented by an enabling
policy environment.

Box 1.1:        Brexit Surprise
Short-Run
Impact of the   In a previous note in Africa’s Pulse, we analyzed the impact of the Taper Tantrum on emerging economies,
Brexit          and particularly on African economies.a The note showed that the effect of the Taper Tantrum was mostly
                financial; it affected the countries (through larger exchange rate depreciation and steeper decline in the
                stock market) that had received large capital inflows in the preceding period and had large and liquid
                financial markets from which international investors could easily withdraw. African economies were largely
                insulated from the turmoil by virtue of their low integration in international capital markets and shallower
                and less liquid financial markets.
                The Brexit Surprise (the surprise outcome of the United Kingdom’s European Union membership
                referendum) was initially perceived to be an event analogous to the tapering talk. The Brexit similarly
                rattled the financial markets in emerging countries when international investors seemed to have switched
                to a flight to safety mode. In this note, we ask whether the Brexit Surprise had effects similar to the Taper
                Tantrum, and whether the effects on African economies differed from those on emerging countries in
                other regions.
                The initial impact of the Brexit seemed remarkably similar to that of the Taper Tantrum, in that stock
                markets declined and exchange rates depreciated in a substantial number of emerging markets. But the
                impact of the Brexit turned out to be shorter-lived—the impact peaked in the first two post-Brexit days of
                trading. In addition, the Brexit Surprise was seemingly perceived by investors to be as much a real shock as
                a financial shock. The real shock transmitted mainly via trade—affecting countries with stronger trade links
                with the European Union and, to a lesser extent, with the United Kingdom. Just like the Taper Tantrum,
                the effect of the Brexit was milder on African economies. This time around it was not just because of their
                lower financial integration with the rest of the world, but also their weaker trade links with the United
                Kingdom and particularly the European Union.
                Short-Run Impact of the Brexit on Emerging Economies
                We follow Eichengreen, Gupta, and Ospino Rojas (2016) in understanding the impact of the Brexit. We
                extend their sample of about 50 emerging markets to include several African countries. The main criterion
                for including countries in the analysis is the availability of daily data for exchange rates and stock markets
                around the Brexit episode. Consistent data are available for eight countries from the Africa region (Ghana,
                Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia).
                Figures B1.1.1 and B1.1.2 depict stock market return change and exchange rate depreciation, respectively,
                for the two trading days after the Brexit, from June 23 to 27, 2016. Significant heterogeneity is visible in the
                impact across emerging markets, as well as across African economies.
                The impact of the Brexit was greatest for the Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European (CESEE)
                countries—the average impacts were -4.1 percent on stock markets and 2.4 percent on exchange rates
                for these countries. In comparison, the average impacts on stock markets and exchange rates were -2.1
                and 0.9 percent for non-African non-CESEE countries, and -1.8 and 1 percent for African countries in the
                sample.b These effects are statistically the same for African countries and non-African non-CESEE countries,
                but different for CESEE countries from the other two groups.
                Who Was Hit and Why?
                Here we explore the variables with which the impact of the Brexit on equity and foreign exchange markets
                is correlated. We first ask whether the countries with a recent deterioration in growth outlook experienced
                larger exchange rate depreciations or stock market corrections. Using data on the revision in the growth
                forecast for 2016 for each country from the World Economic Outlook, comparing the April 2016 and
                October 2015 editions, Eichengreen, Gupta, and Ospino Rojas (2016) show that there is no evidence of a
                link between the change in the growth outlook and the impact of the Brexit Surprise.

                Source: Data are from the International Monetary Fund’s Direction of Trade Statistics.
                Note: The variable is exports destined for the United Kingdom as a share of gross domestic product. Both relationships are significant at the 5 percent level.




                Interestingly, trade with the European Union seemed to matter more than trade with the United Kingdom.
                When we include both values in the regressions (table B1.1.1), it is trade with the European Union that has
                significant coefficients. When it comes to emerging markets, evidently, the fears investors had were for the
                economic prospects of Europe as much as just the United Kingdom. Since the European Union is a more
                important market than the United Kingdom for CESEE economies, this possibly explains the larger impact
                on CESEE countries.

Source: Data are from IMF 2015.
Note: Private external finance includes loans, bonds, and equities received during 2012–14. Following Eichengreen and Gupta (2014), private external finance is considered here as a proxy for
the size of financial markets. The coefficients for stock market response are significant at the 5 percent level.




Table B1.1.1 summarizes our main results: export exposure—to the European Union more than just the
United Kingdom—consistently helps explain which emerging markets reacted most negatively to the
Brexit Surprise. In addition, external financial exposure, as measured by capital inflows in the prior period
or the stock of external liabilities, helps to explain which emerging stock and foreign exchange markets
declined most sharply, although these results are less robust than in our earlier analysis of the tapering
episode.

Extrapolating from the empirical findings, the reason for the relatively mild impact of the Brexit on African
countries seems to be their weaker trade links with the United Kingdom and European Union, as well as
that the size of the financial markets and extent of foreign capital is relatively small in African countries.

different from other types of expenditures, since its services are spread over many years.a

In general, countercyclical fiscal policy is a desirable feature to counterbalance economic cycles. In
other words, during “bad times” (recessions), an above-the-trend increase in government consumption
expenditure might be a useful tool to boost the economy. However, the other side of countercyclical
behavior is often forgotten, that is, during “good times” (expansion), government consumption expenditure
should increase below the trend, not only as a mechanism to avoid overheating the economy, but also to
gain room by saving the extra income for future smoothing of adverse demand-side shocks.

Regression analysis covering the period 1970-2014 finds that Sub-Saharan Africa has a positive relationship
between the cyclical components of government consumption and GDP, and the size of the coefficient
is larger than that for Latin America, the other region with a statistically significant pro-cyclical coefficient.
Although developing Asia has a positive coefficient, it is not statistically significant. The coefficient for high-
income countries is slightly negative and statistically significant, which is preliminary evidence that this
group of economies has implemented more countercyclical fiscal policies than other groups during the
past 45 years.

a negative correlation between the cyclical components of government consumption and GDP in both
periods. However, 26 countries are still in the pro-cyclical quadrants, with almost half of them classified as
having acyclical fiscal policies, since their correlation coefficients are not statistically different from zero.
A comparative analysis of the cyclical properties at the regional level before and after 2000 suggests that
developing regions have either reduced the degree of pro-cyclicality, like in Sub-Saharan Africa, or shifted
to more countercyclical policies, like in Latin America and developing Asia (figure B1.2.2). However, all
these changes are still not statically significant, which is consistent with an acyclical stance of fiscal policy
during 2000–14. The reduction in the degree of pro-cyclicality in recent years has been the result of better
fiscal management, particularly during the expansion phase of the cycle, which better prepared many
developing countries (including those in Sub-Saharan Africa) to face the international financial crisis in
2008/09.

Section 2: Resilient Growth in Some Sub-Saharan African
Countries Amid Economic Challenges

   Post-global financial crisis performance in the region as a whole has not been as stellar as it was
  u	
    in the pre-crisis period. However, there are some diverging growth experiences across countries.
    We can distinguish four groups of growth performers according to the behavior of real output
    growth in the pre- and post-crisis periods: established, improved, slipping, and falling behind
    growth performers.

   Established and improved performers, with more resilient growth, comprise over a quarter of
  u	
    the region’s countries, house 41 percent of its population, and produce 21 percent of its output.
    Slipping and falling behind countries account for nearly 40 percent of the region’s countries, have
    36 percent of its population, and produce 62 percent of its output.

   Established and improved performance have better quality macroeconomic policy frameworks—
  u	
    especially on the monetary front. However, all countries have recently experienced fiscal
    slippages.

   On structural reforms, established and improved performers have made more progress in
  u	
    business regulation, rule of law, and government effectiveness. Rwanda is one of the fastest
    reformers in the region.

   Finally, established and improved performers have more diversified export structures than the
  u	
    other groups of countries, but they are still below the developing country average. Efforts in Côte
    d’Ivoire to diversify within the cocoa industry by adding value are a noteworthy example.




Diverging growth experiences
The Sub-Saharan Africa region grew at an annual average rate of 3.1 percent during 2014–16 vis-à-vis a
rate of about 5 percent in the pre–global financial crisis period (1995–2008). However, the patterns of
growth across countries were not homogeneous in 1995–2008 or in the current context (2014–16). For
instance, real gross domestic product (GDP) in Angola, Rwanda, and Uganda grew at an annual average
rate that exceeded 7 percent in 1995–2008, but it did not surpass 2 percent in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Gabon, and Guinea-Bissau.

The region’s economic performance in the post–global financial crisis period has not been as stellar as
it was in the pre-crisis period. The region as a whole experienced a marked growth deceleration—GDP
grew at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent in 2011–16 compared with 7.3 percent in 2003–08.




                                                                                             A f r i c a’ s P u l s e   >   31
                In per capita terms, this represents a drop from an annual rate of 4.5 percent in 2003–08 to 0.9 percent in
                2011–16. Recent developments suggest that the global environment might be less conducive to growth
                for developing countries—and, notably, Sub-Saharan Africa—over the next several years than it was in
                the recent past. Global trade is growing at a much faster pace than global economic activity, whereas
                global commodity prices—notably, energy and extractives—are predicted to remain at lower levels.

                However, some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa showed signs of resilience, growing at faster rates
                than others in 2014–16. For instance, the average annual growth rate of GDP exceeded 7 percent in
                this period in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, while it failed to surpass 2 percent per annum (ppa)
                in Botswana, Guinea, Liberia, and South Africa. Is the Sub-Saharan Africa region growing at divergent
                speeds? If so, which countries are growing faster in the current context (2014–16)? Were these countries
                also growing at a faster speed during 1995–2008? Or have some countries improved their performance?
                At the same time, were there good performers in 1995–2008 that slipped in the post-crisis period?

                The goal of this section is to implement specific criteria to: (a) identify countries with strong and weak
                growth in the region during the current juncture (2014–16); (b) identify within each group those that
                have consistently had strong or weak growth, those that have improved, and those that have slipped
                during the past two decades; and (c) examine the links between the quality of policies and institutions
                and better economic performance.


                Implementing a taxonomy of growth performers
                in the region
                To identify countries in the region with strong or weak growth in the current juncture (2014–16) as
                well as the persistence/dynamics of that growth rate vis-à-vis the period 1995–2008, we examine the
                evolution of the rate of GDP growth for a sample of 45 Sub-Saharan African countries.1 The countries
                in the region were categorized into four groups based on the comparison of their average annual GDP
                growth rates during 1995–2008 and 2014–16. The classification into strong or weak growth was based on
                the computed top and bottom terciles of the average annual growth rate of the 45 countries between
                1995 and 2008—that is, 5.4 and 3.5 percent, respectively. Other countries (16) are not in the top or
                bottom tercile in 2014-16. Growth performance of a country is sensitive to the nature of exogenous
                shocks that may have occurred in the two periods that are covered in the analysis.

                According to their growth performance, the countries can be classified into four groups (figure 2.1):

                Established. The first group of countries registered an annual average growth rate that exceeds the top
                tercile in both periods (1995–2008 and 2014–16). The group of established growth performers consists
                of five countries, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania. This group houses about 21 percent
                of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa and produces 9 percent of the region’s total GDP. The average
                GDP growth rate of the established growth performers was 6.8 percent in 1995–2008 and 7.8 percent




                1	 This sample of countries excludes Eritrea, Somalia, and South Sudan, as these countries do not have full data for the growth rate of GDP throughout the period 1995–2016.

in 2014–16. The best performer of the established group in 1995–2008 was Rwanda (10.9 ppa), and in
2014–16, Ethiopia (9.4 ppa). In spite of the fact that GDP growth is declining and expected to be at 3.6
percent in 2016, the average growth for 2014-16 in Mozambique is still above the top tercile (5.9 percent
per year in 2014-16).

Improved. This group is characterized by those countries with a growth rate below the top tercile of the
Sub-Saharan Africa distribution in 1995–2008, but with a rate of GDP growth in 2014–16 greater than
the top tercile. It comprises seven countries: Benin, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Kenya, Senegal, and Togo. About 20 percent of the population of the region lives in this group
of countries, and they produce about 11.8 percent of the region’s total GDP. The group of improved
performers saw their GDP growth rate increase from 2.9 percent in 1995–2008 to 5.8 percent in 2014–
16. The largest growth acceleration among the improved performers was experienced by Côte d’Ivoire
and the Democratic Republic of Congo (with an increase in the rate of GDP growth that exceeded 400
basis points between the two periods). Despite the fact that the growth rate is expected to decelerate
in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 2.7 percent in 2016, real GDP grew on average 7 percent per
year in 2014-16.

                Slipping. This is a group of economies with a decelerating GDP growth rate; that is, their average annual
                growth rate in 1995–2008 exceeded the bottom tercile of the Sub-Saharan Africa growth distribution,
                but the GDP growth rate in 2014–16 fell below the bottom tercile. The slipping group comprises 11
                countries: Angola, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Liberia, Madagascar,
                Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and South Africa. The group of slipping performers makes up only 31.7 percent
                of the region’s population, but produces 60.4 percent of its GDP. The GDP growth rate declined from
                5.8 ppa in 1995–2008 to 1.9 ppa in 2014–16. This group of performers includes not only the two largest
                economies in the continent (Nigeria and South Africa), but also oil rich countries (Angola, Chad, and
                Equatorial Guinea). Within the group of slipping countries, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone
                suffered the largest declines in GDP growth. This reversal of fortunes is related to the sharp collapse in oil
                prices in the case of Equatorial Guinea, whereas the Ebola epidemic and the drop in iron ore prices were
                the culprits in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

                Falling behind. This group of economies displayed the weakest growth trajectory throughout 1995–2008
                and 2014–16; that is, GDP growth failed to surpass the bottom tercile in both periods. The falling behind
                group is comprised mostly of fragile states, as well as small (mainland and island) countries, namely,
                Burundi, the Comoros, Guinea, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. The six countries in the falling behind
                group house 4.4 percent of the region’s total population and produce only about 2 percent of its total
                GDP. The average annual GDP growth rate of the falling behind growth performers was 0.9 percent in
                1995–2008 and 1.8 percent in 2014–16. Among the falling behind countries, Swaziland and Guinea are
                the countries with the largest growth contractions (1.6 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively), and the
                former displays the lowest growth rate in 2014-16 (about 1.2 percent per year).

                Map 2.1 shows that the different groups of established, improved, slipping, and falling behind performers are
                not necessarily clustered geographically in the region. This may be interpreted as lack of interconnectedness
                across countries in the region in terms of trade or financial linkages. At the same time, there is a group of
                performers that is excluded from the subsequent discussion of growth performance. This group of countries,
                the stuck in the middle performers, had a growth rate in 2014–16 that exceeded the bottom tercile but was
                lower than the top tercile. This group comprises 16 countries, houses 19.9 percent of the total population
                of the region, and produces 15.5 percent of its output. The full configuration of growth performers in the
                region—according to the criteria established here—can be seen in annex A.

                How does the growth experience of the established, improved, slipping, and falling behind groups
                translate into the evolution of living standards? Figure 2.2 plots the evolution of (population-weighted)
                real GDP per capita for these four groups of countries since 1966. It shows that:

                •	 Real income per capita among established performers—the lowest of the four groups throughout the
                    period—is somewhat converging to that of the other three groups. The group’s real income per capita
                    started a steady increase since 1995 and grew at an annual average rate of 4.6 percent per year since 2001.

                •	 Real income per capita among the falling behind countries has experienced a steady decline since
                    1998 with GDP per capita falling at an annual average rate of 1.6 percent.

                Anatomy of growth across the different
                groups of performers
                The patterns of growth of the established, improved, slipping, and falling behind performers in Sub-
                Saharan Africa can be assessed from two different lenses. One is by examining the evolution of growth
                and size at the sector level, namely the dynamics of economic activity in agriculture, industry (especially
                manufacturing), and services. The other is by assessing the sources of growth per worker in the different
                groups of countries. Specifically, this is done by computing the contribution of factor accumulation
                (physical and human capital) and total factor productivity (TFP) among the different groups of
                performers in Sub-Saharan Africa.


                Sector growth

                Table 2.1 presents the share of the different sectors of economic activity, the growth rate of the value
                added of each sector, as well as its contribution to GDP for the four groups of countries in 1995–2008
                and 2014–15. In the case of the participation of the different sectors of economic activity, the share of
                agriculture in GDP declines over time, whereas that of industry and services increases among established
                performers. However, the rising share of industry is attributed to non-manufacturing activities
                (construction, mining, and quarrying, among others)—as the share of manufacturing declines over time.
                Among improved countries, the share of agriculture declines while that of services increases —with
                the share of industry remaining unchanged. Zooming in on the industry sector shows that the relative
                constancy is the outcome of a lower share in manufacturing that is partly offset by a higher share in
                non-manufacturing activities. In the case of slipping and falling behind countries, the share of agriculture
                in GDP declines, although at a faster pace in the case of the latter group. The share of industry (as well as
                manufacturing) in GDP also declines over time for these groups of countries, although at a faster pace for
                slipping countries. The services sector rises for both slipping and falling behind countries.

                Broadly speaking, the main difference between the fast-growing countries (established and improved)
                vis-à-vis the slow-growing countries (slipping and falling behind) is that the former might reallocate
                resources from agriculture to industry and services, while the latter might reassign resources from
                agriculture and industry to services.

                Looking at the average annual growth rates of each sector, industry and services are clearly the more
                dynamic sectors for the established performers in both periods. Industry growth might be primarily
                driven by non-manufacturing activities (say, construction and extractives), although the rate of growth of
                manufacturing exceeds 8 ppa in both periods. For the improved performers, the growth rate of industry
                and services exceeds 6 ppa in 2014–15, and the latter sector grows at a slightly faster pace than the
                former (6.79 versus 6.50 percent per year). The growth of agriculture (although lagging compared with
                the other sectors) is still higher than 6 ppa for the established and improved performers in 2014–15.

                Slipping performers, by definition, had a strong showing in 1995–2008, with services and industry
                (primarily non-manufacturing) being the most dynamic sectors. However, all sectors had a marked
                slowdown in 2014–15, and the agriculture and industrial sectors contracted. The contraction of the



36   >   A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
industrial sector among slipping performers was mainly attributed to non-manufacturing activities.
Falling behind countries already had a poor showing in 1995–2008; however, industrial activity
contracted in 2014–15, while agriculture and services grew during the same period.

Examining the contribution of sector activity to GDP growth, the fast performers (established and
improved) have a greater and more balanced contribution from industry and agriculture than the slow
performers (where their slower growth is mainly driven by the services sector). Agriculture and industry
jointly explain about 51 and 50 percent of GDP growth among established and improved performers,
respectively, in 2014–15.

A previous issue of Africa’s Pulse examined the contribution of capital stock and TFP to (median) growth
of real GDP per worker during 1995–2012 for fast- and slow-growing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
(World Bank 2014a). The report showed that: (a) slow-growing countries registered negative TFP growth
throughout the period; (b) TFP played a larger role in fast-growing countries; and (c) the contribution of
TFP to growth was greater among resource-rich vis-à-vis non-resource-rich countries.

Figure 2.3 depicts the contribution of factor accumulation (physical and human capital) and TFP to real
growth per worker among the groups of established, improved, and slipping performers in 1995–2008
and 2010–14. The change in the years for the second period responds to the following motives: (a) lack
of data on capital stock and human capital for 2015 among the African nations, and (b) taking a longer
second period, in this case 2010–14, would ameliorate problems with cyclical use of factors.

During 1995–2008, growth per worker among the established performers was approximately 3.6 ppa,
and mainly driven by increases in TFP. Factor accumulation explains about one-fifth of growth per worker
in this group; the rest is attributed to TFP. Slipping countries (which had a good growth record in 1995–
2008) grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent per worker. Factor accumulation in this group explained

                      more than two-fifths of growth per worker. Finally, improved countries (with a rather modest growth
                      record in 1995–2008) grew at an annual rate of only 0.5 percent per worker. In this group, the capital
                      stock per capita declined, while TFP grew and contributed about three-quarters of growth per worker.

                      During 2010–14, the established performers had a greater average annual growth rate per capita
                      compared with 1995–2008 (that is, 5.2 percent); however, the composition of growth changed. Factor
                      accumulation (physical and human capital) explained more than four-fifths of growth per worker for
                      this group (as opposed to one-fifth in 1995–2008). By contrast, the group of slipping performers saw
                      their growth rate per worker decline from 3.1 percent in 1995–2008 to 2.2 percent in 2010–14, and
                      they registered negative TFP growth during the latter period. Finally, the real GDP growth per worker
                      of improved performers increased from 0.4 ppa in 1995–2008 to about 2.8 ppa in 2010–14. In the latter
                      period, factor accumulation and TFP had a more balanced contribution to growth per worker (thus,
                      explaining 40 and 60 percent, respectively).

                      per worker and TFP growth in 1995–2008 and 2010–14 among the established performers. Among the
                      improved performers, Côte d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo experienced a significant
                      turnaround in growth per worker and TFP growth.


                      Role of macroeconomic policies
                      A recent edition of Africa’s Pulse examined whether Sub-Saharan African countries had adequate
                      macroeconomic policy space to withstand adverse shocks that could derail/slow down their growth
                      path (World Bank 2015b). It argued that some countries in the region were able to use their built-in
                      buffers to finance policy responses when the 2008/09 global financial crisis unfolded. In the aftermath


 38     >    A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
of the crisis, however, macroeconomic policy vulnerabilities have heightened. The region lives in an
environment of widened current account deficits, lax fiscal policies, and greater debt vulnerabilities, and
with smaller buffers than in the run-up to the global financial crisis.

At the same time, the report validly argued that there is a great deal of heterogeneity not only in
economic performance, but also in the quality of macroeconomic policies across countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa. This section evaluates the quality of macroeconomic policy among the established,
improved, slipping, and falling behind countries in the region.

The evolution of the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores on economic
management over 2005–15 for fast- and slow-growing countries in the region shows that the quality
of economic management (as reflected in their monetary and exchange rate, fiscal, and debt policies)
has been greater among established and improved performers compared with slipping and falling
behind countries since 2011. Hence, on the one hand, growth among established and improved
performers has been supported by greater quality of macroeconomic policies. On the other hand,
there has been a gradual decline in the score for economic management among slipping countries
since 2008. Looking at the performance of economic management within the established and
improved performers, we find that:

(a)	 Rwanda and Tanzania exhibit the highest scores in economic management among the established
    performers by 2015, whereas Mozambique is the only country within this group with a decrease in
    its score.

(b)	 Kenya and Senegal display the highest scores in economic management among the improved
    performers by 2015. Côte d’Ivoire shows the greatest improvement in economic management, while
    the score for Togo has declined slightly since 2011.

(c)	 Economic management scores have a wider band of variation across countries in the group of
    improved performers compared with established ones. For instance, the CPIA scores for economic
    management typically fluctuate between 3.5 and 4.5 among established performers, and range
    from 2 to 4.5 among improved performers.

The CPIA scores for the quality of monetary and exchange rate policies and the quality of fiscal policy
components of the index of economic management indicate a similar pattern (see figure 2.4). The
quality of the monetary framework has been higher among established and improved performers
since 2011, and that of slipping countries has been on a gradual but slow decline since 2008 (figure
2.3). Interestingly, the dispersion across countries in the quality of the monetary/exchange rate policy
framework is relatively similar.

Likewise, the quality of fiscal policies is superior among established and improved performers (figure
2.4). However, it has been deteriorating among established and slipping countries—although in the
latter at a faster pace. In contrast to what occurred with the adequacy of monetary frameworks, the
cross-country variability in the quality of fiscal policies is larger among improved performers than
among established ones.

                      Indicators of monetary stability and fiscal balance show mixed results (figure 2.5). First, the median rate
                      of consumer price index inflation for all four groups of performers was lower in 2014–15 relative to
                      2007–08, and the sharpest decline in the rate of inflation took place among established performers (from
                      9.7 to 2.4 percent) and improved ones (from 6.0 to 1.0 percent). Although inflation also dropped among
                      slipping performers, it stood at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in 2014–15. Within the group of established
                      and improved performers, the largest drops in inflation were experienced by the Democratic Republic of
                      Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Senegal.

                      Second, the overall fiscal balance in 2014–15 deteriorated for all four groups relative to that in 2007–08.
                      The largest deterioration of the fiscal balance is observed among improved performers (where the
                      median deficit increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2007–08 to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2014–15), and
                      slipping performers (where the median deficit increased from 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007–08 to 4.1
                      percent of GDP in 2014–15). Among the established performers, Mozambique experienced the largest

deterioration of fiscal accounts—with a fiscal deficit that widened from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2007–08
to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2014–15. Benin and Cameroon saw their fiscal surpluses in 2007–08 turn into
large deficits.

Finally, the ratio of gross public debt to government revenues (excluding grants) is a proxy for “de facto”
fiscal space (see Aizenman and Jinjarak 2010).2 It measures the number of government revenue years
it takes to repay the public debt.3 In this context, an increase in the number of years to repay the debt
signals the lack of so-called de facto fiscal space. Across the different groups of performers, the number
of government years to repay debt has increased among established performers from 1.6 in 2007–08 to
3.2 in 2014–15, and among improved performers from 1.7 in 2007–08 to 2.6 in 2014–15. The number of
government years to repay debt declined from 5.2 in 2007–08 to 2.0 in 2014–15 among falling behind
countries, although this might be attributed to debt forgiveness in Burundi, Comoros, and Guinea. Within
each group of countries, the largest deterioration of fiscal space occurs in: (a) Mali and Mozambique
among established countries, and (b) Benin and Cameroon among improved countries.

Looking at the different indicators of monetary and fiscal policy (outcomes and quality indicators), it can
be argued that countries in Sub-Saharan Africa—especially the fast-growing established and improved
performers—have bigger space to maneuver on the monetary front, whereas their fiscal deficits
continue widening and their fiscal space is gradually shrinking.


Drivers of Growth: Moving beyond Luck to Policy
The previous section showed that the higher growth rate of established and improved performers
has been supported by better macroeconomic policy frameworks—although these countries appear
to have greater space on the monetary rather than the fiscal front. However, it is warranted to ask
whether having sound macroeconomic policy frameworks guarantees sustained growth. Do good
macroeconomic policies influence the sustainability of growth among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa?

A strand of the literature has questioned the role of macroeconomic policies as a force influencing
growth over the long term (see, for instance, Acemoglu et al. 2003, and Easterly 2005). In this context,
Fatas and Mihov (2013) summarize the main three pitfalls: (a) macroeconomic policy variables become
insignificant when a large number of long-term growth determinants are included in the analysis; (b)
the degree of persistence of macroeconomic policies is unambiguously higher than that of growth rates
over time; and (c) the positive co-movement between good macroeconomic policies and growth is
attributed to the fact that both are the outcome of robust institutions; hence, this relationship dissipates
once we control for the quality of institutions.

This section looks beyond (exogenous) external factors affecting growth across countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, to domestic factors—and, notably, domestic policies—that help sustain growth over the long
term. The section examines the role of policy-driven, long-term growth fundamentals in the economic

2	 Fiscal space is typically defined “as room in a government’s budget that allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the sustainability of its financial position or
   the stability of the economy” (Heller 2005).
3	 More appropriately, Aizenman and Jinjarak (2010) use government tax revenues. Sparse data over time and issues of cross-country data availability for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
   prevent us from building a time series of “de facto” fiscal space.




                                                                                                                                                                           A f r i c a’ s P u l s e     >   41
                performance of established, improved, slipping, and falling behind countries. These policy-driven, long-
                term growth drivers are classified into four groups:

                (a)	 Structural policies. This focuses on the degree to which the legal, regulatory, and policy environment
                     fosters private sector development by creating jobs, boosting investment, and unleashing
                     productivity. Specifically, it looks at the business regulatory environment, depth of the financial
                     sector, and trade diversification.

                (b)	 Governance. This comprises policies to boost the effectiveness of the legal system and rule-based
                     governance structure to enforce property rights and ensure the quality of the public administration
                     in policy implementation and regulatory management. It also includes the extent to which the
                     executive, legislators, and other high-level officials are held accountable for their use of public
                     resources, administrative decisions, and obtained outcomes.

                (c)	 Infrastructure. This evaluates the quality of and access to the different infrastructure sectors (rail
                     network, air transport, and access to water, among others). In addition to the indicator of overall
                     quality of infrastructure, this group focuses on the quality of the road network, and the quality and
                     reliability of electricity supply.

                (d)	 Rural sector. This focuses on public policies for the development of the agriculture and rural sectors,
                     securing access to land and equitable user-rights over water resources for agriculture among the
                     rural poor, and policies supporting the development of private rural businesses and commercially-
                     based agricultural and rural finance markets.

                In sum, this section aims at examining whether government policies provided an enabling environment
                for the private sector to develop and boost growth. Appendix A provides further details on the
                definitions and sources of the indicators used in this analysis.


                STRUCTURAL POLICIES
                To assess the evolution of structural policies among established, improved, slipping, and falling behind
                countries, this section focuses on three dimensions: (a) the quality of the regulatory framework, (b) the
                depth of domestic banks, and (c) the diversification of exports. This categorization may also involve
                policies that boost human capital accumulation, open trade, and capital accounts, among others. Box
                2.1 summarizes the importance of structural policies in driving the growth of one of the best performers
                among the group of established countries, Rwanda.


                Quality of the regulatory framework

                Private sector development can influence long-term growth to the extent that governments are capable
                of implementing policies and regulations that foster the contestability of output and factor markets. The
                quality of the regulatory framework across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is proxied by two indicators:
                (a) the CPIA score on business regulatory environment, and (b) the index of regulatory quality from the
                World Bank’s World Governance Indicators (WGI).

                                                                                                                    Rwanda:

                                                                                                                    Structural
capita terms). In spite of the adverse external conditions surrounding the region in the past few years,            Reforms and
Rwanda’s growth forecast in 2016 remains at 6 percent, significantly higher than the regional average of            Steady Growth
1.6 percent. Real GDP per capita has more than doubled since 1996; however, it still remains at a low level
(US$690 in 2015).

Our analysis shows that Rwanda, one of the established growth performers in the region, has made strides not
only in macroeconomic management, but also in structural policies. The main goal of this box is to provide
granular information on what contributes to sustain growth in a small, landlocked, resource-poor economy.

Macroeconomic Stability

In the aftermath of the 1994 civil war, the Rwandan government sought to stabilize and revitalize its
economy by establishing Vision 2020, a strategic plan created to transform the country into a middle-
income country by 2020. Although work is still in progress, the government has made major achievements
in some of the objectives highlighted in the plan, including macroeconomic stability. Rwanda managed
to implement prudent macroeconomic policies: (a) consumer price index inflation has remained at an
average annual rate of 3.8 percent since 2010; and (b) international reserves, in spite of their recent decline,
remain at an equivalent of 4.8 months of imports.

On the fiscal front, the government has implemented major tax reforms since 2000, to increase revenues
and mobilize domestic resources. Following Vision 2020, most measures have focused on widening
tax bases, strengthening tax compliance, and encouraging foreign direct investment. Recently, the
government has implemented a major tax reform that includes revision of the investment code, aimed at
eliminating loopholes and unnecessary exemptions, broadening the value-added tax (VAT) base, revising
the excise tax regime, establishing the infrastructure development levy on imported goods, and increasing
the road maintenance levy fund. Tax revenues increased from 11.4 percent of GDP in 2006 to 15.8 percent
of GDP in 2015 (World Bank 2016b).

Structural Reforms

Along with sound macroeconomic policies, robust growth in Rwanda has been supported largely by the
formulation and implementation of structural policies aimed at improving the institutional environment
for private sector development.

Marked improvements in business environment. In 2012, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB), a
government agency dedicated to enhancing business, investment, and innovation, launched a new online
system with which businesses electronically obtain licensing certificates, including Investment Registration
and Environment Impact Assessment Certificates. This online one-stop window facilitates easier and more
efficient registration processes. Furthermore, in 2016, the government eliminated the requirement to open
a bank account to register for VAT.

Strengthening access to credit is another crucial step in starting a business. The Government of Rwanda
has implemented various measures to ensure better access to credit. A secured transactions system
provides more flexibility on the types of debts and obligations that can be secured through a collateral
agreement. Credit information is advanced through collection and dissemination of historical information
from utility companies. More recently, the credit bureau started providing credit scores to banks and
financial institutions as the credit registry expanded borrower coverage. Such measures have strengthened
the credit reporting system.

Continued
                the overall doing business scores, and fourth in the indicator for starting a business. The time and cost of
                starting a business have markedly decreased through various reforms. In addition, the government has
                undertaken pro-investment policies, which have resulted in increasing foreign direct investment as well as
                local business formation.

                Property rights. Clear assignment of rights to property is a precondition for sustainable land management,
                productivity-enhancing investment, and entrepreneurial activity. Proper land tenure regulation not
                only supports individuals in receiving property and engaging in economic activities, but also allows
                businesses to use land as collateral for a bank loan. Although access to land has been a key bottleneck
                for establishing and running a business in many African countries, Rwanda has become the only African
                country that has completed nationwide land regulation. In 2015, all 10.67 million land parcels were
                entered through the land tenure regularization into the land administration system (Hilhorst and Meunier
                2015). With formal land titling and an electronic administration system, it has become significantly
                easier to transfer and register property. Regulatory bodies such as the RDB register intellectual property
                rights and provide a certificate and ownership title. The government has been highlighting robust
                anti-corruption efforts as a key national goal. Corruption allegations are thoroughly investigated and
                prosecuted.

                Private-Sector-Led Growth

                Private sector development has played a catalytic role in Rwanda’s economic growth. The government has
                undertaken measures to foster private sector participation in the country’s key industries, such as tourism.
                The government has launched measures to promote private sector investment in tourism, and formed a
                tourism group (through public-private dialogue) where the private sector is consulted on national policies
                and strategies. The government has also enabled a business-friendly environment by implementing
                market-based reforms: investment codes, company laws, labor regulations, and the insolvency law have
                been reformed to attract private sector participation. A one-stop window at one border crossing was
                launched as such custom procedures were simplified. After a myriad of government and private sector
                efforts, tourism currently accounts for 25 percent of total exports, an increase from 13 percent in 1997.

                Coffee cultivation is another important industry in Rwanda. Historically, coffee was a low-quality, low-price
                commodity in Rwanda, as the country lacked infrastructure. Moreover, the industry was prone to volatile
                international market and commodity price fluctuations. To strengthen the industry, the government
                liberalized the coffee sector in the late 1990s by lowering various trade barriers, creating new incentives
                to invest in coffee production, and fostering entrepreneurship within the industry. The government began
                opening the market for coffee exports to increase competition, and strengthening the value chain. The
                government also initiated discussions about nurturing a high-quality coffee industry, which is less prone
                to price volatility. The liberalization of the industry allowed smallholder farmers to benefit from higher
                coffee prices, as the smallholders were incentivized to invest in infrastructure such as coffee-washing
                facilities. Furthermore, a new value chain and networks among farmers mitigated social distrust and
                allowed the country to regain social benefits.

declined in the latter group.
Among the established performers, Rwanda is the only country in the group with notable improvement
in this area. For improved performers, this is the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo—although
coming from low levels.

The WGI index of regulatory quality shows two opposite trends since 2007: (a) an increase in the quality
of regulations among established and improved performers, although the former group at a faster pace,
and (b) a decline in regulatory quality among slipping countries. By the end of the period, established
and improved performers exhibited the highest quality of regulations (namely, those governing market
contestability). The average of established and improved groups of economies in Sub-Saharan Africa is
still below the average of developing countries (excluding Sub-Saharan Africa).

The biggest reformer, among established performers, is Rwanda, whose WGI index of regulatory quality
is higher than that of other developing countries. Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal experienced some increase
in regulatory quality among improved countries. However, the group of improved performers shows
greater cross-country variability in regulatory quality than the established performers.


Depth of the domestic banking sector

Financial development will foster long-term growth to the extent that domestic financial institutions
improve in the following areas (Levine 2005): (a) producing ex ante information about potential
investments; (b) monitoring investments and implementing corporate governance; (c) trading,
diversifying, and managing risk; and (d) mobilizing and pooling savings, among others.

Figure 2.7 shows a steady increase in credit to the private sector among improved countries (from 15.5
percent of GDP in 2006 to 23.8 percent of GDP in 2015), as well as among established countries (from
11.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 22.6 percent of GDP in 2015), although the level of financial depth of
the former is larger than that of the latter. In the case of slipping countries, the credit-to-GDP ratio
not only has increased at a slower pace, but also their domestic banks are not as deep as those of the
established and improved country groups. Mozambique and Rwanda display the greatest increase in

Figure B2.2.1 depicts the extent of market diversification as measured by the Herfindahl index of trading
partners. It generally shows that improved performers tend to be more diversified across markets than
established ones. Among the improved performers, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Senegal have
increased the number of destinations for their exports over the past 10 years, while Rwanda is the only
country among the established ones with significant progress in market diversification.

In terms of product diversification, the Herfindahl index of export goods for the four groups of performers
across Sub-Saharan Africa is depicted in figure B2.2.2. The improved performers not only have a more
diversified export basket over the past two decades, but also the number of products exported has
increased. For the established performers, product diversification has gradually increased since 2004, while
the export basket has become more concentrated for the slipping countries in the post-crisis period.

Zooming in on the established countries, Tanzania displays the greatest extent of product diversification
over the past two decades. The main export products of Tanzania are gold and precious metal ores,
tobacco, sesame seeds, copper ores, cashew nuts, palm oil, and coffee, among others. In addition,
diversification of the export basket has steadily increased across all countries in this group—although
this has taken place at different speeds. For the improved countries, Kenya and Senegal have the greatest
degree of product diversification. In addition, Benin has the largest drop in the Herfindahl index of product
concentration (figure B2.2.2).

Country experience: Côte d’Ivoire

Product diversification in Africa can also be achieved by moving up the value chain and processing existing
products. This is the case of the cocoa sector in Côte d’Ivoire. The West African nation is the largest cocoa
producer in the world, accounting for 40 percent of the world’s total production in 2015.a Cocoa makes
up 23 percent of the country’s total exports. Although the majority of the country’s cocoa exports are in

                PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
                There is ample evidence that a country’s institutions may create incentives for investment and
                technology adoption, and the opportunity for workers to accumulate human capital—thus, leading
                to higher growth over the long term. Weak institutions may encourage rent-seeking activities and
                corruption, discourage firm investment and human capital accumulation, and lead to stagnation
                (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005).

                In this context, we examine the following features of institutional quality across the established,
                improved, slipping, and falling behind countries:

                (a)	 Institutions that provide a legal framework to secure and enforce property and contract rights,
                                           and foster the quality of the legal and judicial system. Proxies for this dimension of institutional

                           quality are the CPIA score on property rights and rules-based governance, and the WGI index of
                           the rule of law.

(b)	 Institutions that improve the quality of public service and ensure the quality of policy formulation
                           and implementation. Proxies for these institutions are the CPIA score on the quality of public
                           administration, and the WGI index of government effectiveness.

(c)	 Institutions that foster the transparency and accountability of government officials, foster integrity in
                           the management of public resources, and discourage state capture by interest groups. This dimension
                           is captured by the CPIA score on transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector.

Property rights and the rule of law

The evolution over the past decade of the CPIA scores on property rights and rule-based governance
finds that established performers display the highest scores, but they have dropped from their highs in
2010. Improved performers have seen an increase in their scores, and have gradually converged to the
levels exhibited by slipping countries. Among established performers, Rwanda has the sharpest increase
in protection of property rights; Mali and Mozambique have experienced a decline in their scores. For the
group of improved performers, Senegal has the highest score; Côte d’Ivoire recorded the largest increase.

The evolution of the WGI rule of law index since 2000 for the four groups of countries is depicted in
figure 2.9. Most of the groups of countries experienced an incipient turning point in 2013: (a) established
performers have converged to other developing countries; (b) improved performers have surpassed the
slipping ones since 2013; and (c) falling behind countries have seen some progress in the rule of law,
although they still trail the other three groups. The degree of variability across countries in the rule of law
is greater among improved performers than among established ones. Rwanda experienced the steepest
increase in rule of law over the past 15 years among established performers (and registered the highest
score), whereas Mali shows a declining trend over the past decade. Within the group of improved
performers, Côte d’Ivoire records the largest increase, and the highest value of the rule of law index is
displayed by Senegal.

                Government effectiveness

                Established and improved performers exhibit the highest quality of public administration among the
                groups—although their trajectory has changed since 2010. While the quality of public administration
                appears to be increasing among improved countries, it has deteriorated slightly among established
                performers. Improved performers have surpassed slipping ones since 2012. Among the established
                performers, Ethiopia and Rwanda have the highest levels of quality of public administration, and that of
                Mali is the lowest. Among improved performers, Côte d’Ivoire exhibits the largest quality increase, and
                Senegal has the highest level.

                The WGI index of government effectiveness for the four groups of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
                displays a level lower than that of other developing countries (figure 2.9). Government effectiveness
                among established performers in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined steadily since 2006, and that of
                improved performers appears to be catching up by the end of the period. Government effectiveness
                has also declined among slipping countries, but at a faster pace than that of established countries.
                Among established performers, Rwanda is the only country with a sharp improvement and greater
                government effectiveness relative to that of other developing countries; Mali and Mozambique exhibit
                a steady deterioration in this indicator. Cross-country variability in government effectiveness is greater
                among improved performers (compared with established ones), with values ranging from about -2 (the
                Democratic Republic of Congo) to 0.2 (Senegal).


                Government accountability

                The evolution over time of the CPIA scores on transparency, accountability, and corruption in the
                public sector for the four groups of countries is plotted in figure 2.9. Established performers have the
                highest scores in government accountability—although they still have lower levels than those of other
                developing countries. Progress in transparency and accountability is observed since 2012 among
                improved performers. Again, there is greater variability across countries in accountability among the
                improved than the established performers.


                INFRASTRUCTURE
                There is ample research on the contribution of infrastructure development to the growth of productivity
                and aggregate income. Theoretical models have explored different characterizations of the economic
                role of productive public services and their financing, while the empirical literature has examined the
                growth impact of infrastructure development in a variety of cross-section, time-series, and panel data
                settings (Calderón and Servén 2014). Empirical evidence for the region shows that the increased volume
                of infrastructure stocks and improved quality of infrastructure services have a positive impact on long-
                run growth (Calderón and Servén 2010).

                In most dimensions of infrastructure performance, Sub-Saharan Africa ranks at the bottom of all
                developing regions, so the strategic push on infrastructure is not surprising. This section looks at three
                indicators: (a) an overall index of the quality of and access to infrastructure, which involves seven sectors,


50   >   A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
namely, roads, railways, air transportation, access to water, electricity supply, telecommunications, and
digital connectivity; (b) an indicator that assesses the quality of the road network; and (c) an indicator for
the perception of the quality and reliability of the electricity supply, which accounts for interruptions and
voltage fluctuations.

Figure 2.10 presents the evolution of the (perceived) overall quality of (and access to) infrastructure
across the four country groups. A more positive perception of the overall quality of infrastructure has
been building up since 2006, notably among established and improved countries; the same cannot be
said about slipping performers in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Again, the cross-country
variability in the perception of overall quality of infrastructure is greater among improved performers
relative to established ones.

Of the established performers, Mali is the country with the greatest increase in the overall quality of
infrastructure—especially since 2006. This might be attributed to the big push on infrastructure spending in
Mali of about US$555 million per year (10 percent of GDP) during the late 2000s, with nearly 85 percent of
total public spending devoted to transport, power, and information and communications technology (ICT)
(Briceño-Garmendia and Shkaratan 2011). Of improved performers, Kenya shows the largest improvement in
the overall quality of infrastructure. Briceño-Garmendia and Shkaratan (2011) report the significant progress
in infrastructure made in Kenya through the mid-2000s. For instance, institutional reforms in the power
sector have reduced the amount of subsidies by 1 percent of GDP; a modern ICT sector provides 90 percent
of the population with access to a GSM cell phone signal; and the establishment of a sound system for
funding road maintenance should reduce the cost of road travel to the economy.

The quality of the road network over time for the different groups of performers in Sub-Saharan Africa is
depicted in figure 2.10. The largest increase in the perceived quality of the road network is experienced
by improved and established performers—and this is attributed to greater perception of quality in
Ethiopia, Mali, and Rwanda among established performers, and in Cameroon, Kenya, and Senegal among
improved performers. There is also a better perception of the quality and reliability of the electricity
supply in improved and established performers. Over time, that perception has remained almost


                                                                                                                                                                          A f r i c a’ s P u l s e    >     51
                invariant (with a slight decline in the latter years) among established performers, while that of improved
                ones has increased. The rising perception of quality among improved performers might be attributed to
                greater quality in Kenya and Senegal.


                RURAL SECTOR
                Previous issues of Africa’s Pulse have argued that in spite of the high growth achieved over the past two
                decades, the poverty rate fell at a slow pace.4 Achieving faster poverty reduction requires strategies
                that foster inclusive growth—that is, growth that comes along with falling inequality, in outcomes and
                opportunities. A key ingredient is the design of policies to boost productivity in sectors where the poor
                will benefit directly, and key areas are agriculture and the rural sector.

                It is imperative that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa continue boosting agricultural productivity and
                fostering productive nonagricultural jobs in rural areas, among other actions. This section looks at three
                components of rural sector development: (a) public resources for rural development, (b) land and water
                for low-income populations, and (c) rural business environment.

                The indicator on public resources for rural development captures government policies and programs
                for rural sector development as well as the efficiency and transparency of the resources allocated in
                the sector. In spite of having the largest scores on public resources for rural development, this indicator
                has experienced a significant decline since 2010 among established countries (figure 2.11). The
                performances of improved and slipping countries are characterized by a slight increase over time and
                a much more volatile rise, respectively. Ethiopia and Rwanda are the countries with the largest amount
                of public resources devoted to rural development among established performers, and Cameroon and
                Senegal are those among improved performers.

                The extent to which the rural poor have secure access to land and water resources for agriculture is
                presented in figure 2.11. The figure shows an upward trend in all groups of countries over the past
                decade—although there is heterogeneity on the pace of growth across groups. Established performers
                have the highest scores, whereas improved performers show the largest increase in the index.
                Ethiopia and Rwanda are the best performers in the established group, and Cameroon and Kenya
                are salient nations among the improved performers. The indicator of the extent to which policy and
                the institutional framework support private rural businesses shows that there has been no significant
                increase over time in the rural business climate across the established, improved, slipping, and falling
                behind countries (figure 2.11). The dynamic within the groups of established and improved performers
                shows great volatility.




                4	 Christiaensen, Chuhan-Pole, and Sanoh (2013) estimate that one percentage point of growth reduces poverty only by 0.7 percent in Africa, while the decline for other developing
                   regions is 2 percent.

Section 3: Enhancing Agricultural Productivity
for Poverty Reduction1

    The lack of robust agricultural productivity growth underlies pervasive rural poverty in Sub-
   u	
        Saharan Africa. Although many developing countries in other regions have successfully raised
        their agricultural productivity, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag behind. Production increases
        in the region have come largely from expanding the area under cultivation rather than input
        intensification or total factor productivity growth.
    Yet boosting agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa would not only raise the incomes of
   u	
        farm households, which make up over half the region’s population, it would also lower food costs
        for the nonfarm population and promote the development of agro-industry. These outcomes,
        in turn, would promote broader economic growth by stimulating demand for nonfarm goods
        and services. Higher productivity would also free up resources, such as labor, for the growth of
        other economic sectors. Improving agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa through these
        mechanisms remains an important strategy for reducing poverty and enhancing inclusive growth
        and structural transformation in the region.
    Conditions are in place for boosting the productivity of African agriculture. African regional
   u	
        markets are growing rapidly—driven by population, urbanization, and income growth—and
        are forecast to reach a trillion dollars by 2030. On the supply side, the prospects are promising
        as well, since Africa’s potential for agricultural prosperity is enhanced by an abundance of vital
        inputs.
    The successes of countries around the world as well as within the region can provide lessons for
   u	
        African agriculture. Evidence shows that investments in rural public goods, combined with better
        policies and institutions, have driven agricultural productivity growth globally. The dividends
        from investments to strengthen markets, expand irrigation, and develop and disseminate
        improved technologies can be enormous. In addition, improvement of the policy environment
        through trade and regulatory policy reforms complements spending, by enhancing the
        incentives for producers and innovators to take advantage of public goods that crowd in private
        investment.
    Overall, Sub-Saharan African countries tend to underfund high-return investments. Agricultural
   u	
        spending in Sub-Saharan Africa not only lags behind other developing regions by several metrics
        of volume, it is also vitiated by subsidy programs and transfers that tend to benefit the better off
        with insignificant gains for the sector and the poor. Shortcomings of the budgeting process itself
        also reduce spending effectiveness.
    Addressing the quality of public spending and the efficiency of resource use is even more
   u	
        important than addressing the level of spending. Rebalancing the composition of public
        agricultural spending could reap massive payoffs.

                         addressed systemic constraints to productivity through integrated investments in improved
                         technologies, extension services, water management, and market linkages. Countries in Sub-
                         Saharan Africa could achieve greater impact with the existing expenditure envelope by moving
                         away from a heavy focus on fertilizer subsidies, toward a package of complementary investments.
                         Reforming the design and implementation of these subsidy programs while rebalancing
                         government spending in favor of high-return core public goods and policies could produce
                         significant gains.
                      Enhanced public spending is only one ingredient of a strategy for agricultural transformation,
                     u	
                         and must be complemented by a host of additional policies. In a poor policy environment, even
                         spending in areas that otherwise have high returns will be unproductive or counterproductive.
                         The efficient use of public funds has laid the foundation for transformation in other parts of the
                         world, and can play that role in Sub-Saharan Africa as well.



                Why agricultural productivity growth matters
                for Sub-Saharan Africa
                Extreme poverty is becoming concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, and its breadth and depth remain a
                dominant challenge.2 The region accounted for 43 percent of global poverty in 2012. Although the region’s
                growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has picked up in recent years, it has been driven mostly by higher
                production of mineral and hydrocarbon resources. This growth model has not turned out to be an effective
                engine to drive the twin goals of rapid poverty reduction and shared prosperity.3 Even after nearly two
                decades of economic growth, most Africans continue to earn their livelihoods in the traditional economy.
                Much more than in any other region, agriculture dominates African economies,4 accounting for a third of the
                regionwide GDP and employing two-thirds of the labor force, with the poorest countries most heavily reliant
                on it.

                Clearly, one element of progress toward the twin goals is to revitalize growth where a large majority of the
                continent’s poor live and work. Evidence indicates that agricultural growth reduces poverty in developing
                countries by around three times more than growth in other sectors.5 Improving agricultural productivity is also
                critical for fostering structural transformation and managing the urban transition, by increasing incomes and
                enabling people to move out of agriculture.6 Investments and policies to foster growth in the rural economy
                thus emerge as critical for accelerating poverty reduction and fostering inclusive growth in the region.

                The Green Revolution, which boosted yields in other countries, largely bypassed Africa. Figure 3.1 compares
                Africa’s performance in total factor productivity growth (box 3.1) with that in other developing regions over
                two decades: Sub-Saharan Africa was lagging in the 1990s and fell even farther behind in the 2000s.7 In other
                regions, production increases were mainly associated with yield growth because of better use of inputs and
                adoption of improved production technologies. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, increases in production largely
                resulted from expanding the area under cultivation. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only developing region in the

                        agriculture. With the creation of jobs in upstream or downstream agribusinesses, this “youth dividend”
                        could drive growth in the sector. But failing to create these jobs would mean rising unemployment or
                        accelerated migration to already-crowded cities.

                        the balance of trade in food staples was moving from deficit to surplus in Europe and Central Asia,
                        South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, the deficits widened.10 Food trade
                        deficits are understandable in a region such as the Middle East and North Africa, which has limited
                        advantage in food production. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where all the natural ingredients for efficient
                        production are in place, food trade deficits signal that something fundamental is amiss. If not reversed,
                        the consequences of missed opportunities to capture regional markets will only increase over time.
                        But if African agriculture becomes more competitive and regional producers capture these markets,
                        the benefits could be enormous. Taking full advantage of these opportunities will require smart policy

Improving the effectiveness of public investments can boost productivity

A crucial element in enhancing agricultural productivity growth is improving the provision of
productive investments through more and better public spending in agriculture. This opportunity
has been recognized by African policy makers; over the past few years, ministries of agriculture and
finance have intensified efforts to improve the quantity (volume) and quality (effectiveness) of public
spending. In 2003, African nations launched the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Programme (CAADP), which includes the commitment popularly known as the Maputo Declaration
to invest 10 percent of national public spending in agriculture. This target was reiterated in the 2014
Malabo Declaration, and CAADP has led the charge to support national teams to conduct basic
agriculture public expenditure reviews and related specialized analyses. A cornerstone of CAADP’s
work and that of its development partners, including the World Bank, has been to assist countries in
developing National Agricultural Investment Plans, make progress toward the quantitative goal, and
improve the quality of spending.

Increasing the volume of public spending in agriculture will be important but not sufficient to kindle
agriculture growth and poverty reduction. Actions will also be needed to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public spending. The expectation that high-quality public spending should bolster
growth has strong empirical validation. There are significant differences in the rates of return to different
categories of agricultural spending. 11 Indeed, many studies find quite low returns to aggregate spending
on agriculture. But almost all find high returns to specific types of spending, such as investments in
core public goods related to technology generation and diffusion, market linkages, and irrigation
infrastructure. The implication is that a large part of the spending in some countries goes to low-return
activities, dragging down the overall returns relative to what they could have been if more spending had
been allocated to higher-return activities. The inevitable conclusion is that choices about how to allocate
public agricultural spending matter a lot.

Enhanced public spending in agriculture is only one ingredient of a strategy for agricultural
transformation. Investments in rural infrastructure, health, and education matter too, and wise
investments must be complemented by a host of other policies. Indeed, in a poor policy environment,
even spending in areas generally considered high return will be unproductive or counterproductive.
But smart use of public funds—not only by agriculture ministries, but also by other ministries dealing
with hard and soft infrastructure in rural areas—has laid the foundation for transformation in other
parts of the world. 12 In this sense, enhancing the quality of spending is the first order of business.
Nonetheless, the quantity of spending is a meaningful indicator of government commitment to
agriculture, so it is worth considering how Africa compares with other regions and the Maputo and
Malabo targets.

                   percent target (Malawi and Mozambique consistently surpassed it). Three countries—Niger, Rwanda, and
                   Zambia—were close behind at 9 percent. On another metric—public spending on agriculture as a share
                   of agricultural GDP—spending is also substantially lower in Africa than in other regions. This is also the
                   case on the metric of spending per capita; in Africa, spending per capita was on average $19, almost a
                   third lower than the next lowest region, South Asia.


                   Conditions and contexts differ widely—but trends indicate
                   a widespread problem

                   Almost all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are spending below the 10 percent target, but country
                   conditions and thus spending contexts differ widely across the region (figure 3.6). For instance, the
                   spending target is arguably less meaningful for such countries as Botswana and South Africa, which have
                   relatively small agricultural GDP shares in the overall economy. An alternative indicator of the public
                   budgetary commitment to agriculture accounts for sector size—the Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI)
                   is agriculture’s share of public spending relative to its share in the economy.13 An AOI value of 1 would
                   indicate that the share of its budget that the government spends on agriculture is exactly proportional
                   to agriculture’s contribution to GDP. As with other indicators, this is a blunt tool for measuring policy,
                   and only under special assumptions would government spending be allocated exactly in proportion to
                   each sector’s contribution to the economy. Still, intuitively, large deviations would suggest the need for a
                   deeper enquiry by policy makers.

                   As it turns out, no country in Africa has an AOI of 1, although some come close (figure 3.7). There is
                   a strong tendency for the countries with a small agriculture sector to devote proportionately more
                   of the budget to supporting it (higher AOIs). Overall, however, most African countries spend much
                   smaller proportions of the public budget on agriculture than the sector’s share in the economy. Of
                   the 47 countries for which the AOI can be computed, it is less than 0.3 in 31 countries. But perhaps

                   13	 AOI = [(Ag PE/ Total PE)]/ (Ag GDP/ GDP)].

even more important than the level of spending is the inefficiency of resource use within the existing
budget envelope.

Within any given overall budget envelope for agricultural public spending, the allocation across different
activities needs to be balanced for the highest returns. There is no one-size-fits-all formula for deciding
what that optimal allocation should be, and it will differ greatly across countries, depending on country

                 have generally been most productive, and to examine how the current composition of spending appears
                 to reflect these lessons—or not.

                 Saharan Africa has remained low by international norms. Over the past decade, spending on agricultural
                 research constituted about 0.4 percent of agricultural GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 1.3
                 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 0.6 percent in East Asia and the Pacific, and 0.9 percent in
                 South Asia (figure 3.8). In addition, Africa was the only region where agricultural research spending fell
                 on average over this period. These are troubling signs that agricultural research is severely underfunded
                 in Africa.

                 Most countries fall short of NEPAD’s 1 percent spending target
                 In 2006, in its commitment to implementing an agriculture-led development agenda, the African Union’s
                 New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) set an additional target to increase public spending
                 on agricultural R&D to at least 1 percent of agricultural GDP, a target that few countries have met (figure
                 3.9). Most high-income countries spend around 1 percent of their agricultural GDP on research, as does
                 Brazil, a country widely regarded to have an effective research agency, Embrapa. A closer look at the
                 relative shift in the patterns of spending in agricultural R&D in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over time
                 reveals important cross-country differences and challenges. Over 2000–11, half the Sub-Saharan African
                 countries experienced near-zero or negative growth in agricultural R&D spending (figure 3.10). Despite
                 the well-documented considerable payoffs to agricultural research and the demonstrated political
                 commitment to agricultural R&D in Africa, many Sub-Saharan African countries have continued to
                 underinvest in this activity.

agricultural research have
been demonstrated to
be among the most important determinants of long-term productivity growth in Sub-Saharan Africa
as well. For example, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) consortium
has played an important role in raising agricultural productivity growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. CGIAR’s

                spending in the region has generated $6 in benefits for every dollar spent on research. Returns to
                national agricultural R&D spending have been lower, but still significant, averaging about $3 in benefits
                for every $1 spent on R&D.

                Given the economies of scale in research, it would be expected that resources devoted to research
                would bear more fruit in larger countries. And indeed, this seems to be the case. Large countries
                such as Kenya and Nigeria have earned higher returns to R&D than small countries, but even in small
                countries returns have been high enough to justify the investment, particularly for adaptive research
                (table 3.1). Moreover, national and international agricultural research efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa are
                complementary: countries that have made a greater national investment in agricultural research are
                better able to adapt and deliver to farmers new technologies emanating from international centers.
                Stronger national research systems have helped to achieve greater impact from CGIAR research by
                enabling more rapid diffusion of international technologies.16

                African research institutions can learn from Brazil’s Embrapa, whose success is attributable to institutional
                characteristics and policy choices in addition to adequate funding, such as high investment in human
                capital, effective collaboration with private sector and international research centers, as well as an open
                innovation system and intellectual property rights to facilitate technology development and diffusion.

Research in
Sub-Saharan     For now, most investments in agricultural science and technology in Sub-Saharan Africa come from the
Africa          public sector—well over 90 percent, as contrasted with a figure that has fallen below 50 percent in Europe
                and North America. In Sub-Saharan Africa, most public support for agricultural science and technology is
                through programs and institutions that belong to ministries of agriculture. Such public agricultural research

systems in Sub-Saharan Africa have often stagnated. Since 2000, while investment in public R&D has                 Box 3.2
grown by 20 percent across the region as a whole, the increases have been concentrated in just a few               Continued

countries (mainly Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa). Most national public agricultural research
institutions and programs across the rest of the continent have declined, and they lack the resources to
maintain a broad research portfolio.

The main lessons that are emerging from recent experience include the following:

•	 Small national research programs should focus on areas of comparative advantage. To remain relevant
   and viable, country-based research programs are most effective when they focus on and build unique
   expertise in a selective set of thematic topics that are particularly well-suited and of highest priority in
   their locations (bananas and cassava in Uganda, rice in Mali, cocoa in Ghana, and maize in Malawi). Such
   systems may also focus on adaptation and adoption for a wide variety of crops and livestock.

•	 Regional approaches and planning improve efficiency and relevance. Successful examples are the West
   Africa Agricultural Productivity Program and the East Africa Agricultural Productivity Program, with
   coordination from corresponding subregional organizations (CORAF in West and Central Africa and
   ASARECA in East and Central Africa).

•	 African programs should expand coordination with CGIAR programs. Greater participation of African
   programs in CGIAR planning and priority setting, and greater participation by CGIAR centers in
   agricultural planning in Sub-Saharan Africa will produce more relevant plans and more synergies in
   execution under the CAADP-led Dublin process.

•	 Agricultural universities and public agricultural research programs need to be closely linked. Creating
   critical mass in staff and equipment enhances the quality of training for graduate students, and reduces
   the fragmentation of effort. South Africa and Uganda each feature shared research programs, shared
   laboratories and equipment, and joint appointments—and graduate students do some of their research
   under the guidance of staff at research organizations.

•	 Coordinating public, private, donor-led, and nongovernmental organization initiatives can enhance
   coherence and effectiveness. The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa and its support for cocoa
   and rice research in West Africa show how partnerships can improve strategic planning and the
   implementation of common research and capacity building. Pooled donor funding for core budget
   support to subregional organizations can also help. Documenting the outcomes and impacts of
   agricultural research is critical to maintain funding.

•	 Close links with agricultural extension systems and farmers are essential to facilitate the adoption of
   research findings and enhance the relevance of research. In Ethiopia and Nigeria (and many other places
   on a small scale), researchers regularly develop and implement applied research programs with farmers
   in the field. They also work together to evaluate results over time and plan follow-on research.

                 How to reap richer returns
                 through rebalanced spending

                 Reduce the barriers to disseminating foreign technology
                 and developing domestic technology

                 An important principle for expenditure policy is that governments cannot be the only, or even the
                 main, developers of new technology. In Africa, governments currently fund more than 90 percent of
                 the ongoing R&D. But with scarce budget resources, countries need to adopt policies to reduce barriers
                 to spill-ins of technology from abroad and encourage private investment in technology generation.
                 The current requirements for lengthy and expensive tests to register new seed varieties (imported or
                 domestic) in many African countries practically guarantee that African farmers will not benefit from
                 advances in other parts of the world or from private domestic R&D (box 3.3).



Box 3.3:         The Enabling the Business of Agriculture report (EBA 16 report) measures agribusiness regulations, with
Quality of
                 a view to promoting smart regulations that foster efficiency while ensuring safety and quality. The report

for seed and     recognizes the need for well-functioning seed and fertilizer systems for promoting agribusiness. Seed and
fertilizer in    fertilizer are among the six topics covered in the 2016 issue (other topics are machinery, finance, markets,
Sub-Saharan      and transport). The section on seed focuses on assessing the quality of the laws and regulations that
Africa
                 support the development, evaluation, and release of new varieties, as well as seed quality mechanisms.
                 The fertilizer indicators measure the requisites for registering a new fertilizer product, permit requirements
                 for importing fertilizer, and laws in place to ensure quality control of fertilizer. Forty countries, including 14
                 in Sub-Saharan Africa, are surveyed.

                 Scores of seed indicators show that a few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya and
                 Mozambique, perform well, but half of the countries that were assessed place among the bottom tercile
                 of performers (figure B3.3.1). But even in the higher-scoring countries, there is scope for improvement.
                 Overall, most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have higher scores in the seed development and
                 certification indicator than in the seed registration indicator. In some cases, low scores reflect lack of
                 implementation of regulations. For example, seed variety release authorities have been established
                 by law in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Rwanda, but do not meet in practice. Lack
                 of transparency in procedures can pull scores down. For example, lack of an official fee schedule for
                 the mandatory certification of cereal crops underpins the low scores in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Niger,
                 Rwanda, and Uganda. In several countries, accredited private companies are allowed to carry out some or
                 all seed certification activities, which can reduce potential delays in the certification process.

                 There is a wide range of fertilizer scores among the 14 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that were included
                 in the EBA 16 report (figure B3.3.2), but room for improvement in all of them. One-third of the countries
                 do not register fertilizer products, and in three others (Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mozambique) no private
                 sector company has gone through the registration process. Thus, half of the 14 countries in Sub-Saharan
                 Africa that were surveyed have no registration practices. A higher-scoring country, such as Tanzania, can
                 improve in this area, as the registration process has an average cost of 1,000 percent of gross national
                 income (GNI) per capita and takes up to 600 days to complete. In comparison, it takes 242 percent of GNI
                 per capita and 210 calendar days to register a fertilizer product in Zambia. For importing fertilizer, only
                 three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not require that importers obtain an import permit, which, when
                 added to importer registration, can be burdensome for business and obstruct efficient trade. Ethiopia’s

fertilizer products. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa score below average in quality control, mainly driven
by the lack of penalties for mislabeled and open fertilizer bags in several of the studied countries.

                  These barriers could be reduced by following the practices in such countries as India and South Africa,
                  which allow the introduction of new varieties with no performance testing but require truth in labeling
                  to protect farmers from false claims.17 This has been particularly effective in South Africa, where farmers
                  benefit from a much higher rate of introduction of new varieties than other African countries, even
                  accounting for the size of the market.18 Barriers can at least be lowered by mutual recognition of new
                  varieties already registered in neighboring countries, which is the approach of the European Union and
                  is being pursued in several regional regulatory frameworks in Africa, but progress has been slow. The
                  two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and countries could potentially consider unilateral action to
                  reduce barriers while waiting for regional agreements to take shape.19

                  Invest in land governance
                  An important public good that is greatly undersupplied across Africa is the legal and institutional
                  framework for land governance. Only about 10 percent of rural land in Africa is registered. The rest
                  is undocumented or under informal arrangements that make it vulnerable to “land grabbing” or
                  expropriation, a particular problem for women. It takes twice as long (65 days) and costs twice as
                  much (9.4 percent of the property value) to transfer land in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Organisation
                  for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (31 days; 4.4 percent). The poor institutional
                  framework is reflected in the low demand for land administration professionals: Ghana, Kenya, and
                  Uganda, for example, all have fewer than 10 land surveyors per million population, compared with
                  197 in Malaysia and 150 in Sri Lanka.20 These conditions undermine land market development and
                  secure tenure, weakening incentives to make on-farm investments and impeding rural credit market
                  development.

                  Significant investments will be needed to reverse soil degradation and depletion, so improving land
                  security will be hugely important for creating the conditions for sustainably boosting productivity
                  (box 3.4). Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have legislation in place or initiatives underway to
                  address communal land rights and gender equality, the basis for sound land administration. In addition,
                  countries have made a commitment to implement comprehensive land policy reforms, primarily second-
                  generation reforms, guided by the African Union’s Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa.

                  limited land market activity, which prevents the factor from being transferred (for example, through sales or
                  rentals) to the most productive users; and restricted use of collateral for access to credit (including credit for
                  productive investments).

     Impact evaluations of land administration programs in Sub-Saharan Africa provide mounting empirical             Box 3.4
     evidence in support of the first theoretical mechanism. These programs—which include land demarcation,          Continued

     registration, and titling interventions—aim to improve tenure security and strengthen use and transfer
     rights over land through registration and written documentation. In Rwanda, Ali, Deininger, and Goldstein
     (2014) find that a pilot land titling program increased soil conservation investments, particularly among
     female-headed households. Evidence from a randomized controlled trial in Benin points to increased
     investment in perennials following systematic land demarcation activities. The program also erased
     the gender gap in land fallowing, a key soil fertility investment. However, earlier efforts to examine the
     investment and productivity effects of these types of projects yielded mixed results (Place 2009), as many
     of the studies relied on statistical correlations rather than causal estimates of impact.

     Nevertheless, given the variation in land tenure systems and customary and formal legal institutions across
     the continent and within each country, policy has shifted from the costly and complex “one-size-fits-all”
     approach of individual freehold land titling, toward context-specific solutions and a more flexible policy
     framework (Udry 2012). Results from Ethiopia, for example, suggest that low-cost land use certification
     could lead to higher agricultural yields (Holden, Deininger, and Ghebru 2009). Yet there is a need for more
     rigorous evidence to assess whether interventions such as customary land certification and communal
     land registration can boost agricultural yields across a range of contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Bolster extension

Another crucial element in crafting spending decisions to encourage greater adoption of modern
technologies is to improve the effectiveness of extension services. Particularly where information
constraints are a major bottleneck in the uptake of modern inputs and production techniques, public
funding (although not necessarily provision) of extension can be a cost-effective use of public funds.
Moreover, higher returns to investments in agricultural extension are expected if the rate of developing
new technologies for Sub-Saharan Africa is increasing, enabling farmers to adjust more quickly to
changing circumstances.21

Extension services are coming back on the agenda, and in a few countries these services now make
up a substantial share of the budget. But there is the risk that extension will once again be viewed as
ineffective. Attention to extension services peaked in the 1980s and early 1990s, when money was
poured into systems that mainly promoted the adoption of agricultural technology in a centralized,
linear, one-size-fits-all method.22 In the late 1990s, when many of these traditional systems were shown
to be deficient in quality and relevance, public spending on extension declined. However, the rapid
adoption of digital technologies in rural areas shows promise in reviving some aspects of extension
services and consequently improving productivity. Innovative models are being implemented in Kenya
and Nigeria. New digital tools and approaches have helped to overcome information problems that
hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, promote knowledge and skill development, and
stimulate opportunities for agricultural supply chain management.23

                 The balance between R&D and extension has long been an issue, with critics suggesting that many
                 extension agents had nothing to extend, owing to weak R&D—and that extension systems tended to be
                 the poor relation at the bottom of the funding chain. As a result, entire budgets were spent on recurrent
                 items such as salaries, while there was no fuel for vehicles, and thus no farm visits.24 In funding the new
                 generation of extension programs, the lessons from the past need to be taken into account for better
                 balance of spending across subcategories, and to make extension more effective, particularly in reaping
                 the benefits from irrigation (box 3.5).


Box 3.5:         The irrigated area as a share of total cultivated area is estimated at 6 percent for Africa, compared with 37
Sub-Saharan      percent for Asia and 14 percent for Latin America. Food production in Africa remains almost entirely rainfed,
Africa’s
                 despite highly variable and in many cases insufficient rainfall together with a high incidence of droughts.
Potential for
Increasing       The potential for profitable irrigation development in Sub-Saharan Africa remains large, given the existing
Irrigation       water resources, high value of irrigated agriculture, and large number of rural poor who could benefit from
                 productivity improvements as a result of irrigation.

                 The returns to many irrigation projects in the past were relatively low in Africa, and the negative
                 externalities were high. But recent advances in planning and design techniques have provided the ability
                 to minimize the adverse environmental and social consequences of large irrigation infrastructure. Recent
                 studies show that irrigated land can be expanded from 13 million to 24 million hectares in economically
                 viable ways, with returns ranging from 17 percent for large-scale irrigation to 43 percent for small-scale
                 irrigation.a Sub-Saharan Africa has significant unexploited potential to develop both large- and small-
                 scale irrigation, but economic viability depends on keeping costs down (i.e. switching to higher value
                 crops is sometimes necessary so farmers can afford irrigation). Although there is significant potential for
                 rehabilitating existing irrigated areas in the region, the expertise, knowledge, and capacity to manage
                 irrigation investments are critical.b

                 Improve post-harvest practices and market access
                 Investments in post-harvest processing facilities, access to markets, and accompanying infrastructure
                 and policy reforms that foster commercial agriculture are critical for transforming African agriculture. A
                 large literature on the impacts of investments to improve market access for farmers has found that the
                 benefits are significant, come in different forms, and can be realized through several channels. Reduction
                 in transport costs reduces trade costs and interregional price gaps.25 The spillover effects are that farmers
                 pay less for their inputs and get more for their outputs, increasing incomes.26

                 Various digital tools and approaches have helped to overcome information problems that hinder market
                 access for many small-scale farmers. Proximity to rural roads has significant effects on poverty and
                 agricultural productivity overall.27 This is particularly critical in Africa, where less than half of the rural
                 population lives close to an all-season road. Trader surveys in Benin, Madagascar, and Malawi find that
                 transport costs account for 50–60 percent of total marketing costs.28 In Tanzania, the price pass-through

of maize from broader markets to farmers was significantly lower even 25 miles away from a paved road.29
Higher profitability from road access also increases the value of farmers’ land.30 Not surprisingly, access
to markets facilitates economic diversification in rural areas and creates incentives for farmers to adopt
modern production technologies.31

Shift government spending from private to public goods
Research from Latin America and the Caribbean finds that it is crucial to shift public spending from
providing goods and services to speciﬁc groups of producers, toward the increased provision of public
goods. On average, 51 percent of total government spending in rural areas was on subsidies to private
goods during 1985–2001. A reallocation of 10 percentage points of public expenditures from subsidies
to public goods would increase per capita agricultural income by about 2.3 percent without increasing
total spending.32 These findings from cross-country analysis for Latin America are consistent with the
analysis for Asia, where spending on rural infrastructure, agricultural research, and dissemination had
large poverty alleviation effects. Governments in Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions
have invested heavily in state-owned enterprises (parastatals) to perform commercial functions that
generally are carried out more efficiently by the private sector; the public investment crowded out
private investment and dragged down the overall performance of the sector. Although the situation
has improved over time, state-owned enterprises are still more involved than they should be in the
agriculture sector, particularly in marketing inputs and outputs.

Many parts of Asia have achieved impressive gains in agricultural productivity and poverty reduction over
the past half-century. By contrast, sustained productivity growth remains elusive in most of Africa. What can
African policy makers learn from Asia’s experience? Conditions naturally differ in many respects between
Africa and Asia, but it is instructive to understand the mix of public investments and policies in many Asian
countries, and their relative importance in driving growth and reducing poverty. Spending on productive
investments related to the development and diffusion of technological improvements, greater connectivity
in rural areas, and irrigation development did the most to reduce poverty. In India, the relative performance
of subsidies evolved over time, with somewhat higher returns in the early years of the Green Revolution but
rapidly declining returns thereafter. Fertilizer, power, and irrigation subsidies were among the least significant
contributors over the four decades. The findings of studies from other regions provide potentially important
implications for enhancing agricultural growth and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Target spending to reduce poverty
The scope is considerable for crafting investments to magnify their pro-poor impacts. Rural roads and
irrigation infrastructure can be geographically targeted in areas where there are concentrations of the
poor. Research can be aimed at the crops, livestock, and technologies that are likely to be most useful to
the poor rather than, for example, plantation export crops. Efforts to connect farmers to markets can be
focused on smallholders. Analysis indicates that such investments can have large payoffs in economic
growth and poverty reduction (box 3.6).

                  The investments must be conscious decisions in the design and targeting of spending programs, and
                  there are likely to be trade-offs between distributional objectives and the goal of boosting the growth
                  of agricultural GDP. Of course, this kind of pro-poor targeting has limits, since the investments will
                  benefit the landless poor only indirectly. As far as we know, there are no comprehensive cross-country
                  studies on the extent to which current spending policies are taking advantage of opportunities for
                  pro-poor targeting. Anecdotal evidence suggests that such conscious decisions are being made (for
                  example, almost all World Bank projects to improve market linkages are aimed at smallholders), but there
                  undoubtedly is room for improvement.

                  In Sub-Saharan Africa, women make up a large proportion of the agricultural labor force, yet they are
                  consistently found to be less productive than male farmers. The gender gap in agricultural productivity—
                  measured by the value of agricultural produce per unit of cultivated land—ranges from 4 to 25 percent,
                  depending on the country and crop. This gender gap exists because women frequently have unequal
                  access to key agricultural inputs such as land, labor, knowledge, fertilizer, and improved seeds. However,
                  the gender gap is caused by more than just unequal access to inputs; women also face unequal returns
                  to the inputs they do have.

                  The fact that the gender gap persists suggests that current agricultural policies and programs are
                  inadequate for tackling the underlying constraints. It is crucial to recognize that men and women may
                  face different constraints that impede them from improving their agricultural practices, and that it may
                  be necessary to rethink, innovate, and test new programs to address women-specific constraints (see
                  box 3.7).

   positive development outcomes, such as reduced poverty and greater food security. In addition, higher              Africa
   agricultural output could lead to lower food prices, which could in turn help improve nutrition by enabling
   poor people to buy more and better food. As a result, the report suggests that 238,000 people in Malawi,
   80,000 people in Tanzania, and 119,000 people in Uganda could be lifted out of poverty. Estimating the
   monetary value of the gender gap demonstrates the scale of the gross gains that could be made from
   designing better policies to improve women’s ability to use agriculture to lift themselves and their families
   out of poverty and contribute to economic growth.

   The study also finds that the gender gap can be attributed to three main determinants in these countries.
   The first and main cause of the gap is differential access to male family labor. One key reason why women
   farm managers have less access to male family labor is that the majority of women farm managers are
   widowed, separated, or divorced. Second, women farmers are less likely to grow export crops than men
   who grow and sell these crops in the market for higher profits. Finally, women’s access to agricultural
   implements and machinery is significantly lower than that of men in all three countries. Addressing the
   determinants of the gender gap in future policy making will lead to more effective programming to
   increase agricultural productivity.

   The task is to design innovative and effective approaches to close the gender gap. Research to date
   has provided a menu of promising solutions and ideas to test, such as providing women farmers with
   small nudges in the form of well-timed discounts to encourage the purchase of fertilizer, or bringing
   agricultural training to women’s doorsteps through farmer field schools and mobile phone applications.
   Further research should look at the relative impacts of specific policies and programs, as well as their cost
   efficiency to quantify their net benefits.

Address emerging priorities arising from climate change

Public spending policy will need to remain flexible to cope with future challenges, and, for agriculture,
probably no challenge is more urgent than climate change. It is a threat for agriculture across the world,
but the lack of resilience of poor farmers makes it particularly serious in Sub-Saharan Africa. Projections
show yield decreases in the near term of 5 percent, potentially growing to 15–20 percent across all crops
and regions in Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of the century. Agriculture is also an important contributor
to greenhouse emissions, particularly from deforestation, and Africa is the only region where the majority
of production increases have come from expanding cultivated area, generally at the expense of forests.
In Africa, as around the world, a more climate-resilient agriculture sector is needed to achieve the triple
win of enhancing agricultural productivity, mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases, and helping
farmers adapt to climate change.

                 Most investments to mitigate climate change (low-carbon growth) and adapt to it (resilience building)
                 will need to be made by farmers and other private agents. But proactive government policies, planning,
                 and investments will be required to provide information, incentives, and an enabling environment to
                 encourage communities, households, and the private sector to change their behaviors and investment
                 choices. Many climate-resilient investments will not be very different from productive investment
                 choices, even not taking climate change into account. Building resilience has overall benefits in any
                 case, but the value of climate-resilient investments is amplified by the changes that will occur with
                 global warming.



                 Maximize the benefits of fertilizer subsidies

                 Subsidies are resurging

                 The resurgence of input subsidy programs in Africa has arguably been the region’s most important policy
                 development for public agricultural spending in recent years. Ten African governments together spend
                 more than one billion dollars annually on input subsidies alone (figure 3.11), primarily on fertilizers. These
                 programs were almost phased out in the 1990s, during a period of structural adjustment in Africa, but
                 they have made a strong comeback due partly to residual support for subsidies among African leaders,
                                                                                                                          even while pressured

                 The level of fertilizer use is supposedly suboptimal

                 The economic rationale for fertilizer subsidies comes mainly from the motivation that, because of credit
                 and information constraints, the level of fertilizer use is suboptimal in most of Africa. Some argue that
                 subsidies could overcome these problems by reducing the costs that farmers incur and the barriers of
                 affordability, access, and learning. This justification is often based on the facts that fertilizer is used much
                 less intensively in Africa than in other regions, particularly Asia, and fertilizer use on demonstration plots
                 provides high returns.




 74   >   A f r i c a’ s P u l s e
Even so, there are reasons to question the assumption of suboptimal use. Experimental evidence from
farmer-managed fields indicates response rates that are considerably lower than on researcher-managed
fields. On demonstration plots, crops are grown under conditions that are much closer to optimal than
those of most farmers’ fields, with better soil and more plentiful water. But, in much of Africa, water
management is scarce and soil has been degraded, greatly reducing the responsiveness of crops to
higher chemical fertilizer use.33 Facile comparisons of average fertilizer application rates between Africa
and Asia, which suggest that higher application rates in Africa would produce results comparable to
those in Asia, can be highly misleading. Indeed, policy discussions of low productivity in Africa tend to
overemphasize fertilizer use and underemphasize the poor farming practices and rainfed conditions that
limit African farmers’ ability to use fertilizer as proﬁtably as it can be used in other regions.34

The evidence from the high agricultural growth periods in South Asia shows that fertilizer subsidies
played little or no role in substantially boosting productivity.35 Studies in four Asian countries—
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan—conclude that fertilizer subsidies were not significant in
farmers’ adoption of technology. The studies instead identify technology research, irrigation expansion,
and other investments, such as roads, as the main drivers.36 At the height of the Green Revolution,
farmers in three of the four countries (except Bangladesh) were net taxed for fertilizer (that is, domestic
prices of fertilizers were higher than the world market prices), indicating that it was profitability and not
subsidies that drove technology adoption during the Green Revolution.37


Returns to subsidies are low and variable

Evidence has been accumulating on some of the largest input subsidy programs in Sub-Saharan Africa—
in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia—based on farm-level surveys.38 The
analysis points to several conclusions with important policy implications:

•	 The crop response rates of smallholder farmers are highly variable and usually low because of the
     inability to use fertilizer efficiently and profitably. Low water availability and poor soil, chronically late
     deliveries of fertilizer, poor management practices, and insufficient complementary inputs prevent
     farmers from obtaining higher rates of fertilizer efficiency.
•	 The increment in total fertilizer use is smaller than is distributed through the program. Even with
     “smart” subsidies, crowding out of commercial fertilizer sales and outright diversion and theft remain
     major problems.
•	 Subsidies are unlikely to address their multiple objectives effectively. It is often argued that subsidizing
     fertilizer is desirable to boost agricultural production and help poor farmers. Yet there is strong
     evidence that most of the benefits do not go to poor farmers (targeting is regressive with respect to
     asset wealth and landholding size), and the gains in overall food production have been transitory and
     much smaller than the costs (table 3.2).

    times the cost of seeds.

                Note: Ratios are estimated based on five-year estimated response rates. The ratios reported here use baseline calculations, making adjustments to the average partial effect of 1 kilogram of
                subsidized fertilizer on total smallholder fertilizer use, as suggested by Chirwa and Dorward (2013) and Jayne et al. (2013). Costs are those of the fertilizer only, while reported yields are those
                observed using both fertilizer and seeds. For this reason, the benefits overestimate the benefits of fertilizer use alone, and the benefit-cost ratios could be considered upper bounds of the ratio for
                subsidized fertilizer.




                Subsidies are often administered in such a way that they are only or mainly available to growers of a
                narrow set of staple crops, reinforcing the policy bias against diversified cropping. This encouragement
                of mono-cropping makes production less nutritious, exacerbates soil depletion, and makes smallholders
                more vulnerable to adverse climatic events.


                Add alternative and complementary investments to the policy mix

                In areas where fertilizer or other modern production technologies are actually underused, many policy
                levers are available to encourage greater uptake. The optimal choice of instruments depends to a large
                extent on the constraint. If the main bottleneck is that farmers have few choices of appropriate input
                technologies for the main agro-ecological systems in a country, the best solution may be to focus on
                regulatory reform to encourage spillovers from abroad, or to invest in domestic research. If the problem
                is lack of information on the part of farmers, extension may the best policy lever. If one of the underlying
                causes for low fertilizer use is insufficient cash flow for farmers to buy inputs, efficiently promoting the
                emergence and growth of rural credit markets (including support for land market development) would
                address this. Much can be done using innovative ways of doing banking and taking advantage of new
                applications of information technologies.

                Several countries have recently implemented changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
                their input subsidy programs. Countries have replaced public with private procurement and delivery
                mechanisms, and even put in place electronic delivery systems for subsidies (as in Nigeria). These
                changes appear to be steps in the right direction. But there is not yet rigorous empirical evidence to
                assess whether these changes have significantly improved the performance of the programs, much less
                whether they have changed the benefit-cost calculus from negative to positive. And some claims echo
                those for the earlier generation of smart subsidies, which proved to be exaggerated. The new reforms are
                worth monitoring, but until they are proven effective, they cannot be assumed to be good models for
                spending decisions.

                Notwithstanding the large body of evidence that even “smart” input subsidies have seldom produced
                benefits commensurate with their fiscal costs, they remain politically attractive. Where subsidies continue
                to be used, they should at least be reduced to a modest amount in national agriculture budgets, with

a clear exit strategy and combined with complementary expenditures. In the longer term, no program
will sustainably raise fertilizer use until it becomes profitable for farmers to buy fertilizer on commercial
markets after they graduate from the subsidy program. This brings back the issue of complementary
investments. Creating demand will require lowering the farmgate prices of fertilizers in Africa, where
they are high relative to other regions. There are clear implications for government spending priorities:
spending needs to be aimed at streamlining logistics and reducing costs and risks in fertilizer supply
chains.39 Much of this investment is most appropriate for the private sector, but governments can
support the effort by improving the infrastructure for fertilizer distribution, reducing regulatory barriers,
and improving profitability by reducing transport costs (see box 3.3 above).

It will be necessary to enhance research and extension, and invest in soil analysis and mapping, to
improve soil fertility management to raise fertilizer response rates.40 Input promotion during the high
agricultural productivity periods in Asia and South America, for example, addressed systemic constraints
to productivity through integrated investments in new technologies, extension support, irrigation,
and market linkages. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could get a bigger impact within the existing
expenditure envelope by moving away from a heavy focus on fertilizer subsidies, toward a package of
complementary investments. Reforming the design and implementation of these subsidy programs
while rebalancing government spending in favor of high-return core public goods and policies could
produce massive dividends. The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa has a program on soil health,
and some countries (including Kenya and Nigeria) are testing program designs to get these services on
the ground and integrated with fertilizer subsidy programs (box 3.8).


      Most rural development strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa focus on improving the productivity of                   Box 3.8:
      smallholder farms. The approach has clear advantages, since it leverages resources already in place in rural     Central Role of
                                                                                                                       Small Farms in
      communities—primarily land, family labor, farming knowledge, and social capital—while the slow-paced             African Rural
      dynamics of economic transformation and farm restructuring play out. Importantly, improving smallholder          Development
      productivity speeds up economic growth and complements programs that prepare rural workers for jobs              Strategies
      in other sectors.
      With the possible exception of mechanization, technologies that improve overall small-farm productivity
      usually help farmers achieve higher yields. In general, yield gaps are high in Sub-Saharan Africa, and
      even a partial narrowing could have a significant impact on local and global food supplies. A careful and
      transparent approach to promoting new commercial farms, carved from underutilized land resources, can
      help improve food supplies over time, but with fewer benefits for economic growth or poverty reduction,
      and with greater stress on Africa’s natural resources and ecologies.
      A key instrument in the pursuit of improving smallholder productivity is the development and
      dissemination of new technologies. In the case of Asia’s Green Revolution, a small set of technologies
      had a transformational impact on rural communities and food systems that were land-constrained and
      structured largely around wheat and rice. In Sub-Saharan Africa, agroclimatic and market conditions are
      more diverse, as are food systems. Consequently, a larger set of place-specific technologies is needed to
      prompt an African Green Revolution. This raises the cost of developing and testing new technologies and
      the cost of disseminating technologies that meet farmers’ needs.

Box 3.8            Lessons from the fields of maize and rice farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate these points. In the case
Continued
                   of lowland rice, the seed-fertilizer technologies that transformed many Asian food systems work well in
                   well-managed irrigation systems. But those technologies are not enough to create material change in
                   the lives of most rice producers in Sub-Saharan Africa, since most of the rice produced in the region is
                   rainfed. Nevertheless, research suggests that, in many communities, rainfed rice yields can be improved by
                   focusing not only on seeds and fertilizer, but on improved agronomic practices.
                   In the case of maize, differences in risk, markets, and growing conditions help explain dramatic differences
                   among farmers in the use of fertilizer and high-yielding seeds. Heterogeneity also helps explain why
                   technology promotion programs based on a single technology packet, which proved transformational
                   in Asia, have seen limited success in Africa. However, as the example of highland maize farmers in Kenya
                   illustrates, indigenous hybrid systems based on improved genetic material and improved resource
                   management can supplement traditional seed-fertilizer technologies.
                   Taken together, the evidence suggests that a strategy of boosting smallholder productivity is a sound
                   one, especially when combined with policies that help families prepare for jobs outside agriculture.
                   However, the task of building out, cataloging, and disseminating the full set of technologies needed
                   for transformational change represents a challenge for African governments and the development
                   community. Still, there is evidence of local successes and some indication that yield gaps have closed
                   in recent years. Pursuing additional paths, built on resource management technologies and indigenous
                   innovations, can speed Africa’s Green Evolution.

                   Tackle the data and evidence challenge
                   Policies and investments are only as good and effective as the data and evidence informing them.
                   But obtaining good quality data is often a challenge. The topic of data has recently received a lot of
                   attention41 for tracking poverty,42 but the challenge applies in equal measure to agriculture. In part
                   this is because the world in which African agriculture operates has been changing (income growth,
                   urbanization, and climate change), and previously held perceptions have quickly become out of date.
                   But it is also because the information base on African agriculture has been limited for a long time.43

                   Several initiatives are underway to remedy this situation, such as the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural
                   and Rural Statistics, and the ensuing regional Action Plans. Another initiative, at a smaller scale and more
                   focused on innovation in agricultural household data collection, is the Living Standards Measurement
                   Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). The LSMS-ISA supports national statistical offices in
                   the collection of at least four rounds of nationally representative household panel survey data in six to eight
                   African countries during 2008–20. It provides a unique opportunity to ground-truth our understanding of
                   Africa’s farming reality today, which is what an international consortium of researchers led by the World Bank
                   under the Agriculture in Africa Telling Facts from Myths project set out to do.44 The findings underscore how
                   important it is to invest in regular data collection and the continuous examination of conventional views, to
                   confirm, fine-tune, and at times also revise direction or raise new issues. By way of illustration, three of the
                   areas of policy concern that were covered in this research are featured in box 3.9.

intensification in African agricultural production. The evidence suggests that this has not been fully              Sorting out
                                                                                                                    facts from
realized in Africa compared with other developing regions. The practice of fallow has disappeared, but
                                                                                                                    myths
the use of modern inputs (fertilizers, improved seed varieties, and other agro-chemicals) and modern
technology (irrigation and mechanization) have lagged somewhat. However, the orthodox view that
African farmers use few modern inputs is overstated. Although many smallholders still use rudimentary
technologies on the farm, inorganic fertilizer use has picked up to significant levels in some countries,
with more than 40 percent of farmers using inorganic fertilizer in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Nigeria. In
all countries in the region, irrigation and tractor use are negligible (Sheahan and Barrett 2014). Two
important insights come from these data. First, although farmers are using modern inputs, they are
not combined correctly to reap the gains from joint use. Households are spreading inputs across the
farm rather than concentrating them on a single plot, thereby foregoing important synergies. Second,
increasing fertilizer use may well not be a profitable option for many farmers. A study of fertilizer use
among Nigerian maize farmers found, for example, that in addition to low physical returns to fertilizer
at the margin (7.5 kg maize per kg of nitrogen fertilizer compared with estimates of around 17 in
Eastern and Southern Africa, and up to 50 if researcher management protocols are followed), the costs
of acquiring fertilizers (mostly transportation costs) further reduced fertilizer profitability, rendering
additional fertilizer use in effect unprofitable for a number of farmers in Nigeria (Liverpool-Tasie et al.
2015). Such insights from the micro data are vital for understanding farmers’ behavior and designing
effective policies. The insights question the notion that fertilizer use is low (as derived from facile
comparisons with fertilizer use in other continents). They also underscore the importance of integrated
interventions (access to input use, extension, and markets).

Labor productivity. As highlighted at the outset of this section on agriculture, the policy priority in Africa
has to be to raise agricultural productivity—of land and labor. At the same time, the conventional view
is that labor is intrinsically far less productive in agriculture than elsewhere in the economy, and that
the most is to be gained from transferring labor out of agriculture (without much investment in raising
productivity within agriculture). The data examined in the Myth and Facts project, however, show
that this is a myth. While the national accounts report that labor in nonagriculture is six times more
productive than in agriculture, the farm-level data tell us it is only three times more productive. But even
this is misleading. When output is measured per hour worked, the gap almost disappears. This is because
workers in agriculture work fewer hours (700 hours per worker per year) than those in nonagriculture
(1,850 hours). Per worker productivity gaps reflect differences in employment rather than in output
per hour worked (McCullough 2015). The incentive to shift out of agriculture therefore lies in the
opportunity to spend more time at work. In agriculture, work hours are constrained or rationed, possibly
because of the seasonal nature of production.

Seasonality. Although it is commonly accepted that seasonality permeates African livelihoods,
surprisingly little attention is paid to it. Because of the seasonal nature of agricultural production,
one area where seasonality manifests itself is in prices. Better integration of domestic food markets
today may explain part of the limited attention to seasonality. But there is also very little systematic
available evidence on the extent of food price seasonality, and what is available is largely dated. The
consequence is that “while we all know about seasonality,” it is very unclear “precisely what it is we
know.” Using trigonometric and sawtooth models to overcome some of the systematic upward bias
in seasonal gap estimates from the common monthly dummy variable approach, researchers in the
Myths and Facts project showed that seasonality in staple crop prices can be substantial, with maize
prices in the 193 markets from the seven African countries studied on average 33 percent higher

Continued          times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across markets,
                   but in virtually none of them is the variation lower than in the international reference markets. This
                   finding confirms the existence of substantial excess seasonality, for which there may be a host of reasons,
                   including poor post-harvest handling and storage facilities, and lack of market integration. Follow-up
                   analysis in Tanzania shows that the estimated food price seasonality also translates into seasonal variation
                   in caloric intake of about 10 percent among poor urban households and rural net food sellers. Together
                   the findings suggest that the current neglect of seasonality in the policy debate is premature.

                   Manage the political economy
                   Identify underfunded high-return categories of spending
                   Some categories of spending that have been shown to have significant positive effects on productivity
                   and welfare are often underfunded, and others that generally show unfavorable results often capture
                   large shares of the budget. Explaining such discrepancies between impact and prominence in the
                   public budget requires understanding how the public resource allocation process is shaped by agents’
                   incentive structures, the characteristics of the investments, and the broader governance environment
                   in which agents operate. Budget decisions will always be politically influenced, but understanding the
                   sources of bias that are likely to drive inefficient or ineffective policies can help avoid those outcomes.

                   Move beyond the status quo
                   Many African countries have long pursued policies of implicit or explicit agricultural taxation, creating
                   a pro-urban, anti-agriculture bias.45 One explanation is that rural populations exhibit greater difficulty
                   in organizing collective action among dispersed populations that lack easy means of communication.46
                   But if the difficulty of organizing collective action can be overcome, there is also strength in numbers.47
                   One way to offset at least partially this natural disadvantage of rural populations is to improve the
                   information base of key actors, so that they better understand the effects of alternative policy choices.
                   Policy processes exhibit a status quo bias, such that policies that have outlived their usefulness often are
                   not discontinued. Governments favor the status quo because those who benefit from the current state
                   are usually the ones with the power to have ensured enactment of those policies in the first place.48 And
                   their political support for the current policies is increased by those who have altered their behavior to
                   become beneficiaries after the policies were put in place.49

                   Use visibility to guide spending
                   Types of spending with highly visible results that are easily attributable are more attractive. Visible
                   infrastructure investments and direct cash or in-kind transfers are more easily connected to the
                   efforts and spending decisions of public officials. These can even be conveniently advertised—for

example, through labels on the fertilizer voucher ticket indicating who is responsible for subsidizing
the fertilizer—thus serving as an effective tool for patronage.50 In contrast, if a farmer observes that the
quality of information provided by a new agricultural extension officer has improved, it may be difficult
for the farmer to ascertain whether that is because the new extension officer is more motivated, or the
agriculture ministry has done a better job in selecting, training, and incentivizing extension officers.
For example, the greater visibility (and therefore attributability) of large-scale irrigation schemes in
Mozambique has made them more attractive than small schemes, despite the weaker agricultural
performance of the large ones.51

Reduce time lags in investment
Goods and services with a long lag between the time when resources are allocated and the time when
the benefits become available are less politically attractive for several reasons. A longer lag tends to
break the perceptible link between politicians’ decisions and public officials’ resource allocations, and
politicians may have a short time horizon for their tenure in office. Given the substantial time lag between
investing in research and reaping its rewards—usually decades, not years—agricultural research requires
a long-term commitment for sufficient, sustained funding. Long research cycles rarely coincide with short
election cycles, shifting political agendas, and changes in government budget allocations. The inability
to extract short-term political credit acts as a disincentive for policy makers to commit to long-term
agricultural R&D investments, thus jeopardizing future research planning and outputs.

Given low investments by governments, agricultural research in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
is highly dependent on donor funding, which by nature is mostly short term and ad hoc, often causing
major fluctuations in a country’s yearly agricultural investments. In contrast to the long gestation to
realize the benefits of investing in research, public spending to subsidize agricultural inputs usually
requires a span of only a few months from the time of the investment until the subsidized fertilizer
reaches farmers. In Malawi, the time span from the spending being incurred to the fertilizers being
received by farmers ranged from one to six months,52 and in Ghana, the equivalent time span was about
four months.53 This is clearly one factor behind the bias toward subsidies in the current policy mix.

Monitor corruption
The prevalence of corruption tends to increase the share of large capital investment spending in overall
spending. Areas of public spending involving large infrastructure or other capital investment (such as
irrigation) create opportunities for public officials to improve the chances of a private agent winning
contracts, or to loosen regulatory burdens on the agent, in return for private payments to the official.
Underperformance of irrigation infrastructure in countries beset with corruption is notorious for another
reason as well. Incentives for technical staff to maintain structures properly are severely weakened without
side payments, given the rents that can be extracted in a context of insecurity about access to functioning
irrigation systems.54

                Move from top-down to more participatory budgeting institutions

                Institutional mechanisms to make spending more pro-poor have a mixed record and vary in their
                strengths and vulnerabilities. In some African countries, the potential benefits of participatory
                budgeting have been vitiated by a top-down process closely managed by the party in power, as
                in Mozambique.55 Benefits have also been constrained by earmarking transfers from the federal
                government, as in Kenya and Uganda,56 or by high administrative and maintenance costs, as in
                Uganda.57 Where spending decisions are decentralized, concrete mechanisms to strengthen electoral
                accountability need to be put in place to ensure local administrators are responsive to the needs
                of individuals and not only to local elite groups. This must be matched by building local officials’
                public management capacity, and improving citizens’ information base on the actions as well as the
                performance of local governments. Inefficiencies and poor targeting of subsidies can be reduced
                through operational features that improve the clarity and reduce the ambiguity of eligibility criteria,
                paired with an increase in the transparency and information about which localities, and within
                localities which households, are eligible to receive the transfers.


                Overcome inertia in policy making

                Too often, countries fail to adopt and implement policies that are known to be necessary for sustained
                economic development. In addition, for the reasons described, there is significant inertia in policy
                making. How, then, can change occur?

                Be ready to take advantage of opportunities for reform
                Major past reform programs have been necessitated by the realization that more of the same is not
                fiscally sustainable. External (oil and other commodity) price shocks and debt crises have exposed
                inefficient and unsustainable policies.58 Much of the restructuring and privatizing of marketing boards
                in Africa came about when they became fiscally unsustainable, partially because of movements in
                the international prices of commodities.59 Severe budgetary constraints have disturbed the political
                equilibria that supported those policies and opened space for reforms, often with the strategic and
                financial support of external actors such as international financial institutions. These reforms have
                involved profound changes in agricultural policies, including major shifts in public spending programs.
                Among them was a reduction in input subsidies, which were common in the 1980s and 1990s. But
                after the crises subsided and economic recovery progressed, some of the same programs and policies
                (including input subsidies) reemerged, albeit in improved versions, because they remained politically
                attractive.60 The lesson here is not that reforms must always await the advent of shocks, but that
                reformers should be ready with plans and evidence to influence reforms, and alert to opportunities that
                may arise. Countries could also benefit from anticipating economic shocks and investing now in the
                necessary adaptations.

Consider compensating losers
Improvements in the quality of spending have sometimes been greatly facilitated by partially
compensating losers. In Mexico, Romania, and Turkey, comprehensive reforms that reduced agriculture
subsidies and privatized state-owned enterprises ushered in rapid agriculture sector growth. The
reforms were accompanied by area-based cash payments (much more efficient and less costly to the
government than the policies they replaced), without which these reforms likely would not have been
politically feasible to enact or sustain.

Find ways to commit to long-gestation policies with high returns
Other forces can be harnessed to facilitate policy reform. Two major barriers to reform are the
lack of understanding by the citizenry of the distributional effects of policies (which also reduces
the attributability of positive impacts) and the difficulty that politicians have in making a credible
commitment to policies with long gestations. Farmer cooperatives and other producer organizations can
help identify beneficial policies, disseminate this information to their members, and then lobby for their
enactment. Democratization increases the opportunity for the formation of member-driven groups that
can be effective in promoting policy change as opposed to top-down organizations. Other agents of civil
society in a country (the press, local nongovernmental organizations, and even competing parties) can
also increase the transparency of policy and the availability of information. Rigorous impact evaluations
of projects and programs hold promise for revealing the distributional and welfare effects of spending
policies; their wide dissemination would go a long way toward increasing public understanding.

Enhance credibility by committing to an external agent
Enhanced credibility is an important principle underlying international trade treaties. The sweeping
agricultural reform program in Mexico, for example, was motivated by the determination to join the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and the consequent need to firmly lock-in the policies that
would make this possible. In a similar vein, regional agreements and institutions in Africa, such as
the CAADP, can play this role if commitments are taken seriously. CAADP’s peer reviews of National
Agricultural Investment Plans and the Joint Sector Review process with an emphasis on “mutual
accountability” mechanisms could potentially enhance credibility. The fungibility of resources makes
it difficult for donors and development partners to have a significant influence over the size and
composition of agriculture budgets through the mechanism of funding individual projects. But
with agricultural public expenditure reviews becoming more common, they provide a tool to get
a comprehensive view of the entire budget, identify shifts in overall spending patterns, increase
transparency, and facilitate more effective input into budget planning and implementation.

                Appendix A. Definitions of Variables

                Economic Activity
                GDP Growth. We use the growth rate of GDP (in %) from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.

                Sectoral growth. We use the annual percentage growth rate of the value added in agriculture, industry,
                services, and manufacturing. The data are collected from the World Bank’s World Development
                Indicators.

                Sources of growth. The variables used to calculate the sources of growth were collected from Feenstra,
                Inklaar, and Timmer (2015). The data are available for download at www.ggdc.net/pwt.

                The variables used were:

                •	   Real GDP at constant 2011 national prices (in millions 2011 US$)
                •	   Capital stock at constant 2011 national prices (in millions 2011 US$)
                •	   Share of labor compensation n GDP in current national prices
                •	   Human capital index based on years of schooling and returns to education
                •	   Number of persons engaged in employment (in millions).

                Macroeconomic policies
                To measure the quality of macroeconomic policies, we will examine the evolution of the CPIA score on
                economic management, which measures the quality of monetary and exchange rate policies as well as
                fiscal and debt management policies.

                In addition to the overall score of economic management, we will look into the score of two of its three
                components; namely,

                (a)	 Monetary and exchange rate policy. This indicator evaluates the quality of monetary and exchange
                     rate policies in a coherent macroeconomic policy framework. The goal is to examine whether
                     the monetary and/or exchange rate policy framework is consistent with economic stability and
                     sustained medium-term growth. It covers the extent to which the monetary and/or exchange
                     rate policy framework: (i) maintains short- and medium-tern internal and external balance, (ii) is
                     consistent with price stability goals, and (iii) offers flexibility to deal with internal and external shocks.

                (b)	 Fiscal policy. This indicator examines the quality of the fiscal policy in its stabilization and allocation
                     functions. The stabilization function deals with achieving macroeconomic policy objectives in
                     conjunction with coherent monetary and exchange rate policies; that is, smoothing business cycle
                     fluctuations. The allocation function refers to the appropriate provision of public goods; that is,
                     it focuses on the composition of public expenditure —including, for instance, the provision of
                     infrastructure and agriculture-related public goods and services that support medium-term growth.

                Structural policies
                To assess the quality of structural policies, we depict the evolution of the CPI score on structural policies,
                which covers policies affecting trade, the financial sector, and the business environment. In this category,
                we will only zoom into one of its subcomponents:

(a)	 Business regulatory environment. This component examines the extent to which the legal, regulatory,
     and policy environment helps or hinders private business in investing, creating jobs, and becoming
     more productive. It focuses on direct regulations of business activity and regulation of goods and
     factor markets, thus covering: (i) regulations affecting entry, exit, and competition; (ii) regulations of
     ongoing business operations; and (iii) regulations of factor markets (labor and land).
WGI Regulatory Quality. This captures perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and
implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development. It takes
values from -2.5 to 2.5, and higher values imply greater levels of government effectiveness. Source: World
Bank’s World Governance Indicators (WGI). The data can be downloaded from www.govindicators.org/.

Depth of financial systems. We use the domestic credit to the private sector as percentage of GDP. The
data are available from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.

Diversification of exports. The diversification index measures the extent to which exports are diversified. It
is constructed as the inverse of a Herfindahl index, using disaggregated exports at four digits (following
the Harmonized System, rev. 2). The score is then standardized into a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 as the
best score. The data are from Mo Ibrahim Index at http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/.

Public sector management and institutions
To assess the quality of the public sector, we examine the evolution of the CPIA score on public sector
management and institutions. This score covers multiple dimensions of governance and public sector
capacity issues —namely, property rights and rule-based governance; quality of budgetary and financial
management; efficiency of revenue mobilization; quality of public administration; and transparency,
accountability, and corruption in the public sector. In this category, we will focus our attention on the
following categories.

(a)	 Property rights and rule-based governance. This score evaluates the extent to which economic activity
     is facilitated by an effective legal system and rule-based governance structure in which property and
     contract rights are reliably enforced. It covers: (i) legal framework for secure property and contract
     rights, including predictability and impartiality of laws and regulations; (ii) quality of the legal and
     judicial system, as measured by independence, accessibility, legitimacy, efficiency, transparency, and
     integrity of the courts and other relevant dispute resolution mechanisms; and (iii) crime and violence
     as an impediment to economic activity and citizen security.
(b)	 Quality of public administration. This indicator evaluates the core administration —as defined by
     civilian central government (and subnational governments to the extent that their size and policy
     responsibilities are significant) excluding health and education personnel, and police. Specifically, it
     examines the functioning of the core administration in three areas: (i) managing its own operations;
     (ii) ensuring quality in policy implementation and regulatory management; and (iii) coordinating the
     larger public sector human resources management regime outside the core administration (de-
     concentrated and arms-length bodies and subsidiary governments).
(c)	 Transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector. This indicator examines the extent
     to which the executive, legislators, and other high-level officials can be held accountable for their
     use of funds, administrative decisions, and results obtained. Accountability is generally enhanced
     by transparency in decision-making, access to relevant and timely information, public and media
     scrutiny, and by institutional checks (inspector general, ombudsman, or independent audit) on the
     authority of the chief executive. This score quantifies four dimensions: (i) the accountability of the
     executive and other top officials to effective oversight institutions; (ii) access of civil society to timely
     and reliable information on public affairs and public policies, including fiscal information (on public
     expenditures, revenues, and large contract awards); (iii) state capture by narrow vested interests; and
     (iv) integrity in the management of public resources, including aid and natural resource revenues.

                WGI Government Effectiveness. This indicator captures the quality of public services, the quality of civil
                service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and
                implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to such policies. It takes values
                from -2.5 to 2.5, and higher values imply greater levels of government effectiveness. Source: World Bank’s
                World Governance Indicators (WGI). The data can be downloaded from www.govindicators.org/.

                WGI Rule of Law. This measures the perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and
                abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the
                police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. It takes values from -2.5 to 2.5, and
                higher values imply greater levels of government effectiveness. Source: World Bank’s World Governance
                Indicators (WGI). The data can be downloaded from www.govindicators.org/.

                Infrastructure
                Infrastructure measures the quality of and access to infrastructure by using seven indicators, including (i)
                road network; (ii) rail network; (iii) air transport; (iv) access to water; (v) electricity supply; (vi) telephone
                and IT infrastructure; and (vii) digital connectivity. The overall score of the category is an average of each
                indicator, which is converted into a standardized scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is the best score. Source:
                Ibrahim Index downloaded from http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/.

                Of the four indicators, we further look at two components.

                (a)	 Road Network. This indicator evaluates the quality of roads, ranging from extremely underdeveloped
                     to extensive and efficient. The scores are based on the World Economic Forum.

                (b)	 Electricity Supply. This indicator from the World Economic Forum scores the perception of the quality
                     and reliability of the electricity supply, taking into account interruptions and voltage fluctuations.

                Rural sector
                Rural sector is a category comprised of eight indicators: public resources for rural development;
                accountability, transparency & corruption in rural areas; land and water for low-income rural populations;
                rural business climate; agricultural research and extension services; agricultural policy costs; engagement
                with low-income rural populations; and equal representation in rural areas. Source: Ibrahim Index
                downloaded from http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/.

                (a)	 Public Resources for Rural Development. This indicator scores government policies, strategies,
                     and investment programs for the agricultural and rural development sector, and the efficiency,
                     consistency, and transparency with which resources are allocated, managed, and accounted for. This
                     is scored by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

                (b)	 Land & Water for Low-income Rural Populations. This component evaluates the extent to which the
                     rural poor have secure access to land and equitable user-rights over water resources for agriculture. It
                     consists of two sub-indicators from IFAD.

                (c)	 Rural Business Climate. This indicator measures the extent to which the policy and institutional
                     framework supports the development of private rural businesses and commercially-based
                     agricultural and rural finance markets. It consists of three sub-indicators from IFAD.
