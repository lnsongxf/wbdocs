         X   Implementing reform regarding the regulatory framework of the sector. Within the framework
             of the 2014-2020 Operational Program for Environment, the European Commission stipulated
             ex-ante conditions, requiring the Czech Republic to establish a regulatory office for the sector.
             Different alternatives are discussed at the governmental level, and regulatory impact assessment
             papers are being prepared.
         X   Facilitating sector strategic planning despite the heterogeneity of the utility ownership
             structure. Around 6,000 entities (owners, public services providers) operate in the water sector
             (Expert estimate). To some extent, the heterogeneity of those entities in terms of size, legal status,
             scope of competencies, and interests prevent effective strategic planning, resource balancing,
             and efficient asset management of regional systems, including drought and water scarcity issues
             management.

Economy. The Czech Republic, an EU member since May 2004, is a stable and prosperous market economy. With
a per capita GDP of $27,344 (in current international dollars), the Czech Republic is considered a high-income country
and belongs to the most developed economies in Europe. The country has a population of more than 10.5 million, and
a population density of 136 inhabitants/km2. Seventy-three percent live in urban areas (World Bank 2015). While Czech
socioeconomic inequalities are not great, the unemployment rate is estimated at around 7% (World Bank 2015), and
approximately 9% of the population lives below the national poverty line (World Bank 2015). The Roma are considered
a vulnerable minority; the official number of Roma is 0.13% of the population (CZSO 2013), which is far below the
estimated real number of 1.4 to 2.8% of the population (ERRC 2013).

Governance. The Czech Republic is a unitary state and is divided into 14 regions (13 regions and the City of
Prague). The regional authorities also perform state administration. There are 6,253 municipalities, which are the
smallest territorial units (comprising one or several villages). Of this number, 205 have extended powers and perform
state administration at the local level (CZSO 2015). The central authority for water management is in the Ministry
of Agriculture (including water supply and sewerage services). Regional authorities perform state administration of
water management. Infrastructure is mostly owned by municipalities. Towns and villages are the lowest level of self-
government, and they are responsible for provision of public services.

Water resources. The Czech Republic is a landlocked country, and all its water flows out of the country into neighboring
states. Therefore, renewable water sources are totally dependent on atmospheric precipitation. Average volume of total
renewable water resources (surface water sources and usable groundwater sources) is 1,234 m3 per capita per year (FAO
Aquastat 2015). According to the Falkenmark indicator, this average volume corresponds to a situation of “water stress”
which, in the case of Czech Republic, is compensated by water intakes from rivers. The Czech Republic belongs to 3
international basins (the Elbe, Oder, and Danube); 63.4% of the territory (western part) belongs to the Elbe River basin, 9.2%
is located in the northern part of Moravia and is part of the Oder River basin, and 27.4% is situated southeast in Moravia
and belongs to the Danube River basin (MZe & MŽP 2006). The River Basin Management Plan became a mandatory basis
to compile the river sub-basin management plans in accordance with Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements.
The entire country is classified as a “sensitive area” under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. The Czech
government approved the National Program to Mitigate Climate Change Impacts, and the country has gone to great effort
to implement water anti-erosion measures and to improve the water regime and water management in the country.

Water supply sources. Drinking water comes ground sources. Watercourse and water resources management
has been based on hydrologic basins since the 1940s, making water resources management in the Czech
Republic, including planning, fully in compliance with the global trend toward Integrated Water Resources
Management (IWRM). Principles of water management are contained in the government’s 2007 Main River
Basins Management Plan of the Czech Republic. Anyone who extracts surface water or groundwater must obtain
a permit from the water authority. Payments and charges for surface water extraction, including the mechanism
of payment, are mandated by law. Anyone who discharges wastewater into surface water or groundwater
must also obtain a permit from the water authority. Compliance with permit conditions is overseen by the river
basin manager or water authority that issued the permit, under the supervision of the Czech Environmental
Inspectorate. Sanctions can be imposed for noncompliance.

Policy-making and sector institutions. The sector is controlled at the national level. As shown in Figure 2, local
service providers are regulated and controlled by several national-level actors with a clear line ministry, which are:

X    The Ministry of Agriculture, which is the line ministry in charge of water sector policy; water resources management;
     river basin management; watercourses and major water supply reservoirs management; and regulation of drinking
     water supply, sewerage, and wastewater treatment. The ministry also regulates water services quality.
X    The Ministry of Environment, which is responsible for protection of surface and groundwater from pollution, and
     regulation of wastewater discharges.
X    The Ministry of Finance, which provides regulation and control over surface water fees and water and wastewater
     tariffs.
X    The National Institute of Public Health, which is responsible for drinking water quality control.

Economic regulation. The water sector is regulated by the Ministry of Finance according to binding rules
and conditions established for tariff calculation, and monitors compliance through its regional financial
authorities. The provider is entitled to include in the draft tariff “economically justified costs” and “reasonable
profit.” “Economically justified costs” are costs directly associated with the operating activities and the renewal
of infrastructure. “Reasonable profit” is profit providing an adequate return on invested capital and generating
resources for renewal and development of water infrastructure. Tariffs are usually calculated on an annual
basis. The utility submits the tariff proposals to the owner of the infrastructure, which then approves the new
tariff for a particular year. Tariffs apply to all customers within a given tariff area. Infrastructure owners in a

separate operating model implementing EU projects (under OPE) are obliged to apply the “financial model” for
tariff setting. Regional financial authorities provide formal and factual control of tariffs in utilities (sometimes
in-depth), and breach of financial rules is subject to penalties.

Ongoing or planned reforms. Discussions regarding the reform of the regulatory framework of the Czech
water sector are underway. The Czech water supply and sanitation sector is fragmented into thousands of
entities (owners and utilities) providing or operating public water services. Nevertheless, the sector is efficient
because the 50 largest utilities provide services to around 90% of the population (Expert estimate). The EU
OPE 2007–2013 introduced principles (concession contract modification, financial model for tariff setting) for
municipalities that applied for co-financing of their infrastructure projects. The European Commission stipulated
ex-ante conditions within the OPE for 2014–2020, requiring the Czech Republic to establish a regulatory office
for the sector. Different alternatives are discussed at the governmental level, and regulatory impact assessment
papers are being prepared. A decision is expected in the near future.

Service coverage. The population of the Czech Republic has full access to water and sanitation services. Ninety-
four percent of the population is connected to public water systems, and the rest use their own wells. Around 83% of
the population is connected to public sewerage systems (Authors’ elaboration).

Equity of access to services. The entire population has access to water and sanitation, regardless of social or
ethnic status. This means that 100% of the poorest segment of the population (those living on less than $2.50 a day
PPP) has access to piped water supply and flush toilets (Figure 3).

Service infrastructure. Water and sanitation assets are in good condition due to considerable investment;
however, aging infrastructure should be addressed in the near future. Operational conditions are considered
satisfactory in terms of reliability and quality of service provided by utilities. However, even though huge investment
expenditures were made in the last decade, a sustainable renewal rate has not been achieved yet. Infrastructure
owners invested significant sums to meet environmental and drinking water standards. Some facilities are
oversized due to decreasing water consumption. Aging of assets is becoming an issue for the infrastructure, which
was built in the 1970s and 1980s.

 The quality of wastewater discharged is monitored and independently measured by the authorities. Where effluent
 quality limits have not been met, penalties are applied. For some utilities, when operation management contracts
 have been concluded, a set of performance indicators have been defined in the contract and should be reported on by

 utility website.

 Customer satisfaction. Eighty-one percent of the population is satisfied with the service provided in their city
 (Gallup 2013). This number is significantly higher than in most countries in the region. Customer satisfaction surveys
 are not carried out at the national level. Some utilities provide a satisfaction survey themselves or through specialized
 firms and publish concise outcomes on their websites, mostly showing positive results.

 Overall efficiency. The efficiency of Czech water and sanitation utilities is relatively high and is based on the usage of modern
 techniques, procedures, equipment, commercial practices, and significant investments in infrastructure. It could be that the
 involvement of international operators in the large Czech utilities led to overall improvement of the sector. Overall efficiency is
 naturally much higher in larger utilities and there are also regional differences deriving from geographic and physical conditions.
 There are 5.2 employees per 1,000 connections (IBNet 2015), which is into among Danube best practice.

Recent trends. All indicators show that the efficiency of the sector and of individual utilities has risen over the last
two decades. The collection ratio is relatively high (ranging from 95% to 97%) and stable, regardless of small fluctuations
in recent years (IBNet 2015). Utilities faced challenges that pushed them to be more efficient. On the one hand, average
national water consumption dropped over the last 10 years from 103 liters per capita per day (l/capita/day) to 87 l/capita/
day (CZSO 2015). On the other hand, tariffs increased 80-fold over the last 23 years (Expert estimate).

Investment needs. The Czech Republic has already complied with EU water and wastewater directives. Future
priorities will be ensuring a smooth supply of good-quality drinking water to residents and other customers, and
effective sewage disposal, and sustainable services through reliable infrastructure based on affordable tariffs
with minimal support from public finance. About €49 per inhabitant per year until 2022 would be sufficient to
achieve the Czech National Strategy objectives (Expert estimate).

Investments. The investment rate allocated for infrastructure expenditure is very high. Around €62 per person
is invested every year in infrastructure (Authors’ elaboration). Investments are targeted to meet European/Czech
standards, with 78% of investment going to wastewater management (Authors’ elaboration). Tariffs are the basic
funding source for investments, supplemented with EU funds and state subsidies, which play an important role.
Infrastructure owners also co-finance projects from traditional commercial loans, but only in justified cases
and to optimize available means and investment priorities. The rate of investment over previous years has been
relatively stable (Figure 7).

operating costs. Nevertheless, to keep tariffs affordable, some                                         major shareholders (Statutory City of Brno and Suez
villages and small municipalities support their utility operation                                       Environment company) provided loan guarantees,
with municipal budget funds of up to 5 to 10% of total operating                                        including guarantees for project completion (capital

Tariffs. There is only one tariff for households and industries, and cross-subsidies are not permitted. Tariffs have
gradually and continuously increased, in real terms, for more than two decades, and the national average water price
exceeds €2.50/m3 (MZe 2014). Regional differences exist, and the highest tariffs already exceeded 100 CZK, or €3.6/
m3 (MZe 2014). Current tariff levels result from massive investments made over the last 20 years to pay for the more
than 2,000 new wastewater treatment plants built, and the 25,000 km of new sewer pipes laid to meet environmental
standards (Expert estimate). Tariffs are also high due to the high fixed costs of the sector, and the decrease in water
consumption. Tariffs are expected to continue to increase over the next few years as increasing attention is paid to
renewing existing facilities.

Affordability. In 2012, water and sanitation services remained affordable at 2% of average household income.
The social affordability threshold is set at 2%, and is reviewed by the State Environmental Fund under projects co-
financed by EU funds. A methodology, including affordability limits, has been published for all regions of the country.
For households in the bottom 40%, however, water and sanitation expenditure potentially represents on average up to
2.8% of income (Authors’ elaboration).




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was done
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to those best
performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to assess the
sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water Program.
The outcomes of this assessment for the Czech Republic water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also shows
average and best practices in the Danube region. The Czech sector sustainability score is 88, which is much higher than
the Danube average sector sustainability of 64, and is among the best practices in the region. The assessment shows
that, on average, the country performs very well in terms of access to piped water and flush toilets, continuity of service,
wastewater compliance, staffing level, collection ratio, and nonrevenue water. The main deficiencies of the Czech water
sector identified through the sector sustainability assessment are operating cost ratio and affordability (Figure 9).

The main sector challenges are:

X   Implementing reform regarding the regulatory framework of the sector. Within the framework of the 2014-2020
    Operational Program for Environment, the European Commission stipulated ex-ante conditions, requiring the Czech
    Republic to establish a regulatory office for the sector. Different alternatives are discussed at the governmental
    level, and regulatory impact assessment papers are being prepared.

X   Facilitating sector strategic planning despite the heterogeneity of the utility ownership structure. Around 6,000
    entities (owners, public services providers) operate in the water sector (Expert estimate). To some extent, the
    heterogeneity of those entities in terms of size, legal status, scope of competencies, and interests prevent effective
    strategic planning, resource balancing, and efficient asset management of regional systems, including drought and
    water scarcity issues management. Addressing this situation could help implement more efficient sector planning.
