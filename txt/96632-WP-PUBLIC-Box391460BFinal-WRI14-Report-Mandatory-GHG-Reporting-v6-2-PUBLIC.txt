EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the past decade, greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting programs
have emerged at the regional, national, and subnational levels to
provide information on emission sources and trends. As more
jurisdictions plan to design and implement these programs, this
report draws on the experience of 13 existing and proposed programs
to guide policymakers and practitioners in developing GHG reporting
programs. Businesses, industry associations, civil society, and
funding agencies may also find this guide useful in facilitating their
participation in the development of a reporting program.

CHAPTER I


INTRODUCTION
Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is crucial to
understanding the emission trends of companies and facilities so
that targeted and effective mitigation strategies can be developed.
GHG reporting programs provide a platform to gather emissions
data from these entities and help mainstream the measurement and
reporting of GHG emissions.

Emissions data are needed to understand how to influence the
emissions trajectories of different sectors, support policies such as
emissions trading schemes that require emissions information from
facilities, set realistic policies and evaluate their effectiveness, help
reporting entities assess their climate risks and opportunities, and
provide information to stakeholders.

DETERMINING
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
Defining program objectives is the first step toward developing
a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program because the
objectives will determine many design decisions. Objectives can
be short term or long term. They should be reviewed and modified
over time as policy and business contexts evolve and as reporting
entities’ capacity improves. Reporting programs can serve
multiple objectives.

Notes:
a. The Australian program has another objective: to avoid duplication of similar reporting requirements in the states and territories (CER 2014a).
b. This is no longer a stated objective given the repeal of the carbon tax in 2014 (Australia, Department of the Environment 2014b).
c. This is not an explicit objective but it is expected that the program supports this objective.

CREATING AN ENABLING
ENVIRONMENT
Strong legal architecture, adequate institutional, human, technical,
and financial capacity, and regular stakeholder engagement provide a
robust foundation for designing and implementing reporting programs.

An early focus on these enabling factors can help a program reach its
full potential and achieve the stated objectives.

          ▪▪   Policymakers can either anchor the report-
               ing program in an existing law or develop
                                                                   ▪▪   Did the assessment consider how other leg-

               new legislation based on factors such as                 confidential business information) might

               legal and institutional capacity.                        reporting program?

          ▪▪   The legal architecture may include the
               primary legislation, mandating the relevant
               entities to report, and secondary legisla-
               tion, with rules and regulations specifying
               the arrangements to implement the law and
               establish the reporting program.

          ▪▪   Establishing key laws and regulations can be
               a lengthy process and policymakers should
               budget sufficient time to finalize the legal
               architecture.

Notes: Programs provided a relative, qualitative estimate for each function. Costs were not compared across programs. Programs used the following
guidance to provide cost estimate: Low–less than 25 percent of total program cost; Moderate–25–50 percent of the total program cost; High–more than
50 percent of the total program cost.
a. Cost not separately identified by programs because it is incorporated in the cost of other functions.
b. Any infrastructural, institutional, technical or other major recurring expenses (e.g., IT, telephones) that are essential to operate the program but are not
covered in other categories.
c. This cost is likely to increase as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency collects multiple years of data and begins to analyze trends more thoroughly.

DETERMINING
PROGRAM STRUCTURE
AND REQUIREMENTS
Six key program design elements define the structure of reporting
programs and ensure reliability, accuracy, consistency, transparency,
and completeness of the data. This chapter presents an overview of these
elements and illustrates the main decision points.

“scopes.” Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions
from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emis-
sions are indirect emissions from the generation of
energy purchased by the reporting entity for its own
consumption. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect
emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the
value chain of the reporting entity (Figure 7). Pro-

to report only their direct emissions (Scope 1) or

         REQUIREMENT

         Emissions threshold   Threshold defined in terms of annual emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) (e.g., 25,000 metric
                               tons CO2e [tCO2e]), so that all entities emitting equal to or more than the defined quantity are required to
                               report their emissions. For example, the Canadian program applies to all facilities in the country emitting
                               50,000 tCO2e or more annually; the U.S. program employs a 25,000 tCO2e threshold (Environment Canada
                               2010; U.S. EPA 2009a). This kind of threshold could be applied economy-wide to all sectors or defined for
                               individual sectors.


         Energy threshold      Threshold defined in terms of annual energy consumption. For example, in Japan, companies with annual
                               energy consumption of 1,500 kiloliters of oil equivalent or more must report (MoE and METI 2010).


         Source categories     All entities within a certain source category (sector/subsector) are required to report their emissions. For
                               example, the U.S. program requires all facilities producing adipic acid, aluminum, ammonia, cement, lime,
                               nitric acid, petrochemicals, silicon carbide, soda ash, or titanium dioxide to report (U.S. EPA 2009a).


         Production tonnage    Threshold defined for entities in a sector in terms of production. For example, paper manufacturing facilities
         threshold (sector-    producing more than 20 metric tons per day are required to report in the EU program (European Parliament
         specific threshold)   2009a).


         Number of             Threshold is based on the number of employees. For example, in France, companies with more than 500
         employees             employees are required to report their emissions (Kauffmann, Less, and Teichmann 2012).


         Publicly traded       Applicability is defined by whether a company is publicly trading on a stock exchange. For example, all UK
         companies             companies listed on the London stock exchange are required to report under the UK program (Defra 2012).


         Transport capacity    Threshold defined specifically for freight and passenger transport in terms of transport capacity, such as
                               number of railroad cars, number of vehicles, aggregate tonnage of ships, and maximum takeoff weight
                               of airplanes. For example, in Japan, companies with at least 300 railroad cars or at least 200 vehicles are
                               required to report (MoE and METI 2010).

The requirements may include aspects such as the
quantification approach to be used, GWP values to
be used, monitoring methods to be followed, how to
obtain activity data, and how to calculate emissions
factors. Many programs, such as those in Australia,
California, the European Union, and the United
States, provide detailed source-specific calculation
requirements.7 These requirements specify calcula-
tion methods for each emissions source, for exam-

emissions from solid fuel combustion. These can be
supplemented with explanatory material on pro-
gram websites and by providing a help desk or hot-
line to support entities not familiar with calculating
emissions. Programs should ensure that individual
guidance provided through the help desk or hotline
is consistent with the technical requirements.

In deciding just how prescriptive the methods
should be, programs typically rely on factors such
as their objectives, reporters’ capacity and level of
preparedness, and the calculation approach being
used. For example, if a program’s objective is to
support an emissions trading scheme, which puts
a price on each ton of emissions, prescribing exact

        GLOSSARY
         Activity data                  A quantitative measure of activity that results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Activity data is multiplied
                                        by an emissions factor to derive the GHG emissions associated with a process or an operation. Examples of
                                        activity data include kilowatt hours of electricity used, quantity of fuel used, output of a process, number of
                                        hours equipment is operated, distance traveled, and floor area of a building.

         Allowance                      A commodity issued by an emissions trading program that gives its holder the right to emit a certain
                                        quantity of GHG emissions.

         Base year                      A historic datum (a specific year or an average over multiple years) against which an entity’s emissions are
                                        tracked over time.

         Black carbon                   A climate forcing agent formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.

         Carbon dioxide                 A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil fuels from fossil carbon deposits, such as oil,
                                        gas, and coal; of burning biomass; of land use changes; and of other industrial processes. It is the principal
                                        anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which
                                        other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a global warming potential of 1.

Carbon tax                 A levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately
                           emitted as carbon dioxide, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on each unit of CO2 equivalent
                           emissions.

CO2 equivalent             The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of each of the seven
                           GHGs covered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, expressed in terms of the
                           GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide.

Consolidation              Combination of GHG emission data from separate operations that form part of one company or group of
                           companies.

Data management system     A system for collecting and storing GHG emissions information from reporting entities. The system
                           facilitates the reporting, organization, and analysis of GHG data. It can also support quality assurance,
                           quality control and verification activities, track emissions over time, and facilitate analysis and sharing of
                           data with stakeholders.

Direct GHG emissions       Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity.

Direct measurement         Directly measuring GHG emissions in the exhaust stream using continuous or periodic emission
                           monitoring systems (CEMS or PEMS).

Double counting            Occurs when two or more reporting entities take ownership of the same emissions or reductions.

Emission factor            A factor that converts activity data into GHG emissions data (e.g., kg CO2e emitted per liter of fuel
                           consumed, kg CO2e emitted per kilometer traveled).

Emission source            Any physical unit or process that releases GHGs into the atmosphere.

Emissions                  The release of GHGs into the atmosphere.

Emissions trading system   A system that sets an overall emission limit, allocates emission allowances to participants, and allows them
                           to trade allowances and emission credits with each other.

Fugitive emissions         Emissions that are not physically controlled but result from intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs.
                           They commonly arise from the production, processing transmission, storage, and use of fuels and other
                           chemicals, often through joints, seals, packing, or gaskets.

GHG Protocol               A multistakeholder collaboration convened by the World Resources Institute and World Business Council
                           for Sustainable Development to design, develop, and promote the use of accounting and reporting
                           standards for businesses and governments.

Global warming potential   A factor describing the radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given
                           GHG relative to one unit of CO2.

Greenhouse gas reporting   Any voluntary or mandatory international, national, subnational, government, or nongovernmental initiative
programs                   that collects information on, or regulates GHG emissions or removals from reporting entities.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs)    For the purposes of this report, GHGs are the seven gases covered by the United Nations Framework
                           Convention on Climate Change: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O);
                           hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

Indirect GHG emissions     Emissions that are a consequence of the operations of the reporting entity, but occur at sources owned or
                           controlled by another entity. They are categorized as Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.
