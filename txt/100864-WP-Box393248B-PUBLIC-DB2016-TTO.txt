THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a

        and Marine Resources provides vertical and horizontal survey
        control services to land surveyors, engineers and to the general
        public on request. This service provides professionals with the
        coordinates required to perform cadastral, geodetic and
        topographical surveys, and to produce location maps.

        Request outline planning permission

        Outline planning permission should be obtained prior to
        applying for full planning permission. This permission informs an
        applicant whether or not the type of development proposed is
        consistent with the existing land use policy and provides overall
        development standards applicable to the site. Submission of an
        outline application reduces the risk of unnecessary expense in

      survey plan relating to the parcel of land to be developed

      While detailed plans and drawings are not required at this stage,
      a conceptual plan of the proposed development may be
      provided.

      Upon submission, the application is appointed a reference
      number and an acknowledgement slip is issued. This reference
      number is plotted on the Division’s cadastral and layout sheets
      and all relevant cross references are filed with the application.
      The Development Control Inspector from the Town and Country
      Planning Division visits the site to collect information pertaining
      to the application. An evaluation and report are then submitted
      with the application for consideration. A notice of grant or
      refusal of outline planning permission is prepared and sent by
      mail to the applicant. An application is processed within a 2-

      utilization of land (LHA-2), which should be forwarded to the
      local authority. These forms can be obtained from the municipal
      corporation responsible for the area concerned.

      Upon submission, the application is appointed a reference
      number and an acknowledgement slip is issued. This reference
      number is plotted on the Division’s cadastral and layout sheets
      and all relevant cross references are filed with the application.
      The Development Control Inspector from the Town and Country
      Planning Division visits the site to collect information pertaining

      Full planning permission may be granted unconditionally, or may
      be subject to specified conditions. Where planning permission is
      subject to conditions or refused, the reasons for the decision
      taken are included in a Notice of Determination. Failure to
      provide proper information will result in the application being
      returned to the applicant undetermined.

      It is possible for several applications for different types of
      development to be submitted for one property and get
      approved. Each of these planning permissions remains valid,
      unless otherwise specified, and in principle a developer may
      choose the one(s) they intend to implement.

      The statutory period to respond to applicants according to the
      TCP Act is 2 months. This deadline is not usually observed.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       There are two systems of law under which land is held in Trinidad and
       Tobago: the old or Common Law system of conveyancing, and the
       Torrens system of registered conveyancing (The Real Property Act
       system - RPA). Most of land in Trinidad (about 70%) is still held under
       the old law system. The two systems exist side by side and it is not
       uncommon to find one property consisting of lands held under both
       systems. The registration system used is dependent on where the                              • TDD 500-1,200 •
       property is located. The deeds registartion system, established under the                     search of a single

       conducts the title search at the Land Registry by examining the Index of
       Deeds and Country Books relating to parcel of land. The Land Registry
       created an online database which is in the testing stage and, thus, only
       grants access to search clerks. The fee for conducting a single index or a
       single deed search is TDD 10.

      * Conduct companies search at the Companies' Registries

      Searches should also be performed on the companies which are parties
      to the transaction. Lawyers will usually use two resources to conduct
      companies searches : (1) the online registry at
      https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/ and (2) the Companies’ Registry. Common
      practice is to consult a company’s online file and what is termed the
      physical file that is held at the Companies Registry. Downloading a          Less than a day
      company file from the online registry costs TT$20.00 while physical               (online
      searches can cost anywhere around TT$500 - $1,000.00. A standard                procedure;
      company’s search will usually take approximately one week. The                                        TDD 20 per

      company search is done by first downloading the Company's file from                                    download
                                                                                  with procedures 1

      the physical file at the Companies' Registry to ensure that the online file
      is accurate. Once the Company's file has been obtained, the attorney can
      confirm whether any charges exist which may affect the relevant
      property as well as, for the purposes of execution, the directors of the
      company can be identified.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
