Abstract

Turkey’s government increased tobacco tax revenue and lowered tobacco
consumption by increasing tobacco tax rates significantly between 2003
and 2013. However, both per capita tobacco consumption and total
cigarette sales in Turkey have begun to increase again in recent years.
Although the recent rise in cigarette sales might be attributed to the influx
of Syrian refugees into Turkey, our analysis reveals other factors. First, average
cigarette price increased more slowly than inflation. Thus, cigarettes became
relatively cheaper compared to other goods and services. Second, cigarette
affordability has increased. Turkey’s economy has grown steadily, and the
demand for cigarettes has risen as the population has become wealthier
over time. Turkey’s experience in managing these challenges offers lessons
for successful tobacco taxation. Turkey also provides a good example of the
feasibility of increasing tobacco taxes, while combatting the illicit
tobacco trade.

01. Introduction

Turkey bears a high burden of tobacco consumption. A quarter of all deaths
in the country, more than 100,000 deaths every year, can be attributed to
tobacco-related diseases. About 21 million Turkish people, more than one-
fourth of the country’s population, currently smoke. Turkish smokers spend
around 12 billion USD annually on tobacco products: four times the annual
budget of the Ministry of Health (Kose 2016).

The burden of tobacco consumption and related health costs has been a
powerful motivating factor for tobacco control in Turkey. Tobacco control
measures led to decreases in consumption over the years until 2013.
However, a recent rebound in consumption to an overall rate of 27 percent
has raised fresh concerns. In 2010, among men ages 25-54, around half
were smokers, while less than 20 percent of females in the same age group
smoked. Of all men, 39 percent smoked in 2010. That rate fell to 35.9 percent
in 2012, but then rose again to 41.8 percent in 2014. Similarly, 12.3 percent of
all women smoked in 2010, with the rate dropping to 10.8 percent in 2012,
before rebounding to 13.1 percent in 2014. Thus, between 2012 and 2014,
smoking rates among males in Turkey rose by six percentage points and
among females by 2.3 percentage points (Kose 2016).

however, almost one in four Turkish smokers started between the ages of 10

                    indicating that more boys in this age range started smoking, as compared to
                    female cohorts. After age 14, however, women had consistently higher rates
                    of smoking initiation than men in each age category. For example, from ages
                    20-24 more women than men started smoking.

                    Clearly, tobacco consumption has both direct and indirect costs for the
                    population. When consumption increases, so do health care costs. Tobacco
                    consumption rates in Turkey correspond to incidences of cancer, especially
                    lung cancer, in the population. Cancer incidence trends in Turkey between
                    2002 and 2014 indicate that males have been consistently more prone to
                    cancer than females. Rates of cancer incidence among males, females, and
                    the overall population were lowest in 2002, then increased sharply until 2009,
                    when a peak was reached at 270 per 100,000 population for males, 173 for
                    females, and 221 for the population as a whole. Since 2012, cancer incidence
                    rates for both men and women have been decreasing.

Similarly, lung cancer incidence trends in Turkey between 2002 and 2014
indicate that males have been consistently more prone to lung cancer than
females. Rates of lung cancer incidence were lowest in 2002, then increased
until 2009, where a peak was reached at 66 per 100,000 population for males,
8.1 for females, and 37 for the total population. Lung cancer incidence for
males fell between 2009 and 2010. Subsequently, male lung cancer incidence
has again been decreasing since 2011. For females, incidence increased
slightly in 2011, but has remained stable at around 10 since then (Kose 2016).

This study will first provide an analysis of the political economy of tobacco
taxation in Turkey, then explore the economics of tobacco and tobacco
control in the country in recent years. Our main aim is to determine how
Turkey has achieved remarkable results since the introduction of the country’s
first tobacco law in 1996. In the economics of tobacco section, the focus will
be on tobacco taxation, affordability, and illicit trade. The report will conclude
by summarizing key takeaway messages that may provide guidance for other
nations embarking on strict tobacco control measures.


02. Political Economy of Tobacco Taxation in Turkey

Due to the health and economic burden of tobacco use, Turkey’s government
has been strongly motivated to initiate polices and reforms to curtail tobacco
consumption. The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior Affairs, Ministry of
Customs and Trade, Ministry of Finance, universities, and NGOs have worked
together using a multi-sectoral approach in the fight against tobacco.

Despite Turkey’s history of heavily regulating tobacco production, the
country’s first wide-ranging tobacco control law was only enacted in the late
1990s. In 1991, then-President Ozal had vetoed an earlier anti-tobacco bill,
arguing that the advertising ban it included went against free trade (Bilir et
al. 2009). When a revised tobacco control bill was submitted to Parliament in
July 1992, members of the Justice Commission found the health evidence
with regard to smoking inadequate, and therefore rejected the bill. Several
years later, in 1996, the General National Assembly and the President finally
approved the bill, and Law No. 4207 “Concerning the Prevention of Hazards of
Tobacco Products” was enacted in November 1996.

In regards to tobacco control activities, Law No. 4207 was a crucial
achievement and a milestone for Turkey. The law prohibited all tobacco
advertisements and all sales of tobacco products to children under age
18. It also targeted key public spaces, banning smoking in all health and
educational institutions and on public transport, such as buses and aircraft.
The legislation also restricted smoking in other public buildings. In addition,
it required broadcast media to transmit programs on the hazards of smoking
for 90 minutes every month. Moreover, the law imposed warning labels on
cigarette packages. Despite these many advances, Law No. 4207 was not all-
encompassing. Under the legislation, smoking was prohibited in some public
places, but restaurants, bars, and cafés remained vulnerable.




                                                                                                       7
This made smoking a persistent public health issue in these spaces and posed
workplace risks for persons in the hospitality industry.

The new law faced challenges. The tobacco industry made numerous
attempts to overturn the advertising ban, since it posed a serious threat to
companies’ marketing strategies. Industry representatives rapidly developed
plans to engage the government’s Justice Commission in negotiations.
Industry leaders proposed to sponsor a youth project for the Ministry of
Education in return for rescinding the ban (Bilir et al. 2009). In a second
attempt, a few months later, they tried to hold an open-air event to promote
the tobacco industry in Ankara. The Governor of Ankara halted this event as a
clear violation of the advertising ban. The industry pursued legal action, filing
a suit claiming that the ban was unconstitutional. A lower court deemed this
a serious claim, and the issue was referred to the Constitutional Court. In April
1999, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ban on advertisement did not
violate the Turkish constitution, considering in particular the importance of
the public’s health (Bilir et al. 2012).

In April 2004, the Minister of Health signed the WHO Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and the Grand National Assembly approved
it in November 2004. In 2006, a proposal for implementation of the FCTC
was developed and presented to Parliament. After a lengthy parliamentary
procedure, Law No. 5727 was finally accepted in January 2008. Law No. 5727
amended some relevant articles found in the earlier Law No. 4207, for example
broadening provisions regarding penalties. The new law extended the range
of public places where smoking was banned to include school premises
and all hospitality workplaces. Sale of tobacco products within schools and
on their premises was prohibited. Tobacco company sponsorships were
banned, on top of the previous ban on advertising and promotion already
found in Law No. 4207. Once again, the tobacco industry launched a lobbying
campaign, arguing that these measures would have a detrimental effect on
the hospitality industry, a key part of the Turkish economy.

Subsequently, ministries, universities, and many NGOs collaborated to
prepare the National Tobacco Control Program. The program incorporated
a full array of elements to successfully decrease tobacco consumption. The
program aimed to raise the proportion of people aged over 15 years who do
not smoke to 80 percent, and to completely eliminate smoking in children
under age 15. In December 2007, the Minister of Health publicly unveiled the
National Tobacco Control Program for 2008–2012.

Comprehensive and efficient national tobacco control activities require
political commitment. In this regard, the Government of Turkey has been
determined and successful over the past years. In 2013, Turkey became the
first country in the world to attain the highest implementation score for all
of WHO’s FCTC and MPOWER measures. Looking ahead, the Second National
Tobacco Control Program, covering the period 2015-2018, has been prepared
and published. The purpose of the program is to inform and educate the
public on the health, economic, and social impacts of tobacco consumption.
Under this updated program, smoking within five meters of the entrance
of public spaces such as airports, bus terminals, shopping centers, movie
theaters, and health care facilities has been forbidden. A symbol of Turkey’s
political dedication to tobacco cessation was the declaration of 2016 as the
“Year of the Fight against Tobacco.”


03. Economics of Tobacco and Tobacco Control
in Turkey

Turkey is the world’s 10th biggest tobacco producer, accounting for 1.2
percent of the global market. Despite the recent decrease in market
share, Turkey still leads the cultivation of oriental tobacco with an annual
production of approximately 60 thousand tons (Tobacco Report 2016). Law
No. 4733, passed in 2002, defined the organization, structure, and duties
of the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority. This measure has
resulted in a continuous reduction in tobacco production, in part because,
under the legislation, tobacco farmers lost some of the price subsidies
previously afforded to them. The privatization of the state-owned tobacco
company, TEKEL, in 2008, exacerbated the decline in tobacco farming, since
multinational tobacco companies, which began operating in Turkey in the
1980s, preferred imported tobacco to minimize their production costs.
Multinational tobacco companies gradually increased their market share by
aggressive advertising, promotion campaigns, and pricing strategies. These
companies increased total cigarette production by 29 percent, from 120.9
billion sticks to 156.1 billion sticks between 2003 and 2015. However, the
amount of domestic tobacco used in cigarette production declined from 46
thousand to 14 thousand tons, while tobacco imports significantly increased,
from 63 thousand to 94 thousand tons.




                                                                                       9
Figure 3. Tobacco Used in Cigarette Production in Turkey                      SOURCE
                                                                              Tobacco and Alcohol Market
                                                                              Regulatory Authority




Consequently, domestic tobacco production fell from 160 thousand tons
of tobacco in 2002 to 62 thousand tons of tobacco in 2015. In addition,
the number of tobacco farmers declined from 160 thousand in 2002 to 56
thousand in 2015, a decrease of 65 percent. In the past, tobacco played an
important role in Turkey’s agricultural exports, but since 2012, Turkey has
become a net importer of tobacco. In 2015, Turkey exported 54 thousand
tons of tobacco netting 383 million USD, meanwhile it imported over 94
thousand tons of tobacco at a cost of 528 million USD.

Turkey is also one of the largest tobacco consumers. Among OECD countries,
Greece and Turkey carry the second-highest smoking rates, with more than
27 percent of persons over fifteen years of age declaring themselves to be
daily smokers.

03.1. Tobacco Taxation

The most cost-effective method of fighting against tobacco is through
taxation, since people are responsive to monetary incentives. Significant price
increases on tobacco products, through higher tobacco taxes, encourage
current tobacco users to quit or reduce their consumption, while preventing
uptake of tobacco practices in potential future consumers (Chaloupka,
Yurekli, and Fong 2012). Although tobacco taxation is regarded as the most
cost-effective anti-tobacco intervention, many countries have failed to make
much progress in increasing the price of tobacco products by raising taxes,
compared to the advances in other tobacco control strategies under the

Literature and research stemming from high-income countries generally
indicate that a 10 percent increase in price reduces overall tobacco-product
consumption by 2.5 to 5 percent. A recent consensus estimate confirms that
a 10 percent price increase reduces consumption by 4 percent. The effect
on tobacco consumption prevalence in low- and middle-income countries
has been found to be even stronger (Kostova et al. 2014). The price elasticity
of demand for cigarettes is estimated to be -0.41 in Turkey (Önder 2002). The
same study shows that poor households in Turkey were more price sensitive
(-0.47) compared to rich households (-0.16). Another study indicated that
the total price elasticity was -0.67 in 2003, with poor households once again
found to be more price sensitive than wealthier households (Önder and
Yürekli 2014). The price elasticity of demand for cigarettes also varies based
on the type of cigarette. While cigarettes in low- and medium-price segments
are more sensitive to price changes, the demand for premium cigarettes is
highly price inelastic in Turkey (Atuk and Özmen 2016).

Since 2002, Turkey has significantly increased tobacco taxes. The effective
total tax rate as a percentage of retail price in Turkey has increased from 64.8
percent in 2002 to 83 percent in 2017. The current tobacco taxation system in
Turkey includes both ad valorem and specific excise taxes. However, the latter
is not significant, and none of the tax is earmarked. Before 2002, only the
Value Added Tax (VAT) was imposed on tobacco products. Turkey introduced
a 49.5 percent ad valorem tax rate on cigarettes in 2002 and increased
the ad valorem tax rate to 55.3 percent the following year. In 2004, Turkey
introduced the specific excise tax, which varied based on the proportion of
oriental tobacco used in order to protect domestic oriental tobacco farmers.
The ad valorem tax was lowered to 28 percent (Yürekli et al. 2010).




                                                                                        11
The specific excise tax on cigarettes made with 0–24 percent oriental tobacco
was set at 1.00 TL. Cigarettes containing 25–49 percent oriental tobacco were
taxed 0.60 TL, those including 50–74 percent oriental tobacco 0.45 TL, and
cigarettes containing 75–100 percent oriental tobacco were taxed 0.35 TL.
To avoid high taxes and maintain affordability of their products, the tobacco
companies increased the proportion of oriental tobacco in their cigarette
production. Due to the perceived possible negative impact on tax revenue,
the government increased the ad valorem tax to 58 percent, introduced a
minimum tax floor, and eliminated the specific excise in 2005. Until 2009, the
ad valorem rate was constant at 58 percent, but the minimum tax floor was
gradually raised. Turkey increased the ad valorem tax rate to 63 percent and 65
percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

                             In 2013, Turkey reintroduced a specific excise, while increasing the ad valorem
                             rate to 65.25 percent; however, the specific excise was not significant, only
                             0.092 TL (~ 0.05 USD). In 2017, the current specific excise tax is set at 0.325
                             TL (~0.085 USD), and the ad valorem rate remains at 65.25 percent, with the
                             minimum 4.56 TL (1.215 USD) tax floor.

                             The prices of cigarettes in Turkey remain relatively lower than those in other
                             countries of the WHO European Region, even after adjusting for PPP. The
                             cheapest brands in the United Kingdom and Ireland, for example, cost more
                             than twice as much as the cheapest brands in Turkey. Turkey’s best-selling
                             brand is comparable in price to the highest-selling brands in Austria and
                             Estonia, while in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the price of the highest-
                             selling brand remains more than twice that of the most-sold brand in Turkey.

Higher tobacco taxes are only effective in reducing tobacco consumption if
they result in higher tobacco prices. Historically, there was a steady increase
in cigarette sales between 1925 and 1998 in Turkey. Possibly as an effect of
the tobacco law enacted in 1996, tobacco sales remained almost constant
until 2008. Between 2008 and 2013, there was a significant decline in cigarette
sales in Turkey; however, sales began increasing again after 2013. In 2014
alone, 94.7 billion cigarette sticks were sold in Turkey, and sales reached 103
billion sticks in 2015. According to the Ministry of Health Statistical Year Book,
the percentage of smokers in the population increased from 23.2 percent in
2012 to 27.3 percent in 2014, in contrast to the decline observed in
previous years.

might be relatively more affordable, even if nominal price of cigarettes have        Regulatory Authority
been increasing. If the average price of cigarettes increases less than inflation,
cigarettes become relatively cheaper; consequently, the demand for cigarette
rises. As illustrated in Figure 8 below, the price index for cigarettes in Turkey
increased more slowly than the consumer price index between January
2013 and June 2016. During that period, the relative price of cigarettes
decreased compared to other goods and services. Therefore, the demand
for cigarettes increased. Turkey’s per capita cigarette consumption rate had
declined significantly, by 26 percent, between 2003 and 2013. However, the
rate increased by 10 percent between 2013 and 2016, as the relative price of
cigarettes fell.

                              This has enabled the recent increase in consumption and sales. Turkey’s
                              experience provides a key piece of evidence that tobacco taxes are
                              ineffective if they do not lead to higher relative prices.

                              Price-discrimination strategies give tobacco companies the ability to
                              minimize the effect of higher tobacco taxes on their sales. The tobacco
                              companies provide price promotions such as volume-based discounts,
                              multipack offers, and coupons, in addition to setting up different price tiers
                              to reach price-sensitive consumers such as youth and low-income individuals
                              (Brock, Schillo, and Moilanen 2015; Chaloupka et al. 2002; Feighery et al.
                              2004). Price dispersion measures the gap between the cheapest and the
                              premium-brand prices by analyzing the share of cheapest-brand price in
                              premium-brand price. Basically, the larger the share of the cheapest-brand
                              price in the premium-brand price, the smaller the gap, meaning fewer
                              opportunities for substitution to cheaper brands. In 2014, the share of the
                              cheapest-brand price in the premium-brand price in Turkey stood at a
                              relatively low 55 percent, compared to 73 percent in other countries in the
                              European Region. In practice, this means that in Turkey there is a relatively
                              higher price difference between the cheapest brand cigarettes and the
                              premium brand cigarettes for price-sensitive smokers. Availability of cheaper
                              brands in the market undermines the fight against tobacco as it facilitates
                              switching down by smokers to lower–price cigarettes.

middle-income countries (U.S. National Cancer Institute and World Health         Geneva: WHO, 2015
Organization 2016). The tobacco industry’s pricing policy is based on
undermining the effectiveness of tobacco taxes in order to increase the
affordability of tobacco products, especially for youth, and to maximize the
industry’s future sales. As described above, the tobacco tax scheme in Turkey
includes an ad valorem tax (65.25 percent), VAT (15.25 percent), and a small
specific excise tax (0.08 USD). Even though Turkey has one of the highest
total tobacco tax burdens among WHO EURO countries, the specific excise
tax rate is the third-lowest after Turkmenistan and San Marino, which do not
have specific excise tobacco taxes. This type of tax scheme incentivizes firms
to be flexible with prices, while also giving consumers the option to react to
increased tobacco taxes by switching to lower-priced cigarettes. Firms’ and
consumers’ response to tobacco tax policy can undermine the effectiveness
of tobacco taxation in decreasing tobacco consumption. Therefore, an
appropriate tax scheme requires a balance of ad valorem and specific tax
rates to limit these effects (Atuk and Özmen 2016).

                                Besides relative prices, another important factor that would affect the
                                demand for cigarettes is income. Turkey’s economy has been growing steadily
                                since 2002. As a result of this rapid economic growth, per capita income
                                increased by 66 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2015. One downside
                                of economic growth is that the demand for cigarettes increases as the
                                population becomes richer over time and has more resources to spend on
                                cigarettes.

                                One way to measure the change in affordability is to look at the percentage of
                                per capita income needed to purchase 100 packs of cigarettes. Among upper
                                and lower middle-income countries, the percentage of national income
                                required to purchase 100 packs of cigarettes ranged from 0.5 to 31.8 percent
                                (U.S. National Cancer Institute and WHO 2016). Among all middle-income
                                countries, Turkey has one of the highest levels of cigarette affordability.
                                Between 2000 and 2013, cigarettes became more affordable in 8 out 25 high-
                                income countries and 15 out of 24 middle-income countries including Turkey.
                                This change in affordability led to an increase in cigarette consumption for
                                middle-income countries and a decrease for high-income countries. Figure
                                11 shows that a pack of cigarettes became significantly less affordable in
                                Turkey between 2008 and 2010, mostly due to the global financial crisis.
                                Affordability also declined slightly during the periods 2005-2006 and 2011-
                                2013. However, there has been a major increase in affordability since 2013.




                                                                                                                       17
Thus, 2.99 percent of per capita national income was needed to purchase
100 packs of cigarette in 2013; however, 2.56 percent of per capita national
income sufficed to purchase 100 packs of cigarettes in 2015.

                    Tobacco Taxation in Turkey: An Overview of Policy Measures and Results




Despite rising prices, cigarettes have become more affordable since 2003 as
a result of Turkey’s fast-growing economy. Like the preceding affordability
analysis, the affordability index reveals that cigarette affordability declined
only in 2009, when Turkey’s economy contracted due to the global financial
crisis. The increase in affordability of tobacco products helps explain the
increase in cigarette sales in Turkey starting in 2013. Even though the price
of cigarettes increased, higher per capita income weakened tobacco control
efforts by increasing demand for cigarettes.

Another factor that may have contributed to the recent increase in cigarette
sales is the influx of Syrian refugees into Turkey, particularly since 2013.
Tobacco use in Syria was extremely high before the crisis that began in 2011.
An estimated 60 percent of Syrian men and 17 percent of women consumed
cigarettes, and most of these were daily smokers. Around 20 percent of men
were also intermittent users of water pipes (Ward 2006). In addition, tobacco
usage is high among Syrian adolescents. Nearly 30 percent of Syrian boys
and over 15 percent of girls between the ages of 13 and 15 were found to
use tobacco products (Maziak et al. 2015). Currently, Turkey hosts more than 3
million Syrian refugees, equivalent to roughly 15 percent of Syria’s pre-conflict
population. In addition, the war in Syria has made the smuggling of cheaper
cigarettes into Turkey relatively easier as a consequence of weak border
control between Syria and Turkey.



03.4 Government Revenue from Tobacco Taxes

In 2015, Turkey collected 12.5 billion USD in tobacco tax revenues,
accounting for 8.4 percent of all tax revenues. Between 2003 and 2015, per
capita cigarette consumption decreased by 18 percent, while tobacco tax
revenue increased by 476 percent. Compared to the 2003 tobacco excise
tax revenue of 4.7 billion TL (3.1 billion USD), the 2015 tobacco excise tax
revenue increased substantially to 27.0 billion TL (9.9 billion USD). The Turkish
Government collected an additional 7.1 billion TL (2.6 billion USD) as VAT from
cigarette sales.

                   Tobacco Taxation in Turkey: An Overview of Policy Measures and Results




Since the beginning of the country’s Health Transformation Program in 2003,
Turkey has successfully increased public health spending and collected
more tobacco tax revenue. According to the latest available figures, in 2015,
tobacco tax revenue was equivalent to 42 percent of the country’s public
health expenditure and 1.5 percent of GDP.

03.5 Illicit Tobacco Trade

Fear of illicit tobacco trade has become an impediment to raising tobacco
taxes worldwide, including in Turkey. The tobacco industry has seized this as
an opportunity and attempts to convince policymakers that any tobacco tax
increase will spark uncontrollable smuggling and ultimately result in lower
government revenues. However, recent experiences in Canada and Sweden
have disproven the industry’s claim that, if tobacco taxes are lowered, then
tax revenues will increase. In the 1990s, under pressure from the tobacco
industry, the Canadian and Swedish governments lowered tobacco taxes
in an attempt to recover revenue losses caused by smuggling (U.S. National
Cancer Institute 2016). However, one year after the introduction of these
measures, tax revenues had fallen significantly, and cigarette consumption
had increased. In Canada, it has now been shown conclusively that the
tobacco industry itself was actively involved in facilitating much of the
smuggling (Blecher and Walbeek 2004; Shafey 2009).




                                                                                       21
Illicit tobacco trade has many facets and is a multiplayer process, varying
greatly in the commercial products involved and methods used. It negatively
impacts countries in both economic and social terms. Smuggling crimes are
committed either directly through border violations, or by irregularities or
forgery during customs transactions. Some of the causes of the illicit tobacco
trade include a lack of effective international cooperation, abuse of duty-free
sales, and cross-border price differentials. Other contributing factors include
lax law enforcement and insufficient penalties, transit system weaknesses, and
information distribution networks. Finally, another major contributor is the
lack of adequate resources to combat illicit practices. Although higher taxes
give more incentives for illicit tobacco trade, maintaining stable taxes at a
lower level due to fear of illicit trade does not solve the problem.

Turkey is a good example of the feasibility of combatting the illicit tobacco
trade, while successfully increasing tobacco taxes. Smuggled cigarettes,
particularly brought in via Turkey’s eastern and southeastern borders, are
distributed within Turkey and appear in trailer trucks with a fake seal and
hidden in or under numerous kinds of goods. Since smuggled cigarettes is an
important illicit trade activity, Turkey has expanded its control efforts against
illicit tobacco trade. Adopting modern tools for tracking commercial products
is part of the government’s strategy to more effectively tackle financial flows
resulting from this illicit trade activity that benefit criminal enterprises.

illicit tobacco trade (Ministry of Interior and KOM 2016). In 2007, Turkey
implemented a digital tax-stamp system using invisible ink and featuring
a unique, covert code with product data for each cigarette pack. While the
standard tax stamp provides only product security, the digital tax stamp helps
with tax revenue planning, improves accounting control, and contributes to

                      tobacco control policy, as well. The Ministry of Customs and Trade launched
                      the online “Monitoring/Tracking System for Products with Tax Stamps” in 2007.
                      This prevented products without tax stamps from remaining on the market.

                      In addition, the Ministry of Interior Affairs increased its efforts and capacity
                      for enforcement. These efforts, along with enhanced coordination among
                      Ministries, have resulted in success in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade,
                      even as the government has raised tax rates and collected significantly more
                      tobacco tax revenue. Thus, in 2009, 10.1 million packs of cigarette were seized
                      in 2,700 cases as part of the fight against tobacco trafficking. However, by
                      2015, the numbers had risen to 143.4 million packs of smuggled cigarettes
                      confiscated in 14,889 cases. The estimated tax loss resulting from seized
                      smuggled cigarettes would have been approximately 800 million Turkish Lira,
                      or 265 million USD; this is equivalent to 2.8 percent of tobacco tax revenues
                      (Ministry of Interior and KOM 2016). Between 2005 and 2011, Turkey increased
                      cigarette tax revenues by 124 percent, while the illicit tobacco market share
                      ranged between 14.3 percent and 17.5 percent (U.S. National Cancer Institute
                      and World Health Organization 2016).

                      Between 2003 and 2009, the total tobacco tax burden in Turkey increased
                      by 3.5 percentage points, from 70.6 percent to 74.1 percent, and the
                      number of packs of cigarettes confiscated by the security forces increased
                      by 6.5 million. Between 2010 and 2015, the total tax burden increased by a



                                                                                                               23
similar increment, 3.4 percentage points, from 78.7 percent to 82.1 percent.
However, during this period, the number of packs of cigarettes confiscated by
security forces surged by almost 100 million, from 43.5 million to 143.1 million
packs, due to increased efforts against illicit trade (Figure 16).

The experience of Turkey’s shows that besides higher taxes on tobacco
products, strengthened tax administration improvement efforts are required
to realize the tobacco use reduction objective of this policy measure over the
short and medium terms. From a health perspective, increased availability
and affordability of untaxed and inexpensive cigarettes puts more people at
risk of being harmed because of increased smoking, addiction to a deadly
product, and the resulting ill health, premature mortality and disability
associated with tobacco-related diseases. From a fiscal perspective, illicit
tobacco trade only benefits a few (often criminal enterprises) at the cost of
forgone tax revenues for the government, which results from taxes not being
paid on tobacco products.

04. Lessons Learned

Tobacco taxation is the most cost-effective way to fight against tobacco. It is
possible to lower tobacco consumption and increase tobacco tax revenue by
increasing tobacco taxes. Turkey’s government has increased tobacco taxes
significantly since 2002. The total tax burden as a percentage of the retail
price in Turkey reached 83 percent in 2017. As a result of the higher taxes,
Turkey managed to double total tobacco tax revenue in real terms. In 2015,
Turkey’s tobacco tax revenues were 82.13 billion TL (30.27 billion USD), and
the share of tobacco tax revenues in total tax revenue was 8.4 percent. In
addition, the percentage of the population who smoked in Turkey dropped
from 31.2 percent in 2008 to 23.2 percent in 2012.

The demand for tobacco products is sensitive to price changes. If tobacco
taxes do not lead to higher tobacco prices, the impact of tobacco taxes on
tobacco consumption is significantly diminished. Significant price increases
through higher tobacco taxes discourage current tobacco users from
continuing usage, prevent uptake of tobacco practices among potential
consumers, and reduce consumption among current users. After a decline
in total cigarette sales and per capita tobacco consumption between 2008
and 2013, both per capita tobacco consumption and total cigarette sales
have begun to increase in Turkey. Average cigarette prices rose more slowly
than the consumer price index between January 2013 and June 2016.
Therefore, the demand for cigarettes increased. Turkey’s per capita cigarette
consumption rate increased by 10 percent between 2013 and 2016.

The demand for tobacco products is also sensitive to changes in income.
The recent increase in cigarette sales can also be attributed to the increase
in affordability of cigarettes in Turkey. Turkey’s economy has been growing
steadily since 2002. As a result of rapid economic expansion, the demand
for cigarettes increased, as the population became wealthier over time. In
2013, 2.99 percent of per capita national income was needed to purchase
100 packs of cigarettes. By 2015, however, 100 packs of cigarettes could be
bought for only 2.56 percent of per capita national income. Higher tobacco
taxes are only effective in reducing tobacco consumption if they result in
lower affordability.

While high tobacco taxes may create incentives for illicit tobacco trade,
illegal trade activities can be controlled by strengthening the capacity of
tax administration systems, focusing on both on legal means (e.g., use of
prominent tax stamps, serial numbers, special package markings, health
warning labels in local languages, adoption of uniform tax rates nationwide


                                                                                       25
that facilitate successful collection at the points of manufacture and import),
and (ii) increased law enforcement (e.g., improving corporate auditing,
better trace and tracking systems, and good governance). Turkey is a good
example of the feasibility of combatting the illicit tobacco trade while
successfully increasing tobacco taxes. Between 2005 and 2011, tobacco tax
revenues increased by 124 percent, while the illicit tobacco market share
ranged between 14.3 percent and 17.5 percent. Turkey stepped up its efforts
against illicit trade by adopting digital tax stamps, which have effectively
forced products without tax stamps out of the market. In addition, Turkey
strengthened its efforts and capacity for enforcement. Enhanced coordination
enabled major gains in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade, while still
raising tax rates and tobacco tax revenue. In 2015 alone, 143.4 million packs
of smuggled cigarettes were confiscated. The estimated tax loss resulting
from seized smuggled cigarettes would have been approximately 800 million
Turkish Lira or 265 million USD.

Comprehensive, efficient national tobacco control activities require political
commitment. In this regard, the Government of Turkey has been determined
and successful in implementing tobacco control activities and fighting
against the illicit tobacco trade over the past years.

Ratification of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products,
which is a supplementary treaty to the WHO Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (FCTC), is a critical first step for countries to confront this
global health, economic and social scourge. The Protocol is now open for
ratification, acceptance, approval, formal confirmation or accession by all
Parties to the WHO FCTC to make this Protocol an international law.
