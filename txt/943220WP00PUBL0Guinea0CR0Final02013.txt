    1. Establishing an Enabling Environment
       Policies and regulations promote some level of access to ECD services in all
       sectors in Guinea. The National Policy for Preprimary Education and Child
       Protection supports access to education and social protection services, but does
       not mandate compulsory preprimary enrollment. Budget allocations for ECD are
       insufficient, and there is a lack of synergy between sectors in the
       implementation of interventions.
    2. Implementing Widely
       Although the scope of ECD programs targets all beneficiaries, inequalities exist
       in the level of coverage between regions and socioeconomic groups. Children
       and families in marginalized communities generally have less access to ECD
       services. Specialized interventions are required to ensure equal access for all
       beneficiaries.

    3. Monitoring and Assuring Quality
       Guinea collects administrative data on some important ECD indicators, but lacks
       a comprehensive system to monitor children’s development across sectors.
       Standards for ECD service delivery exist but are not always mandatory or
       adequately enforced.

   Box 3: Relevant lessons Senegal: Improving access to nutrition interventions in hard-to-reach populations

 Summary: In 2002, the Nutrition Enhancement Program (NEP) was launched by the Government of Senegal to provide
 multisectoral support for nutrition and enhance nutritional conditions for children below age 5 and pregnant and lactating
 women. It includes a community-based growth monitoring and promotion and community IMCI (Integrated Management of
 Childhood Illness) with maternal counseling, home visits, and cooking demonstrations. The project integrated nutrition
 interventions (i.e. growth monitoring and promotion) with existing health sector interventions (i.e. IMCI). The Ministry of Health
 and local development agencies already provided a relatively good scope of coverage of health interventions in local
 communities. Thus, the nutrition sector leveraged existing resources for delivering the NEP interventions. Due to the synergistic
 effect of bringing together the nutrition and health sectors, the NEP became a mechanism for delivering other essential health
 and nutrition services provided by existing programs (including insecticide-treated bed nets and vitamin A supplements). As of
 2012, the Government of Senegal has expanded the community nutrition program to reach more than 60% of the target
 population.

 Key considerations for Guinea:
 9 Given Guinea’s focus on integrated ECD services through Community Education Centers, these nutritional components could
   be included in the parental education programs provided by CECs.
 9 Promoting feeding practices combined with the delivery of essential health services can be an effective strategy to promote
   the holistic development of children.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results
       (SABER) initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on
       education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping
       countries systematically strengthen their education systems.
       SABER evaluates the quality of education policies against
       evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic tools and
       detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers,
       and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Early
       Childhood Development.
