Roadmap
for
Gender
Equality
“As the GEF moves forward with a new and innovative
investment strategy, we are deeply committed to initiating and
enhancing projects to more effectively deliver on the goals for
gender equality while addressing the challenges we face on
the global environment. These are not separate issues. Only
by engaging partners, both women and men, can we reverse
the negative trends threatening our ecosystems and save
them for our future generation.”

2 Roadmap for Gender Equality
Introduction
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has a long
history of investing in local actions geared toward
social inclusion to achieve global environmental
objectives. Mainstreaming gender1 through GEF
programs and projects presents opportunities for
enhancing project value as well as advancing gender
equality and women’s empowerment.

The GEF is committed to furthering its systematic
engagement addressing gender mainstreaming
during GEF-6, based on the GEF Policy on Gender
Mainstreaming2, which was adopted by the GEF
Council in May 2011 (refer to Annex 1). The GEF
aims to achieve global environmental benefits and
sustainable development by addressing issues related
to gender equality and women’s empowerment.

The GEF recognizes gender equality as an important
goal in the context of projects that receive GEF
support because it advances both the GEF’s goals for
attaining global environmental benefits and the goals of
gender equality and equity, and social inclusion.

1. Gender mainstreaming means bringing the experience, knowledge, and interests of
women and men to bear on the development agenda. Within a project context, gender
mainstreaming commonly includes: identifying gaps in equality through the use of sex-dis-
aggregated data, developing strategies and policies to close the gaps, devoting resources
and expertise for implementing such strategies, monitoring the results of implementation,
and holding individuals and institutions accountable for outcomes that promote gender
equality.

(b)	 Incorporated gender sensitive approaches
     and indicators in some focal area strategies,
     including international waters and climate change
     adaptation.

(c)	 Revised project templates and review criteria.
     Project templates include specific section to
     describe gender dimensions, benefits, and
     approaches. One of the project review criteria
     for GEF projects is to have appropriate gender
     consideration in project design and monitoring.

(d)	 Incorporated gender in the Results-Based
     Management (RBM). Two gender indicators,
     including staffing and gender analysis in projects,
     were incorporated in the RBM at the institutional
     level.

(e)	 Conducted annual monitoring review of gender-
     related portfolio. Annual reviews of projects
     across focal areas are conducted to see how
     gender mainstreaming has been addressed and
     integrated in GEF projects through the Annual
     Monitoring Review.

(f)	 Designated a gender focal point at the GEF
     Secretariat. A senior staff of GEF Secretariat has
     been designated to coordinate and implement the
     work related to gender mainstreaming internally
     and externally.

(g)	 Reviewed GEF Agencies on gender
     mainstreaming. Assessment was conducted
     among all ten of the existing GEF Agencies on
     whether they meet the minimum requirements of
     the Policy on Gender Mainstreaming. The report6
     was discussed at the 45th GEF Council meeting in
     November 2013.

Since the Policy on Gender Mainstreaming was
adopted in 2011, there has been a notable shift and
significant progress in the attention paid to gender
and social concerns in GEF projects. The GEF project
templates and review criteria have been revised
to describe socio-economic benefits and gender
dimensions to be delivered by the project, and how
it supports the achievement of global environmental
benefits. As a result of these efforts, an increasing
proportion of projects has mainstreamed gender
in project design.7 In particular, enabling activities
