I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in the
        Republic of Congo perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in the Republic of Congo regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in the Republic of Congo;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in the Republic of Congo;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in the Republic of
               Congo; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in the Republic of Congo.

       Use data to help inform the Republic of Congo country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In May-June 2012, 402 stakeholders of the World Bank in the Republic of Congo were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on
World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
local NGOs; international NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 361 stakeholders participated in the
country survey (90%).

Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing the Republic of Congo; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in the Republic of Congo; and the Bank’s communication
and information sharing in the Republic of Congo.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues facing the Republic of Congo: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   the Republic of Congo is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three
   most important development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in the Republic of Congo.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in the Republic of Congo, Bank staff
   preparedness, the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development
   agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to
   which the Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate
   the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources,
   the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Congo, with which groups the Bank should work
   more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in the Republic of Congo, the
   extent to which the Bank meets Congo’s need for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across forty development areas, such as
   economic growth, governance, education, health, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Congo: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in the Republic of Congo’s development in the near
   future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Congo.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
   from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in the Republic of Congo, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the Prime Minister were
        combined with those from the office of a Minister; consultants working on Bank-supported
        projects were combined with respondents from PMUs; respondents from bilateral agencies were
        combined with those from multilateral agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private
        banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; and the few respondents from
        the office of a Parliamentarian, local government, and independent government institutions were
        included in the “Other” category. Note that respondents from local and international NGOs,
        private foundations, community based organizations, trade unions, and faith-based groups were
        combined under the “CSO” category. There were no respondents from the Office of the President
        and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
       Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and PMUs/consultants on Bank

        academia/research institutes/think tanks indicated significantly lower levels.
       Respondents from Brazzaville indicated the highest levels of familiarity whereas
        respondents from Kinkala, Ngamboma, and Owando indicated significantly lower levels.
       It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
        significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
        effectiveness in Congo, the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in ratings of the World Bank’s
        effectiveness across nineteen of these forty areas of development. For the most part,
        respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and PMUs/consultants on Bank
        supported projects tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in these
        areas whereas respondents from the Office of the Prime Minister/Minister and
        academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to have significantly lower ratings for the
        Bank’s effectiveness. Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Congo, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustai nable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Congo. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at water and sanitation;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at basic infrastructure;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Congo, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at monitoring and evaluation;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at health; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at water and sanitation.

         development priorities, providing feasible recommendations, adaptability to Congo's
         development challenges, and translation. For the most part, respondents from bilateral/
         multilateral agencies tended to give the highest ratings regarding these four aspects of the
