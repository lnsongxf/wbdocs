THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        There are no minimum educational or professional requirements for
        electricians who carry out the external works. The Ministry issues licenses
        to electrical engineers only.
        The client can hire any electrician to carry out the internal wiring. The
        design approval however, needs to be submitted by an electrical

      External works are designed and carried out by the Electrical Distribution
      Networks Department of the Ministry of Electricity & Water (MEW) only.
      A 140-kVA load can be supplied from an existing distribution sub-station
      in the area, if capacity is available.
      In the absence of the infrastructure facilities, the holder of the license can
      allocate a space on the plot not exceeding 5x5 m2 for the MEW to install
4     an electrical transformer to provide additional power to the plot. Having 21 calendar days          KWD 0

      After completing the building works and obtaining the approval of the
      municipality, the applicant will need to apply for a no-objection letter
      from the municipality. The municipality will then send the letter by mail

        drawings for approval to the Electrical Installation Department of
        the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) and obtains inspection
        of internal wiring

        During or after execution of the internal wiring the client’s licensed
        engineer will need to submit the final electrical drawings related to the
        internal wiring for approval to the Electrical Installation Department of
        the Ministry. These drawings include air-conditioning, lighting and all
        other electrical equipment, electrical mains, switches, cable sizes, circuit
        breakers and fuses.
        The client will also need to submit a load form in order to obtain
        inspection of internal wiring and final connection. The load form will then
        be handed over to the applicant themselves. If the applicant is a
        company, the form will be handed over to an authorized staff of the          16 calendar days      KWD 150

        company.
        The approval itself is granted after a couple of weeks, but is obtained in
        parallel with the external works. The inspection however, happens only
        after the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) has obtained the letter
        of no-objection from the municipality.
        If the drawings meet the Ministry’s specifications, then inspectors from
        the Electrical Installation Department of the Ministry will inspect the
        internal installation (size of cables, type of fuses, cable connection
        process and installation of main panels and sub-panels inside and
        outside the warehouse).

        Upon successful inspection the applicant will pay the connection fees at
        one of the Ministry offices. The client will then need to show a receipt of
        payment to one of the nearest emergency departments of the Ministry
   7    to obtain final supply. The meter is handed over to the client directly by    2 calendar days    KWD 5,567.16

       Apply for the Borders and Cadastral Sheet from the Municipality

       The seller must request a Borders and Cadastral Sheet from the
       Municipality providing the details of the property in question (i.e. its size,
       the developments on it, the zoning, etc) and confirming that the
       property is in compliance with all the Municipality regulations. This
       document is prepared following an inspection of the property by an
       architect of the Municipality. The warehouse is likely to be in one of the
       following areas; Shuwaikh, Sulaibiya, Sabhan, Al Rai, Anghara and Ardiya.
       This is however not an exclusive list. The Kuwait Municipality, which is the
       authority responsible for zoning, may authorize the construction of a
       warehouse in an area that is not ordinarily used for warehousing. The
       documentation shall include: Application from the seller on the selling
       company's letterhead Copy of the deed of title of the property provided              1 day              KWD 5

       incurred (e.g. non-maintenance of the property, or encroachment of the
       property borders on neighboring plots), any violations of the structure
       (e.g. if the building does not meet the fire regulations), usage of the plot
       (e.g. for commercial or residential purpose). Any licenses granted to the
       plot (e.g. license to have machinery brought onto the property to be
       used on the plot) and drawings of the plot and structures approved from
       the Municipality showing the areas and utilization of the plot.

      Municipality will issue the Borders and Cadastral Sheet and transfer the
      same along with a letter of no objection to the transfer to the Ministry of
      Justice to continue the process of the property transfer. It ordinarily
      takes between 7 – 12 days for the inspection of the property that is
      located within the Capital Province by an architect/engineer representing
      the Municipality. For properties located in the other provinces, the
      process may be shorter or longer depending on the work load of the
      Municipality officials. The process is typically as follows: the seller will go
      to the Municipality (with jurisdiction over the location of the warehouse
      to be sold) to submit an application for an allocation letter (specifying
      the size of the plot and the buildings on it if any) and a description
      certificate (description of the existing buildings if any on the plot and
      size/use of such building). The fee to be paid for these documents is
      KD10. The seller concurrently delivers the warehouse's title deed to the
      Municipality against a receipt thereof. The engineer/architect responsible
      for the area then fixes a date to meet with the seller at the warehouse to
      carry out the inspection, or may alternatively carry out the inspection on
      his own. Generally, this Procedure may take 10 working days (two
      weeks). Meanwhile, the seller should obtain clearance from the utility
      authorities (i.e. electricity, water and telephone). When the Municipality
      engineer completes the inspection and the Municipality has issued the
      descriptions certificate and the allocation letter for the property, the
      seller will be issued with a receipt with a reference number from the
      Municipality with which the seller will receive the original title deed, the
      allocation letter and the descriptions certificate from the General
      Registry Division at the Ministry of Justice.

      The seller must prepare an application requesting a transfer of title to be
      filed with the Contracts Control Department of the Real Estate
      Registration Office of the Ministry of Justice. The Contracts Control
      Department reviews the application and the attached documents

      Legal representative of the parties must appear in person to sign the
      sale agreement before the notary public

      The parties must appear in person or through their attorneys to sign the
      sale agreement before the notary public. The notary public verifies the
      contents of the written agreement (a form commonly prescribed by the
      Ministry of Justice), authenticates the required signatures, and satisfies all
      other related matters. The notary public is a governmental employee in
      Kuwait providing public service and is part of the Ministry of Justice.
      The process may however take a longer (two working weeks at most) or
      shorter time frame depending on characteristics of the transaction (i.e. if
      it is a contentious issue) or the work load in the Ministry at the time of
      application. The duration of the process may also be affected by the
      identity of the entities or people involved (i.e. the process is relatively
      shorter and more straight forward for individuals while companies will
      likely take a longer period of time as more documentation is required –
7     e.g. board resolutions, minutes of meetings, etc). Furthermore, if the            1 day         no cost
      warehouse price reflected in the sale agreement is considered to be
      below the market value/price, the Ministry in such case may dispatch an
      expert to carry out a valuation of the warehouse to avoid any loss that
      may be incurred by the Ministry when it collects the transfer charges that
      are 0.5% of the property value. The process of the valuation of the
      warehouses may take approximately 5 - 10 days (one to two working
      weeks). The parties must either appear in person or send an attorney
      authorized to act on their behalf (holder of a Power of Attorney). The
      buyer typically receives the title deed on the same day after it has been
      signed by both parties and the notary public and after it has been
      stamped and given a registration number from the Department of Real
      Estate and Registration at the Ministry of Justice.

      under which the agreement will be registered under the purchaser’s

        submit it before the notary public at the Department for Real Estate and
        Registration. The notary public automatically delivers a copy of the
        notarized sale agreement to the Department of Real Estate and
        Registration. The buyer will receive a registration number on the
        notarized sale agreement (which is the new title deed for the property) at
        the time of signing the agreement before the notary public. The
        notarized sale agreement received on the date of signing the agreement
        will reflect the registration number under which the agreement has been
