EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    Executive Summary

    Indonesia is currently in the midst of major reforms of its health system, which have resulted in the
    institutionalization of one of the largest single-payer universal health coverage (UHC) programs
    in the world. At the same time, the country is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition and non-
    communicable diseases (NCDs) are now the dominant share of the overall disease burden in the country.
    Indonesia faces several challenges to effective implementation of UHC in terms of expanding breadth,
    height, and depth of coverage, especially in addressing NCD conditions, which are generally chronic in
    nature, require careful patient case management over time, and are most cost-effectively addressed at the
    primary care level. Given this backdrop, this policy paper focuses on the issue of supply-side readiness
    from the perspective of assessing the depth of UHC in Indonesia, especially in rural and remote areas of
    the country where a large proportion of the poor and near-poor populations reside, and with a focus on
    key tracer NCD conditions – diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic cardiovascular conditions, and chronic
    respiratory conditions – at the public primary care (Puskesmas) level in Indonesia. The paper compares
    supply-side implications of UHC benefit entitlements as derived from national health facility and
    program-specific guidelines with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations for service
    availability and readiness assessment (SARA) for these same tracer NCD conditions. Using a variety of
    information sources – including analysis of the 2011 Rifaskes facility census – the paper assesses the ability
    of Indonesia’s public health system to provide effective coverage for NCDs across the country.

    Results from the analysis show that, even though DM is now the eighth (and rising) cause of the
    overall disease burden in Indonesia, service readiness for basic diagnosis and basic treatment of
    DM is limited. For example, only 70 percent of urban Puskesmas could conduct a blood glucose test
    for the diagnosis and monitoring of DM. In rural Puskesmas, this readiness indicator declined to 51
    percent nationwide and in some provinces, such as Gorontalo, Papua, Southeast Sulawesi, Maluku, North
    Sulawesi, and West Papua, less than 20 percent of Puskesmas fulfilled this indicator. Basic pharmaceutical
    treatment for DM is more encouraging with 90 percent of Puskesmas stocking glibenclamide; however,
    only 48 percent stocked metformin. As over 95 percent of Puskesmas reported the availability of
    functioning blood pressure apparatus and over 99 percent reported the same of stethoscopes, most
    Puskesmas have the necessary equipment to diagnose hypertension. The availability of medical treatment
    for hypertension using captopril, a commonly used antihypertensive medication in Indonesia, is fair.
    Nationwide, 84 percent of Puskesmas stocked this medication, although deficiencies were notable in
    rural Puskesmas in provinces such as West Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua, where captopril was available
    in less than 70 percent of Puskesmas. Furthermore, in the case of hypercholesterolemia, only a third
    of Puskesmas nationally reported the ability to conduct cholesterol tests and only 36 percent reported
    the availability of simvastatin, a common treatment for hypercholesterolemia. In the case of chronic
    respiratory diseases such as asthma, over 75 percent of all Puskesmas reported the availability of basic
    treatments such as salbutamol, prednisolone, and oxygen. There are geographic variations, with less than
    75 percent of Puskesmas reporting availability of salbutamol and prednisolone in Central Sulawesi, West
    Sulawesi, and Papua.




                                                         Supply-Side Readiness for Universal Health Coverage
                                                                                                                    3


Putting all the available indicators for the three NCD tracer conditions together into an index
reveals that the deficiencies are especially prominent at the primary care level in 12 of 33 provinces
in Indonesia, especially in the eastern part of the country where 18 percent of the country’s total
population and 22 percent of Indonesia’s rural population resides: North Sumatera, Bengkulu, East Nusa
Tenggara, North Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Gorontalo, West Sulawesi, Maluku,
North Maluku, West Papua, and Papua. By way of contrast, supply-side readiness for NCDs appears not
to be a problem in public hospitals across all provinces in Indonesia.

The analysis reported in this policy note underscores that – in order to attain UHC – there needs
to be a focus not just on increasing the breadth and height but also on ensuring that effective depth
of coverage exists, especially in the rural and remote areas of the country and for primary care. It
is not enough to specify a comprehensive benefit package on paper if facilities do not have the basic
supply-side readiness conditions to be able to provide key services. In ensuring and expanding effective
depth of coverage, various policy implications should be considered. Firstly, although this paper sheds
some light on the existence of deficiencies on the supply-side, further efforts and systematic analysis are
required in order to understand why supply-side deficiencies exist so that the appropriate policy measures
can be instituted. Furthermore, as financing gradually shifts from the supply-side to the demand-side, the
mechanics of this demand-side financing should be leveraged to improve service readiness at facilities in an
optimal manner. Greater clarity is required on the implications of the benefit package, both for providers (in
order to understand what inputs are required to provide the benefit package) and for the insured, through
improved socialization of benefit entitlements so that the insured are better able to understand what services
they should be able to receive through Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (BPJS) Kesehatan. Although
the survey and census analyzed in this paper provide a snapshot of some aspects of service readiness,
regular independent monitoring and evaluation of supply readiness is required: both as part of the routine due
diligence functions of the insurance administrator and also as evaluation of the health provision system in
order to inform Ministry of Health (MoH) policy. Regardless of whether investments in service readiness
are predominantly driven by supply-side investments or by demand-side financing mechanisms, it is clear
that overall investments in service readiness for NCDs are required, in order to maximize efficiency gains
from the prevention and prudent management of these chronic conditions. Finally, although the scope of
the paper is focused on facilities, risk factors for NCDs should be addressed holistically, through public health
interventions beyond the health facility and indeed, beyond the health sector alone.

    Supply-Side Readiness for Universal Health Coverage
INTRODUCTION
6


    1. Introduction

    Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for the largest share of the overall burden of
    disease in Indonesia. Whereas in 1990 only about 37 percent of morbidity and mortality in the country
    was due to NCDs, by 2010 this number had risen to 58 percent.1 This increase is expected to continue
    as the share of the population aged 65 years and older will begin to rise rapidly beginning in 2015, and
    ageing will bring an even higher susceptibility to NCDs in Indonesia. With this rapid epidemiological
    transition in the backdrop, Indonesia is currently implementing a series of health system reforms aimed at
    attaining universal health coverage (UHC) for its population by 2019. These reforms include the merger
    of several existing contributory and non-contributory social health insurance schemes with streamlined
    uniform benefits under a single-payer umbrella beginning in 2014, followed by a gradual expansion in
    breadth of coverage to those currently uncovered by 2019.

    There are several challenges facing effective implementation of UHC in Indonesia, both from a
    health financing and a service delivery perspective. Some key issues from a health financing perspective
    are the collection of contributions from the non-poor in the informal sector, ensuring adequate fiscal
    space for financing coverage for the poor and near-poor, managing an effective transition from supply-side
    to demand-side financing of the health system, reducing out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, and ensuring
    cost containment and financial sustainability of UHC. From a service delivery perspective, important
    challenges remain related to ensuring supply-side readiness in terms of addressing the rise in NCDs,
    provision of the UHC benefit package in a coordinated manner, meeting current and future demand for
    health care, improving quality of care, leveraging and regulating private provision, and ensuring availability
    of human resources for health (HRH) across the country, among others.

    This policy paper focuses on the issue of supply-side readiness from the perspective of assessing the
    effective depth of UHC in Indonesia, especially in rural and remote areas of the country where a large
    proportion of the poor and near-poor populations reside.2 Insurance coverage under UHC implies
    benefit entitlements and – in some cases – restrictions as to what services will be eligible for reimbursement.
    As Indonesia moves towards an increase in demand-side insurance-oriented financing of its health system,
    assessing the extent to which benefit entitlements are actually available is a key consideration in ensuring
    that UHC is effective. In particular, given the rapid rise in NCDs in the country. This policy paper
    assesses the ability of Indonesia’s public primary care health facilities to provide preventive, diagnostic, and
    curative care for selected tracer NCD conditions: diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular conditions, and
    chronic respiratory diseases. The paper compares supply-side implications of UHC benefit entitlements as
    derived from national health facility and program-specific guidelines with the WHO’s recommendations

for service availability and readiness assessment (SARA) for these same tracer NCD conditions.3 Next,
using a variety of information sources – including analysis of the Rifaskes facility census triangulated
with other sources of information – the paper assesses the ability of Indonesia’s public primary care health
system to provide coverage for the selected tracer NCD conditions across the country and discusses policy
implications for effective implementation of UHC in Indonesia.

The focus in the paper is on highlighting gaps in benefit entitlements and service readiness to
stimulate policy dialogue on ways to enhance UHC implementation in the country. It is important
to note at the outset that this policy paper is not an exhaustive study of the key determinants of tracer
NCDs in Indonesia. Needless to say, even if service delivery inputs are available, the ability and efforts
of providers – as well as the actions and behaviors of households and key interventions in other sectors –
remain areas of consideration in ensuring that any intended reforms lead to improvements in NCDs and
other health outcomes. As discussed later in the paper, there are many risk factors associated with NCDs.
The availability of preventive, diagnostic, and curative medical care services is one – but only one – critical
factor in addressing the burden of disease related to NCDs in Indonesia and to ensure effective UHC
implementation. Addressing the rising burden of NCDs in Indonesia will require a coordinated effort
from both within and outside the health sector.

The remainder of the policy note is structured as follows: Section II provides some background and
context related both to NCDs and to UHC in Indonesia. Section III analyzes the benefit package for key
tracer NCD conditions, derives the supply-side implications of the benefit package, and compares these
implications to the WHO’s SARA-recommended indicators. Section IV presents results from analysis of
data related to the effective depth and distribution of coverage for key NCD conditions in Indonesia.
Section V concludes with a summary and some policy implications.

     2. Background

     2.1         Implementation of Universal Health Coverage Reforms in Indonesia

     Indonesia has mixed public-private provision of health care services, with the public sector taking
     a generally dominant role in rural areas and for secondary levels of care. For primary care, Indonesia
     has more than 9,000 public Puskesmas, each serving catchment areas of 25,000-30,000 individuals
     (approximately a third of Puskesmas also provide inpatient services). Private provision has been increasing
     rapidly in recent years, including for primary care. Of the 163,000 hospital beds in the country, about
     52,000 are managed by the private sector. In 2011, household survey data estimates indicated that less
     than half of all Indonesians reported having some form of health insurance coverage.4 An estimated 21
     percent of all households had coverage under the non-contributory Jamkesmas scheme which targeted
     the poor and near-poor; 8.9 percent of households were covered by Askes, Indonesia’s social insurance
     program for the public sector; 7.9 percent were covered under Jamsostek, the private sector insurance
     program for the formal sector; and 7.1 percent were covered by other forms of insurance. 58.5 percent
     of all Indonesian households reported having no health insurance coverage in 2011. Coverage of benefits
     under social programs such as Jamkesmas and Askes was skewed towards provision by the public sector,
     although private provider enrollment in these programs has been increasing rapidly in recent years. There
     is evidence indicating that expansion of insurance coverage has increased utilization rates, especially
     inpatient utilization, among the poor and near-poor. Nevertheless, OOP spending remains the dominant
     source of financing, and is high even among those with coverage.5

     Indonesia is currently in the midst of implementing a series of health system reforms aimed at attaining
     UHC for its population by 2019. The universal right to health care was included as an amendment
     to Indonesia’s constitution in 1999. However, the impetus for UHC came a few years later, in a 2004
     landmark legislation -- the Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional or the SJSN Law – which formed the legal basis
     for attaining several social protection objectives in the country. In 2011, the government passed a ground-
     breaking follow-up law that defined the administrative and implementation arrangements – the Badan
     Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial or BPJS Law – which stipulated that several existing contributory and non-
     contributory social health insurance schemes be merged to provide streamlined uniform benefits under
     a single-payer umbrella beginning in 2014. Following institutionalization of the single-payer insurance
     administrator (BPJS Kesehatan) in 2014, the government plans to incrementally extend coverage to the
     entire population by 2019. The unified insurance program is referred to as Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional
     (JKN). BPJS Kesehatan is expected to contract with both public and private providers for delivery of the
     JKN benefit package beginning in 2014.

With these reforms in mind, service delivery issues are increasingly relevant in Indonesia. This report
builds on an earlier report focused on the health workforce, which found that although the quantity of
health workers had increased, the deployment and distribution of health workers was still skewed and thin
in rural areas of Indonesia. Although training requirements and opportunities had expanded, the quality
of public and private health services, as measured by ability to diagnose and treat, was “marginal” and
overall quality remained low.6

2.2          Rising Non-Communicable Disease Burden in Indonesia

Like several other countries in the region, Indonesia is undergoing a rapid demographic and
epidemiological transition. NCDs now account for the largest share of the burden of disease in Indonesia.
Whereas in 1990 only about 37 percent of morbidity and mortality in Indonesia was due to NCDs, by
2010 this number had risen to 58 percent (Figure 1).7 This trend is expected to continue in the coming
years, with the share of NCDs in the disease burden continuing to rise as the population ages. Beginning
in 2015, the share of the population aged 65 years and older is projected to increase rapidly in Indonesia
(Figure 2).

     Stroke, an NCD, was responsible for the largest share of the overall disease burden in Indonesia,
     causing 8 percent of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to morbidity and premature
     mortality in 2010 (Table 1).8 Stroke was also the leading cause of premature mortality in Indonesia.
     Ischemic heart disease, unipolar depressive disorders, and diabetes are other prominent NCDs in the top
     ten causes of the disease burden, with most of these conditions having doubled their share of the disease
     burden in Indonesia over the period 1990-2010 (Table 1).

The rise in NCDs in Indonesia is a result of several socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. Ageing
is one contributory factor, although the prevalence of NCDs among younger age groups in Indonesia is
also increasing. Physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, tobacco use, and harmful alcohol consumption are key
risk factors for NCDs. Several of these risk factors – including dietary risks, hypertension, smoking, high
fasting plasma glucose, and physical inactivity – are prominent among the top ten risk factors contributing
to the overall disease burden in the country (Table 2). The share of dietary risks and high blood pressure
as contributors to DALYs lost has more than doubled over the period 1990-2010 (Table 2).

 NCDs were 51.4 percent of the top ten DALYs in Indonesia, with the top ten conditions accounting for 45.7 percent of the
total disease burden in the country.


Assessing the Depth of Coverage for Non-Communicable Diseases in Indonesia
14


     From a health financing and service delivery perspective, NCDs tend to be of a chronic nature, typified
     by long durations and slow progression rates, but they can also result in rapid premature death
     (for example, with stroke and cardiovascular conditions) or an expensive period of disability and
     morbidity. In addition, NCDs are often preceded typically by a sub-clinical phase in which preventative
     strategies may be effective in delaying or reversing disease progression. For these reasons, NCDs can be
     relatively costly to treat and require sustained case management, often requiring multiple contacts with
     the health system over one’s lifetime. In addition to the crucial role played by public health efforts aimed
     at reducing risk factors for NCDs on a population level, the management of NCDs also requires primary
     care services to play an important and effective role in screening and delivering preventive and promotive
     interventions which, for most NCDs, are far more cost-effective than treatment at advanced stages of
     progression. There is also evidence to suggest that NCDs are more likely to result in catastrophic health
     spending, placing households at risk of impoverishment.10 Given the lifestyle nature of risk factors, an
     additional challenge is that several promotive and preventive interventions for addressing NCDs tend to
     lie outside the immediate purview of health systems – in the tax, agricultural, education, urban design,
     and transport sectors – and some of these interventions are generally not amenable to inclusion as part of
     traditional insurance benefit packages.

     2.3      Supply-Side Implications of Universal Health Coverage

     UHC – ensuring that everyone has access to quality health services when needed, without experiencing
     financial hardship as a result – can be conceptualized as having three key dimensions: “breadth”,
     “height”, and “depth” (Figure 3).11 Breadth refers to the proportion of the population that is covered;
     height refers to the proportion of health costs that are paid by pooled funds as opposed to via direct OOP
     payments; and depth refers to the benefit package of services that are covered by pooled financing (and the
     definition of services can be broadened to include provision of public health interventions).12 For example:
     by expanding coverage to include the non-poor informal sector (as intended by BJPS Kesehatan), breadth
     is expanded; by excluding additional services such as cosmetic surgery, depth is reduced; and by covering
     the costs of medications and removing co-payments and deductibles (as intended by BJPS Kesehatan)
     so that patients do not need to pay out-of-pocket for these, height is increased. These dimensions are
     often interrelated, as poor service coverage due to supply-side readiness problems can drive the insured
     to alternative non-empanelled private providers, in effect rendering financial coverage or even population
     coverage meaningless. A key challenge in implementing UHC is to balance the expansion of these three
     dimensions, by making the appropriate trade-offs (given resource constraints) between breadth, depth, and
     height. Although all dimensions are important, this paper focuses on ensuring depth of coverage – not just
     on paper, but also in effect – especially in rural, remote regions of the country and in light of the rapid
     transition to an NCD-dominated disease profile in Indonesia.

                     Population: who is covered?




2.3.1        Depth of Coverage in Indonesia

From 2014 onwards, various social insurance schemes including Jamkesmas (for the poor and
non-poor) and Askes (for civil servants) have been merged into JKN, which has a single-payer
administrator (BPJS Kesehatan). The structure of the benefit packages imply that the effective depth of
coverage for NCDs is sensitive to the readiness of empanelled health facilities. All social health insurance
schemes prior to 2014 define their benefit packages generally, not by the coverage of specific diseases
but by the types of services that are eligible for coverage (e.g., health promotion, medical screening,
consultations, examination, diagnostics, and treatment); in the case of Askes, specific diagnostic tests and
medical interventions were also mentioned. The benefit packages allude to treatment guidelines, which
were level-specific in Indonesia and which for many diseases specify the names of drugs that should be
used. For public health facilities, a national essential drug list exists and is used to define which drugs can
be provided to public health facilities (these are typically procured by district health offices).13 These social
health insurance schemes also defined a “negative list” of specific services and benefits that are not eligible
under these schemes.

The JKN benefit package is comprehensive and similar to that of Jamkesmas. The benefit package has
been defined in terms of covering everything except for:

      • Health services that do not follow stipulated procedures, including referrals
      • Health services in facilities that are not contracted by BPJS Kesehatan, except for emergencies
      • Health services that are covered by occupational accidental insurance
      • Health services abroad, cosmetic procedures, health services for infertility, and orthodontic services
      • Health disorders/diseases caused by drug addiction and/or alcohol
      • Health problems caused by self-harm activities
      • Complementary treatment using alternative/traditional medicine unless declared effective by health
        technology assessments
      • Experimental procedures, health equipment for households, contraceptives, baby food, and milk
      • Health services for disaster situations.

Assessing the Depth of Coverage for Non-Communicable Diseases in Indonesia

     Despite the elaboration of the JKN benefit package, the effective depth of coverage of NCDs will
     depend on an interplay between the service readiness of these facilities (the focus of this policy
     note), government clinical guidelines, the national essential drug list, the service types defined in
     the schemes, and the exclusionary “negative list” defined in the schemes. Details of the social health
     insurance schemes and their benefit packages are summarized in Table 3 below. Given the importance of
     referrals under JKN, and for cost-effectiveness considerations more generally, it is especially important
     that the primary care sector play its role in the health system in terms of being ready to provide the
     stipulated services.

     All public health providers were automatically included in these health financing schemes, whereas
     private providers are subject to an accreditation process, with a grace period of 5 years for primary
     care facilities and 3 years for hospitals. Although including all public providers helps to expand the
     theoretical breadth (population) coverage to include the population in the catchment area of all public
     providers, this is likely at the expense of the depth (services) of coverage as these facilities many not be
     ready to provide these services. The degree of independence and robustness of the accreditation process for
     private providers would be an area ripe for further research.

     2.3.2   Provider Payment Mechanisms

     Provider payment mechanisms can influence the service readiness of health facilities, and hence are
     summarized here in order to contextualize the findings and policy implications. Demand-side payments
     from social health insurance schemes are not the primary source of revenue for health facilities. For
     example, health facilities receive equipment and drugs (except for contraceptive, immunization, and any
     drugs related to vertical programs such as HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria) from (and determined by) local
     governments and, in some instances, through a fund operated by the central government (though with
     expected but often not realized contributions from the local government) called the Special Allocation
     Fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus). Operational budgets (including salaries) are also provided by both the central
     government, through the General Allocation Fund (Dana Alokasi Umum), and by local governments.
     Vertical programs, likewise, are funded through the central government. The supply-side readiness of
     Puskesmas is hence, to a large extent, influenced by a combination of local and central government
     supply-side financing. This caveat should be considered in the following discussion on provider payment
     mechanisms used by the social health insurance schemes.

     Indonesia’s social insurance schemes made a distinction between primary care services and secondary
     care (referral) services. Capitation was the predominant provider payment mechanism at the primary
     care level although there were important variations. Askes differentiated between the type of primary
     care provider: with capitation payments ranging from Rp 2,000 per month at small Puskesmas to Rp
     6,500 per month for empanelled family doctors. Jamkesmas initially paid capitation payments directly to
     Puskesmas but, since 2011, capitation payments are made to district health offices, which then reimburse
     Puskesmas on a fee-for-service basis, depending on actual utilization. These arrangements are expected to
     be continued for Puskesmas under BPJS implementation as of 2014. Capitation payments do not currently
     expose primary care facilities to the costs of referrals made, leading to the risk of inappropriate referrals




                                                         Supply-Side Readiness for Universal Health Coverage
                                                                                                                          17


made not for clinically justified reasons, but merely to shift the costs and burden of managing a patient
to secondary care or tertiary care facilities. Furthermore, there is the risk of incentivizing undertreatment
under capitation systems, which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that Puskesmas do not need to finance
the purchasing of essential medicines and commodities themselves, but receive these without charge on
request from district health offices.

At the secondary and tertiary care (referral) levels, a form of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) called
Indonesia Case-based Groups (INA-CBGs) were used to pay providers under the Jamkesmas scheme.
BJPS Kesehatan is also using this provider payment mechanism as of 2014, replacing the tariff system used
by Askes currently in which a comprehensive schedule of tariffs varying by the hospital class/specialization
is used to pay for specifically defined diagnostic tests and medical interventions. Additional details of this
provider payment mechanism are summarized in Table 3.

     3. Supply-side Readiness Assessment

     3.1     Framework for Analysis

     The framework used in this paper for assessing supply-side readiness for UHC is summarized below
     in Figure 4. As depicted in the figure, the supply-side assessment begins with an examination of the current
     benefit package for Jamkesmas and Askes, two of the biggest social health insurance programs merged
     under BPJS in 2014, as well as the proposed package under JKN. Detailed supply-side implications for
     the provision of the benefit package were derived from program-specific Puskesmas guidelines that detail
     equipment, diagnostic tests, and medicines that are stipulated. The paper also compares the supply-side
     implications from program-specific Puskesmas guidelines with those recommended by the WHO SARA
     framework. Although the WHO SARA framework specifies various elements required for a particular
     category of services – for example, cardiovascular conditions – it does not generally specify the exact
     combination of indicators required to treat a particular (stage of ) disease, nor does it generally specify
     alternatives nor capture the full diversity of potential treatment options (for example, there are a wide
     variety of anti-hypertensive medications in reality, but only a select few “tracer” drugs are chosen).
     Furthermore, due to limitations of the data sources, which were not initially conceived for this form of
     analysis, there are important omissions in indicators captured by the census and survey. For these reasons,
     it may be misleading to generate disease-specific composite measures (which require the presence of a
     set of indicators together), although in future iterations of data collection and analysis, this would be a
     valuable measurement. The lack of an exhaustive list of all available drugs and commodities at the health
     facility limits the interpretation of some aspects of the analysis.

In assessing the depth of UHC, it is important to link the provision of covered benefits to the concept
of service delivery. Service delivery can be conceptualized as consisting of three key dimensions: (i) inputs;
(ii) ability; and (iii) effort.14 This paper focuses primarily on “service delivery inputs”, in the terminology
of the Service Delivery Indicators model, which is analogous to “service readiness” in the WHO SARA
framework. Needless to say, even if service delivery inputs are available, the ability and efforts of providers
– as well as the actions and behaviors of households and key interventions in other sectors – remain areas
of consideration in ensuring that any intended reforms lead to improvements in NCDs and other health
outcomes. The Service Delivery Indicators model is summarized in Figure 5. By converging elements from
both the Service Delivery Indicators model, and the UHC model, this framework is hence an attempt at
linking health financing structures to service delivery.

In addition, in assessing the depth of UHC, it is important to note that the three dimensions of
UHC (depth, breadth, and height) are not independent and mutually exclusive: ensuring depth of
coverage has implications for the breadth and height of UHC as well. Universal availability of the
benefit package for all – not just those who are well-off and live in urban areas – is a key aspect of ensuring
that UHC is not a hypothetical aspiration but a realized policy designed to enhance health and improve
social protection. Also, high OOP payments – that is, low height of UHC – can be (and often are) a result
of poor depth of coverage if patients have to pay OOP for drugs or seek care elsewhere in private facilities
that are outside the social health insurance network.

     3.2      Data Sources

     The assessment of the depth of coverage reported in this policy note using the framework outlined
     above is based primarily on analysis of the 2011 Rifaskes facility census data, triangulated with
     information from the 2011 Health Facility Costing Study (HFCS) as well as evidence reported in
     recent literature where applicable. The Rifaskes facility data was collected by the Ministry of Health’s
     National Institute Health Research and Development Ministry in 2011. The inclusion criterion for the
     Rifaskes census was that the facilities had to be established prior to 2010. The response rate of 685 hospitals
     and 8,981 Puskesmas was a 100 percent by all eligible public health facilities owned by central, provincial,
     and district governments. The data includes information on human resources, medical equipment,
     organization and management, health services, and outputs of most essential health services. Data was
     collected through interviews, observations, and also from secondary sources. Independent validation of
     the Rifaskes data was conducted by three public health faculties in Indonesia: University of Indonesia,
     Airlangga University, and Hasanudin University.

     Where possible, basic triangulation of Rifaskes data was done with the HFCS dataset which was a
     nationwide costing study commissioned by the Ministry of Health in 2011, financed by the German
     Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the Australian Agency for International Development
     (AusAID) with technical support from Oxford Policy Management, GIZ, and Universitas Gadjah Mada.
     The facility survey sampled 234 Puskesmas, 120 government general hospitals, and 80 private general
     hospitals across 15 provinces in 30 districts/cities. The sample was selected using a stratified random
     sampling method so as to ensure national representativeness of the facility data. The primary objective
     of the GIZ health facility study was to calculate the cost of service provision. For this purpose, the study
     collected very detailed information about assets, drugs, equipment, and supplies from Q4 2010 until
     Q3 2011. Some modules were collected monthly; others were collected quarterly or annually. To ensure
     data quality, an independent verification team was established consisting of staff from four universities:
     University of Indonesia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, University of Airlangga, and University of Hasannudin.
     The richness of the database and the time period of data collection make it useful to triangulate with
     Rifaskes data. Indicators that overlap with Rifaskes in that the same piece of equipment or drug is reported
     available, are noted as footnotes in the paper where and if there are large discrepancies.

     Although a small number (80) of private general hospitals were sampled in the HFCS, this is not
     nationally representative and the sampling methodology and criteria were unclear. In addition, with
     respect to the national insurance scheme (BPJS), private providers are subject to an accreditation process,
     and hence deficiencies in their supply-side readiness would be expected to result in exclusion from the
     scheme (and in potential impact on population coverage, or breadth, if there are no alternative providers)
     rather than impact the depth (services) of coverage. A Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS)
     covering health facilities is anticipated in the coming year. It is expected that the explanatory power of this
     service-readiness analysis can be enhanced using advanced statistical techniques that compare facilities’
     expenditure and revenue data with their readiness.

     Annex A summarizes key information regarding both the Rifaskes and GIZ facility datasets used in
     the analysis reported in this policy note.

     4. Supply-Side Readiness Assessment
        for Non-Communicable Diseases

     As mentioned above, cardiovascular diseases – including stroke and ischemic heart disease -- were
     the leading causes of the overall disease burden and the leading causes of premature mortality in
     Indonesia in 2010. Although the effective availability of treatment of stroke and acute heart disease events
     (such as heart attacks) is a key consideration in reducing the contribution of cardiovascular diseases to the
     overall disease burden, it is far more cost-effective and meaningful to focus on the ability of Indonesia’s
     health facilities to diagnose, treat, and manage chronic cardiovascular conditions at the primary care level.
     In addition to cardiovascular conditions, the policy note also assesses service availability and readiness of
     Indonesia’s primary care facilities to provide care for two additional prominent NCDs in the country: DM
     and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs).

     4.1       General Service Readiness

     The WHO SARA framework includes two domains: general service readiness and specific service
     readiness for specific diseases/conditions such as DM, cardiovascular conditions, and chronic
     respiratory care. General service readiness encompasses the basics required to provide any medical service,
     such as availability of water and a private room for consultations.

     Almost all Puskesmas in Indonesia had electricity and a private room for consultations. Basic
     communications such as telephones were present in 84 percent of Puskesmas, but computers with internet
     access were much less common, available only in 16 percent of Puskesmas (Figure 6).

     There is a nearly twofold variation between provinces with the lowest and highest general service
     readiness. In Papua, the mean basic amenities index was 46 percent compared with 89 percent for DI
     Yogyakarta (Figure 7).16 As almost all Puskesmas had electricity and a private room, most of the differences
     between provinces appear to be driven by the availability of water, toilets, basic communications, and
     referral transportation. As the primary role of Puskesmas in the management of NCDs is to provide a
     comfortable place for outpatient medical consultations, the near universal availability of electricity and a
     private room was encouraging.




     16
       The index is the average of available indicator divide by minimum indicator’s required; for example, the basic amenities index
     in province A was 50 percent, meaning that on average health centers in province A only had half of the stipulated minimum
     indicators.


                                                                   Supply-Side Readiness for Universal Health Coverage

     4.2       Human Resources for Health

     The Rifaskes census, which was not intended to specifically explore issues related to human resources
     for health (HRH), nevertheless includes several questions on the numbers and qualifications of
     staff working at the health facility as well as in-service training received. This information has been
     leveraged using the SARA framework in order to inform service readiness. However, it should be noted
     that additional dimensions – that is, provider ability (e.g., knowledge) and provider effort (e.g., presence
     at the health facility) – are not included in the Rifaskes census.

     Complementary work on HRH focuses on human resource inputs as well as some measure of health
     provider ability (using health cases or vignettes, covering prenatal care, child curative care, and adult
     curative care) from the 1997 and 2007 Indonesian Family Life Survey.17 Regarding adult curative care, of
     closest relevance to NCDs, the HRH study finds that over the 10 years from 1997 to 2007, ability scores
     have generally increased, that public providers have marginally higher scores than private providers, and
     that ability scores are marginally higher in urban compared with rural areas.

     4.3       Diabetes Mellitus

     DM, a prominent chronic NCD, occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin (Type 1
     DM) or the body is not able to effectively use the insulin that is produced (Type 2 DM).18 The result
     is raised blood sugar levels that, over time, damage nerves and blood vessels. Globally, 6.4 percent of the
     population aged 20-79 is estimated to be diabetic.19 There are no known preventive interventions for Type
     1 DM, treatment of which requires insulin therapy; however, Type 2 DM – which accounts for 90%
     of all DM cases globally – can be prevented with weight management, physical activity, and a healthy
     diet. Of particular relevance to Indonesia, where the prevalence of undernutrition is high, there is an
     established association between low birth weight and Type 2 DM.20 The management of Type 2 DM and
     its complications involves lifestyle adjustments, oral medication, and/or insulin injections.

     DM is ranked as the eighth highest cause of the overall disease burden in Indonesia, accounting
     for 3.5 percent of DALYs in 2010 (Table 1).21 The burden of DM in Indonesia has more than doubled
     over the past 20 years (Figure 8). High fasting glucose levels as a risk factor accounted for 4.7 percent
     of all DALYs in the same year, while related risk factors – dietary risks, physical inactivity, and high
     body-mass index – are also prominent in Indonesia (Table 2). Riskasdes data estimated the prevalence of
     diagnosed DM as 0.7 percent in Indonesia in 2007.22 The prevalence estimate was higher (1.1 percent)

        Indonesia Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) is routine survey conducted by NIHRD-MoH every 3 years. The sample size is
     around 240.000 household and the data represented national level and provincial level

when including those who were untreated but reported symptoms of diabetes. Blood glucose tests among
the urban population aged 15 years and older indicated a prevalence rate of 5.7 percent, with an additional
10.2 percent having impaired glucose tolerance.23 In the provinces of West Papua and North Sulawesi,
more than a quarter of urban residents aged 15 years and older were either diabetic or had impaired
glucose tolerance.

As summarized in Table 4, the supply-side implications for the diagnosis and treatment of DM at the
primary care level were similar in both the government’s Puskesmas basic service standard guidelines and
the WHO’s SARA toolkit, except that the former also specified availability of glipizid as being essential
for DM-related care at Puskesmas. As information on staff training received for NCDs was not captured
in Rifaskes, the paper uses a proxy measure as to the proportion of Puskesmas that had at least one doctor
on staff.




23
  Impaired glucose tolerance (and the related impaired fasting glycaemia) is an early stage of DM, where the formal diagnostic
criteria have not been fully met.

     Nationally, about 95.7 percent of all Puskesmas reported having a doctor on staff (94.8 percent
     of rural Puskesmas and 98.4 percent of urban Puskesmas). Across provinces, only in Papua was the
     availability of doctors at Puskesmas below a threshold level of 75 percent (Annex B).

     Regarding basic equipment for DM-related care, analysis of Rifaskes data indicates that the availability
     of blood pressure apparatus, stethoscopes, and adult scales was excellent across the country: over 95
     percent of all Puskesmas in the country reported all three key pieces of equipment being available.24
     There were no significant differences in the availability of blood pressure apparatus, stethoscopes, and
     adult scales by type and location of Puskesmas: whether rural versus urban, with and without beds, and
     across provinces. Only in the province of Maluku did only 73 percent of the 103 Puskesmas without
     beds have blood pressure apparatus, the only subcategorical grouping of Puskesmas within any province
     for which the reported availability was less than the benchmark threshold of 75 percent. On the other
     hand, the availability of measurement tape, to estimate waist circumference, was low: only 59 percent of
     Puskesmas nationally reported having this.25 Only in two provinces (DI Yogyakarta and East Java) was the
     availability of measurement tape in Puskesmas greater than 75 percent.




     24
        Over 80 percent of all Puskesmas in the HFCS facility sample reported having blood pressure monitors and adult weighing
     scales and 68 percent reported having height measurement/stadiometre.
     25
        A similar magnitude was reported in the HFCS facility sample.

The diagnostic and monitoring capacity of Puskesmas was very low: only 54 percent of Puskesmas
nationally reported being able to conduct blood glucose tests, which are crucial in the management
of DM, and only 47 percent reported being able to conduct urine tests.26 Urban Puskesmas were far
more likely to report having diagnostic capacity to conduct both blood glucose and urine tests for DM,
although even among urban Puskesmas the share reporting availability was below the threshold value of
75 percent (Table 6). The availability (or lack thereof ) of blood glucose and urine tests was correlated
across provinces: provinces with higher capacity to conduct blood glucose tests also had a generally higher
capacity to conduct urine tests (Figure 9). In Gorontalo, Papua, West Papua, Southeast Sulawesi, Maluku,
North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, and West Papua, less than 25 percent of all Puskesmas reported being
able to conduct either blood glucose or urine tests. In Gorontalo and North Sulawesi, two provinces where
the urban prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be around 8 percent for those 15 years of age or older,
less than 20 percent of urban Puskesmas reported being able to conduct blood glucose and urine tests. DI
Yogyakarta and East Java were the only two provinces where more than 75 percent of all Puskesmas were
able to diagnose diabetes using blood glucose and urine tests.27

   The Rifaskes questionnaire does not differentiate between the different types of urine tests (e.g., for protein, ketones, or sug-
ar). Almost all hospitals, on the other hand, reported being able to conduct urine tests.
27
   In a 2007 study of 252 Puskesmas and 20 private health centers in 8 provinces (DKI Jakarta, West Java, North Sumatera,
West Sumatera, DI Yogyakarta, East Java, Bali, and South Sulawesi) found similar results with 82.0 percent of health centers
reporting availability of blood glucose tests and 76.3 percent reporting urinary tests; in addition, a third of general physicians
and 78.9 percent of other health personnel had not received any training in type 2 diabetes mellitus; see Widyahening, IS and
P Soewondo. 2012. “Capacity for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary health centers in Indonesia.” Journal of

     Regarding medicines and commodities related to DM, about 80 percent of all Puskesmas nationally
     reported having glucose injectable solution, used to treat low glucose levels occasionally caused
     by treatment. Rifaskes did not collect information on availability of oral diabetic medications such as
     metformin or glibenclamide, or injectable insulin at the Puskesmas level. In the HFCS facility sample,
     only about half of all Puskesmas reported having metformin, while glibenclamide was available in almost
     90 percent of all Puskesmas in the sample.28

     4.4                                   Cardiovascular Conditions

     Relevant cardiovascular conditions for Indonesia include hypertension, coronary heart disease,
     cerebrovascular diseases, and peripheral arterial disease. In addition to genetic dispositions, risk
     factors for cardiovascular conditions include unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and smoking. As a result,
     individuals often exhibit “intermediate” risk factors such as hypertension, DM, high total cholesterol,
     and high body mass index. Prevention and treatment of hypertension, DM, and high total cholesterol –
     in addition to lifestyle change interventions – are key in preventing and managing these cardiovascular
     conditions. Although, as mentioned earlier, the SARA framework does not generally differentiate individual
     diagnoses like hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, but instead focuses on a cluster of conditions –
     without disaggregating service indicators by diagnoses – for the purposes of this report, three common
     diagnoses are highlighted: (i) hypertension (the main focus, due to relevance to Indonesia and availability
     of data), (ii) coronary artery disease (which can result in a “heart attack” or myocardial infarction), (iii)
     congestive heart failure, and (iv) hypercholesterolemia.


     28
       These magnitudes are similar to those reported elsewhere for Indonesia; see: Cameron, A. 2013. Understanding Access to Medi-
     cines in Low and Middle-Income Countries through the use of Price and Availability Indicators. Utrecht: Gildeprint Drukkerijen.

                                                                                                                                 33


Hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure) is defined as systolic blood pressure equal to or above
140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 90 mm Hg. Normal levels of blood
pressure are essential for efficient functioning of organs and body functions. Although some hypertensive
people exhibit symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, palpitations, and nose bleeds, most people with
hypertension do not exhibit any symptoms at all, making regular screening essential for detection and
control. The WHO estimates that globally about 40 percent of all adults over the age of 25 suffer from
hypertension.29 Unhealthy diets (including diets high in salt and fat, and diets low in fruits and vegetables),
physical inactivity, and stress are prominent lifestyle risk factors for hypertension. Genetic factors can play
a role, and hypertension can also be a result of other conditions such as during pregnancies and due to
endocrine dysfunctions. Untreated hypertension increases cardiovascular risk and is a major risk factor for
stroke as well as for ischemic heart disease.30

The prevalence of primary hypertension is high in Indonesia.31 The national prevalence of hypertension
among adults aged 18 years or older was estimated to be 31.7 percent in 2007.32 There was a wide variation
in the prevalence of hypertension across provinces in the country: West Papua and Papua had generally
lower prevalence rates, while South Kalimantan and East Java had higher prevalence rates (Figure 10). An
estimated 10 percent of the overall burden of disease and 370,314 deaths were attributable to high blood
pressure in Indonesia in 2010.

WHO SARA guidelines recommend that, in order for facilities to be able to diagnose and treat chronic
cardiovascular conditions: (i) at least one staff member in the facility should have received training for
diagnosis and treatment of chronic cardiovascular conditions in the previous two years, and national guidelines
for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cardiovascular conditions be available at the facility; (ii) health
facilities should have, at the minimum, stethoscopes, functional digital blood pressure machines or manual
sphygmomanometers with stethoscopes, and adult scales; as well as (iii) angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors, thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, metformin, and oxygen.

Hypertension medications as specified in the basic treatment guidelines for Puskesmas and in
the formulary include: hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine, propranolol, captopril, and nifedipine.
Guidelines for Puskesmas also specify that each facility should have “blood pressure apparatus”.33 The
guidelines furthermore mention that treatment of chronic cardiovascular conditions includes management
of hypertension and heart failure. In addition, the National Guideline for Controlling Risk Factors of
Cardiovascular Diseases includes coronary artery disease for treatment in Puskesmas.

     While diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) may rely mostly on symptoms and simple
     equipment such as blood pressure apparatus and stethoscopes, confirmation of CAD requires
     referral to secondary care facilities. However, it is expected that primary providers, including Puskesmas,
     can provide emergency measures if a cardiovascular event is suspected. Isosorbide dinitrate, aspirin,
     nitroglycerine, and diltiazem are used for anginal attack in CAD before referral. With reference to
     congestive heart failure, digoxin and furosemide are commonly used for managing mild congestive heart
     failure on an ambulatory basis. These additional drugs have been added to the list of specific service-
     readiness guidelines summarized in Table 7.

Rifaskes data indicate a generally strong readiness among most Puskesmas in Indonesia to diagnose
and treat primary hypertension. Over 95 percent of all puskemas nationally reported having functional
blood pressure apparatus, over 99 percent reported having a stethoscope, and 84 percent reported the
availability of captopril, a common (but not the only) medication for treating hypertension.34 Availability
was high even in rural Puskesmas: while 86 percent of urban Puskesmas reported availability of captopril,
the corresponding number for rural Puskesmas was 83 percent (Table 8). Nevertheless, some provincial-
level deficiencies were significant, especially with regard to reported availability of captopril: for example,
less than 75 percent of Puskesmas in West Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua, East Nusa Tenggara, North Maluku,
and Central Sulawesi reported availability of captopril (Table 8).

   WHO reported the availability of captopril in Indonesia in 2004 as 33 percent (Originator) and 93 percent (Generics) in
public sectors; For more details see: WHO. 2006. Gelders S, Ewen M, Noguchi N, Laing R. Price, availability and affordabil-

     Additional data on medications was extracted from HFCS in order to provide a picture of drug
     availability for other cardiovascular diagnoses. With regard to congestive heart failure (there is some
     overlap or dual-use of drugs with hypertension), data shows that furosemide was available in 84 percent
     of Puskesmas, isosorbide dinitrate in 60 percent, digoxin 72 percent, furosemide 83 percent, thiazide 79
     percent, nifedipine 60 percent, isosorbide dinitrate 60 percent, propanolol 52 percent, and diltiazem 22
     percent. Regarding hypercholesterolemia, HFCS data shows that simvastatin is available in 36 percent
     of Puskesmas and higher in urban (50 percent) than rural Puskesmas (27 percent). It is more available
     in the Java-Bali (42 percent) region than non-Java-Bali regions (32 percent). Although the ability to
     conduct cholesterol screening was not included in either the WHO’s SARA guidelines or in Indonesia’s
     national cardiovascular guidelines, it is notable that nationally only about 35 percent of Puskesmas report
     being able to conduct cholesterol screening tests (31 percent of rural Puskesmas and 44 percent of urban
     Puskesmas reported being able to do so). Less than 10 percent of Puskesmas in the provinces of Maluku,
     Gorontalo, East Nusa Tenggara, Southeast Sulawesi, and Papua reported being able to test for cholesterol.

     4.5         Chronic Respiratory Conditions

     Chronic respiratory diseases – asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other
     diseases of the airways and lung structures – are another growing NCD challenge; Asthma and COPD
     accounted for an estimated 1.0 percent and 2.6 percent of all DALYs lost in 2010 in Indonesia (up from
     0.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, in 1990) (Table 9). Riskesdas estimated the national prevalence
     of asthma to be 3.5 percent in 2007, with the provinces of Gorontalo, Central Sulawesi, West Papua, and
     South Kalimantan having prevalence rates in excess of 5.0 percent of the population.

Several risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases – including smoking as well as household air
pollution – are prominent in Indonesia (Table 2). The prevalence of smoking among males in Indonesia
is particularly high: the latest 2011 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) estimated that two out of every
three adult Indonesian males smoked tobacco (versus only 2.7 percent of adult females) and this ratio has
been increasing over time.35 The prevalence of smoking was generally higher in rural areas: 37.7 percent of
all adults smoked in rural areas versus 31.9 percent in urban areas. Kretek cigarette smoking was especially
popular in the country, and is the dominant modality of tobacco consumption in both urban and rural
areas. Exposure to second-hand smoke was also a large problem in the country: 51.3 percent of adults
who worked indoors and 78.4 percent of adults at home reported being exposed to second-hand smoke.36

Table 10 summarizes the supply-side implications for provision of chronic respiratory disease-
related care at the primary level derived from SARA and the Puskesmas guidelines. Facility data were
available to assess the availability of stethoscopes, salbutamol, prednisone or prednisolone, and oxygen in
Puskesmas across the country.

     In general, at the national level, the availability of the selected indicators appeared to be good: 99
     percent of Puskesmas reported having stethoscopes; and over 75 percent of all Puskesmas reported
     having salbutamol, prednisolone, and oxygen.37 Again, some provincial-level deficiencies were notable:
     for example, in the provinces of Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, and Papua, less than 75 percent of
     Puskesmas reported availability of salbutamol and prednisolone. HFCS data shows that prednisolone was
     available in more than 94 percent of Puskesmas. In addition salbutamol was available in 76 percent of
     Puskesmas, but aminophylline (another bronchodilator) was available in 90 percent of Puskesmas.




     37
          Oxygen was relevant only for Puskesmas with beds, with 80.7 percent of 5,639 Puskesmas with beds reported availability.

     5. Conclusions

     Indonesia is currently in the midst of major reforms of its health system that, have resulted in the
     institutionalization of one of the largest single-payer UHC programs in the world. At the same time,
     the country is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition and NCDs are now the dominant share of
     the overall disease burden in the country. Indonesia faces several challenges to effective implementation
     of UHC in terms of expanding the breadth, height, and depth of coverage, especially in addressing
     NCDs that are generally chronic in nature and require careful disease management over time. Given this
     backdrop, this policy note has outlined a framework for assessing the “effective depth” of coverage in terms
     of supply-side readiness to diagnose and manage key tracer NCD conditions at the public primary care
     level: DM, cardiovascular conditions, and chronic respiratory conditions.

     Regarding supply-side readiness, although DM is the eighth (and rising) cause of the overall disease
     burden in Indonesia, the service readiness for basic diagnosis and basic treatment of DM is limited.
     For example, only 70 percent of urban Puskesmas (where the prevalence of DM is higher) could conduct
     a blood glucose test for the diagnosis and monitoring of DM. In rural Puskesmas, this readiness indicator
     declined to 51 percent nationwide and in some provinces, such as Gorontalo, Papua, Southeast Sulawesi,
     Maluku, North Sulawesi, and West Papua, less than 20 percent of Puskesmas fulfilled this indicator.
     Basic pharmaceutical treatment for DM is more encouraging, with 90 percent of Puskesmas stocking
     glibenclamide but only 48 percent stocking metformin.

     As over 95 percent of Puskesmas reported the availability of functioning blood pressure apparatus
     and over 99 percent reported the same of stethoscopes, most Puskesmas have the necessary equipment
     to diagnose hypertension. The availability of medical treatment for hypertension using captopril, a
     commonly used antihypertensive medication in Indonesia, is fair. Nationwide, 84 percent of Puskesmas
     stocked this medication, although deficiencies were notable in rural Puskesmas in provinces such as
     West Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua, where captopril was available in less than 70 percent of Puskesmas.
     Furthermore, in the case of hypercholesterolemia, only a third of Puskesmas nationally reported the
     ability to conduct cholesterol tests and only 36 percent reported the availability of simvastatin, a common
     treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

     In the case of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, over 75 percent of all Puskesmas reported
     the availability of basic treatments such as salbutamol, prednisolone, and oxygen. There are geographic
     variations, with less than 75 percent of Puskesmas in Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, and Papua reporting
     availability of salbutamol and prednisolone.

     A basic index of NCD service readiness indicators can be constructed by combining all available
     NCD-related service readiness indicators. To construct this, the mean availability (or “score”) of all
     available NCD-related service readiness indicators was calculated. Next, the mean of all these scores was
     calculated for all facilities. Each indicator and each facility was weighted equally, as there is no available
     valid method at the moment for meaningfully weighting each individual indicator, and there is not
     enough information for the population catchment coverage of each facility to generate population weights


                                                          Supply-Side Readiness for Universal Health Coverage

(as is done for Service Delivery Indicators). Using this basic methodology, provincial-level NCD service
readiness can be mapped (Figure 11), revealing that in the eastern part of the country and representing
15 percent of the country’s total population and almost a fifth of all of Indonesia’s poor and near-poor
residents (in North Sumatera, Bengkulu, East Nusa Tenggara, North Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast
Sulawesi, Gorontalo, West Sulawesi, Maluku, North Maluku, West Papua, and Papua) there are substantial
deficiencies (using an index of 75 as the cut-off) in NCD service provision. Of these, provinces with the
lowest levels of NCD supply readiness were Papua, West Papua, and Maluku (Annex B).

     NCD supply readiness is correlated to economic indicators: richer provinces with generally lower
     poverty rates also tended to have better NCD supply readiness, although there are some exceptions
     to this (Figure 12). Provinces with relatively poor NCD supply readiness (NCD index < 75%) also tended
     to be those where distances to hospitals was higher than the national average and the availability of HRH
     was low, indicating broader problems related to service delivery and not just for NCDs.

     Deficiencies appear not to be a problem at the hospital level across all provinces in Indonesia (Annex
     B), at least based on the indicators that were available for NCD tracers from the hospital census. In
     addition, it is important to note that this analysis is limited to government facilities, but in reality, private
     primary care providers play a large and increasing role. There is no systematic information about service
     readiness in the private sector. Although it may not be representative of all private primary care providers,
     analysis of the profiles of family doctors both in the Askes and Jamsostek programs would help to provide
     some understanding of the service readiness of private providers.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

     6. Policy Implications

     The analysis reported in this policy note underscores that in order to attain UHC there needs to be
     a focus not just on increasing the breadth and height but also in ensuring that effective depth of
     coverage exists, especially in the rural and remote areas of the country and at the primary care level.
     It is not enough to specify a comprehensive benefit package on paper if facilities do not have the basic
     supply-side readiness conditions to be able to provide key services.38 In addition to identifying where and
     along what dimensions the key supply-side deficiencies exist, it is also important to better understand why
     this is the case. Some policy implications to ensure this are summarized below.

     Understand Why Supply-Side Deficiencies Exist. The analysis above has utilized Rifaskes and other
     facility data to demonstrate where some of the deficiencies in supply-side readiness exist at the public
     primary care level in Indonesia and looked at some broad province-level correlates. One key next step
     would be to gain a better and more systematic understanding of why these deficiencies exist and what
     can be done to overcome them. Are supply-side deficiencies a result of data collection and reporting
     deficiencies, lack of financing, information flow issues, and/or other forms of implementation challenges?
     In this regard, proposed provincial consultations and analytical work related to assessment of public
     financial flows at different levels of government (central, provincial, district) and health facilities could
     provide an excellent opportunity to help fill in some of the gaps.

     Leverage Demand-Side Financing to Improve Service Readiness at Facilities. At the primary care level,
     where the predominant provider payment method for health facilities is capitation, this payment should
     be linked directly or indirectly to the attainment of minimum standards analogous to the accreditation of
     private facilities. Although the expediency with which the government is expanding geographic coverage
     using public facilities is understandable, the insurance administrator could assess public facilities in order to
     signal to local governments where investments are required. Initial standards could start at a basic level and
     rise as the program develops, with the credible threat that facilities could be deregistered from the program
     if standards are not met, thus allowing and incentivizing facilities to upgrade their service readiness. As
     financing gradually shifts from supply-side to demand-side, an appropriate level of autonomy for health
     facilities, coupled with enhanced managerial capacity to manage revenues, would need to be found for
     public health facilities. At the secondary level, DRG-related payments could be made conditional on the
     adequacy of services provided in order to encourage investments in improving service readiness. As the
     health system evolves, additional measures to mitigate negative incentives inherent in capitation systems
     – such as over and inappropriate referral to secondary care and undertreatment – are likely to be required.

        Indonesia is not alone in this regard. In general, there are clear deficiencies in the supply-side readiness of primary care facil-
     ities in providing NCD-related care across most low- and middle-income countries. See: WHO. 2010. Global Status Report on
     Non-Communicable Diseases. Geneva: World Health Organization.

                                                                                                                   45


Clarify Supply-Side Implications of Benefit Package. As the analysis reported in this policy note
indicates, it is not enough to specify a benefit package on paper; in moving forward to implementing
UHC, Indonesia needs to ensure that there are clear supply-side implications that are derived from
the specification of the unified BPJS Kesehatan benefit package, in terms of what equipment, training,
diagnostic capabilities, and medicines are to be provided at different levels of care and to clearly specify
accountabilities for this provision. In this regard, BPJS may want to reconsider its plans for automatic
accreditation of public facilities and to consider an independent accreditation process for public facilities
as the program develops.

Improve Socialization of Benefit Entitlements. Effective implementation of UHC will also require
patients to be clear as to what benefits they are entitled to, and providers to be clear as to the minimum
requirements for provision of services. For NCDs, Indonesia does have comprehensive guidelines in place;
the issue is more of ensuring that these guidelines are widely disseminated to and internalized by providers.
An electronic form of disseminating the latest clinical guidelines for NCDs (and other conditions) may
hence be useful.

Regular Independent Monitoring and Evaluation of Supply Readiness. The MoH should consider
institutionalized collection of regular and relevant facility-level data (from a sample of facilities, including
private sector facilities, as the private sector contributes to a large proportion of health service provision)
and ensure that the data collected reflects national guidelines and norms and can help shed light not
just on where the deficiencies lie but also why they exist. Providers of traditional, complementary, and
alternative therapy should also be considered for inclusion in the collection of health facility data, in order
to capture the unique nuances of such providers, and to explore interrelations between these providers and
allopathic providers. It is understood that preparations are currently underway by the MoH to conduct
a follow-up health facility survey, which will complement a further Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
of health facilities. Facility data collection should be independent and, ideally, separate from routine
administrative data monitoring. If possible, data should also be collected from a sample of beneficiaries to
ensure that UHC service provision is occurring as intended and that patients are receiving the care they
are entitled to. This will be especially critical over the period of expansion of UHC from 2014 to 2019.

Invest in Service Readiness for NCDs. In order for investments in the expansion of the breadth and
height of UHC to be fully realized, the depth of coverage for NCDs needs to be addressed: to maximize
efficiency gains from the prevention and prudent management of these chronic diseases and conditions
by minimizing their costly and harmful complications. Findings from this health facility survey and the
additional surveys mentioned earlier should shed light on the appropriate balance of investments flowing
from the supply side versus financing received from the demand side. However, regardless of the exact
mechanism of financing used, it should be noted that public health spending in Indonesia is comparatively
low considering its economic status, and an expansion in public health financing generally would be
helpful, not only to ensure the long-term sustainability of BJPS Kesehatan, but also to improve the health
and productivity of the Indonesian population.

     Address Risk factors for NCDs Holistically. Although the scope of analysis provided in this paper is
     focused on facility service readiness, many of the risk factors for NCDs (summarized in Table 2), such as
     dietary risks, smoking, indoor air pollution, and physical inactivity, should be addressed through public
     health interventions beyond the confines of health facilities and indeed, beyond the health sector alone.
     Various cross-sectoral interventions will need to be considered – including taxation policy for tobacco,
     interventions to promote physical activity at schools and in the workplace, the designs of urban spaces,
     and environmental and energy policy.
