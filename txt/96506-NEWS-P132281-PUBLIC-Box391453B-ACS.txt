    into low user satisfaction, which in turn jeopardizes the
    sustainability of the results achieved across all countries.

    Moving the Reform Process Forward is of Vital Importance
    The countries should focus on getting sector institutions to
    work rather than keep changing the institutional framework.
    They should establish clear sectoral policies that enable
    effective stewardship and regulation, as well as planning based
    on the need to extend coverage and improve the quality of
    drinking water and sanitation services to the entire population.

    Revise Strategies and Standards is critical to meet the new
    targets
    It is critical to define new sector strategies and revise standards
    oriented towards achieving universal access to quality WSS
    services in all countries in the region.

    Urge a new water culture to promote protection and
    rational use of water resource
    The median water consumption in Central American and the
    Dominican Republic is almost 30% higher than the average in
    the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean.

    Better Information for Better Services
    Systematically compiling sector information is crucial to having
    well-informed investment planning and tracking progress
    toward better WSS services.

reach targets in both urban and rural areas (See Figure 4). The
investment gap is larger is urban areas, reflecting the difficulties
the sector faces in sustaining coverage achieved and broadening
access to account for rapid population growth, particularly in
peri-urban areas. Interestingly, the three countries have each
reached a deficit of some US$ 190 million per year.

The investment deficit in rural areas is no less significant. This is
explained by the fact that service quality and coverage targets
for rural areas have been set lower than those of urban areas.
This reinforces inequalities between urban and rural areas, that
have particularly low levels of coverage in Afro-descendent and
indigenous communities.

One relevant finding is that the cost to rehabilitate and replace
existing systems greatly surpasses the investments required
for new infrastructure to extend services to the population
that does not have access in all the countries (Figure 5). This is
due to the fact that many existing systems, built decades ago,
are reaching the end of their design lives. Moreover, this wear
and tear contributes to an increase in operating costs, further
undermining investment in new systems. While replacing these
systems will be critical to sustain current coverage levels, no
country has mechanisms in place to finance or provide funds for                 Wastewater treatment plant in Panama City, Panama. Ministry of Health

    External and internal challenges for the sustainable development         of domestic financial resources, foreign assistance, and grants,
    of the water and sanitation sector were identified through a             primarily in those countries that are highly dependent on bilateral
    series of workshops and consultations with key stakeholders              and multilateral external finance. These scenarios combined
    and experts from sector institutions, and have been validated by         with institutional fragility to develop sound proposals that affect
    representatives of the FOCARD-APS member countries.                      national and regional policy decisions are factors that can limit the

    The following challenges were identified which are outside the           Evolving Political Priorities
    remit of the domestic WSS sector, though impact its performance          A permanent risk in the countries of Central America and the
    in drinking water and sanitation service provision:                      Dominican Republic is changing government priorities, which
                                                                             can affect political support, necessary for the development of the
    Unplanned Urbanization and Rapid Population Growth                       sector in the countries, as well as the continuity of the regional
    Unplanned urbanization and rapid increases in the urban                  initiatives that are underway, such as the Regional Agenda for
    population put the sector’s achievements in drinking water and           Sanitation, MAPAS, or the Regional Information System for Rural
    sanitation coverage at risk. This is compounded by inefficiencies        WSS (SIASAR).
    in the current service delivery model and investment rates that
    are markedly insufficient to meet growing demand. Between
    1990 and 2012, the urban population grew on average 89% in the
    region. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama doubled
    their urban populations over that period. A backslide in service
    coverage is predicted if necessary reforms are not undertaken to
    improve the performance of urban service providers and funds
    are not allocated to extend drinking water and sanitation services
    to the entire urban population, which is estimated to account for
    80% of the total regional population by 2050.

    Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management
    Central America has some 723,072 million cubic meters of water,
    though only uses 8.1% for human consumption (GWP) and
    many areas suffer shortages. El Salvador, for instance, possesses
    only 1,752 cubic meters per capita on an annual basis, which
    approaches the 1,700 cubic meters per capita per year level
    considered water stress (Jiménez and Asano, 2008). Climate
    change is accentuating the phenomena of floods and droughts in
    the region. For example, The Government of Guatemala declared
    a state of emergency in 2009 for food shortages, malnutrition, and
    famine caused by a prolonged drought. The drought in the Central
    American dry corridor has resulted in crop losses of corn, beans,
    and sorghum of 50-100%, complicating food and nutritional
    security for the poorest families in the area. Forecasts indicate that
    the El Niño will be an ongoing and recurrent phenomenon. This
    will produce irregular rainfall throughout the region, representing
    a threat to the availability of water resources and the sustainability
    of WSS services, notably for those that serve the most vulnerable
    populations.

                       •	 The majority of countries in the region do not prioritize drinking water and sanitation in national strategies,
                          which limits the development of reforms, the preparation of strategic plans, and the allocation of sufficient
                          resources for the sector.

     Policies:         •	 Targets for the universalization of drinking water and sanitation services that are not disaggregated by subsector
     average              and the targets for sanitation and hygiene as well as wastew ater treatment are not prioritized in strategic sector
                          and investment plans.

       1.13            •	 The overlap of roles in legal frameworks and in sector policies complicates coordination among the multiple
                          institutions that make up the sector or implement sector projects, in addition to the effectiveness of stewardship,
                          project implementation, regulation, and service provision functions.
                       •	 The current framework has not been fully operationalized and should be adapted to the regional context to
                          include, inter alia, low cost alternative solutions for drinking water and sanitation.

                       •	 The high coverage levels reported mask problems in terms of equity of access, quality, and sustainability of
                          services.

     Planning:         •	 Investment plans for drinking water and sanitation lack a sectoral focus, instead being linked to specific
      average             institutions or programs, and responding to unplanned needs in the majority of countries.
                       •	 Plans are not coordinated with all actors, donors, and social organizations linked to the sector, nor are they
       0.38               regularly revised (annually or biannually) to monitor results and adjust targets and strategies to respond to
                          needs.
                       •	 There is a lack of standardized, updated, and accessible information, which allow for reliable measurement of
                          the results and impact of sectoral plans and investments.

                       •	 The annual budget assigned to the sector is substantially insufficient to meet the targets set by the governments.
      Budget:
      average          •	 There is no investment framework to permit medium and long term sector planning, nor are funds allocated to
                          replace infrastructure, or for climate change adaptation or disaster risk management measures.
       1.50            •	 National budget structures do not allow for monitoring investment in drinking water and sanitation
                          disaggregated by subsector or financing source (national, municipal, foreign assistance, lenders, or NGO).

      Maintenance:
        average          •	 Operating and maintenance costs are not covered by user tariffs, which results in chronic financial deficits for
                            service providers and in turn complicates the expansion and upkeep of the systems.
           0.65          •	 Payment is not promoted as a mechanism for the protection of basins, and the majority of providers do not
                            incorporate actions for the protection and conservation of water sources, climate change adaptation, or disaster

                                                     The lessons learned and best practice

The lessons learned and best practice that are presented below were endorsed by the representatives of the key institutions in the
FOCARD-APS member countries. The quotes come from participants in the process.

                                                               Lessons learned

  •	 “The ownership of the initiative by the FOCARD-APS and sector institutions of countries together with joint consultations
     through official intersectoral coordination mechanisms ensured the involvement of the entire structure of the public sector,
     donors, and civil society, making it a participatory process in each country.” This in turn facilitated coordination of information
     gathering with the GLAAS initiative, promoted by the WHO/PAHO, which avoided duplication of efforts and allowed making more
     efficient use of the scarce resources available to these sector evaluation exercises.

  •	 “The fact that the tool explicitly allowed for the visualization of results through a user-friendly format based on a traffic
     signal facilitated understanding on the part of all stakeholders and participation of decision makers, contributing to the
     empowerment of sector authorities.” Once technical experts from the various institutions that participated in the process validated
     the results, sector authorities presented the results in high-level government meetings and organized national events to disseminate
     findings.

  •	 “Validating the results of each of the indicators with reliable sources was critical to increase awareness of weaknesses in the
     sector.” The first round of the exercise offered a very optimistic picture of the sector, with highly satisfactory preliminary ratings in each
     country, which were then verified as the consultation and validation process moved forward with reliable sources. Open opportunities
     for consultation and validation with all stakeholders delayed the process but was key to the appropriation of the results by countries.

  •	 “Projecting a plausible medium term scenario allowed for visualizing expected results of ongoing initiatives to identifying
     priority reform actions.” A lesson learned from the process was that it is difficult to assign a score based only on three possibilities,
     as intermediate scores may be considered when there are ongoing reforms or programs that may improve the results. For example, a
     situation where the government has no plan for sanitation cannot be evaluated in the same way as in a case where the government is
     preparing it. The comparison of the current situation with a medium term scenario, developed by reassigning scores under the assumption
     that the expected results of these reforms and programs will be achieved, allowed the exercise to capture these results by visualizing the
     components that will improve and those that will not, or even worsen, if further action is not taken to prevent this from happening.

  •	 “Identifying who should implement each recommendation and aligning implementation of the exercise with the electoral
     cycle can generate the greatest impact for sector reform in the country.” The publication of the results of the MAPAS exercise in
     the countries at the end of the government cycle was critical to catalyze dialogue around the water and sanitation sector during the
     political transition, as were policy notes with recommendations to inform the plans of the incoming government about priority actions
     to improve the performance of WSS service delivery. This lesson learned caused the sector institutions that lead the process to reflect
     on the relevance of updating the sector assessment every two years, coinciding with the midterm and end of government mandates in
     the countries. Doing so would allow for the results to be updated based on new sectoral targets set at the midterm, and evaluate the
     progress made and pending challenges through the end of the government cycle.

  •	 FOCARD-APS: Development and institutionalization of SIASAR as harmonized information system to track progress in the rural water
     and sanitation in Central America and Dominican Republic.
  •	 Costa Rica: Significant improvement of performance indicators in urban utilities.
  •	 El Salvador: Institutionalization of public and private bodies for consumer defense.
  •	 Guatemala: Strengthening capacity of local government to improve WSS services.
  •	 Honduras: Creation of associations of rural water and sanitation community boards and regulation of rural WSS services.
  •	 Panama: Total Sanitation for the Bay in Panama City.

                                                                 Strategic opportunities

   The countries identified the strategic opportunities and next steps outlined below:

                             •	 Greater understanding of the status of WSS service delivery in Central America and the Dominican Republic, not
                                just coverage levels, m ay help leverage new investment in the sector.

                             •	 The identification of common endogenous challenges and best practices in the sector may encourage the
          Global
                                exchange of experiences with countries in other regions.

                             •	 The availability of information that is generated and validated by the countries will contribute to better reflect
                                the actual status of the sector in international reports, such as the GLAAS report or post-MDG evaluations.

                             •	 The participatory methodology of the MAPAS initiative may contribute to streamlining the sector policy dialogue
                                around common challenges and priority actions to be addressed through strategic partnerships between
                                governments and key sector stakeholders in the region.

                             •	 The results and findings of the MAPAS initiative may contribute to inform the design of regional and national
        Regional
                                strategies and promote sector-wide programmatic approach to planning processes in FOCARD-APS member
                                countries.

                             •	 Having updated information on the status of the WSS sector would enable a higher profile for FOCARD-APS
                                member countries in regional forum such as LATINOSAN.

                             •	 The sectoral policy dialogue can foster inter-institutional coordination and allow reaching consensus on priority
                                actions to undertake in the water and sanitation sector in each country.

                             •	 The results of the MAPAS initiative may inform ongoing reform processes and the development of national
         Country                public policy and plans.

                             •	 Disseminate results at the political and technical level can also contribute to inform the political transition, the
                                strategies of incoming governments and consequently, the strategic partnerships of the World Bank Group
                                (WBG) and other key sector donors in with the countries.

REGIONAL SYNTHESIS
Central America and Dominican Republic
Monitoring Country Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation (MAPAS)
This report is an overview of the MAPAS Regional Synthesis. It summarizes the inputs and results of the regional dialogue on
the Drinking Water and Sanitation sector carried out under the leadership of FOCARD-APS by official representatives from all
the member countries. It is based on the results of the initiative in El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama, which are presented
in individual country reports, complemented by information generated and validated through regional consultation
workshops, where participants identified common challenges and priority actions needed to improve sector performance
in the provision of quality drinking water and sanitation in a sustainable way to meet the sector targets established by each
country.

The opinions described here are the result of analysis and sector dialogue, and do not necessarily reflect the specific points
of view of the participating institutions or sponsors.
