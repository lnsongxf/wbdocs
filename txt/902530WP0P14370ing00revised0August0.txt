        This paper explores the conditions under which public spending could minimize
        violent conflict related to oil wealth. Previous work suggests that oil can lead to
        violent conflict because it increases the value of state as a prize or because it
        undermines its bureaucratic penetration. Yet, little has been said on how oil
        wealth could be used to prevent the onset of violent conflict through public
        spending by buying off citizens and elites, increasing state legitimacy by
        providing basic services, or strengthening the military and security apparatus. Our
        empirical analysis (148 countries over 1960 – 2009) shows that high levels of
        military spending are associated with lower risk of both small- and large-scale
        conflict onset, especially as oil revenue grows larger. Welfare expenditure is
        associated with lower risk of small-scale conflict, irrespective of the level of oil
        revenue. On the other hand, general government spending does not appear to have
        any robust mitigating effects.

INTRODUCTION

Sub-Saharan Africa has seen in the last decade significant oil and gas discoveries. In 2007,
British Petroleum estimated that Africa had the third largest global oil reserves (Omgba, 2009).
Ross (2012) reports that between 1998 and 2006, 19 new countries, mostly low and middle-
income, became oil and gas exporters. At the same time, Africa has been plagued by political
violence, in particular ravaging civil wars. This link between natural resources and conflict
outbreak has been confirmed by numerous studies (Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Collier and
Hoeffler, 2004; Humphreys, 2005; Lujala et al., 2005; Fearon, 2005; Ross, 2006; Lujala, 2010).
Ross (2012) warns that the inflow of oil revenue into mainly poor nations in Africa is likely to
spread further the oil curse in the form of lack of democracy and civil conflict. While other
causal mechanisms have been suggested (Humphreys, 2005; Ross, 2006), such negative
outcomes can also be linked to features of oil revenue - non-tax based, unstable and secretive -
that limit the ability and incentive of governments to spend such revenue productively (Ross,
2006).5

In this paper, we study the conditions under which the spending patterns of oil resources may
mitigate the risk of violent domestic conflict. Some recent research suggests that more
government spending either in general or specifically in welfare and military may reduce the risk
of civil conflict onset (Hegre and Sambanis, 2006; Basedau and Lay, 2009; Fjelde and de Soysa,
2009; Taydas and Peksen, 2012). While oil wealth has begun to be considered in the study of
civil conflict as an important source of revenue for governments, there has not been a systematic
analysis of whether oil-rich countries can increase public spending or alter the particular
allocation of such spending to social sectors or the military as a way to mitigate the risk of
conflict.

We use time-series cross section data (148 countries, 1960-2009) to test the hypothesis that oil
has a conditional effect on civil conflict depending on the size of government expenditure and
the allocation of government spending. Our dependent variable is the onset of small and large
civil conflict (Gleditch et al., 2002). The empirical estimations show that small and large
conflicts alike are less likely when large parts of oil resources are dedicated to military spending.
Increased spending in education, health or social security is associated with lower risk of small-
scale conflict, irrespective of the level of oil revenue. On the other hand, higher levels of general
government expenditure do not appear to have any robust mitigating effects.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section II reviews work on natural resources and conflict;
Section III discusses the literature on public spending and conflict; Section IV presents our
approach, derives testable hypotheses, and presents the data; Section V describes the results; and
Section VI concludes.

 Gylfason (2001) links low economic growth in resource rich countries to low investment in education. Cotet and
Tsui (2013) find that oil-rich countries tend to spend more on their military.

I. Natural Resources and Conflict

 A significant amount of research has investigated why some countries experience violent civil
 conflict. Previous work points to rebel motivation coming from grievance and injustice (Gurr,
 1970; Wimmer et al., 2009; Cederman et al., 2011) or economic opportunity and greed (Collier
 and Hoffler; 1998, 2004). Other parts of the literature emphasize the characteristics of the state
 and the different facets of state capacity (Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Buhaug, 2006; Hendrix, 2010;
 Thies, 2010). A key aspect of state capacity is having the material resources to govern and using
 fiscal policy to advance government’s priorities.

 Natural resources have been argued to influence conflict through these same channels. A large
 body of literature on civil war emphasizes that natural resources fuel violent conflict (de Soysa,
 2002; Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Ross, 2004a; de Soysa and Neumayer, 2005; Dixon, 2009). 6
 Generally, natural resources are argued to promote violence through three major causal
 mechanisms (see Ross, 2004b; Humphreys, 2005; Le Billon, 2008): (1) motivation to take up
 arms may result from grievances, such as ecological damage or the withholding of resource
 revenues; the costs and benefits related to resources are the driving forces of conflict; (2)
 resources also provide the opportunity for conflict by making rebellion or warfare financially
 feasible; (3) resources may have a detrimental influence such as state institutions (the ‘weak
 state’) and socio-economic development which in turn makes civil war more likely.

 Two ground breaking papers, Collier and Hoeffler (2004) and Fearon and Laitin (2003) both
 show that wealth in natural resources increases the probability of civil war onset. Collier and
 Hoeffler (2004) suggest that natural resources finance rebel groups and thus lower opportunity
 costs for rebellion. On the other hand, Fearon and Laitin (2003) emphasize the fact that oil
 producers tend to have weaker state apparatuses, which makes it difficult for governments to
 sustain efficient conflict prevention.7 In addition, Fearon and Laitin (2003), Englebert and Ron
 (2004), Fearon (2005), and Besley and Persson (2009) argue that natural resources swell the
 state’s coffers and thus increase the value of the state, which is then more likely to induce
 conflicts over the state as a “prize”.

 Ross (2004a) observes, however, that this negative effect may be related only to oil and not to
 natural resources in general. Reviewing 14 quantitative studies of the resource–conflict link, he
 concludes that primary commodities as a whole cannot be robustly linked to either civil war
 onset or duration. Only oil-exporting countries seem to be particularly prone to civil war onset.
 This finding is supported by another meta-analysis conducted by Dixon (2009). Furthermore,


 6
   For a more exhaustive literature review, see Ross (2006a).
 7
   Alernatively, Bulte and Bruunnschweiler (2009) and Cotet and Tsui (2013) argue that, after dealing with possible
 endogeneity problems between conflict and resource dependence, natural resource wealth no longer has a
 statistically significant effect on the risk of conflict.

                                                                                                                20
      Lujala (2010) finds that the mode of resource extraction and its location matter: oil is only linked
      to civil war onset when produced onshore; offshore oil production is unrelated to the onset of
      civil war.

      On the other hand, research has long suggested that oil might provide states with resources to
      deliver public or private goods and stabilize political regimes, be they democracies or
      dictatorships. Considerable work suggests that natural resource rents can, in fact, bring stability
      to the state-society relationship (Mahdavy, 1970; Beblawi and Luciani, 1987; Smith, 2004;
      Morrison, 2009; Basedau and Lay, 2009; Fjelde, 2009; Morrison, 2010; Ross, 2012). Bueno de
      Mesquita et al. (2003) point out that government spending decisions are strategic responses
      aimed at maintaining power. Regimes can offset oil-related or other conflict risks by generous
      and large-scale distributional policies, and as a result grievances are less likely to emerge. A
      huge security sector, financed by oil money, also helps to render rebellion more difficult.

      More specifically, Ross (2001) argues that oil wealth has two mechanisms through which
      governments provide goods that reduce social pressures against the government. First, natural
      resource wealth permits governments to buy off citizens using low tax rates and patronage (a
      “rentier effect”). The second is a “repression effect”: natural resources allow governmen ts to
      strengthen the military and security forces to maintain social order. Along the same lines, Smith
      (2004) and Morrison (2009) both demonstrate that natural resources or non-tax revenues tend to
      increase political stability by prolonging regime durability. Ulfelder (2007) also shows that
      autocracy is more durable in natural resource rich countries.

      The above discussion suggests a potential conflict between the “rentier state” argument and the
      resource curse argument, and research has been seeking background conditions that may
      condition the effect of oil on civil conflict. For instance, Humphreys (2005) finds that the
      presence of oil production significantly increases the likelihood of civil war in weak states and
      may lower conflict risk in strong states. Morrison (2010) finds similar results. Fjelde (2010) finds
      that oil wealth tends to mitigate civil war risk if political corruption is high enough to help buy
      off oppositions and placate restive groups by providing patronage in exchange for political
      loyalty.

II.     Public Spending and Conflict

      Research points out the importance of government spending in preventing violent conflict. This
      work emphasizes specific types of spending including (1) general government spending, (2)
      military spending or (3) social spending such as education, health and social security.

      General spending

      High levels of government expenditures could signal that the political leadership is willing to use
      its resources to reward its supporters, rather than spending them for personal enrichment. A

                                                                                                       21
strategic allocation of state patronage, in the form of government construction contracts, public
employment, or economic transfers, might buy support for the government from powerful
segments of the population and placate restive groups (c.f. Bratton and Van de Walle, 1997;
Acemoglu et al., 2004). Fjelde and de Soysa (2009) provide evidence indicating that higher
government expenditure enables governments to buy off effectively opposition and increase the
welfare of marginalized groups.8 This has the potential to increase the status-quo stakes of key
social actors, as well as reduce grievance and inequity, thus reducing the appeal of violent
challenges to power from both elites and the broader population.

In oil-rich countries, the signaling function and public nature of spending commitments could be
even more important than in oil-poor countries. Because oil resources are non-tax revenue, it is
generally difficult for citizens and rebels to figure out how much oil resources the government
actually has and how much the ruling elites can siphon out from the public coffers (Ross, 2012).
In this context, rebels may overestimate the value of the state. Signaling via large-scale provision
of public goods could thus lower the rebels’ perception about the value of the state as a prize
going to small elites and their expectations that they will be able to grab a high state prize
pending successful insurgency. This should result in fewer incentives to take up arms, and more
readiness to cooperate with the government.
Military spending

Collier and Hoeffler’s most recent work (2009, with Dominic Rohner) argue that the financial
and military feasibility (and thus the coercive and administration capacity of a state) play an
important role in explaining the occurrence or not of rebellion. Weak states (i.e. ones that do not
have sufficient bureaucratic presence across their national territory, police, and military forces)
will face difficulties in enforcing laws, imposing order, and maintaining peace. Similarly, Fearon
and Laitin (2003) suggest that “most important for the prospects of a nascent insurgency are the
government’s police and military capabilities and the reach of government institutions into rural
areas.” 9 Military spending would be an important aspect of state capacity to pacify violent
conflict via coercion and policing (Hendrix, 2010).




8
  Hypotheses are tested for 141 countries, 1965 - 2006. The onset of violent conflict is measured using the
UCDP/PRIO armed conflict dataset, with both the 25 casualties and the 1000 death toll threshold to define conflict
onset. Government expenditure as percent of GDP (World Development Indicators) excludes government military
expenditures that are part of government capital formation. Statistical results consistently and statistically significant
show that countries with large government expenditure ratios to GDP are less likely to experience violent conflict.
Thies (2010), however, uses an instrumental variable approach and finds no effect between the share of government
spending and large civil wars (1000 death toll threshold).
9
  Previous studies have mainly focused on the duration of violent conflict, relying on military personnel per capita
taken from the Correlated of War (COW) Material Capabilities dataset (Hendricks 2010). A key argument is that
because the strong military can defeat rebel groups more easily, it contributes to shorting duration of conflict
(Mason and Fett, 1996; Mason et al. 1999; DeRouen and Sobek 2004). There is also evidence to the contrary
(Balch-Lindsey and Enterline, 2000).

                                                                                                                       22
In consolidated democracies, where there is significant oversight over the budget, increasing
military expenditure provides public goods for citizens in the form of domestic and international
security. In mixed regimes and autocracies, on the other hand, military spending is primarily
used for repression, patronage to regime loyalists, or direct rents to the military to prevent
possible coup attempts (Collier and Hoeffler, 2007).

In this regard, Herbert et al. (2013) point out that the emergence of rebel groups in the Central
African Republic partly stems from the state’s inability to protect its citizens from violence and
poverty. The state capacity and authority in many core state functions is too weak. Along the
same lines, Hegre and Sambanis (2006) show that the size of military personnel tends to be
negatively and robustly correlated with civil war onset.

The opposite could also be suggested, however. Increasing military spending could provide
potential military opposition with the needed equipment to overthrow a regime. Larger military
budgets may not generate efficiency and loyalty, but may be a result of leaders bribing the
military to keep them from staging a coup (Belkin and Schofer, 2003; Acemoglu et al., 2009;
Keefer, 2010). Many countries at risk of civil war face other risks (Bodea and Elbadawi 2007;
Svolik, 2009; Roessler 2011). Stacking the military with loyalists or ethnic group members, by
shuffling, arresting or executing high ranking officers, or by creating multiple and overlapping
units suspicious of each other could undermine the quality of the military forces and weaken
further vulnerable regimes.

Furthermore, Henderson and Singer (2000) argue that because higher military expenditure
crowds out social spending, economic growth and investment, subsequent citizen’s grievance is
more likely to be linked with insurgency and thus fuel violent conflict. Collier and Hoeffler
(2007) find that military spending is at best ineffective in reducing the risk of internal conflict.
Similarly, the recent work by Taydas and Peksen (2012) find no effect of military spending on
civil war onset.

Social spending

Azam (2001) observes that “the occurrence of civil conflict in Africa is intimately related to the
failure of government to deliver the type of public expenditure that people want; i.e. with a
strong redistributive component such as health and education”. In earlier work, he uses a game
theoretical model that explicitly links redistributive policy adopted by states with domestic peace
(Azam, 1995). Governments could thus also foster their legitimacy, and thereby reduce the risk
of conflict, by signaling that they care about their population. This could be done in a variety of
ways, such as increased spending for water sanitation, securing basic health needs, or providing a
strong system of education (Stasavage, 2005).

Taydas and Peksen (2012) argue that spending resources in the form of social welfare policies
leads to more loyalty and support from citizens, which increases the difficulty of rebel

                                                                                                 23
recruitment. 10 Through welfare policies that influence positively the living standards of citizens,
governments can outspend the opposition, helping gain support from a broad segment of the
population, co-opt political opposition, and decrease the incentives for organizing a rebellion.
Social safety nets, transfers and investment in public goods show people that the state cares, and
prevents disadvantaged members of society from falling below a certain level of poverty and
experiencing absolute desperation. It has been argued that this strategy, namely government
commitment to redistribution in favor of the poor, had been used by rulers in the West in the
nineteenth century to increase their legitimacy and prevent revolutions (Acemoglu and Robinson,
2000).

Robins (2012) mentions that studies of the attitudes and priorities of conflict-affected people
have concluded that the degree to which a state meets its citizens’ every day needs is an
important component of their subjective assessment of its legitimacy. From this perspective,
positive encounters with frontline service officials is argued to provide a source of legitimacy for
the state, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected situations where the state was previously
mistrusted, or outright feared (Brinkerhof, Wetterberg, and Dunn, 2012). Similarly, in his study
in Medellin, Colombia, Guerrero (2011) finds that a quick upgrading of basic services
(infrastructure, health, education) in the city’s less favored districts improved political support
for and trust in government.

Taydas and Peksen (2012) also argue that social spending promotes economic development,
thereby raising further the opportunity cost of rebellion. Government investment in human
capital has a positive influence on social mobility, labor opportunities, and the distribution of
earning capacities (Korpi and Palme, 1998; Chu, Davoodi and Gupta, 2000; Justino, 2003;
Rudra, 2004; Thyn, 2006). It leads to better skilled and more productive workers, enhancing the
international competitiveness of the economy (Schultz, 1963; Van de Walle, 1996; King, 1998;
Gupta and Verhoeven, 2001; Brown and Hunter, 2004; Avelino, Brown and Hunter, 2005;
Burgoon, 2006). As social policies improve the quality of life in society and promote wealth, the
likelihood of domestic violence will decrease.

Based on the existing quantitative evidence, there seems to be an emerging consensus in the
literature that education in particular has a general pacifying effect on conflict (Østby and Urdal,
2010). 11 As discussed above, Thyne (2006) argues that by investing state resources in education
governments send a strong signal toward citizens that they are trying to improve their lives. 12


10
   Hypotheses are tested using a dataset for 153 countries, 1975 - 2005. The same dependent variable is used as
Fjelde and De Soysa (2009). The independent variable is welfare spending which combines three sources of welfare
(education, health and social security spending, as percentage of GDP). Statistical results with imputed data
consistently show that welfare spending is negatively related to the onset of both armed conflict (25 battle deaths) as
well as major civil war (1000 battle deaths).
11
   See Østby and Urdal (2010) for an extensive literature review.
12
   Empirical tests are carried on 160 countries, 1980 - 1999. The dependent variable, civil war onset is based on
Fearon and Laitin (2003). Five variables measure education: total government expenditures allocated to education as

                                                                                                                    24
Education creates opportunities for economic development and social equality, each of which
lowers grievances that lead to civil war. Education is also argued to increase the opportunity
costs for the youth to take up arms (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). Barakat and Urdal (2009)
provide evidence how higher levels of educational attainment increase the opportunity cost for
male youth (the key suppliers of rebel labor) to engage in violent conflict and reduce the risk that
large male youth bulges are associated with violent conflict.13

At the micro level, the failure of the Sudanese government to provide educational resources
adequately for the southern region has been cited as a major grievance leading to a 22-year-long
civil war (Glickman, 2000; Deng, 2001; Breidlid, 2005). Similarly, Richards (2003) places the
failure of the government to provide an adequate education at the center of rebel decisions to go
to war in Sierra Leone. Brett and Specht (2004), who have been conducting interviews with
young soldiers, have found strong micro-level support for the expectation that lack of schooling
in addition to poverty, and low alternative income opportunities are important reasons for joining
a rebel group. Similarly, Oyefusi (2008) found that low educational attainment significantly
increased the willingness of young people to participate in armed struggle for local resource
control in the oil-rich Niger Delta, Nigeria.

Thyne (2006) also suggests that education promotes social cohesion by encouraging students to
cultivate interpersonal skills and thus learn how to resolve disputes peacefully. Such social
cohesion enables the country to achieve economic and social stability, which lessens the
incidence of violent conflicts. Lipset (1959) argues that education broadens one’s outlook,
increases tolerance for other members of society, restrains extremist activity and doctrines, and
increases a person’s ability to pursue their interests using the political process. Similarly, Brady,
Verba, and Schlozman (1995), Heyneman (2003) and Almond et al. (2004) argue that schools
are one of several agents of socialization that provide people the means by which to pursue their
needs in a peaceful manner. Education provides civic skills to people, ultimately leading to
increased political participation and social stability.

Education, however, may not always lead to civil peace. Rapid expansion of education in
developing countries may increase the number of educated people to the level where the market
cannot absorb them, so that it fuels violent conflict (Huntington 1968; Oyefusi 2010). Urdal
(2006), for example, shows that the impact of large youth cohorts on terrorism is magnified in
countries experiencing a rapid expansion of education. Lange and Dawson (2010) and Lange
(2012) also argue that education is more likely to fuel violent conflict, especially ethnic violence


a percentage of GDP, primary enrollment rates, secondary enrollment rates, postsecondary enrollment rates, and
adult literacy rates. Results show a moderate to strong association between all the education variables and lower
conflict risk, with the exception of postsecondary education that does not have any significant effect.
13
   They use new global dataset (120 countries, 1970 – 2000) measuring cohort specific educational attainment rates.
Violent conflict is operationalized by the UCDP/PRIO low intensity armed conflict. The key finding is that the
effect of large young male cohorts on conflict is mitigated by higher secondary education attainment especially in
low-middle income societies.

                                                                                                                 25
  in countries with ethnic divisions, ineffective political institutions and/or low incomes. Reasons
  include the fact that education is often provided in a segregated manner with biased curricula and
  tends to deepens ethnic antagonisms. Also, schools provide diverse resources that can be
  exploited to organize collective movements, so that education intensifies citizens’ mobilization
  power, triggering ethnic violence.

III. Data and Methodology

  The manner in which the government uses natural resource revenue could affect significantly
  rebels’ view of rewards and costs from violent conflict. In a paper most closely related to ours,
  Basedau and Lay (2009) find that oil wealth (when controlling for dependence on oil revenue)
  reduces the chances for civil war onset. Their work on a small sample of countries with high
  average dependence on oil revenues shows that, comparatively, the countries rich in oil can
  maintain peace because they engage in larger scale distribution and spend more on the military.
  The analysis is based, however, on a simple comparison of country values to sample medians for
  27 oil dependent countries (after 1990) and may overlook important differences among
  countries. A more rigorous approach taking into account the possible non-linearities mentioned
  by Basedau and Lay (2009) and the endogeneity issues that plague many of the exiting studies
  would be needed to understand the possible mitigation effect of public spending on the risk of
  conflict onset related to oil.

  Method and Hypotheses

  Our dependent variable is the dichotomous indicator for conflict onset and empirical estimations
  are logit models with robust standard errors, that include the duration of peace years (or years
  since independence) and cubic splines to control for time dependence (Beck et al., 1998). To test
  our conditional hypotheses, we use interaction terms between the measure of oil value and
  measures of broad public spending and the specific spending items described above. Similar to
  previous work, all time varying variables are lagged one year. Based on our literature review, we
  derive the following three hypotheses:

         H1 (general public spending): A larger size of public spending in oil rich countries is
          associated with a lower risk of violent conflict onset.
         H2 (military spending): More military spending in oil rich countries is associated with a
          lower risk of violent conflict onset.
         H3 (social spending): More social spending (education, health and social security) in oil
          rich countries is associated with a lower risk of violent conflict onset.

  Dependent Variable

  Several data sources have been used for conflicts, explaining part of the different results found in
  the literature. There are four major datasets: (1) Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) from the

                                                                                                   26
Uppsala Conflict Data Program PRIO (Gleditsch et al., 2002); (2) Fearon and Laitin (2003); (3)
Sambanis (2004); and (4) the Correlates of War, or COW (Sarkees and Wayman, 2010). All four
use a threshold of 1000 battle deaths to define a civil war. The UCDP/PRIO dataset also codes
smaller civil conflicts of at least 25 battle deaths per year, leading to three common UCDP/PRIO
conflict constructions: low intensity (25 deaths) conflict years, cumulatively high-intensity (1000
death) years, and high-intensity years only. These competing measures differ in relation to when
to code the start, what counts as a war, and how to treat breaks in violence.

To measure the onset of violent conflict, we use in this paper the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD)
for years 1960-2009 (Gleditch et al. 2002, Version 4.1.) to generate a dichotomous variable that
takes the value of one in years with a new conflict onset and zero otherwise. This dataset has
become the standard reference for cross-country analyses of conflict determinants. The majority
of the recent studies have tended to use this source. Furthermore, along with major civil
conflicts, PRIO also codes the onset of minor conflicts as those above 25 battle deaths per year.
These smaller conflicts provide a relevant complement to the rarer full blown civil conflicts.
Adding these smaller conflicts to define conflict onset should assist in estimating the
determinants of rare events such as conflict onset.

Following Ross (2012), we regard a conflict as a new conflict onset if it occurs two years after
the previous conflict. The ACD defines violent conflict as “a contested incompatibility that
concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of
which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths”
(UCDP/PRIO 2012). As mentioned above, in addition to the low intensity violence indicator, we
also use the 1000 battle-related deaths threshold to measure the onset of major civil conflict.

Key Independent Variables: Natural Resources and Public Spending

Oil revenue: to operationalize oil revenue, we follow Ross (2012) and use his oil-gas value per
capita 14 . The data measures the value of oil and gas production per capita, multiplying the
amount of oil gas production in a country with current oil and gas prices.15




14
   The data is available online at http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/mlross (accessed on March 14th, 2013). Previous
work shows that even when looking at a wider range of natural resources, it is hydrocarbons that affect civil war
onset (Fearon, 2005; De Soysa and Neumeyer, 2008).
15
   This data has advantages over other measures that scale oil production to GDP or exports, both of which can be
driven down by risk of civil war. More importantly, it gives a sense of the size of the oil wealth available to the
government for spending. We use both logged and non-logged oil variables in our analyses. For models using non-
logged oil variable, one may suspect that results are driven by a handful of outliers. Yet, this is not the case for our
results. Even if we exclude outliers that have more than 10,000 dollars oil-gas value per capita from the models,
main results did not change. In Tables 1 and 2, we report models using the non-logged oil variable without
excluding outliers. In the Appendix, we show results using the logged oil variable, including replications of the
results of Ross (2012).

                                                                                                                       27
General government spending: we use general government final consumption expenditure
relative to GDP (WDI). This includes all government current expenditures for purchases of
goods and services (including compensation of employees). It also includes most expenditure on
national defense and security, but excludes government military expenditures.

Military spending: the Correlates of War Project (COW) provides information on total military
expenditure that we scale by total population.16

Welfare spending: this includes total health, social security and education expenditures. Total
health expenditure (public and private) is based on the WDI, complemented with data from the
IMF and Kugler et al. (2000). Social security expenditure includes public pensions and
unemployment benefits. We use for this variable the data provided by Kugler et al. (2000) and
Burgoon (2006). The education spending variable is the total public expenditure (current and
capital) on education expressed as a percentage of GDP in a given year. We use education
spending from the IMF to complement the WDI data. Following Burgoon (2006) and Taydas and
Peksen (2012), we create a welfare spending variable by combining the health, social security,
and education spending indicators to see the impact of aggregate social spending and oil on
conflict.

Missing observations in the welfare spending variable, especially in developing countries, is an
important issue that may pose difficulties in interpreting results. 17 To address this issue and for
the purpose of comparison and replication, we use the same approach as in Taydas and Peksen
(2012) and use Stata’s ICE imputation procedure. The procedure specifically imputes missing
observations based on the observed values of the non-missing variables in the same row and
creates a completed dataset. In the new completed dataset, the observed values are the same,
while the missing observations are filled in with the imputed data.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics on oil revenue and public spending based on data for all
countries except western developed democracies. We group oil-rich countries in two categories:
oil abundant countries (more than 996 dollars of oil-gas value per capita, or above the 90th
percentile for Ross’ (2012) oil-gas value per capita in the sample of non-western countries); and
oil producing countries (oil gas value per capita is between 109 and 996 dollars, or the range
between 75th and 90th percentiles). We further classify countries according to whether they are
low or high on various categories of public spending (the cut point is the mean). The
classification of countries in the tables is based on national means, which are computed by taking
within-county means over time.


16
   We prefer scaling military spending by total population because the GDP data from sources other than the COW
are not in the same metric. For comparison, in our summary Table 1 we scale military spending with GDP data from
the Penn World Table 7.1.
17
   Education spending, for instance, has significantly more missing values than health and social security spending,
so the welfare spending variable has a smaller sample size than transfer spending.

                                                        Low         1.86% (0.92)          1.37% (0.82)
                   Social Security Spending             High        4.78% (2.48)          3.6% (2.08)
                                                        Low         0.55% (0.62)          1.0% (0.97)

Note: Countries are defined as oil abundant if oil-gas value per capita (Ross, 2012) ranges above the 90 percentile (more than 996
dollars). Countries are oil producers if oil-gas value per capita ranges between the 75 and 90 percentiles (between 109 and 996
dollars). Each spending item is regarded as high if it is above the mean.

There is a remarkable variation in the pattern of government spending in countries with
significant oil revenue. No clear pattern seems to emerge. Oil abundant countries can have high
ratios of government spending to GDP (21.29 percent: Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Brunei) or more modest ones (12.3 percent: Trinidad, Venezuela,
Gabon, UAE, Turkmenistan). Similarly, resources in oil abundant countries can be directed to
the military (average of 7.85 percent of military spending to GDP: Bahrain, Brunei, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE) or military spending can be much less
prominent (0.97 percent: Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Trinidad, Turkmenistan, Venezuela). The
average difference between high and low spenders on welfare is less impressive but it exists. Oil
abundant countries that allocate significant resources to social security spend on average 4.7
percent of GDP (Kuwait), while those that allocate little spend on average 0.55 percent of GDP
(Bahrain, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, UAE,
Venezuela). Education spending shows similar patterns, with some oil abundant countries
spending above the mean for developing countries (5.51 percent: Brunei, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Trinidad, Venezuela), while other spend below that mean (3.44 percent: Bahrain, Gabon, Iraq,
Libya, Oman, Qatar, Russia, UAE).

Control Variables

Along the lines of Fearon and Laitin (2003), our model also includes a range of control variables,
capturing the variety of factors possibly explaining conflict. All models include the following
variables:

         The logged income per capita to control for the “state’s overall financial, administrative,
          police, and military capabilities.” (Fearon and Laitin, 2003). This variable also captures
          the argument that there exist fewer grievances in a society with higher levels of income;




                                                                                                                              29
        The log of the country’s population to control for “the number of potential recruits to an
         insurgency a given level of income.” (Fearon and Laitin, 2003);

        Noncontiguous territory, because if a country has a territorial base separated from the
         state’s center due to geography, rebel groups could find it easier to take up arms;

        A country’s democracy score: a more democratic country should be less likely to
         experience violent conflict because political rights and civil liberties are guaranteed in
         democracies so that people find it easier to resolve conflict through non-violent means; 18

        Political regime instability: unstable regimes signal a weakened state capacity, leading to
         an increase in the risk of violent challenges to government power;

        Ethnic and religious fractionalization captures the notion that civil wars are more frequent
         in heavily heterogeneous societies. Ethnically or religiously divided societies may face
         strong grievances, which increases the risk of violent conflict;

        A dummy variable for ongoing war: if a country is in a violent conflict with another
         group, other rebel groups may find is easier to challenge the government. 19

Econometric Issues

While previous studies have been influential, the cross-country empirics they are based on have
not always taken fully account of cross-country heterogeneity or the likely endogeneity between
conflict and our determinants. The endogeneity bias may arise from measurement errors, omitted
variables or potential reverse causality between the dependent variable, conflict onset, and our
variable of interest, public spending. It is possible, for instance, that education enrollment drops
as a civil war approaches because people flee their homes in anticipation of fighting. Likewise,
expenditures may drop before an insurgency as the government diverts resources from social
expenditures to the military in order to defend itself. Studies of conflict onset typically address
this problem by lagging the explanatory variables so that conflict onsets in a given year are
explained by the values on the explanatory variables in the previous year. However, it is possible
that problems with reverse causality appear before t-1.

To take account of unmeasured regional effects, all estimations include regional dummies as in
Fearon and Laitin (2003) for Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Europe (the Middle East being the

18
   We recode Polity IV score to avoid possible endogeneity following Vreeland (2008).
19
   Income per capita comes from Penn World Tables and World Development Indicators, supplemented with per
capita energy consumption. Population size is based on World Bank World Development Indicators. We do not
control for recent independence because for some of our specifications data is only available post 1960. Democracy
is based on Polity IV (-10 to 10). For political instability, we follow Fearon and Laitin (2003) and use a dummy
variable for country/years had a three-or- greater change on the Polity IV regime index in any of the three years
prior to the country-year in question.”

                                                                                                               30
      reference region). We also use random effects logit models. Since the dependent variable is
      binary, fixed effects would drop all the countries that do not experience any conflict over the
      period of study. Yet, at the same time, it may be the case that the effect of interactions may differ
      systematically due to country specific conditions, even after the inclusion of our control
      variables. Therefore, as an alternative, we include country-level random effects to account for the
      likelihood that each country may have different effects with regard to the interaction term.

      Finally, to test our results for military spending – our most statistically significant results – we
      also employ instrumental variable (IV) estimations. It is not hard to imagine that increases in
      military spending could be driven by high risk of civil war. To mitigate the risk of reverse
      causality, we use IV estimations in which we first predict military spending with models
      including instrumental variables that are not clearly determined by the risk of civil war.
      Following Collier and Hoeffler (2007), we use two instrumental variables: neighboring
      countries’ military spending relative to home country’s GDP and a Cold War dummy. 20 From the
      first stage model we predict values of military spending per capita and subsequently estimate
      logit models of civil conflict onset that include: oil-gas value per capita, predicted military
      spending per capita, and the predicted interaction between military spending and oil wealth.21

IV.        Results
      Tables 2 and 3 report our key results. We show the results for both small and large conflict onset.
      The coefficients on the control variables have broadly the expected signs. Political instability
      increases the risk of both small and large conflict. More populous countries also face a higher
      chance of civil conflict. The estimated coefficient for states with noncontiguous territory is
      positive and consistent with Fearon and Laitin (2003). Ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF)
      increases the risk of small scale war, while it does not appear to be associated with larger scale
      conflicts. Democracy reduces the risk of large scale conflict, while it has an ambiguous effect on
      small scale war. Finally, economic development, operationalized as income per capita is not
      predicting civil conflict in our models.

      General government spending is not robustly associated with a lower risk of conflict. Models 1
      and 2 present the estimation results for oil revenue interacted with general government spending.
      While the results in Table 1 indicate a negative and statistically significant coefficient (at the 10
      percent level) in the case of small-scale conflicts, this result does not hold once random effects
      are included (Table 3). Hypothesis 1 does not seem to hold, whereby governments are able to



      20
        We also include neighboring countries’ military spending relative to their own GDP and our results do not change.
      21
        Besides the exogenous instruments, we include the following independent variables in the first stage model: a
      country’s coup history and the years since the last coup, an indicator variable for military regimes, international war
      duration, and one year lagged values for Polity IV, per capita GDP, trade openness, oil-gas value per capita. To
      avoid the Wooldridge (2002) forbidden regression the predicted interaction between military spending and oil
      wealth comes from a similar model that also includes the interaction of predicted military spending and oil wealth.

                                                                                                                          31
contain the increased risk of conflict onset related to oil revenue by signaling their willingness to
use this revenue not just for their own enrichment, but also to reward their supporters.

Note: ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1. The estimation method is logistic regression. Models 5 and 6: Welfare spending is imputed using Taydas
and Peksen (2012) data. Regional dummies, half decade dummies, peace years and cubic splines are included in all models. Country clustered
standard errors in parentheses.


Military spending, by contrast, seems to have a mitigating effect both on large- and small-scale
conflicts. Models 3 and 4 report coefficients from estimations that include the interaction
between oil-gas value per capita and military spending per capita. The negative and statistically
significant coefficients on the interaction terms show that higher levels of spending on the
military are associated with lower risk of both small and large civil conflict. These results remain
unchanged even when random effects are included (Table 3) and support our Hypothesis 2.

In logit models the substantive effect of a particular independent variable depends on the levels
of all other variables. Therefore, to facilitate the substantive interpretation of the result, Figure 1
shows the predicted probability of small conflict at low and high military spending, for all levels
of oil-gas value per capita, using estimation results from Model 3.

With low military spending per capita (10th percentile), being oil-rich tends to increase the risk
of violent conflict by about 28 percent. Moving across the oil-gas value per capita scale (from
zero to 15,000 dollars) the risk of small conflict goes from about 2 percent to more than 30
percent. When military spending per capita is large (90th percentile), however, natural resource
wealth tends to reduce the probability of conflict. Moving across the oil-gas value per capita
scale the risk of small scale war goes from about 3 percent to zero. For large conflict, spending
more on the military also reduces the risk of conflict. In this case, however, the predicted
probability lines are downward sloping for all levels of such spending, although here again a
lower risk of conflict is associated with countries spending more on the military as revenues
from oil and gas grow larger (Figure 2).

These non-linearities may explain at least in part the diverging results observed in the literature.
For oil-poor countries with limited resources, military spending could be perceived as crowding
out more important spending, fueling citizens’ grievance and possibly leading to higher risk of
conflict. As countries become richer in oil and can tap more resources, they may be less
constrained and military spending can take place without crowding out other expenses.
Furthermore, as these governments grow richer they may represent more attractive prizes, and
would need larger military budgets to fend off unwanted claims on their treasury, either through
patronage or military action.

In both cases, signaling and patronage seem to prevail over any possible loss of efficiency in the
military apparatus. The results presented here would suggest that spending on repression,
patronage to regime loyalists, or direct rents to the military to prevent possible coup attempts
offsets any undermining in the quality of the armed forces. Governments seem to have been able
to spend on military and contain the increased risk of conflict onset related to oil resources, while
not becoming more vulnerable to other threats.

Finally, higher welfare spending seems to be associated with lower risk of small-scale conflict.
Results from Models 5 and 6 indicate a negative and statistically significant coefficient for the
level of welfare spending. The coefficient of the interaction term with the oil-gas value per capita
is, however, not statistically significant. These results remain unchanged once random effects are
included (Table 3). This would suggest that the reduction in conflict risk associated with higher

                                                                                                       19
levels of spending on education, health, and social protection is independent from the oil-gas
value. The relation is here linear and the effect on conflict higher than military spending for low
levels of oil revenue.

Robustness Tests

The use of instrumental variables for military spending does not alter the results. Models 13 and
14 in Table 3 show estimations using instrumented values for military spending per capita and
indicate that the earlier results remain robust. Interaction terms remain negative and statistically
significant and their magnitude changes little (large conflict) or not at all (small conflict). This
continues to show that spending oil wealth on the military tends to reduce the risk of conflict.

We also investigate the robustness of the results by imposing various sample restrictions that
previous work suggest may be relevant. In all cases, the results reported above remain
unchanged.

        A first restriction is whether a country is having another violent conflict or not and only
         observations that do not have an ongoing war were kept in the sample;

        We also restrict our sample by only focusing on non-democracies (autocracies and
         anocracies); 22

        We also exclude non-oil producing countries and include only country-year observations
         that produce more than 106 dollars per capita of oil and gas;

        The sample was restricted to very poor countries (the bottom 25 percentile based on
         logged GDP per capita), selecting only the post-Cold War period (1990-2009);

        Finally, we use logged oil gas value per capita to replicate the findings in Ross (2012).
         The results are shown in Models 15-19 in the Appendix and remain broadly unchanged.


CONCLUSION

If natural resources increase the risk of violence in a country, are there ways for the government
to change this course of events? Contributing to this ongoing debate in the study of civil war,
our paper sheds light on one key aspect of governments’ political decisions: the allocation of
natural resource wealth, in particular oil wealth, for various public spending items. This
pacifying outcome may be due to a signaling effect of spending, showing potential rebels the size

  We consider countries as autocracies or anocracies if a combined score of xrconst, xrcomp and xropen in Polity
IV is no more than 11 (the maximum score is 14).

                                                                                                             20
of the coalition they would be facing; a reduction of grievance; or a deterrent effect due to a
greater security apparatus.

The statistical analysis presented in this paper finds that higher levels of military spending in oil-
rich countries are associated with lower risks of both small- and large-scale conflict. This
mitigating effect is all the more potent when oil revenue grows larger. As these resources grow
in importance, larger military budgets may be called for either for repression, patronage to
regime loyalists, or direct rents to the military to prevent possible coup attempts. At low levels of
oil revenue, however, the opportunity costs of military expenditure in terms of foregone
alternative spending may fuel grievance. Higher levels of military expenditure are in this case
associated with higher risk of conflict.

Higher spending in education, health, and social protection is associated with lower risk of small
scale conflict. This effect is independent from the level of oil revenue and could be more
effective than military spending in reducing conflict risk for countries not well-endowed with
natural resources. While unable to prevent full-scale wars, higher spending on public services for
which the citizens care could be enough to reduce grievance, foster a government’s legitimacy,
and reduce the risk of small-scale conflict. Finally, higher levels of general government spending
are not robustly associated with lower risk of conflict.

These results uncover interesting non-linerarities in the relations between conflict, natural
resources (oil and gas in this case), and public spending that call for further investigation. First,
while general government spending does not seem to have any effect on conflict risk, patronage
usually goes through construction contracts or civil service employment. Examining the
association between higher investment budgets or higher wage bills and the risk of conflict may
yield different results.

Furthermore, citizens may care more about actual improvements in public service delivery than
higher public spending. Signaling without delivering the actual service may backfire and fuel
grievance. Examining the possible role of improving education or health outcomes in reducing
grievance and conflict risk could also be something for future research.
