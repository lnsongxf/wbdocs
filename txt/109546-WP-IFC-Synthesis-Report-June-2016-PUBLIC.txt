    OVERVIEW OF DAY 1

    The conference began with opening remarks by Andreas
    Pinkwart (Dean of HHL Leipzig Graduate School of
    Management), followed by Stijn Claessens (Federal
    Reserve Board, CEPR, and University of Amsterdam).
    In his remarks, Pinkwart stressed the importance of
    effective corporate governance, as its patterns lay the
    foundation for market transparency and efficiency. He
    encouraged participants to ask which concepts have
    proven beneficial for emerging markets and which have
