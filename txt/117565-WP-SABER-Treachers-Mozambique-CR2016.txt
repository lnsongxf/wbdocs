    1. Setting Clear Expectations for Teachers
       Clear expectations exist for what students should learn and what teachers are
       supposed to do. Teachers’ official duties involve both teaching and
       nonteaching tasks related to instructional improvement.

    2. Attracting the Best into Teaching
       Teacher salaries may be attractive, but entry requirements and career
       advancement opportunities may not be appealing to talented candidates.

    3. Preparing Teachers with Useful Training and Experience
       Currently, initial teacher education systems do not ensure high quality
       teachers. Beginning teachers have opportunities to develop practical teaching
       skills, but there are few entry requirements for teacher-training programs.

    4. Matching Teachers’ Skills with Students’ Needs
       Official systems are in place to attract teachers to hard-to-staff schools, but not
       to attract teachers to teach critical shortage subjects.

    5. Leading Teachers with Strong Principals
       Principals are expected to monitor teacher performance and provide support to
       teachers to improve instructional practice, but their performance is not
       rewarded. At present no mentoring programs exist for new principals.

    6. Monitoring Teaching and Learning
        Systems are in place to assess student learning, but it is not clear that these
       systems inform teaching or policy. Teacher performance is evaluated using
       some criteria that assess effective teaching.

    7. Supporting Teachers to Improve Instruction
       It is not clear that there are teacher professional development opportunities, or
       requirements for teachers to participate in professional development.

    8. Motivating Teachers to Perform
        Mechanisms are in place to hold teachers accountable. Promotion
        opportunities are not linked to teacher performance.

For each goal in the country report, we define the goal in
the first paragraph of the country report, and identify the
levers in the second paragraph,. The remaining
paragraphs provide details about the indicators that
measure each of the levers.

Using the policy levers and indicators, SABER--Teachers
classifies education systems’ performance on each of the
eight teacher policy goals, using a four-category scale
(latent, emerging, established, and advanced) The
ratings describe the extent to which a given education
system has in place teacher policies that are known to be
related to improved student outcomes.

This four-tiered rating system represents a continuum,
ranging from systems with more comprehensive,
developed policies oriented toward learning, to systems
with no policies at all (or, in some cases, policies that are
detrimental from the perspective of encouraging
learning). SABER--Teacher ratings can be defined in the
following manner:

    x   Advanced—Systems are rated “advanced”
        toward a particular policy goal when they have
        multiple policies conducive to learning in place

                                                                                                                      16

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results
       (SABER) initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on
       education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping
       countries systematically strengthen their education systems.
       SABER evaluates the quality of education policies against
       evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic tools and
       detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers,
       and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of teacher
       policies.
