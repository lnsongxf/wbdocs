How scoping is conducted depends on the project’s objectives.
More emphasis may be given to specific sectors of the economy,
or economy-wide issues affecting all firms (for example, the
inspections regime, tax system, or product standards) depending
on the nature of the project. In some countries, the business
environment may have been diagnosed many times already; in
frontier countries, even basic figures may be missing. The tool
presented in this Quick Guide should therefore be adapted to the
specific local conditions.




Process
When scoping for PPD, it is not unusual to find that the
government and private sector have pre-existing consultative
platforms. Where PPD exists and is functional—there is a clearly
defined reform process that achieves results—it is an advantage
for any international agency or private sector organization.
However, in some cases PPD is not effective or in use, and this
should become apparent by utilizing the scoping checklist in this
Quick Guide. Examining key drivers that make PPD effective,
helps reveal why dialogue is not creating impact. Understanding
the environment will provide the information necessary to
design a PPD concept that can be accepted by the respective
stakeholders.

1	PREPARING FOR THE 		
   SCOPING MISSION
1.	 DESK RESEARCH: Prior to planning a scoping mission, it is
    recommended that research be conducted to determine the
    macro-economic and political situation of the country as well as
    the legal and regulatory challenges facing private sector growth
    and productivity.
2.	 ENGAGE THE COUNTRY TEAM: The country office is the most
    suitable counterpart to support scoping mission planning, by
    identifying the relevant stakeholders and consultations necessary
    to ensure an inclusive scoping mission and share hands-on
    experience.
3.	 JOIN THE PROJECT SCOPING MISSION: It is important for
    the project team to reach out to the PPD practitioner during
    the design phase of the project. That connection will make it
    possible for the scoping missions for the project and the PPD
    component to be planned in parallel because several of the
    consultation meetings can be jointly scheduled. If the project
    leader is conducting the PPD scoping mission in person, then it
    would be beneficial to expand the project scoping mission to
    include the PPD assessment.

2	SCOPING 		
	MISSION
During the scoping mission, the project leader will focus on assessing the externalities that affect the project
environment, while keeping the stakeholder mapping process in mind, to ensure an inclusive PPD platform is set up. The
scoping mission is an assessment of the status quo and the current active players operating in the identified country.
