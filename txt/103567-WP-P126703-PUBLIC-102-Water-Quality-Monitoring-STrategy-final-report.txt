Executive Summary
The 2013 National Water Policy recognises that the quality and condition of Zimbabwe’s

surface and groundwater resources are deteriorating. The cholera outbreak of 2008-2009

countrywide that claimed over 4,000 lives as well as the recent typhoid outbreaks in Harare

are a clear indications of the need to protect water sources against pollution. The deterioration

in the quality of water resources is due to multi-sectoral factors that include discharge of

untreated or partially treated wastewater from cities, towns and industries. Challenges posed

by the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater from cities and towns can be

traced to weak waste collection and management by local authorities. Most local authorities

lack proper waste collection, disposal and management facilities that meet international

standards. As a result, all urban local authorities, including growth points, dispose of solid

waste at open dumps that have no linings to prevent leachate from contaminating surface and

groundwater. In addition, the mining sector, which has been boosted by the recent discovery

of large mineral deposits including diamonds, is a major contributor to point source pollution

of water despite the existence of effluent standards and legislation against water pollution.



To address the threats to water quality highlighted above, The Ministry of Environment,

Climate and Water, with the support of the World Bank, is preparing a ‘Strategy for

Managing Water Quality and Protecting Water Sources’. The World Bank has received funds

from the Analytical Multi-Donor Trust Fund (AMDTF) and allocated part of the funds for the

benefit of the Government of Zimbabwe to prepare such a strategy to support the

implementation of its New Water Policy. The strategy will focus on water quality and water

pollution as well as source degradation of surface water and groundwater, among others. This

strategy will be developed in two stages i.e., Phase 1 and 2. Phases 1 entails developing a

methodology for conducting a rapid assessment of water quality in selected pilot areas using
specialized tools and techniques (including Remote Sensing, Geographic Information

Systems (GIS) and field sampling) as well as identifying pollution hotspots nationwide.

Phase 2 will focus on an in-depth assessment of all hotspots across the country.



This report presents results of Phase 1 which focused on the development and testing of a

methodology for rapid mapping and classification of water sources, water quality and

quantity assessment. This was done in close collaboration with EMA, ZINWA, Catchment

Managers, Provincial Environmental Managers (PEOs), and local authorities. In other words,

due to the high intensity and widespread nature of the water quality problem, Phase 1 set out

to test and apply GIS and Remote sensing tools to calibrate field measured data with satellite

signals for specific locations and parameters to enable understanding of the pollution problem

broadly and to develop the baseline for establishing changes in water quality over time using

satellite remote sensing.



Results of Phase 1 indicate that using data from ZINWA and EMA selected surface water

pollution hotspots, including additional control points selected by the University of

Zimbabwe team, a field measured data- calibrated GIS and Remote sensing methodology for

mapping and classification of water sources, and conducting a rapid water source assessment

was successfully developed. Additionally, a GIS-based expert system was successfully

developed to characterise groundwater vulnerability in Zimbabwe.



In conclusion, Phase 1 work has demonstrated that, (1) using remote sensing and GIS, it is

possible to undertake a rapid assessment of water quality issues for both surface and ground

water as a value-addition to of the traditional methods and (2) that the methodology requires

a much smaller infrastructure outlay to accomplish. However, this approach requires highly


vi | P a g e
trained personnel, as well as robust data, with all variables measured at the same time. The

method is also intolerant of missing data cells. Finally, the field recording sheets must be well

designed and data capture from these must be well supervised. Phase 1 provides

recommendations for Phase 2, particularly that Zimbabwe implements a robust water quality

monitoring programme that has key planning elements that include clear, measurable and

well defined objectives. To this end, a review of both institutional and structural aspects for

such a water quality monitoring programme needs to be implemented. From Phase 1, an

outline of the current status of water quality monitoring in the country is presented and terms

of references for Phase 2 are spelt out based on the lessons learnt in Phase 1.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Background



Zimbabwe’s freshwater resources, comprising a network of rivers, thousands of small dams,

lakes, numerous wetlands, surface water and significant amounts of groundwater, are critical

for supporting life, economic development and natural ecosystems. To manage these water

resources, the country has been divided into seven catchments: Gwayi, Manyame, Mazowe,

Mzingwane, Runde, Sanyati and Save. These seven catchments are named after the main

river systems most of which drain into international watercourses. The national surface water

generation, i.e. mean annual runoff (MAR) is estimated at 61 mm/year with a coefficient of

variation of 122% (ZINWA, 2009). This high coefficient of variation indicates the

unreliability of runoff from year to year and hence justifies the construction of dams to

provide additional water security in times of water scarcity. Although many dams (~ 14,000)

have been constructed on the main rivers for various reasons including supplying water to

urban settlements and to irrigate farms, there is still room for additional storage as only 25%

of the potential storage has been developed so far (ZINWA, 2009). Apart from surface water,

Zimbabwe has significant groundwater resources. However the potential contribution of

groundwater to economic development has not yet been fully explored nor fully exploited.

While available national water resources are deemed sufficient to satisfy demand based on

medium to long term population projections, water quality degradation and a 15% projected

decrease in precipitation due to climate change (IPCC, 2007) imply that water managers are

confronted with the challenges of dealing with a declining resource and addressing conflicts

between competing water users.



The 2013 National Water Policy recognises that the quality and condition of Zimbabwe’s

surface and groundwater resources are deteriorating. The cholera outbreak of 2008-2009


1|Page
countrywide that claimed over 4,000 lives (Figure 1) as well as the recent typhoid outbreaks

in Harare point towards the need to protect water sources against pollution. This could just

be the tip of an iceberg, as it is also known that blue-green algal bloom in lakes is toxic and

can pose a substantial health risk for communities accessing affected water for drinking,

irrigation and recreation. Specifically, toxins can destroy cells in the liver and other internal

organs, and may act on the nervous system leading to respiratory failure. Other health

impacts of algal blooms can include gastric upsets, fever, headaches, skin irritations, and

numbness and paralysis of the arms and legs. Human deaths have been associated with blue-

green algal blooms, and deaths of livestock and wildlife are common (Erin Hestir, CSIRO

personal communication).

The deterioration in the quality of water resources is due to multi-sectoral factors that include

discharges of untreated or partially treated wastewater from cities, towns and industries.

Challenges posed by the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater from cities and

towns can be traced to weak waste collection and management by local authorities. Most

local authorities lack proper waste collection, disposal and management facilities that meet

international standards. As a result, all urban local authorities, including growth points,

dispose of solid waste at open dumps that have no linings to prevent leachates from

contaminating surface and groundwater. In addition, the mining sector, which has been

boosted by the recent discovery of large mineral deposits including diamonds, is a major

contributor to point source pollution of water despite the existence of effluent standards and

legislation against water pollution.



Zimbabwe’s water resources are also under threat from various non-point sources. These

include fertilisers and agrochemicals used in agriculture, wastewater from livestock ranches

and poultry farms, and urban runoff carrying pollutants from vehicles, effluent from

industries, wastewater discharged from leaky sewers, as well as the leachates from urban

solid waste dumps. Land use changes (e.g. settlement expansion, urbanization, conversion of

wetlands into cropland and built-up areas, as well as the conversion of vegetated areas to crop

fields) that reduce vegetation cover in catchments are also a major source of water quality

degradation.



In urban areas, diffuse runoff now poses major challenges in water quality management,

especially given that the standard strategy for waste water management in cities is based on

the use of pipes to direct effluent into waste water treatment plants. So far Zimbabwe has not

developed a strategy for diffuse source pollution management. In the case of Lake Chivero


3|Page
near Harare, the diffuse source of pollutants are now so numerous that they can maintain the

lake in a hyper-eutrophic state even when all point sources from wastewater treatment works

have been brought under control. The main diffuse sources of pollutants in Zimbabwe’s

urban areas now include urban agriculture.



To address the threats to water quality highlighted above, The Ministry of Environment,

Climate and Water, with the support of the World Bank, is preparing a ‘Strategy for

Managing Water Quality and Protecting Water Sources’. The World Bank has received funds

from the Analytical Multi-Donor Trust Fund (AMDTF) and allocated part of the funds for the

benefit of the Government of Zimbabwe to prepare such a strategy to support the

implementation of its New Water Policy. The strategy focuses on water quality and water

pollution as well as source degradation of surface water and groundwater, among others. This

strategy will be developed in two phases:

     i) Phase 1 entails developing a methodology for conducting a rapid assessment of water

        quality in selected pilot areas using specialized tools and techniques (including

        remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and field sampling) and

        identifying pollution hotspots nationwide; and

     ii) Phase 2: will be an in-depth assessment of all hotspots across the country.



The Terms of Reference (TORs) of Phase 1 are as follows:

1. Undertake review of published literature and government reports (including River System

   Outline Plans) and data on point source and diffuse source pollution and surveys of water

   weeds to identify locations, hotspots and pollution loads. Review literature on water

   sources and source degradation. In consultation with key stakeholders such as MWRDM,

   ZINWA, Catchment Offices and sub-Catchment Offices, Ministry of Environment, EMA


4|Page
   and Provincial Environmental officers, Local Authorities, Ministry of Local Government

   Rural and Urban Development and Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanization and Irrigation

   Development (MAMID), identify and locate the priority natural water sources

   (watersheds, springs, aquifers) and built water sources (dams) used for urban water

   supply and irrigation water supply to be used as a sample for rapid assessment;

2. Define the methodology for mapping and classification of water sources and carrying out

   a rapid water quality and quantity assessment. This will include:

       (i)     developing a methodology of mapping and classification of water sources,

               and,

       (ii)    developing a methodology for carrying out a rapid water quality and quantity

               assessment. The analysis it to be conducted for both wet and dry seasons;

3. Conduct a rapid water source assessment in consultation with EMA, ZINWA, Catchment

   Managers, Provincial Environmental Managers (PEOs), and local authorities;

4. Conduct a rapid water quality assessment in consultation with EMA, ZINWA, Catchment

   Managers, PEOs, and local authorities;

5. Analyze and interpret the results;

6. Use GIS and Remote sensing tools to calibrate field measured data with satellite signals

   for specific locations and parameters to enable understanding the pollution problem

   broadly and to develop the baseline for establishing changes in water quality over time

   using satellite remote sensing;

7. Draft Phase 1 report;

8. Present at a workshop (a) the methodology used and results obtained, (b) the maps

   generated, and (c) develop TOR, work plan and budget for Phase 2 work to scale up the

   analysis to all pollution and source degradation hotpots across the country; and

9. Submit the final Phase 1 Report.

Chapter 2: Water quality and source degradation in Zimbabwe



2.1 Introduction

Zimbabwe’s water resources - comprising surface and groundwater - are critical for

supporting life, economic development and natural ecosystems. Usable water resources are

under stress and in recent years water quality has been diminishing rapidly due to pollution.

The unavailability of a regular water supply for domestic use in Zimbabwe’s urban areas is

well-known problem. It is also well-established that when the water is available its quality for

human consumption is often questionable. This problem is often framed in local authorities’

inability to provide water due to inadequate infrastructure, rather than declining supply from

the catchments.




Surface water

In our water quality survey, we noticed that except for Zhove dam in Beitbridge district all

other dams were critically low. Many streams and rivers, such as the Mzingwane River are

now seasonal rivers. When they do flow, the hydrographs are peaked with reversion to base

flow soon after the end of the rainy season. This implies that whatever hydrological income

we have it quickly passes through Zimbabwe, leaving little dry season reserves. Those

reserves are in the form of reservoirs. While the storage capacity of large reservoirs has not

been significantly altered, many of the small reservoirs, such as Nyamabishi Dam in Chiota,

are either completely or highly silted. Google Earth images show that many dams have

stretches of sand in the inflowing rivers waiting to enter the reservoirs. Thus, many reservoirs

now have finite lifetime measurable in decades rather than centuries.




7|Page
Virtually all large rivers, with the exception of the fast flowing river draining the eastern

highlands, show large amounts of siltation. People now cross the Save river at Birchenough

bridge on foot, bypassing the bridge. Yet there was once deep dark pools laden with legends

and mystery. Mysterious pools, like the Chirikuusti in the Honde valley or the Nyachowa

pool in Chogodora in Zimunya were centres of spiritual and cultural focus. Now they are

profaned sand pits. The hippopotamus, crocodile and fishes that used to occur in this river are

now distant memories of aged generations.



Climate change and land uses changes compound the problem of surface and groundwater

availability. There is little we can do about climate, but with regard to lands use we can adopt

land use practices that protect catchments and enhance water security.



With regard to water quality, the old Shona adage “mvura haina nganga” - water is innocent -

rarely holds now. It is now an undeniable fact that most of our surface water and some

groundwater resources need to be treated before they can be deemed safe for human

consumption. The sources of contamination are numerous but the main ones include:

inadequate sanitation, shared use of water by humans and livestock, frequent sewer outbursts,

industrial effluents and alluvial mining. Traditionally local authorities have attempted to

control point source pollution, but recent studies show that diffuse source pollution is now a

major source of water quality degradation. For example, the rehabilitation of all wastewater

treatment works in the Manyame watershed will not alleviate eutrophication in Lake Chivero,

but a combination of engineering and ecological approaches that are costly could restore

water quality in Chivero in less than ten years

Poverty has lead to desperate activities, and in particular alluvial mining. The use of toxic

substances to extract minerals such as gold is slowly poisoning our waters with toxins that do

not degrade easily. These are cyanide and mercury, and further prolonged exposure to such

toxins can result in serious health problems (Hutton, 1987). Human health risks include the

carcinogenicity of arsenic, cadmium toxicity to the kidneys and the destruction of the central

nervous system by lead (Fu et al., 2008). In addition, the excavation of riverbanks and

transfer of soil into streams for gold panning is changing the flow and nature of our rivers,

leading to both physical and ecological damage to our river systems.



The deterioration of water quality poses a direct threat to human health. Recent outbreaks of

enteric diseases, such as cholera, typhoid are a clear manifestation of this link. These

outbreaks attract international attention and can be dealt with in good time. However, the

greater problem is in the insidious diseases which are not obviously linked to water quality.

These are disorders of the liver and kidneys and other body organs caused by carcinogens

present in drinking water. A study of human milk in Kariba showed that there were

significant amounts of PCBs, DDT and its derivatives (Chikuni et al. 1997). The effects of

this in bats’ milk were shown to result in deaths of the suckling puppies. We do not know yet

what the effect in humans is as symptoms of DDT poisoning are similar to malaria

symptoms.



One of the effects of global warming is a fundamental change in phytoplankton communities.

At temperature above 28oC, cyanobacteria, also known as blue green algae dominate the

aquatic phytoplankton. These produce microcystins which are known to be carcinogenic.

However for these to proliferate they need water rich with phosphorus, which is the case with

Lake Chivero and other eutrophic waters in Zimbabwe. A recent study seems to suggest that


9|Page
the frequency of liver cancer in Harare has been on the increase (Ndebele and Magadza,

2006).




Ground water

Ground water is also of special concern. As our surface waters become increasingly scarce,

large population of Zimbabwe are resorting to ground water. In Chitungwiza, Epworth and

other informal settlements residents depend on shallow wells. Many of these have been

shown to be infested with enteric bacteria, and have been implicated in cholera outbreaks.

The special issue is that while pollution of surface waters can be remedied in reasonable time

than ground water is contaminated it can take decades and sometimes centuries for the

pollutants to disappear. Thus ground water contamination is a persistent problem. Here

prevention is indeed better than cure.



The second issue about groundwater is that its replenishment is a function of catchment

health. For instance, in degraded watersheds where wetlands have been impaired, the fraction

of precipitation that becomes surface runoff increases dramatically. This reduces aquifer

recharge resulting in drying up of boreholes and shallow wells.



2.2 Surface water resources

Surface water comprising rivers, dams, lakes, springs, and wetlands is by far the most widely

used source of water in Zimbabwe. The distribution of rainfall ranges from about 300 mm/yr

in the southern parts of the country to about 1,200 mm/yr in the Eastern highlands. The

quality of water in the Eastern highlands is considered good and is classified as “pristine”

under the Environmental Management Agency river classification scheme. For example, the

City of Mutare is currently abstracting water from the perennial Pungwe River, which

10 | P a g e
requires minimum purification and therefore treatment costs are very low. Relatively clean

water is found in most rivers in the eastern highlands, and this may be attributed in part to the

fact that they originate from protected national parks (e.g., Rhodes Nyanga National Park,

and Chimanimani National Park) under temperate montane forests, both natural and exotic.

The streams and dams in the drier parts of the country are more ephemeral and are more

vulnerable to siltation and sedimentation. However the water in the Eastern highlands may be

cleaner because of high runoff available compared to the drier parts of the country but source

protection clearly plays a role.



2.2.1 General factors affecting surface water quality in Zimbabwe



2.2.1.1 Sewage discharges

The most contaminated rivers in the country tend to be those draining catchments with major

urban settlements (see Figure 2 showing the location and distribution of urban centres in

relation to major catchments). All major catchments in Zimbabwe have urban centres with

sewage output ranging from tens of megalitres to hundreds of megalitres per day, most of

which finds its way into surface water. Due to frequent sewer outbursts as well as direct

discharge of raw or partially treated sewage into public waterways draining urban areas,

urban water quality is generally poor. For example, due to sewage discharges, nitrogen (N)

levels averaging 13.5 mg/ℓ and phosphorus (P) levels averaging 2.6 mg/ℓ have been

measured in the Marimba River which drains into Lake Chivero (Nhapi and Tirivarombo

2004). This concentration level of P far exceeds the statutory limits for sewage discharge into

public waterways, which is 0.1 mg/ℓ for phosphorus. The presence of cyanotoxins in Harare’s

treated drinking water reported in literature can also be attributed to the discharge of raw or

partially treated sewage (Mhlanga et al. 2006; Ndebele and Magadza 2006). Little is


11 | P a g e
understood about the impact of sewage discharge in other urban centres hence this needs

further investigation.

2.2.1.2 Mining

Zimbabwe is a mineral rich country with over 40 minerals that can be developed

economically. The country has approximately 200 registered ‘formal’ medium-scale gold

mines and thousands of small-scale unregistered gold operations, most of which use mercury

(Hg) for the processing of primary gold quartz veins and supergene gold mineralizations. The

techniques that are used are inefficient, hence, gold mines, especially artisanal gold mines,

are major point and non point sources of Hg and other heavy metals such as arsenic (As) and

lead (Pb). Zimbabwe's gold mining activities range from very low technology gold panning

(on the major internal rivers) to sophisticated carbon-in-pulp extraction technology practised

at an increasing number of larger and smaller mining and tailings dump re-treatment


12 | P a g e
operations. The economic crisis in Zimbabwe saw the closure of most of the big mines that

use sophisticated extraction technology and the sprouting of more small-scale and artisanal

mining activities. Small scale mining has been practiced since time immemorial by the early

Shona and their contemporaries although shallow by contemporary standards, the old

workings developed into considerable undertakings, with open stopes (narrow deep trenches)

and shafts (Summers, 1969; Swan, 1994). Small-scale mining is commonly associated with

informal, unregulated, under-capitalized and under-equipped mining operations, where

technical and management skills are lacking.



A study carried out at Shamva gold mine showed that as much as 20 - 30% of Hg is lost to

tailings, soils, stream sediments and water (van Straaten 2000). In another study, results from

chemical analysis of water samples collected from tributaries of Manyame river located

downstream from four abandoned gold mines in the Beatrice gold belt also indicated the

presence of heavy metals (i.e., Pb, Zn and Ni) in surface water (Ravengai et al. 2005b).

Figure 3 shows that most gold mines and mills are located in the Sanyati and Mzingwane

catchments, while Save and Manyame catchments had the least. With respect to mining, the

Eastern highlands of Zimbabwe have previously been viewed as free of water pollution.

However alluvial gold mining in Penhalonga and gold panning in Chimanimani now pose a

threat to water quality. Information on the impact of artisanal gold mining in other areas on

water quality is lacking. For example, the Global Mercury Project (GMP) identified Kadoma-

Chakari region as having the highest population of artisanal and small-scale miners in

Zimbabwe (~ 20,000) and documented the widespread use of mercury during gold

processing, but its impact on water quality was not quantified. The mechanisms through

which mercury may impact aquatic ecosystems and human health were however described.




13 | P a g e
The extraction of other minerals also poses a direct threat to both surface and groundwater

quality. Work done at Trojan Nickel Mine (near Bindura) reported high concentrations of

sulphide (over 100 mg/l) as well as high levels of Pb (> 1.0 mg/l) and nickel (Ni) from the

rock dump (Lupankwa et al. 2006). Water samples taken from Pote River located

downstream from the mine dump had elevated levels of Pb, As and Ni which rendered the

water unfit for domestic use. The deterioration in the quality of surface water has also been

observed at Iron Duke Mine in the Mazowe catachment. Upstream of the mine premises,

water in the Yellow Jacket River was not contaminated yet downstream it was contaminated

with iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and sulfate ions

(SO42-) (Ravengai et al. 2005a). Acid mine drainage seeping from tailing dams is degrading

water quality of the Yellow Jacket and Mazowe Rivers. At Madziva mine, also located in the

Mazowe catchment, acidic effluent with high concentrations of iron, nickel and sulphate

emanating from the tailings dam was detected in both surface and groundwater (Lupankwa et

al. 2004).

2.2.1.3 Industrial effluent

The treatment and disposal of industrial effluent is also a major factor contributing to the

deterioration of surface water quality in the country. While most industries are connected to

sewerage reticulation, several industries discharge directly into public waters. For example,

due to the discharge of industrial effluent, high concentrations of heavy metals were detected

in sediment and water samples from the Mukuvisi River downstream to Prospect Industrial

Area in Harare (Nyamangara et al. 2008). Heavy metal pollution has been linked to industrial

effluent discharge and, in urban centres such as Harare; it has been linked to the deterioration

in potable water quality (Zaranyika et al. 1997). Thousands of backyard industries have

mushroomed in urban centres, but their contribution to water source pollution is largely

unaccounted for. Backyard industries in places such as Mbare have been identified as

polluters of the Mukuvisi River, disposing of pollutants such as oils. They also have great

potential as diffuse polluters when there is runoff.



2.2.1.4 Agriculture

Zimbabwe’s commercial agriculture, especially sugar production and tobacco farming,

depends on high inputs of fertilizers and pesticides. The widespread use of fertilizers and

agrochemicals makes agricultural runoff a major source of diffuse pollution (Moyo and

Mafara, 1997). For example, the lower reaches of the Sanyati River had high levels of

nitrogen, while small rivers like Nyaodza also contributed to phosphorus loading in Lake

Kariba (Begg, 1970). The lack of up-to-date information makes it difficult to infer the impact

of agriculture on water quality and pinpoint pollution hotspots. In communal lands where

subsistence farming is predominant, the use of pesticides and fertilizers is not as extensive as

in commercial farming but overgrazing and vegetation clearing are common degradative

practices. Such practices increase rates of wetland loss, soil erosion and consequently


15 | P a g e
promote the siltation of rivers. Apart from rivers in the Eastern highlands draining into

Mozambique, all other major rivers in Zimbabwe are silted to varying degrees, especially in

their lower reaches. While this impacts on surface water availability it also has a profound

impact on the biodiversity of aquatic fauna due to habitat loss.




2.2.1.5 Aquatic invasive weeds
The presence of aquatic invasive weeds is a manifestation of eutrophication. For example, the

invasive weed Salvinia molesta (Kariba weed), which has infested in Lake Kariba, declined

after nutrient levels dropped. Due to nutrient pollution, Khami dam, Lake Chivero and Lake

Mutirikwi have both been infested by water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes).



2.2.2 Knowledge gaps on surface water quality

In general, there is no comprehensive study giving a national picture of the status of surface

water quality in Zimbabwe since all previous studies have focused on few selected rivers,

reservoirs, mines and industries. Data on water quality are available from a number of studies

that evaluated the quality of surface water in Zimbabwe and most previous studies

concentrated on perennial rivers and large reservoirs supplying water to major settlements.

As a result, little is known about the threats to and the quality of surface water from wetlands,

springs, small rivers, and small reservoirs, which are mainly located in the headwaters of

most perennial rivers and large reservoirs e.g., Connemara Dam in Nyanga. In addition,

current information is lacking on ambient water quality conditions of many surface water

sources.




16 | P a g e
2.3 Groundwater resources

In Zimbabwe, groundwater may be categorized into: (i) shallow unconfined aquifers

developed in the weathered surface layers (the regolith) in crystalline rock areas and

associated with high water tables; and (ii) deeper unconfined to confined aquifers associated

with sedimentary strata. The majority of people, especially in rural areas, obtain water from

the first category where water is accessed from depths up to 20 m. The vulnerability of such

shallow groundwater to contamination by unsafe sanitation activities is high. The second

category of deeper sedimentary aquifers may be better protected from microbiological

contamination, but is frequently more highly mineralized due to its greater age and less

frequent flushing. Pumping costs for the deeper groundwater will be higher than for the

shallow aquifers and motorized pumps may be required.



Zimbabwe has 10 hydrogeological units as identified in the National Master Plan for Rural

Water Supply and Sanitation. These hydrogeological units comprise both primary granular

aquifers and secondary fractured aquifers and constitute the basis of the rural water supply

system throughout Zimbabwe. However, their overall exploitation is still low.



2.3.1 General factors affecting groundwater quality in Zimbabwe

The quality of groundwater has become an increasingly important global water resources

issue for two principal reasons. The first is that groundwater constitutes by far the greatest

fresh water resource on the planet, although surface water is still the preferred source in most

humid climates. The second reason is that while surface water has a shorter detention time

due to flushing by fresh inflows in a matter of a few months to years, groundwater tends to

have much longer detention times sometimes up to a thousand years. Contaminated

groundwater therefore tends to remain in the aquifer for decades or hundreds of decades, and


17 | P a g e
does not respond readily to clean-up efforts. Entire aquifers may be rendered unfit for use for

generations once contaminated. As water availability per capita declines, the threat to

groundwater quality, our largest freshwater resource, stands out as one of the major

environmental challenges of our time.



The natural groundwater quality in Zimbabwe is generally good, especially in the granitic

terrain (± 60% of the country), where the quality is considered excellent. There are natural

localized areas with poor groundwater quality. These areas are associated with poor

groundwater circulation in confined aquifers, poor recharge in arid areas and hyper-saline

paleo-groundwater.



Geogenic sources of groundwater pollution

On a national scale geogenic groundwater quality issues are minor and localized, and it is

generally considered that Zimbabwe has no major geogenic groundwater quality issues. The

geogenic groundwater quality problems that do exist tend to occur in sedimentary basins in

specific localities that are distant from the recharge areas and are thereby associated with

poor groundwater circulation. In the confined parts of the lower Karoo, groundwater flow

paths tend to be several tens to hundreds of kilometres, and groundwater residence times may

exceed several hundreds of thousands of years. Due to these long flow paths and extended

residence times, the groundwater in these aquifers tends to be quite highly mineralized.



By contrast, the groundwater in the crystalline basement areas of Zimbabwe are shallow,

locally recharged and have short residence times. As a result they tend to be fresh good

quality water. The Karoo basin is known to have naturally occurring fluoride in the

groundwater from boreholes drilled in the Madumabisa mudstones and lower Karoo


18 | P a g e
sandstone units. Gokwe north, Hwange, Beit Bridge and Save Valley are all areas where

geogenic groundwater fluoride has been observed in the groundwater (Norad Map of

Groundwater Flouride in Zimbabwe).



Saline groundwater (TDS > 2000 mg/l) is rare in Zimbabwe but such TDS values have been

measured in boreholes in the arid Beit Bridge district and in the cretaceous sediments along

Zimbabwe’s SE border with Mozambique. Some saline groundwater has also been recorded

along the Zambezi valley, presumably associated with deep groundwater in the escarpment

fault zone and in the deep Kalahari in NW Zimbabwe, likely related to the evaporite

sequences in the Kalahari beds. Highly saline groundwater has been observed in the Save

valley and is filled with sediments in some parts of the valley. Similarly elevated salinity also

occurs in the Karoo basins in Zimbabwe, especially in the confined parts of the aquifers

where there is no active recharge. If associated with coal measures, these will produce an

unpalatable sulphurous taste in the groundwater (NORAD Map of Groundwater TDS in

Zimbabwe). All other groundwater quality issues in Zimbabwe are of an anthropogenic

origin.



Anthropogenic sources of groundwater pollution

Groundwater quality may be affected by direct recharge of polluted water generated by a

suite of point and non-point sources of pollution. In addition, groundwater may be polluted

by river-bed infiltration of polluted river water at some distance from the primary pollution

source.




19 | P a g e
Groundwater pollution does not yet appear to be a major issue in Zimbabwe. Complaints and

publicity about groundwater quality hardly feature in our news media and are a minor

component in our scientific literature.



Nevertheless, many of the anthropogenic activities that generate groundwater pollution are

occurring without adequate safeguards. For example, municipal solid waste dumps are all

constructed without an impermeable base and without leachate collection and treatment

facilities. Sewage treatment plants discharge wastewater to ‘sewage farms’ for use as

fertilizer without assessment or monitoring of subsequent wastewater discharge to local

groundwater. All mining activities in Zimbabwe are now subject to EMA effluent discharge

regulations, but many thousands of historic mining waste dumps and tailings dams are

generating acid mine drainage (Moreno-Madrinan et al. 2010) and releasing toxic heavy

metal enriched acid water to the environment. Industry is in a similar position and old

abandoned dumps are still sources of toxic leachate to the groundwater system. Many of the

human communities in the urban high-density suburbs also impact on the groundwater

system via pit latrines and uncollected domestic waste.



2.3.1.1 Mining

A major source of groundwater anthropogenic pollution is mining and mine waste disposal

sites. There are over 8000 mines of various sizes scattered across Zimbabwe, mostly gold

mines in the greenstone/gold belt terrain, but also chrome and platinum mines along the Great

Dyke and coal mines in the lower Karoo coal measures.



Most of these mines have open shafts, waste rock dumps and tailings dams with exposed

sulphide minerals, making them susceptible to acid mine drainage. Air and circulating fresh


20 | P a g e
water react with the exposed sulphides to form sulphuric acid, subsequently dissolving

susceptible heavy metals, which are then in solution and mobilized to enter the surface and

groundwater systems. The finely ground rock material in the tailings dams presents by far the

largest surface area of exposed sulphide minerals and therefore these generate the largest acid

mine drainage (Moreno-Madrinan et al. 2010) pollution load.



It is anticipated that the sulphide load in the tailings dams constitutes an AMD threat that will

persist for several generations. Mines therefore constitute a very widespread suite of point

pollution threats to groundwater in terms of heavy metal contamination, both now and into

the future.



2.3.1.2 Sewage

Domestic sewage in the urban areas is generally managed by water borne sewage networks,

with septic tanks in the low-density residential areas. Pit latrines are the principal form of

domestic waste management in the rural areas. Sewage farms are often overburdened due to

expansion of the urban population and lack of investment in new infrastructure. For example,

Firle sewage treatment plant in Harare is under-designed for the number of people that use

the sewage network and as a result it discharges large volumes of partially treated and

untreated domestic waste into both the surface water and the groundwater drainage. This

makes it a hotspot of groundwater pollution.



The impact of sewage outbursts on groundwater quality in the high-density suburbs in both

Harare and Bulawayo is a cause for concern particularly in light of the frequent outbreaks of

diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Due to the decline in water supplies, water both for

consumption and for flushing the waste system has declined. As a result, sewers become


21 | P a g e
blocked and burst, leaking effluent into the ground and thus contaminating groundwater. At

the same time, treated water supply has declined and residents have to rely on groundwater

from shallow hand dug wells and from drilled boreholes. In recent years there have been

outbreaks of cholera and typhoid in Harare and these have been linked to deteriorating water

quality and limited supply. In Bulawayo, total coliforms and faecal coliforms which pose a

threat to human health were found in 27% and 8% respectively of the sampling sites (n = 32)

drawn from the Matsheumhlope basement aquifer (Mangore and Taigbenu 2004).



In informal high-density suburbs, sanitation is generally by means of pit latrines, and the

impact on the groundwater is even greater. Work done in the semi-formal settlement of

Epworth (near Harare) reported significantly elevated levels of coliform bacteria in

groundwater samples collected from shallow wells and boreholes scattered throughout the

settlement. The highest levels of coliforms (> 10,000 cfu) were measured in water samples

from the old parts of the settlement with a high density of pit latrines (Zingoni et al. 2005). It

was therefore concluded that most parts of Epworth lack safe groundwater for human

consumption. This finding suggests that pit latrines impact both surface and groundwater

quality.



2.3.1.3 Solid waste dumps

All urban settlements in Zimbabwe use solid waste dumps to dispose of the waste. Many of

these solid waste dumps are poorly constructed and poorly managed without impermeable

linings and leachate collection as well as treatment facilities. Waste is generally not separated

into waste streams with domestic, industrial and chemical wastes all being disposed in the

same dump. As a result, a mixed toxic leachate is generated and discharged into the




22 | P a g e
groundwater system, and this may further discharge as baseflow to the stream system. Golden

Quarry and Teviotdale / Pomona dumpsites in Harare are two examples of such facilities.



The capacity to measure persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PCB’s (Poly-

Chlorinated Biphenyls) from solid waste dumps is very limited in Zimbabwe hence such

pollutants may already be in the aquifers but remain undetected.



2.3.1.4 Pit latrines

Pit latrines and septic tanks constitute tens of thousands of minor point sources of local

bacterial contamination of the shallow groundwater table. Although groundwater is protected

by natural filtration against bacteria of faecal origin if proper controls are in place, there is

evidence that faecal coliforms from pit latrines are contaminating the shallow groundwater in

some parts of the country. This may occur when pit latrines are located too close to water

supply wells or boreholes. Although less common, the ground formation may fail to attenuate

the bacterial load if flow is fracture flow rather than seepage flow. This process results in

bacterial contamination of underground water.



Some data exists on the impact of pit latrines on groundwater quality for Epworth informal

high-density suburb in eastern Harare (Zingoni et al. 2005), and there is also a report on the

impact of pit latrines on groundwater quality from Chihota communal lands (Dzwairo et al.

2006). Faecal coliforms were also detected in groundwater from some drinking water wells

located in sandy soils and on deeply weathered and fractured igneous rocks in the Goromonzi

district (Conboy and Goss 2000).




23 | P a g e
2.3.1.5 Industry

Industry generates effluent and other toxic waste and in many cases such waste is not

properly treated. Older factories established before adoption of cleaner technologies in

production processes were in the habit of discarding industrial waste into unlined pits and

effluent back into the stream system. Such practices have declined with increased

environmental understanding and improved legislation and management practices, but the

threat to groundwater for these practices still resides in the sub-surface. Chemical industries,

such as Chemplex and ZimPhos in Harare, leather tanneries in Harare and Bulawayo, and

industries that use large volumes of water and discharge bulk effluent back into the drains,

such as the dairy industry, all contribute to groundwater quality degradation.



2.3.1.6 Land degradation and reduced recharge

Decline in groundwater quality may also occur as a result of land degradation. Removal of

vegetation cover and erosion of topsoil results in increased run-off coefficients and a

concomitant decrease in groundwater recharge. This decrease in recharge creates a threat to

groundwater quality in that there is less fresh water entering the aquifer. As a result the

remaining groundwater is older and becomes relatively more saline with time. Thus

protecting and restoring recharge and retention rates is an important component in protecting

the groundwater quality and has been identified as a key strategy in protecting our

groundwater resources.



A similar reduction in recharge occurs when urban development takes place, covering the

land surface with concrete, tar and other impermeable surfaces. Such developments reduce

the area of recharge and the recharge rate. For this reason the development of urban wetlands




24 | P a g e
for housing, infrastructure or commerce should be discouraged and only take place with

extreme caution and a proper appreciation of the long-term impacts on groundwater quality.



2.3.1.7 Excessive pumping

A further potential threat to groundwater quality arises from excessive pumping that result in

unsustainable drawdown in the water levels. Under such conditions, older and less fresh

groundwater can be mobilized from the deeper parts of the aquifer, mixing with the fresher

better quality groundwater and thereby reduces the overall groundwater quality. With the

reduction of fresh water distribution by municipalities, many private individuals and

companies have turned to boreholes to supply their water needs. This increased abstraction

together with declining recharge due to climate change suggests that the groundwater

resources may become steadily drawn down over time, with an attendant reduction in the

quality. If the annual chloride deposition in rainfall and as dry deposition is known, then the

chloride content in groundwater can be used to estimate the long term average annual

recharge as a percentage of rainfall. Recent groundwater samples from boreholes at the

University of Zimbabwe suggest that only 2 % of rainfall becomes recharge. This is

equivalent to a recharge rate of 1 litre/second per km2. Although pumping rates for Harare

groundwater are not known, estimates suggest that abstraction rates in the range of between

10 to 15 litres/second is likely. Anecdotal evidence from Harare indicates that the water-table

has already declined significantly in many areas.



2.3.2 Knowledge gaps on groundwater quality

A further issue with regards to groundwater quality management in Zimbabwe is that there is

very limited data available. Work on groundwater quality has been limited to a few scattered

studies. For example, Mabvira (2003) and Ashton et al. (2001) produced general overviews


25 | P a g e
on the impact of mining on water quality in Zimbabwe. Meck et al. (2009 and 2010),

Ravengai et al. (2001), Ruzive (2000), Musiwa et al.(2004) and Ngwenya (1997) have

assessed the impacts of mining on water quality, but none of these studies specifically

focused on groundwater quality. In addition, Ravengai et al. (2004 and 2005) presented data

on the impact of industrial effluent on groundwater from a single site in Harare. Love et al.

(2006) and Zingoni et al. (2006) reported on the impact of diffuse pollution on groundwater

from several localities around Harare. The ZINWA groundwater branch hosts a national

groundwater database. This database has entry fields for groundwater quality data for each

borehole, but for the most part, these fields are not populated. Where the fields are populated,

the data are usually for a single instance in time and there are almost no time series data to

show changes to groundwater quality. There are no data on persistent organic pollutants in

groundwater and the laboratory capacity to measure such components is not available in

Zimbabwe.



During the course of this study, a basic groundwater vulnerability map was produced, but it

has not been tested against actual data. There are no contaminant load maps identifying point

and diffuse sources of potential groundwater contamination, such as mines, solid waste

dumps, industrial developments and agrochemical farming. There are no groundwater hazard

maps that combine the groundwater vulnerability with the location of sources of pollution

and the risk to human, livestock and commerce. The development and production of such

maps will be an important step towards managing groundwater quality in Zimbabwe.

Geogenic groundwater quality maps are available for fluoride and TDS (MWRED-Norad

1985), but only have few data points.




26 | P a g e
There is a need to know more about the groundwater quality especially in areas where

groundwater is heavily used, and in areas where it is a strategic resource. This is particularly

true of the major urban centres, especially where the surface water sources and the treatment

and distribution infrastructure are insufficient to meet demand. In these areas, groundwater is

widely used for domestic water supply and the quality of the groundwater is vital. It is

important to understand the impact of major point sources, such as solid waste dumps and

mines, on the groundwater quality, as well as the extent and distribution of pollution

associated with such point sources. The persistence and attenuation of pollutants in the

groundwater system needs to be known. Similarly, understanding the impact of agriculture

and the application of fertilizers and agrochemicals on groundwater quality is required.

Finally, it is important that the vulnerability of groundwater in Zimbabwe is assessed,

particularly in relation to sensitive areas, such as the cities.

Chapter 3: Methods



3.1 Review of published literature and government reports

Zimbabwe’s surface and groundwater resources are critical for national economic

development yet there is inadequate information about their quality, extent and condition

with respect to pollution threats. However, some information can be gleaned from both

published and unpublished literature such as government reports. To produce this report more

than 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles were consulted to ensure that the proposed methods

for rapid assessment of water quality and quantity are consistent with international best

practices. All the articles consulted are available in digital format and can be provided upon

request. The two main reasons for consulting peer-reviewed scientific literature were to: (i)

identify key knowledge gaps, and (ii) select algorithms relevant for rapid assessment of water

quality and quantity. The net benefit of this exercise is that the results reported here are

comparable to those reported elsewhere.



While the scientific literature provided the basis for the methods used for rapid assessment of

water quality and quantity, technical reports such as the 2009 report entitled “An assessment

of surface water resources of Zimbabwe and guidelines for planning” published by the

Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management were used to evaluate whether

satellite-derived estimates of water quality and quantity are consistent with previous ground-

based observations. Other government reports and policy documents such as The National

Water Policy pertinent to Phase 1 were sourced from relevant government ministries and

departments including the Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management

(MWRDM), the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), Ministry of Environment




28 | P a g e
and Natural Resources Management (MENRM), the Environmental Management Agency

(EMA), and Catchment Councils.



In addition to relying on government reports, interviews with key ZINWA and EMA staff

were conducted to assist the team of consultants develop a list of pollution hotspots. From

this list, a sample of hotspots representing a wide range of point and diffuse pollution threats

in different catchments was produced to guide field measurements of water quality.



3.2 Methods for rapid mapping and classification of water sources

Zimbabwe’ surface water sources can be classified into (1) surface streams and rivers (2) and

surface   water   bodies   comprising    numerous     impoundments/dams.       These   artificial

impoundments consisting of small and medium dams with an ‘annual yield’ as well as large

dams with a carry-over storage capacity have been established as part of the country’s overall

water development strategy (Ministry of Water Resources and Development 1984). The

methods that permit rapid assessment of these surface water bodies differ.



3.2.1 Methods for rapid mapping and quantification of rivers and streams

A 90-m NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data (SRTM) digital elevation model

(DEM) was used to delineate watershed boundaries, extract river topology, and stream

networks using standard DEM hydro-processing algorithms in an open source GIS. Next,

Strahler’s stream order was calculated to further classify the streams and rivers by order.

3.2.2 Use of satellite remote sensing for rapid mapping of surface water bodies

Recent developments in remote sensing technology make it possible to map surface water

and monitor the dynamics of surface water throughout the year. In this study, the recently

developed Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) (Ji et al. 2009) was

applied on Landsat 8 imagery over Zimbabwe between 19 April 2013 and 30 May 2013 to

map surface water bodies in catchments covered by the Landsat scene. The MNDWI is

calculated as follows:



MNDWI = ρG - ρSWIR/ ρG + ρSWIR



Where: ρG is reflectance in the green band of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., Band 2 of

Landsat 8) while ρSWIR is the reflectance in the short wave infrared region of the

electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., Landsat 8 Band 6). This spectral index is based on the

fundamental idea that water absorbs energy at near-infrared (Munir,1996) and shortwave-

infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. Hence, MNDWI values greater than 0 indicate water while

MNDWI values below 0 indicate non-water features. In this study, Landsat 8 data were

freely downloaded from http://glovis.usgs.gov/ and were converted to top of atmosphere

reflectance.



3.2.3 Rapid assessment of catchment condition and source degradation

Water source degradation or catchment / water source condition was estimated using a

remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) which is an estimate of

green vegetation density over Zimbabwe between 19 April 2013 and 30 May 2013. The

reasoning behind use of this simple satellite-based index is that holding other factors




30 | P a g e
constant, the better protected the catchment the higher the vegetation cover and the higher is

its mean NDVI value. NDVI is estimated as follows:



ρNIR - ρR/ ρNIR + ρR



Where: ρNIR is reflectance in the near infrared band of the electromagnetic spectrum

(Landsat 8 Band 5) while ρR is the reflectance in the red region (Landsat 8 Band 4) of the

electromagnetic spectrum. NDVI values below 0 indicate water while NDVI values above

zero indicate different land surfaces from bare ground (0-0.1) to dense green vegetation (0.5-

1). Using GIS overlay, we calculated the mean NDVI in each of the hotspot watershed

sampled using zonal statistics operation. Next, we used the regression to relate TSS estimated

for each hotspot watershed with remotely sensed mean NDVI. The objective was to test the

whether water source condition or watershed condition estimated using NDVI can

significantly be used to predict TSS in watersheds.



To relate catchment condition and source degradation, a total of 89 sites distributed in all the

seven catchments were sampled as shown in Figure 4. Data on key water quality parameters

such as chlorophyll-a, turbidity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended solids were

regressed against the mean NDVI estimated from the watershed delineated using the sample

site as the pour point in an open source GIS. To determine the critical value of mean

vegetation index, the regression equations derived were set to zero and solved for x where x

is the mean NDVI of a watershed.

3.2.4 Rapid assessment of water quality of reservoirs



3.2.4.1 In-situ measurements of water quality parameters



The utility of satellite remote sensing for conducting rapid assessment of water quality was

tested in Lake Chivero and Mazvikadei dam (Figure 5). As of June 2013, Lake Chivero was

~24 km2 in area while Mazvikadei dam was ~21 km2 in area. The maximum depth in Chivero

has been estimated at 22 m while that for Mazvikadei is similar (26 m). These comparisons

suggest that the two reservoirs have similar limnological characteristics. However, they

greatly differ in terms of the degree of watershed protection, pollution threats and trophic

state. Previous research has established that while Lake Chivero is a hyper-eutrophic lake

dominated by cyanobacteria with a virtual absence of zooplankton, Mazvikadei has a healthy

green algae and a thriving population of zooplankton. In addition, the catchment of

Mazvikadei is relatively well-protected although of late it is under threat from artisanal

chrome mining and commercial agriculture while Chivero’s catchment is not well-protected.

The main reason for selecting these reservoirs was to test the utility of satellite remote

sensing for rapid assessment of water quality in other reservoirs. The logic adopted is if

satellite remote sensing can yield results that agree with ground observations in these two

lakes with different trophic states it will likely work for rapid assessment of water quality in

other Zimbabwean reservoirs. It was not necessary to sample all the reservoirs in all the

catchments, but the rapid method to be developed was supposed to be easily adaptable to any

reservoir.



Chlorophyll-a concentrations, Secchi disk depth and turbidity which are directly linked to

trophic state and are amenable to measurement by satellite remote sensing hence they are


33 | P a g e
widely used to monitor water quality (Lanthrop 1992; Kloiber et al. 2002; Olmanson et al.,

2008). In the present study these three water parameters which can be sensed from satellite

platforms (Sass et al. 2007) were used to characterise the water quality of two reservoirs

located in Manyame catchment.



Field data on chlorophyll-a concentrations, Secchi disk depth, turbidity and other water

quality parameters such as total coliforms were collected under clear blue skies from 80

sample stations within 7 days of satellite overpass in Chivero and Mazvikadei. Half of the

sample stations were in Chivero (~24 km2 in area) and the other half were in Mazvikadei dam

(~21 km2 in area). Sample stations were chosen randomly in a geographic information

system.




Figure 5: Map of lakes Chivero and Mazvikadei showing their location in Manyame

catchment (black solid line) of Zimbabwe and the position of sample stations (solid circles).




34 | P a g e
The geographic coordinates of each sample station were transferred to a hand-held global

positioning system (Garmin GPSmap 60CSx), which was used to navigate to sample stations

in the lake. At each sample station, a water sample of ~1lin volume was collected from the

uppermost water layer (top 40 cm). Water samples were stored in a cooler box and returned

to the laboratory for analysis of chlorophyll-a, turbidity, total dissolved solids and other

variables.     Chlorophyll-a   concentrations    (µg/l)   in   surface     water   were   measured

spectrophotometrically in the laboratory after exposure to acetone using on samples filtered

through 0.7 µm GF/F glass fibre filters (Tilzer 1988; Strickland and Parsons 1975). Turbidity

was measured on unfiltered water samples using a standard nephelometer and results were

expressed in nephelometric turbidity units (Brezonik et al. 2005). Secchi disk depth was

measured on-site using a 20-cm diameter, black and white quadrated disk (Lanthrop 1992).

Other variables such as pH, salinity and temperature were also measured at each sample

station using standard calibrated portable water quality instruments.



3.2.4.2 Satellite image processing

Landsat 8 imagery (path 170 and row 72) covering the two reservoirs acquired on 6 and 22

June   2013      were   downloaded     from     the   freely   available    Landsat   archives   at

http:glovis.usgs.gov. The images, which had less than 5% cloud cover, were registered to the

Universal Transverse Mercator zone 36 south projection using the WGS84 as the global

datum. A minimum of 15 ground control points were used during image registration. The

nearest neighbour resampling method was used for image registration and a root mean square

error less than 0.2 pixels (~ 6 m for Landsat 8 data) was obtained.




35 | P a g e
The uncalibrated digital numbers were converted to radiance and from this to a dimensionless

top-of-atmosphere (ρTOA) as:



               ρTOA = πLλd2 / ESUNλCosθs



where Lλ is the spectral radiance at the sensor, d is the Earth-sun distance in astronomical

units, ESUNλ is the mean solar exoatmospheric irradiance for each band and Cosθs is the solar

zenith angle in degrees (Irish 1998). Sensor calibration information such as solar zenith angle

and Earth-sun distance were extracted from the header file of the imagery (Tebbs et al.,

2013). Next, the images were converted to reflectance based on the equation provided by the

United States Geological Survey (www.usgs.gov).



Three Landsat 8 bands in the visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, that is, band 2

(blue), band 3 (green), band 4 (red) and band 5 (near-infrared) were extracted from each

image. Following Lillesand et al., (1983) and Sass (2007) at each sample station, the average

reflectance value for a 3 x 3 window centred on these pixels was calculated to generate a

satellite-based “sample” that corresponded with a ground-based sample. This spatial window

was used to reduce the effect of scatter and account for locational errors that could have

arisen due to boat drift. However, since previous research has shown that using reflectance

values of pixels in the deep open area of a lake yields best calibration results (Kloiber et al.,

2002), only average reflectance values for sample stations located at the lake centre were

used in the calibration step to avoid spectral interference from the shoreline, aquatic

vegetation and the lake bottom (McCullough et al. 2012). In the absence of bathymetric data,

the lake centre was assumed to be the deepest part of the lake and hence sample stations

located at the centre were considered typical of the open water. ENVI 4.6 software package


36 | P a g e
(ITT Visual Information Solutions, United States of America) was used for all image

processing.



3.2.4.3 Calibration satellite data ground-based measurements

Landsat images were calibrated with ground-based measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi

depth and turbidity made within 7 days of satellite overpass at sample stations. To avoid

spectral interference from the shoreline, lake bottoms and aquatic vegetation, only field data

from sample stations placed in the deepest regions of the lakes away from floating aquatic

vegetation were used for statistical analysis. At each of the sample station not excluded from

analysis, the average reflectance values for each Landsat 8 band and band ratios was paired

with ground measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth and turbidity. Then, Pearson

correlation matrices were computed to select bands or commonly used band ratios (such as

band 2/4, band 4/2, and band 5/3) that were the most significantly correlated with each of

chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Following Kloiber et al., 2002, the strongest

correlates were then regressed against chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Least

squares regression analyses were applied to the two datasets using the measured water quality

parameters as the dependent variable and the reflectance recorded in single bands or band

ratios as the independent variables. Regression equations developed were applied to

corresponding bands or band ratios to produce surface maps of water quality parameter using

the Spatial analyst tool in ArcGIS version 10.0 (Environmental Systems Research Inc.,

Redlands, CA, United States).



The coefficient of determination (R2) which should approach unity, the standard error (s.e.)

which should approach zero and the F-value were used to evaluate the significance of the

regression models (Lavery et al. 1992). The three basic assumptions of regression analysis


37 | P a g e
that: (i) regression residuals have constant variance; (ii) residuals are independent and; (iii)

residuals are normally distributed, were tested and logarithm transformations of the response

variables were performed where necessary to improve the distribution of the data and satisfy

the assumptions of Pearson correlation and simple linear regression analysis (Crawley 2007).

Outliers were identified and eliminated with the Bonferroni outlier test as well as case-by-

case inspection of residuals (McCullough et al., 2012). Parsimonious regression models

which are both easy to interpret and apply by other users were preferred. All statistical

analyses were performed using the Hmisc package in R version 3.0.1 software (R

Development Core Team, 2008).



Note, to ensure that the field data used to calibrate satellite were obtained within 7 days of

satellite overpass as recommended in the literature (see Kloiber et al., 2012) for lake Chivero,

satellite data acquired on the 6th of June 2013 were calibrated with field data collected on the

11th of June 2013 while satellite data downloaded on the 22nd of June 2013 were calibrated

with field data collected on the 15th of June for Mazvikadei.



3.2.4 GIS-based expert system for rapid assessment of groundwater vulnerability

A GIS-based expert system was used to generate the groundwater vulnerability map. This

map is based on an expert assessment of a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors that

contribute to the vulnerability to pollution of the groundwater system. The factors assessed

are:

       Rainfall

       Geology

       Soil

       Topographic wetness index


38 | P a g e
          Vegetation cover

          Land use



It is considered that these parameters control the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution,

where vulnerability may be defined as the likelihood that groundwater pollution will occur

for a given contaminant load applied at the land surface. There are a number of different tool

to assess groundwater vulnerability, such as DRASTIC. In essence, these tools assess the

likelihood of surface water reaching the aquifer. Some of the critical factors are the degree of

confinement of the groundwater, the permeability of the unsaturated zone and the depth to the

groundwater. This simple approach has been used to generate a Zimbabwe groundwater

vulnerability map, given the data availability and the possibility to apply such data sets at a

national scale.



For each of the individual parameters indicated above, a ranking has been applied between 1

and 0.1, where the maximum ranking (1) indicates that polluted water at the surface is most

likely to reach the groundwater system and the minimum ranking (0.1) indicates that such

water is least likely to reach the groundwater system.



For example, areas with the highest rainfall (> 1000 mm per annum) are ranked 1, and those

with the lowest rainfall (< 400 mm per annum) are ranked 0.1. With regards to soil and

geology, the most permeable materials are ranked higher than the impermeable materials.

Geological formations that support shallow unconfined aquifers are ranked lower than

geologies that give rise to deep confined aquifers. A spread-sheet provided in the appendix

section (Appendix x) gives the details of the variations of rankings within and among the key

factors.


39 | P a g e
These rankings are applied to a suite digital maps that record the parameter variations for

each parameter; for example, each soil type is assigned a ranking value depending on its

assessed impact on groundwater vulnerability. Similarly ranking values are assigned to

different geologies, vegetation classes, land use classifications, topographic settings and

rainfall values.



The digital maps are overlaid and the coinciding ranking scores are added together to

compute the overall vulnerability. Dividing all the scores by the highest value score recorded

normalizes this overall vulnerability score. The output is a vulnerability ranking from 1 to

0.1, with 1 being the most vulnerable to groundwater pollution and 0.1 being the least

vulnerable. The result is presented as a national groundwater vulnerability map.



This vulnerability map may be overlaid with a ‘contaminant load map’ that shows the

contaminant hotspots, and a demographic map, in order to develop a ‘groundwater quality

risk’ map that shows the risk posed to the public by deteriorating groundwater quality. To a

limited degree this has been done here. The major urban areas, the catchment boundaries and

the EMA / ZINWA hotspots are shown on the groundwater vulnerability map. Where urban

centres and hotspots coincide with vulnerable groundwater systems are the principal areas of

concern.



To validate the results of groundwater vulnerability mapping, a total of 22 groundwater

samples were collected and analysed. These came from the Manyame (11), Sanyati (7),

Mazowe (3) and Gwayi (1) catchments. They included: potable groundwater for high density

suburbs (4 samples); Urban Solid Waste Disposal sites (3 samples); Agricultural Impact (4

samples); Mining (3 samples); Industry (3 samples); Over-pumping in Urban areas (2


40 | P a g e
samples); and Geogenic Groundwater issues (3 samples). The location and detailed

description of groundwater sample sites is presented in Appendix C.



Neither ZINWA nor EMA were able to provide any groundwater quality data and the data

from literature is scanty and without any laboratory certification. It was also found that to

collect groundwater samples, permission had to be sought from the owner of the borehole.

This required the location of the owner and made it difficult to just go out and collect

samples.

The results of the groundwater sampling are presented in Appendices D, E and F. The spread-

sheets have been arranged such that the ‘hotspot types’ are grouped together. This makes it

easier to observe if there are specific issues related with specific hotspot types.

4.1 GIS-based estimation of hydrological catchment characteristics

Figure 6 shows that the entire drainage networks and stream orders of Mazowe and Runde

catchments derived from a digital elevation model. These results indicate that using standard

hydrological modelling tools in a GIS rapid assessment of surface water can be done. This

eliminates the need of extracting the data on drainage network from analogue maps, which is

time-consuming.

4.2. Quantification and mapping of open water bodies

For Runde catchment, the Modified Normalised Difference Water index was able to detect all

dams contained in the ZINWA database as shown in Fig 7. In addition, by using this satellite-

based index wetlands as well as tailing dams can be detected and mapped. The main

advantage of using this relatively new satellite-based index is that it is a physically-based

index and time-invariant hence it can be used for monitoring the extent of surface water

bodies throughout the year in all catchments.

4.5 Groundwater vulnerability in Zimbabwe

Figure 17 shows groundwater vulnerability throughout Zimbabwe as well as groundwater

samples that provide evidence for microbiological contamination. Most of these samples

(57%) lie in areas with high vulnerability scores. Further, the results suggest that groundwater

is more vulnerable to contamination in catchments with high urban sewerage especially

Manyame and Mazowe. Aquifer vulnerability was predicted to be lowest in Mzingwane

catchment. According to WHO standards no total coliforms should be present in the water if

it is for domestic consumption.

Detailed results are presented in a spread-sheet (Appendix E). The results can be compared to

the WHO drinking water standards at the base of the table. Values that exceed these

guidelines have been highlighted in red if they greatly exceed the guidelines or in yellow if

they are just above the guideline values. At a glance, the results summarised in Appendix F

imply that there are many groundwater quality issues associated with all of these hotspot

types. Many of these water quality issues can have a potentially serious impact on public

health and the environment. However with this small sample number, caution is needed

before any generalizations regarding the impact of various anthropogenic activities on



58 | P a g e
groundwater quality can be made. This table can provide a general guide to the type of

groundwater quality issues that may be anticipated at the different types of hotspots.



In addition, regular groundwater quality monitoring should be instituted at such localities,

particularly where the risk to the public or the environment is high. The availability of timely

water quality data allows the impacts of groundwater pollution to be ameliorated by

appropriate adaptive management actions. Nevertheless it can still be stated that the

groundwater quality at most of the ‘hotspot’ types does exhibit quality problems as indicated

in Appendices E and F.

 Chapter 5: Discussion and TORs for Phase 2


5.1. Discussion

In the introduction we painted a broad picture of the water quality and source degradation

issues in Zimbabwe. However, Phase 1 was not designed to address all of these issues. The

specific mandate of Phase 1 was to develop and test a methodology and carry out a rapid

assessment of water quality using optical remote sensing and GIS calibrated with field data.

In summary results of Phase 1 demonstrated that, using optical remote sensing and GIS, it is

possible to undertake a rapid assessment of both surface and ground water quality in

Zimbabwe at a fraction of the cost of the traditional methods. Phase 1 also demonstrated that

a much smaller budget and infrastructure outlay is it required to accomplish this task. The

results documented in this report are comparable to those in the literature by clearly

demonstrating the utility of satellite remote sensing for rapid assessment of water quality.

However, the methodology we used has two key limitations that may need to be addressed in

the design of Phase 2, which should focus on a long-term monitoring and assessment

framework that is needed for Zimbabwe waters.



First, as a quick first approximation of water quality from satellite remote sensing an

empirical, regression type approach that related field measurements to satellite imagery was

used to create maps of water quality. In other words, we used empirical algorithms to

estimate water quality by statistically modelling relations between combinations of spectral

bands and measured water quality parameters. The advantage of this empirical approach is

that it is easy to implement as it does not require one to understand the underlying physics

such as atmospheric and underwater light processes which influence the spectral properties of

a water column. However, empirical algorithms struggle when the range of water column



60 | P a g e
constituents fall outside of the range upon which the statistical relationship was based or

when applied to other water bodies that may display different fractions of water column

constituents. As such, empirical algorithms like the approach taken here are generally limited

in transferability in space and time, in concentration range, and require ongoing coincident

in-situ data. Inorder to mature, these algorithms need to be further tested with a range of

parameter concentrations



Second, although the relations that we established between water quality variables and

satellite data were based on reflectance data which is dimensionless, these may be Landsat 8

(i.e. sensor) dependent. This may be problematic for the goal of long-term time series where

empirical algorithms would need to be re-parameterized for each new sensor used.



To address these limitations, we propose for Phase 2 physical-based models that use

analytical or semi-analytical solutions of radiative transfer or bio-optical models to estimate

water constituents based on forward optical or inversion models. Forward optical models are

used to predict surface reflectance based on in-situ parameterization while inversion methods

are used to match optical remotely sensed data to the spectra generated. These types of

approaches provide advantages over empirical approaches, including reduced requirements

for in-situ data, and sensor, space and time transferability. Sensitivity and error analysis can

also be objectively determined. It is therefore clear that the much-needed long-term

operational water quality monitoring and assessment systems developed for Zimbabwe rely

on physical-based approaches.



With regard to the main findings, our report suggests that the urban sewerage and the mining

sector are significant contributors to point and diffuse pollution despite the existence of


61 | P a g e
effluent standards and legislation. Although we caution the generality of this finding given

the small dataset used, there are some interesting policy and management implications that

arise from this finding. This warrants future research which should tease apart whether the

negative impact of mining and urban sewerage on water quality is due to the local urban

authorities and the mining sector being compliant to the standards and legislation, or whether

current standards and limitations need to be properly defined for successful control of point

and non-point-source pollution of water.



The potential impact of harmful algal blooms, including cyanobacterial (blue-green algae)

blooms in freshwater systems was not addressed in this report yet blue-green algal bloom is

toxic and is known to pose a substantial health risk for communities accessing affected water

for drinking, irrigation and recreation. The toxins can destroy cells in the liver and other

internal organs, and may act on the nervous system leading to respiratory failure. Other health

impacts can include gastric upsets, fever, headaches, skin irritations, and numbness and

paralysis of the arms and legs. Exposure over time can lead to neurodegenerative diseases

such as motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's-like dementia, and the toxins can be

carcinogenic or tumor promoters. Human deaths have been associated with blue-green algal

blooms, and deaths of livestock and wildlife are common. Therefore in Phase 2, a protocol

for long-term monitoring of cyanobacteria must be developed and implemented.



Zimbabwe’s water quality problems and sources of pollution

Results of this study showed that certain waterbodies have water quality problems, and others

such as Lake Chivero and the Manyame rivers are well documented in the public domain as

highly polluted systems. It is important for this study to identify the broad problems of water




62 | P a g e
quality in terms of point and non-point source pollution as the design of any future

monitoring programme will need to take that into consideration.



Point sources of pollution

The history of point source pollution is largely anchored in urban and industrial communities

where wastewater is produced normally through a reticulated water supply and waste disposal

system (Davis and Hirji, 2003a). Water supply in urban centres improves direct access to

water which is an important benefit but it also creates the problem of having to process and

safely discharge wastewater back into the environment (Davis and Hirji, 2003b). The

planning of urban centres in Zimbabwe is based on a reticulated water supply and wastewater

disposal system, and fully functional and efficient wastewater treatment facilities are

essential. Hence, as observed in this study, urban centres were the primary sources of point

source pollution followed by mining which is really a form of industrialisation outside of

urban centres. Examples include malfunctioning sewage treatment facilities in most urban

centres, sewer bursts, and industrial discharges into sewers and directly into waterbodies

which in most cases are also water sources.



In Phase 2, water quality monitoring must consider issues related to point-source pollution in

Zimbabwe as it has become a serious national issue. It is therefore important to establish

water quality objectives as ambient and effluent quality objectives. EMA has already gazetted

effluent standards (2007) while the municipalities have their own standards for waste and

potable water. EMA uses these guidelines to punish polluters using the “polluter pays

principle” although the sentiments are that a maximum fine of US$5000 is too lenient.

Similarly, municipalities like City of Harare also charge polluters at point sources. However,

polluters are content with paying fines and the effectiveness of such a strategy needs to be


63 | P a g e
reviewed against the costs to the environment. The performance of sewage treatment plants

needs to be assessed, and practical measures such as industrial pre-treatment can significantly

reduce pollution loads in our rivers (Davis and Hirji, 2003b)..



Non-point sources

In this Phase 1 study, it was evident that Zimbabwe has problems with non-point source

pollution which contributes to water quality problems the country is facing. Non-point source

pollution by its nature is very difficult to attribute to an entity and is therefore very difficult to

manage (Davis and Hirji, 2003c). A lot of activities in urban centres and rural areas

contribute to non-point source pollution. The informal business sectors operating largely in

urban centres like Harare include car breakers, oils, factory washes, illegal sand mining all

contribute to effluent. Outside of urban areas, activities such as mining, agriculture and

construction contribute to environmental degradation and hence water pollution. However,

there is very little information on the monitoring of non-point pollution sources in Zimbabwe,

in contrast to point sources often targeted for payment of penalties. Therefore, impacts and

contribution on non-point sources is largely unknown and unquantified.



The future monitoring programme must also assess non-point source pollution but the

exercise can be very expensive as the area involved can be large and a broad range of

parameters may be involved (Davis and Hirji, 2003c). Water quality objectives are somewhat

similar to those of ambient monitoring but they still have to be clearly defined particularly

taking into consideration downstream beneficial uses (Davis and Hirji, 2003c). The first

approach can involve physical and chemical monitoring where parameters such as nutrients,

pesticides, salts, silt and sediment are measured. The second approach can involve biological

monitoring which offers the advantage of detecting impacts especially if exposure to


64 | P a g e
pollutants is chronic. Biological monitoring is also used for monitoring pathogens such as

coliforms, and to also determine if there is acute toxicity normally measured as mortality. A

case in point is the regular fish kills at Lake Chivero due to pollution of the water body.



The current status of Zimbabwe’s water quality monitoring framework

In order to accurately define what needs to be done in Zimbabwe in terms of water quality

monitoring which will lead to strategies for managing problems such as pollution, we need to

understand more the current situation in relation to international best practices. Zimbabwe’s

water quality monitoring and management challenges are typical of most developing

countries and the country needs to move towards modernizing this important aspect (Ongley,

1994, 1997). This process can be informed by studies done in other developing countries

with similar problems such as Mexico (Ongley and Ordonez, 1997). The traditional

paradigms of water quality monitoring programmes have not worked and the country will

have to take a more adaptable approach that brings positive outcomes for its society (Ongley,

1994).



Institutional arrangements

First, it is necessary to highlight the institutional framework in place at the time the study was

carried out. Phase 1 presented an opportunity to get some insight into the water quality

monitoring systems that are currently operational in Zimbabwe, and to interface with the

responsible authorities such as EMA, ZINWA and municipalities. The Environment

Management Agency (EMA) is the statutory body responsible for environmental issues

which also includes monitoring of surface water quality. This function was previously the

responsibility of ZINWA before EMA was duly constituted under the Environment

Management Act. ZINWA had put in place a comprehensive network of flow gauging


65 | P a g e
stations on most rivers around the country, and also incorporated sampling stations for

surface water quality monitoring and groundwater monitoring boreholes. Cooperation among

these institutions and other stakeholders is vital for any water quality monitoring programme

to be successful. Institutions tend to “defend their turfs” but this can prevent useful

collaboration in data collection that in the long run will significantly reduce the costs

involved.



ZINWA was responsible for both groundwater and surface water monitoring up to 2006.

Thereafter, the responsibility for water quality monitoring was handed over to EMA in 2006.

When ZINWA ceded the functions of surface water environment monitoring to EMA, the

transfer of data was not done very well. However, EMA resumed the monitoring from then

on but due to logistical and financial constraints discontinued the countrywide water quality

monitoring and have instead focussed more on strategic areas that require intervention or in

response to pollution incidents. This came out very clearly during attempts to compile

previous data on the water quality monitoring programme. Where it was available, it had

either many gaps or there was not much consistency in the parameters analysed or the

frequency of sampling to really make any useful dataset. In some instances the data was in

different formats as hardcopy or soft copy. The “polluter pays principle” has also hamstrung

EMA as ambient monitoring now just becomes a cost.



When Phase 1 commenced, consultation was made within the Ministry of Water Resources

Development (then custodian of ZINWA) and the Ministry of Environment (then custodian

of EMA). Since September 2013, the two agencies have now been merged into the Ministry

harmonization    between    the   two    institutions,   which is    much    in-line   with   our

recommendations.



Water quality assessment and standards

A key requirement in any water quality monitoring assessments is to have clearly defined

goals/objectives for the programme (Davis and Hirji, 2003a). It was not clear what the

primary objectives of the ZINWA water quality monitoring programme were, but the extent

of the programme suggests that it was a national data collection exercise intended to give

information on water quality, land use impacts, water usage and regulation. Since ZINWA

has the mandate for water management, this database was going to be pivotal for water

resources management in the country. It was not clear what the objectives of EMA were as

the data was not usable, and so the issue of water quality objectives is central to any future

work to be done in Zimbabwe. If that is not in place the motivation to monitor water quality

for objectives other than the “polluter pays principle” is difficult to institute. It must also be

clear what the data will be used for, how it will analysed, what and where it needs to be

collected.



The issue of water quality standards is also important so that there is sufficient and coherent

guidance on the different uses of water. The WHO standards are used extensively in

Zimbabwe along with local standards which include EMA Effluent Standards (2007),

ZINWA standards, Standards Association of Zimbabwe, and municipal standards. The local

standards attempt to address the various possible uses of water from potable to industrial. The

presence of so many standards under different statutory bodies has its problems, and Phase 2

must critically look at the issue of coming up with unified national standards for the major

types of water users. Typically, other functions such as environment, navigation, recreation or


67 | P a g e
agriculture tend not to have any guidelines. Local standards should be simple and must take

into account the limitations in the parameters that can be accurately measured in water quality

monitoring (Davis and Hirji, 2003a).



Water quality monitoring network

As stated earlier, the purposes and objectives of the monitoring programme must be well

defined in order to determine what sort of monitoring programme Zimbabwe requires.

According to the The UN/ECE taskforce on monitoring and assessment, there are four main

purposes for a water quality monitoring programme: basic/reference, effluent control and

regulation, protection of functions and uses, and early-warning monitoring (Davis and Hirji,

2003a). In Phase 2, this must be resolved so that the different institutions involved in water

quality monitoring can cohesively determine the objectives of their sampling programmes to

reduce duplication and data that is not useful. It is now evident that inheriting a monitoring

programme as the case with EMA can actually create more problems if its objectives are not

well defined. At the same time, ZINWA’s programme was disrupted as it had its water

quality monitoring objectives linked to flow assessments when it initially designed the

programme.



The next step would be to design the monitoring network itself based on the identified

objectives. First step would be to identify the sampling sites for monitoring and here GIS &

Remote sensing tools would be most useful. Then determine the frequency of sampling

needed considering factors such as river flow dynamics, climate factors etc. and this being

done in reference to the objectives. The third step would be to identify which parameters to

sample and analyse, guided by sampling objectives influenced by statutory regulations, for

example. These aspects were inherent weaknesses in the current water quality monitoring


68 | P a g e
framework as parameters are sometimes measured because they can, but this tends to be

costly. It is imperative to recognise that different approaches and parameters will be used

depending on whether we are dealing with point or non-point sources of pollution. A

monitoring programme must also consider the use of tools such as biological monitoring

which can be very cost-effective in the long-term, but whatever approach is used must ensure

that objectives of water quality monitoring are achieved (Davis and Hirji, 2003a)..



Sampling and analysis

Sampling involves the collection of a portion of water from a water body with the assumption

that is representative of the conditions at that site and point in time. Primarily it involves field

collection of samples of not just water, but any other medium such as sediment or organisms

of interest such as macroinvertebrates, fish or riparian vegetation. All these parameters have

techniques and a certain level of technical competency required by the person collecting the

samples. Sample collection methods for surface and groundwater therefore need to be

standardized to ensure that results are comparable even across institutions. At present, this

does not exist in Zimbabwe which makes it difficult to confidently utilize data collected by

another institution. In Phase 2, the aspect of sampling techniques will need to be addressed

and training must be considered as sometimes tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe lack capacity

to give potential water managers the necessary practical experience.



The next step after collection of samples is analysis for various parameters in the laboratory

(Davis and Hirji, 2003a). Most developing countries, including Zimbabwe face severe

constraints in this aspect because of the high capital outlay required to set up a laboratory.

For example, EMA has one national reference laboratory situated in Harare, and this

automatically determines the extent of any sampling programme in addition to the parameters


69 | P a g e
that can be analysed. Laboratories tend to ignore parameters that they cannot analyse, and in

Phase 2 critical thought has to be given to how the issue of laboratory analyses also taking

into consideration the aspect of cost. Important to this also is the aspect of technical and

professional competencies where training could be required for laboratory technicians (Davis

and Hirji, 2003a). Laboratory procedures and methods need to be well defined and

standardized across institutions in Zimbabwe, and in Phase 2 a way of achieving this needs to

be determined (Davis and Hirji, 2003a).



Processing, interpretation, management and presentation of data

The way data is handled after collection is of great concern to many developing countries.

The example given earlier where data collected by ZINWA in its monitoring programme can

no longer be accessed as no one is certain who took what when EMA was formed highlights

the seriousness of the issue. Ideally data should be entered and stored into a computerized

database with key information such as sampling, measurement variables and sampling

information (Davis and Hirji, 2003a). It will be most useful to also couple water quality

monitoring data with hydrological data, and Zimbabwe had gone some way in trying to

implement that but presently those two functions reside in two different statutory institutions.

It is important to clearly determine by who and where the data are stored and ideally a unit

must be responsible for data management in an entity so that there are adequate backups.

Most importantly, other users and institutions should be able to access the data. The issue of

access to data needs to be addressed in Phase 2 as it was apparent that accessing data in some

regulatory institutions was a very difficult process. Data is collected so that it can be used, not

stored and barricaded within institutions and parameters of how this can be best done need to

be worked out.




70 | P a g e
Stockpiles of data are useless if that data is not analysed and interpreted in a way that gives

clear management direction (Davis and Hirji, 2003a). This problem is also linked to a lack of

clear objectives why the data were collected in the first place. What could be lacking in

Zimbabwe’s context is the capacity of staff in institutions like EMA and ZINWA to apply

tools such as models in order to improve data interpretation. Phase 2 will need to implement

capacity building trainings in order to increase the level of confidence in data treatment. This

goes along with skills on how to present results to different audiences, as for example, some

policymakers may not have the technical knowledge of water quality monitoring (Davis and

Hirji, 2003a). The use of tools such as GIS mapping also can help in visually aiding

understanding about water quality management to non-technical audiences.

5.2. Zimbabwe Strategy for Managing Water: Key questions relevant for developing the

TORs for Phase 2

Based on the findings of this work, and experience in water quality assessment and

management, we pose seven key questions that are critical for Zimbabwe’s long-term

strategy for monitoring its water quality in Phase 2.


5.2.1. Does the current policy and legislative environment provide for comprehensive water
quality management?
Zimbabwe is regarded to have some of the finest legislation on environmental and water

issues such as the ZINWA Act, Water Act and EMA Act and a national water policy.

However, there is need to harmonise some sections of these different pieces of legislation to

ensure efficient water quality management. In addition, what is lacking is also a proper

implementation strategy that ensures maximum compliance by stakeholders and that derives

maximum benefits for the government and the public. While the implementing agencies do

have qualified personnel, there is need for continuous training of staff and capacity building

to adapt to new challenges. There is also need for appointment of management staff with

relevant technical qualifications and experience and whose performance is regularly

monitored and evaluated. There is also a need for harmonization of activities of all units

involved in law enforcement and for the judicial arm to decisively deal with offenders such

that environmental protection becomes respected and prioritized by citizens and corporates.

An application strategy for existing water-related legislative frameworks may need to be

developed in Phase 2.


5.2.2. Does the institutional set-up promote efficient water quality management?
At least three parastatals are responsible for some aspect of water management in Zimbabwe.

Despite the extensive network of institutions in water resources management, there is little

coordination and cooperation between ministries whose decisions have major implications for



72 | P a g e
water resources planning and management. There are also potential conflicts of interest in

some institutions. For example, while the Environmental Management Agency has the legal

obligation to monitor both underground and surface water, in practice ZINWA monitors

underground water while EMA deals with surface water. Under this arrangement, ZINWA

has to provide water quality data to EMA which may not be done timeously. In some cases

there are no defined limits for each body and a lot of functional overlaps occur. Since each

body manages the implementation of a different Act, there is need for harmonization of

functions of each body in implementing water-related programmes to improve synergy. The

recent promulgation of a single government ministry to oversee the environment, water and

climate may be one such step towards harmonization (see “Discussion” under Institutional

arrangements).


5.2.3. Do adequate technical skills exist within institutions to ensure efficient water quality
management?
Institutions responsible for water quality management do not have adequately trained staff.

The lack of adequate staff complement negatively affects the ability of the institutions to

effectively carry out their mandate; yet human capital is a requisite skill to perform the water

quality management operations. In this regard, the Consultant must implement a programme

to promote new, and modern technical skills amongst the staff at the water management

institutions. Areas that need attention include laboratory testing, field monitoring, biological

monitoring, and the application of remote sensing and GIS tools to Water Quality

management. This dire need must also devolve to the tertiary institutions where the requisite

manpower is trained and ensure adequate resources are mobilized to produce this critical

mass.




73 | P a g e
5.2.4. Are the technological resources (e.g. laboratories, geodatabases) and capacities
adequate?
Traditional regular water quality monitoring systems comprising a dense network of ground-

based monitoring stations and well-equipped laboratories are expensive and inefficient.

Remote sensing offers relatively cheaper, repetitive and quantitative method for assessing and

monitoring water quality (Lavery et al. 1993). There are several airborne optical and thermal

sensors on satellites providing both spatial and temporal data needed for managing water.

Zimbabwe can utilise remote sensing datasets such as Landsat and MODIS imagery which

can be downloaded free of charge from the internet to monitor changes in water quality

parameters and develop management practices to improve water quality. These datasets

provide repeated measurements covering a large synoptic view of the earth making them

suitable for national water quality monitoring.



To convert remotely sensed data into useful information specialised GIS software, hardware

and skills are needed. It is this technical capacity that is currently lacking in organisations that

are responsible for water quality monitoring and assessment in Zimbabwe. To address this

problem in Phase 2, training is needed for EMA and ZINWA staff on how remotely sensed

data, global positioning system (GPS), and GIS technologies can be integrated with in situ

data to yield a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing water quality at different spatial and

temporal scales across Zimbabwe.


5.2.5. Is data on water quality being collected based on clear water quality monitoring
objectives? Is it adequate and of the right quality? Are there databases where data is stored
and made accessible?
At present water quality monitoring objectives are fragmented and in general not clear why at

times the data has to be collected. Typically this has led to the collapse of the extensive

ground monitoring system initially established by ZINWA, as data collection must always be

guide by clear management objectives. Data on water quality have not been collected

74 | P a g e
consistently at least over the last 10 years. Numerous gaps exist, and the purposes for which

they are collected are not clearly defined. There is no uniformity in the way data are collected

making it difficult to assess for trends and other information. This implies that monitoring

may not really be taking place. Water quality data are collected that are not adequate and

methods of analysis produced some questionable data. There is need for a functional data

collection system that also makes use of the newly developed remote sensing tools to ensure

timely data collection. Phase 2 must develop and implement quality assurance/quality control

(QA/QC) mechanisms to ensure that water quality data meet international standards. This

will certainly require an investment in modern equipment and adequate capitalization of

laboratory facilities. The establishment of a data management system is also imperative

which will include databases with adequate backups. These will be key components to the

development of an efficient water quality management system for Zimbabwe that can provide

information for management decisions.


5.2.6. Are there sustainable financing mechanisms for a water quality management
programme?
The Zimbabwean economy is still in a recovery phase after a period of hyperinflation. This

has resulted in serious constraints on the ability of the Government fund programmes.

Programmes such as water quality monitoring and management, are normally the first to lose

funding especially when data collection objectives have not been well defined. This was very

apparent from the lack of adequate water quality monitoring data from the institutions.

Therefore, the issue of funding of a water quality monitoring and management programme is

of critical importance. The Consultant must work with the Institutions to identify mechanisms

of funding such a programme to ensure its sustainability in the future. Potential sources of

revenue need to be identified, and thoroughly analysed with the assistance of the Consultant.

This exercise can draw lessons from what other countries such as South Africa have done

when funding water quality monitoring programmes.

5.3. Terms of Reference (TORs) for Phase 2

Given the issues raised in the Discussion, Zimbabwe will have to reconsider its approach to

water quality monitoring focusing on what is relevant to the local context and also

international best practices. Overall, there is need to change the entire data paradigm which

was based on traditional approaches, to one with a clear rationale and is linked to the data

needs of stakeholders all placed in the national socioeconomic context (Ongley, 1994). Based

on our work in Phase 1, we propose that the consultant focus on the following work for Phase

2:

     1. Develop or redesign both a long-term water quality monitoring and a short-term

        regulatory assessment framework for Zimbabwe’s waters taking into account

        international best practices, but with clear and well defined objectives. The following

        must be taken into consideration:

        -      Define water quality monitoring objectives for all statutory bodies with water

               quality monitoring functions, recognising the importance of point and non-point

               pollution sources.

        -      In line with the objectives, identify sampling sites, appropriate parameters, and

               frequency of sampling. This can include the use physicochemical, biological

               monitoring protocols and GIS tools.

        -      Train technicians and WQ managers at EMA and ZINWA in sampling

               procedures, methods, laboratory analysis and quality control. A comprehensive

               field and laboratory water quality sampling and assessment procedures

               manual/protocol for Zimbabwe must be produced.

        -      Establish a data management unit that will be the custodian of all data collected in

               the field and laboratory. There is need to train and capacitate a unit on information



76 | P a g e
               collection, data management and processing by responsible authorities (EMA and

               ZINWA).

    2. Develop a capacity building programme (Nationals Strategic Training Programme)

        for providing adequate technical skills in water quality monitoring including

        laboratory testing, field monitoring, biological monitoring and their integration with

        remote sensing and GIS tools. The aim is to create a core group of professionals in

        order to sustain future monitoring programmes in line with the country’s needs.

        Collaboration with university/polytechnic colleges in developing relevant curricular

        and research programmes will also ensure a consistent production of critical human

        capacity.

    3. Conduct a review of different financing mechanisms for water quality monitoring

        management with an intention to identify a sustainable financing mechanism,

        especially the role of other stakeholders such as the private sector.

    4. Evaluate the current water management-related legislative and policy framework for

        Zimbabwe to minimise duplication and conflicts among different agencies.

    5. Review water quality standards for potable and effluent water and recommend

        possible approaches to developing unified, relevant and practical standards for point

        and non-point source pollution. Focus should also be on the reduction and

        simplification of parameters.

    6. Set up quality assurance/quality control mechanisms for laboratory proficiency,

        calibration of equipment and standardisation of methods.
