Providing Sustainable
Sanitation Services for All
in WASH Interventions
through a Menstrual Hygiene
Management Approach

Summary
A gender-inclusive approach to sanitation through
Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is needed
to ensure that the benefits of sanitation and hygiene
are truly universal. The key takeaways from this brief
are: (1) the need to do contextual research before
proposing an intervention, ideally by working with a
­
gender specialist; and (2) the value of working through
Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions
                                                                             © Stephan Bachenheimer/World Bank.

        Box 1.   What Is Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM)?


        Various components are considered essential to MHM. The first is that women and adolescent girls be able to
        use clean materials to absorb or collect menstrual blood, and to change them in privacy as often as necessary
        throughout their menstrual period. MHM also involves being able to use soap and water for washing the body
        as required, and having access to safe and convenient facilities to dispose of used menstrual management
        materials. Further, women and girls must have access to basic information about the menstrual cycle and how
        to manage it with dignity and without discomfort or fear.

      Box 2.   Key Resources for Integrating MHM in the WASH Sector


      The Menstrual Hygiene Matters resource book and training guide toolkit are the most comprehensive
      resources on MHM in developing countries (Wateraid 2012, 2015). The 2015 WSSCC/UN Women Initiative on
      MHM is an excellent example of documenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices on menstruation. Finally,
      a special issue of Waterlines dedicated to MHM provides additional reference material showcasing MHM
      initiatives in different contexts (Shahin 2015).




      Box 3. Providing Menstrual Hygiene Materials to Girls and Women: The Experience of Sustainable
      Health Enterprises in Rwanda


      Ms. Julian Kayibanda of Sustainable Health Enterprises (SHE) was the guest speaker for the learning event
      organized by the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Thematic Group (RWSS TG) with the support of the
      WPP on integrating gender in rural sanitation services through a MHM approach. SHE is a social enterprise
      dedicated to improving MHM for women and girls in Rwanda, and focuses on the following activities: (1)
      providing education and information on menstruation, aimed at debunking stereotypes; (2) reclaiming local
      resources—that is, banana fiber—to produce low-cost sanitary pads; and (3) investing in and empowering local
      entrepreneurs to produce low-cost sanitary pads.

      According to SHE, 18 percent of women and girls in Rwanda miss out on work or school every year because
      they cannot afford to buy menstrual pads. Apart from the larger issues of health and dignity, this represents
      a potential Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss of $215 per woman per year in Rwanda (i.e., $115 million
      in potential loss of GDP per year). SHE therefore aims to help women jumpstart social businesses to
      manufacture and distribute affordable menstrual pads, as well as to provide health education and advocacy
      for improved MHM.

      One of the main takeaways from Julian’s speech was that implementing such a comprehensive MHM
      program takes time: SHE was established in 2007, but did not start producing pads on a commercial scale
      until 2013. SHE also had to review its branding and marketing strategy to better appeal to their target group.
      Empowering school teachers to educate girls about MHM was considered essential to the mission of the
      organization.
