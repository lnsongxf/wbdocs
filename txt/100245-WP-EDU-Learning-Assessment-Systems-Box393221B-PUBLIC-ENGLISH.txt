21. By contrast, one could think of tablet or smartphone
applications where navigational options tend to be more
limited but also clearer and easier to use.

22. An interesting case is observed in Uruguay, where the
National Administration of Public Education administers
evaluations online using computers provided by Plan
Ceibal. Teachers can monitor students from their own
computers as they take the exam and access results and
view each student’s scores as well as their individual
answers. Test results come with information to help
teachers interpret them. For instance, a detailed item
“profile” to better understand the question, analyze
persistent conceptual errors, and plan corrective
interventions (Luaces, 2014). Teachers also have access to
“didactic guides,” developed by specialists to help teachers
improve their teaching methodologies.

23. It is worth mentioning that, in 2003, PREAL published
the findings of a regional study (Ferrer and Arregui, 2003)
with the financial support of the Peruvian Consortium for
Economic and Social Research (CIES). This study can also
be taken as a reference in time regarding the changes and
continuities in Latin America’s participation in international
assessments over a decade.

24. The interviewees did not offer any explanations for this
lack of interest. It is possible that education authorities
in the region feel that the cost of participating in so many
international tests is simply too high.

25. Isomorphism in this field has not a few detractors and
could possibly be one more reason to oppose international
assessments as a new way of cultural colonialism.
However, other voices argue that pedagogy and
curriculum are plagued with erratic, arbitrary definitions
and terminology, and therefore it should be good news
that some conceptual and semantic agreement is been
reached. The debate, nevertheless, is still open and will
probably be for many years to come.

26. For a recent example from Mexico, see Hoyos, Garcia-
Moreno, and Patrinos (2015).
