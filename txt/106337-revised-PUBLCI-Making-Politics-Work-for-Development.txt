Foreword


The challenge of economic development goes beyond economics. Social
norms and customs matter, as do politics and political institutions. The
transparency, efficiency, and inclusiveness of governments have a large
impact on economic outcomes; and citizen participation is also an impor-
tant determinant of the policies that are chosen and, as a result, the path
that an economy takes. Further, in today’s participative world, citizens
exert influence not just by queuing at voting booths but by taking to
the streets, using modern communication technology, and engaging the
media.
   This major report is part of the World Bank Group’s effort at recogniz-
ing that to do good economics we need to go beyond economics. It draws
on the best research on the interface between politics and economics, and
focuses in particular on the role of transparency and citizen engagement.
   The report is aimed at serving our clients and the development commu-
nity with a technical knowledge product on politics, to learn from mount-
ing research on the economic consequences of these forces of political
engagement and transparency. Synthesizing available research, the report
draws lessons about the political behavior of citizens, public officials, and
leaders, and how they respond to transparency across a variety of insti-
tutional contexts. Policy makers can use this knowledge to shape public
sector governance in ways that are suited to their institutional contexts.
For example, national leaders are concerned about monitoring and manag-
ing local-level public officials, who are often on the front lines of service
delivery, and about generating local revenues to support local government.
National leaders across the political spectrum are considering how best to
use citizen engagement and transparency to solve this “last-mile” problem,
including through well-managed local elections.

                                                                                ix
FOREWORD



              The analysis in this report points to ideas for relaxing political con-
           straints to pursuing technically sound policies, as opposed to choosing
           “second-best” solutions that are available when these constraints are taken
           as given. Rather than lowering expectations when politics is a problem,
           technical experts and policy makers can use a better understanding of
           political incentives and behavior to improve outcomes.
              A lesson for us at the World Bank also comes out of this research. We
           can do more, through relatively small changes in what we are already
           doing, to leverage our technical strengths in generating credible data and
           evidence, and to work with our clients to diminish political constraints
           to achieving development goals. We can provide more targeted, specific,
           reliable, and impartial information that will help citizens to work with
           their leaders to build effective public sector institutions that are capable of
           tackling public good problems. To do this we have to overcome the fear of
           talking about politics, and confront it as part of the challenge of develop-
           ment. That is what we are doing through this report.

Overview


Too often, government leaders fail to adopt and implement policies that
they know are necessary for sustained economic development. They are
encumbered by adverse political incentives, which prevent them from
selecting good policies, and they run the risk of losing office should they
try to do the right thing. Even when technically sound policies are selected
by leaders, implementation can run into perverse behavioral norms
among public officials and citizens, who seek to extract private benefits
from the public sector. Such behavior might be supported by widespread
beliefs that corruption is the norm.1 Even countries with low corruption
and strong institutions experience problems of political incentives and
behavior that prevent the public sector from solving shared problems.
Ideological polarization among citizens and capture by special interests can
lead to policy gridlock and the failure of the state to provide public goods,
even in advanced economies.2 Even educated citizens can hold ideological
beliefs about the role of public policy that lead them to deny technical
evidence contrary to these beliefs.3



Harnessing citizen engagement and transparency
to address government failures
This report is about addressing government failures, such as the ones
described in box O.1, by making politics work for development rather
than against it. It draws on research about how political markets
function in determining which citizens become leaders and what

                                  distills lessons for how a variety of policy actors—from sovereign

                                  organizations—can harness political markets to serve the goals of

                                  how political markets function across and within countries. The report
                                  brings together dispersed strands of research and forges connections
                                  between them to gain an understanding of their implications. Research
                                  shows how citizen engagement and transparency in the political pro-
                                  cess shape incentives and behavioral norms in the public sector, with
                                  profound consequences for economic development. These lessons yield
                                  implications for policy actors who want to build effective public sector
                                  institutions that can deliver the public goods and services needed for
                                  development.

Growing space for political engagement
A global shift in political institutions is providing space for greater citizen
engagement in the political process—or political engagement. Political
engagement is defined as the participation of citizens in selecting and
sanctioning the leaders who wield power in government, including by
entering themselves as contenders for leadership. The dramatic spread of
elections at national and at local levels, even within countries with authori-
tarian national political institutions, has created unprecedented opportu-
nities for citizens to influence governance. Citizens are engaging in the
political process as individual voters and as contenders for political office.4

Note: The Polity IV Score is a measure of state authority that is widely used in research, varying on a 21-point scale ranging from −10 (which
corresponds to hereditary monarchy) to +10 (which corresponds to the Polity IV view of consolidated democracy). Higher values are associated
with more democratic institutions.

                                        the overall distribution of political institutions across countries has steadily
                                        shifted toward those institutions that allow greater political engagement.

Political engagement is a means for citizens to improve the quality of pub-
lic goods they receive by selecting and sanctioning political leaders. These
leaders in turn exert great influence—for good or for ill—through the
many public service institutions that are responsible for providing public
goods. Non-political forms of citizen engagement seek to bypass the politi-
cal process. Some forms try to make public officials and frontline providers
more accountable to citizens for the public goods and services they provide.
Others try to increase direct citizen participation in managing public bud-
gets and organizing service delivery. This report will argue that such forms
of non-political citizen engagement can only have limited benefits when
they do not address fundamental failures in the political process. Indeed,
even when such forms of non-political citizen engagement improve service
delivery outcomes, they may do so by letting political leaders, public offi-
cials, and frontline service providers “off the hook” and, in effect, require
citizens to provide public goods for themselves.


Growing space for transparency across different institutional contexts
At the same time, greater political engagement has been supported by
greater transparency, defined as citizen access to publicly avail-
able information about the actions of those in government and the
consequences of these actions. Public disclosure policies are bringing
out greater information about the functioning of government and the
actions of those in power. Greater information is available not only
due to disclosure by governments, but also by non-government agents,
such as investigative journalists and civil society groups. New media
technologies broadcast information about government performance at
all levels.6
   Established democracies tend to have independent media, but nascent
and emerging democracies, as well as autocracies, are also experiencing
greater media freedom. Figure O.2 shows that countries that have more
democratic institutions, as measured by Polity IV indicators, also tend to
have more independent media, as measured by Freedom House.7 At the
same time, even autocracies allow some degree of independence or perhaps
are unable to fully control media. Indeed, new information and commu-
nications technologies (ICTs), such as high-speed Internet access, have
been described as a “dictator’s dilemma” (World Bank 2016). On the one
hand, ICTs are important to facilitating economic growth and attracting
investments, but on the other hand, these technologies increase access

                                               debated, recent research reports a robust positive association.8 On average, this

                                               to better development outcomes. Yet clear examples can be pointed to where
                                               autocracies outperform democracies.9 Research examining these differences
                                               in outcomes concludes that the key question that applies to both autocracies
                                               and democracies is whether leaders are selected and sanctioned on the basis of
                                               performance in delivering public goods (Besley and Kudamatsu 2008). This
                                               report is not about whether democratic institutions are better or worse than
                                               other institutions. It moves beyond cross-country evidence on the effects of
                                               national political systems to focus on within-country evidence on the nuances

of political engagement within the same formal context and how its specific
characteristics matter for governance and for development outcomes.
   Political engagement happens in every institutional context, from democ-
racies to autocracies, albeit in different ways. The main contrast examined
in the literature is when there is scope for greater political engagement by a
larger number of individual citizens acting as voters, and as contenders for
leadership, because of electoral institutions, versus when they do not; that is,
when power over leaders is instead concentrated among elites or organized
groups of citizens such as political parties. The report reviews the available
research to draw lessons about citizens’ and leaders’ political behavior and
how they respond to transparency across a variety of institutional contexts.
Policy makers can use this knowledge to shape public sector governance in
ways that are suited to their institutional contexts. For example, national
leaders across the political spectrum are concerned about monitoring and
managing public officials at the local level, who are often on the front lines
of service delivery. National leaders even in authoritarian regimes are con-
sidering how best to use citizen engagement and transparency to solve this
“last-mile” problem, including through local elections.
   The analysis in this report points to the benefits of relaxing political
constraints to the adoption of technically sound policies, as opposed to
choosing “second-best” solutions that are available when these constraints
are taken as given. This report recommends a shift in development policy
advice from one in which technical experts seek to bypass politics or lower
expectations when it is a problem, to one in which they confront politics
and incorporate it into the search for technical solutions to development
problems. This approach does not mean prioritizing attention to politi-
cal incentives or waiting until problems of politics are solved. Instead,
the suggested approach opens up avenues for development practitioners
to harness the current forces of political engagement and transparency,
which are emergent everywhere, for better development outcomes.

Message 1: Government failures are a consequence
of “unhealthy” political engagement
The examples of government failures in box O.1, above, can be understood
in the context of research on “unhealthy” political engagement: when
leaders are selected and sanctioned on the basis of their provision
of private benefits rather than public goods.10 Unhealthy political

                     engagement can take many forms. For example, electoral competition can
                     involve violence, fraud, vote buying, and patronage targeted to specific
                     groups.11 Vote buying and fielding of candidates against whom there are
                     serious allegations of criminality undermine the ability of citizens to use
                     elections to hold leaders accountable for public goods provision (Khemani
                     2015; Prakash, Rockmore, and Uppal 2014).
                         Unhealthy political engagement can also result from distributive con-
                     flict among citizens. Special interest groups can mobilize to extract private
                     benefits from public policies at the expense of the broader public interest
                     (Grossman and Helpman 2001). Ideological beliefs among citizens about
                     specific public policies, such as energy subsidies or immigration, can be dif-
                     ficult to shift with technical evidence on the costs and benefits of different
                     policy options (Kahan et al. 2013). Distributive conflict and entrenched
                     beliefs can lead to the selection of leaders who further polarize citizens
                     and nurture ideological constituencies, rather than trying to find com-
                     mon ground to address shared problems. Polarizing leaders can prevent
                     reformers from gaining power and pursuing appropriate public policies.
                     Such unhealthy political engagement can occur in weak as well as strong
                     institutional environments, and in poor as well as rich countries.
                         Unhealthy political engagement casts a long shadow. It not only shapes
                     the incentives of elected leaders in adverse ways, but also the behavior of
                     unelected public officials and of citizens. Leaders directly influence incen-
                     tives and norms within public bureaucracies through the management
                     policies they select. For example, when political leaders provide jobs in the
                     government as political patronage, they prevent the professionalization
                     of bureaucracies. A growing body of research provides evidence on the
                     behavior of officials in the public sector that is consistent with the impli-
                     cations of such patronage politics. For example, doctors with connections
                     to political leaders are more likely to be absent from public health clinics,
                     and the public officials who manage these doctors are more likely to report
                     political interference when trying to apply sanctions (Callen et al. 2014).
                         Unhealthy political engagement undermines the legitimacy of leaders,
                     weakening their ability to manage complex organizations and effectively
                     implement policies (Akerlof 2015). For example, leaders can use new tech-
                     nologies to monitor frontline providers, reducing opportunities for graft
                     (Banerjee, Duflo, and Glennerster 2008; Muralidharan, Niehaus, and
                     Sukhtankar 2014; World Bank 2016). But when leaders lack legitimacy, they
                     may face resistance from frontline public providers to take up these technolo-
                     gies. For example, the time stamp machines that were installed to monitor
                     staff attendance in public health clinics in India were sabotaged by the staff

(Banerjee, Duflo, and Glennerster 2008). Widespread electricity theft and
non-payment of dues to public electric utilities in the developing world are
further examples of the lack of legitimacy of the state in environments of
unhealthy political engagement (Min 2015; Min and Golden 2014).


Message 2: Political engagement also functions in “healthy”
ways that hold the key to addressing government failures
While unhealthy political engagement explains government failures, the
solutions to these failures lie in fostering “healthy” political engagement
and not in circumventing or suppressing political engagement. Political
engagement happens in “healthy” ways when leaders are selected and
sanctioned on the basis of performance in providing public goods.
Healthy political engagement enables citizens to play a role in overcoming
government failures by holding leaders accountable and by selecting better-
quality leaders.12 For example, corruption is lower when political leaders face
reelection incentives (Ferraz and Finan 2011). Poverty is lower when political
leaders come from social groups that have historically experienced greater
poverty and economic discrimination (Chin and Prakash 2011). Greater
political competition is associated with the selection of better-quality lead-
ers who contribute to economic growth (Besley, Persson, and Sturm 2005).
   The evidence on the adverse effects of unhealthy political engagement
does not imply that authoritarian institutions that bypass or suppress
political engagement would necessarily improve outcomes. For example,
one study finds that ethnic favoritism led to distortions in public resource
allocation even under authoritarian regimes in Kenya, and that periods
of transition to multiparty electoral competition were in fact associated
with reductions in these ethnicity-based policy distortions (Burgess et al.
2015). Other factors that explain unhealthy political engagement, such as
the ability of political elites to punish voters through economic sanctions,
violence, and coercion, can also prevent autocratic arrangements from being
successful (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Besley and Kudamatsu 2008).
   The diversity of successful institutions around the globe might tempt
reform leaders to find ways of bypassing the messiness of electoral politics
rather than improving it. It may even be interpreted as evidence in favor of
restricting political engagement and establishing institutions run by benevo-
lent dictators and organized elites. For example, some have attributed the East
Asian growth “miracle” to institutions that restricted citizen engagement,
allowing leaders to select and implement policies on technical merit.13 This
view, however, begs the question of where benevolent dictators and elites come
                                                                                         9

                                       from and whether the “miracle” can be replicated in other countries. Societies
                                       in which elites do not sanction poor leaders or where elites benefit from
                                       poorly performing leaders remaining in office, are unlikely to be successful
                                       autocracies (Besley and Kudamatsu 2008). Why are some autocratic settings
                                       successful in selecting and sanctioning leaders on the basis of competence and
                                       performance, and others disastrous at it? There is little research available to
                                       guide us on this question and even less on whether messy democracies can
                                       eschew elections, however flawed they may be, and become well-functioning
                                       autocracies. Overall, however, the evidence from a large variety of institu-
                                       tional contexts is clear that fostering healthy political engagement rather than
                                       suppressing it is more likely to result in better development outcomes.
                                          Table O.1 provides a typology of healthy and unhealthy forms of political
                                       engagement and behavior in the public sector. It also distinguishes between
                                       actions by individual citizens, such as voting, and actions by organized
                                       groups of citizens, such as political parties or civil society organizations.

Previous work has focused on the role of citizen action through groups to
solve collective action problems (Grandvoinnet, Aslam, and Raha 2015;
Keefer, forthcoming). This report emphasizes the role of individual citi-
zen actions, such as voting, in solving collective action problems. Political
engagement involves the interaction of both individual and organized group
action. Together, individual and group actions work through political insti-
tutions to shape the incentives and quality of leaders, as well as the political
beliefs and behavioral norms of citizens and public officials.
   Individual citizen actions, such as voting or working through political
markets, play a critical role in whether political engagement functions in
healthy or unhealthy ways. Although it is an enduring puzzle to economists
why people vote at all (Feddersen 2004), the evidence presented in this
report suggests that citizens perceive the costs of voting as low and the
potential benefits as high.14 However, beyond the act of voting, citizens
can vary in how they vote: for example, whether they are influenced by
policy issues or by vote buying when deciding whether to support or evict
leaders. Political leaders, both incumbents and challengers, can use differ-
ent strategies, including unhealthy ones such as vote buying and violence,
to influence and manipulate the votes of citizens.
   The impact of organized groups such as political parties, special interests,
and civil society, depends in part upon their ability to influence individual
actions such as voting. Most of the available research provides examples of
unhealthy organized group action that worsens the incentives and selection
of leaders. For example, Satyanath, Voigtlaender, and Voth (2013) show
how social groups in Germany enabled the Nazi party to mobilize voters,
gain office, and subsequently subvert democracy. Research suggests that
groups that can effectively organize collective action—by preventing “free-
riding” by group members and by enforcing group-prescribed actions for
individual members—are more likely to emerge to extract private group
benefits rather than to work for the broad public interest.15
   Well-intentioned civil society leaders can try to organize to pressure gov-
ernment for public goods, but for that organization to have real impact, they
need strategies that work with the political incentives of government leaders
to respond. There is little evidence and understanding about the impact of
civil society organizations in contexts where elections are marred by vote
buying or captured by special interests. However, a recent example suggests
that civil society groups can make an impact when they are able to shift
voting behavior. Some of the leaders of an anticorruption civil society move-
ment in India turned their organization into a political party to contest and

                                                                                         11

                     win elections on an anticorruption platform.16 Such a development can
                     improve governance by strengthening the incentives of all political parties
                     to demonstrate competence and performance in controlling corruption,
                     that is, by shifting the issues of political competition toward public goods.
                        The incentives of special interests or organized elites can become
                     aligned with public goods when the costs of government failure become
                     too large for these groups. When this happens, history suggests that they
                     contribute to strengthening political incentives by increasing space for
                     political engagement by individual citizens. For example, research sug-
                     gests that a rise in demand for urban public health goods among the elite
                     in the United Kingdom after the Industrial Revolution contributed to the
                     movement to expand the franchise toward universal male suffrage (Lizzeri
                     and Persico 2004). Research on the origins of state capacity has identified
                     the emergence of citizens’ demand for common-interest public goods as a
                     driving factor (Besley and Persson 2009). When elite business groups and
                     civil society organizations demand broad public goods, they can advance
                     their goals by using transparency initiatives to cultivate better quality of
                     political engagement by individual citizens.17

                     overcome government failures. In contrast, transparency initiatives that do
                     not improve political engagement are unlikely to be effective
                     Transparency can cultivate and improve the quality of political engagement
                     in a variety of institutional contexts.18 Even where corruption is rampant,
                     concrete information on the extent of corruption, as revealed by public audits
                     of government spending, can increase the likelihood that corrupt leaders are
                     removed from office (Ferraz and Finan 2008). Where ethnic favoritism and
                     vote-buying practices are widespread, the use of these clientelist practices to
                     win office by providing private benefits at the expense of public goods, can
                     be reduced by providing greater information about the quality of leaders and
                     their performance in delivering public services (Banerjee et al. 2011; Casey
                     2015; Fujiwara and Wantchekon 2013; Keefer and Khemani 2014).
                        Transparency, in the form of greater information and better means of
                     communicating it, can improve what citizens demand from leaders, can
                     influence what issues they consider when assessing candidates for leader-
                     ship, and can help them determine whether to enter political markets
                     as contenders for leadership (Campante, Durante, and Sobbrio 2013).
                     However, in contexts in which political engagement is unhealthy, there is

no clear evidence on whether transparency’s impact is sufficient to get lead-
ers to respond with sustainable or long-term improvements in outcomes,
using the powers of their office to strengthen institutions.
   The design of transparency is important—the nature and credibility of
sources of information, and media through which it is ­   communicated—all
        19
matter. For example, a growing body of evidence, primarily from the
United States, shows how the intersection of media markets and political
markets shapes governance outcomes (Campante and Do 2014; Campante
and Hojman 2013; Snyder and Strömberg 2010). When media markets
coincide with political jurisdictions, citizens have better access to informa-
tion on the actions of local leaders and their consequences for local out-
comes that can be used to assess the leaders they choose. Leaders, in turn,
have been found to play a role in credibly communicating information to
citizens, persuading them to change their prior and typically entrenched
beliefs (Glaeser and Sunstein 2013). That is, transparency as information
provision alone is not enough—it needs to interact with political engage-
ment, and the leaders selected through it, to shift behavior and beliefs.
   Evidence from developing countries indicates that leaders and mass media
do play the same role here as well, for example, in causing social norms
related to the role of women to shift (Beaman et al. 2009; Beaman et al.
2012; World Bank 2015). This finding suggests that the effects of leaders and
persuasive media programming might extend to influencing political beliefs
and strengthening political behavioral norms—what policies to demand,
how to behave in the public sector, what issues to consider when evaluat-
ing leaders, and whether to become a contender for leadership. Available
research highlights the role of mass media as a force for persuasion, and as an
institution that can address coordination problems among citizens beyond
information alone (Keefer and Khemani 2014; Yanagizawa-Drott 2014).20
   While transparency can support healthy political engagement, the evi-
dence suggests that transparency initiatives focused on citizen engagement
outside the political process are less effective. For example, citizen report
cards have been used as a tool to mobilize and motivate citizens to monitor
and demand accountability directly from frontline public service providers,
rather than from the politicans to whom the service providers ultimately
report (Banerjee et al. 2010; Bjorkman, De Walque, and Svensson 2014;
Bjorkman and Svensson 2009). These types of initiatives are described
as social accountability mechanisms because they do not rely on changes
in the political incentives of leaders in government to trigger better per-
formance on the part of providers. The evidence shows that whether

                                                                                        13
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     a transparency initiative improves a service delivery problem depends upon
                     the characteristics of political engagement.21 For example, if low motivation
                     and effort by public providers is attributable to leaders’ political incentives
                     to provide patronage jobs in the public sector, then citizen engagement for
                     social accountability may have little effect on public service delivery (Callen
                     et al. 2014). Consistent with this view, the evidence for the effects of citizen
                     report cards is weakest in unhealthy political contexts.22
                        Transparency interventions, such as information campaigns about
                     local service delivery problems, are likely to have only transient effects if
                     they do not improve political engagement. In the absence of institutional
                     strengthening by leaders, governance problems can be displaced to other
                     times and other areas outside the limelight of the information campaign.
                     For example, theft of public funds might fall when there is media coverage,
                     only to come back with a vengeance when the news cycle is over (Bobonis,
                     Cámara Fuertes, and Schwabe, forthcoming; Zimmerman 2014). 23
                     Sustained reductions in corruption and improvements in service delivery
                     depend upon whether transparency has fundamentally changed incentives
                     and behavioral norms in the public sector. In turn, the permanence of
                     these changes in incentives depends upon whether leaders are selected and
                     sanctioned on the basis of good performance.


                     Message 4: Building effective government institutions requires changes
                     in political behavior—investments in formal capacity and innovative
                     technologies are not enough. Political engagement and transparency
                     can bring about the needed changes in political behavior
                     Political engagement is a blunt instrument for accountability. For example,
                     even when they function well, elections are designed only to hold elected
                     officials accountable. But many of the functions of government are del-
                     egated to appointed officials rather than to elected politicians. Both elected
                     and appointed officials exercise their powers through a myriad of working-
                     level institutions of government, ranging from ministries and agencies all
                     the way down to local public schools and clinics. Strong institutions of
                     internal accountability within government, such as supreme audit insti-
                     tutions, and checks and balances, such as through independent judicia-
                     ries, are therefore important mechanisms to complement accountability
                     through elections and other forms of political engagement.
                        The problem is how to build such institutions when they are weak to
                     begin with. A wealth of experience with efforts to strengthen institutions

has shown that programs to replicate successful rich country institu-
tions in developing countries—by providing equipment and training
   bureaucracies—often fail (Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock 2013;
to ­
IDS 2010; Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews 2013). Rather, effective
institutions are more likely to be homegrown, using local knowledge
and tailored to local contexts (Dal Bó, Foster, and Putterman 2010;
Rodrik 2000).
   The literature on institutional transition in the history of nations sug-
gests that transparency in combination with political engagement provides
tipping points for change in how government institutions function (Camp,
Dixit, and Stokes 2014; Glaeser and Goldin 2006; Lizzeri and Persico
2004). Working together, these forces not only can hold elected leaders
more accountable, but can also improve the incentives, political beliefs,
and behavioral norms of appointed officials and of citizens. Political
engagement and transparency serve as “meta-institutions” for building
effective homegrown institutions.24 They influence institutional change
not only by affecting the “political will” or incentives of leaders to take up
formal reforms, but also by changing the informal behavioral norms in the
public sector to act upon them.
   In contrast, change in formal institutions alone is not sufficient to
change actual behavior. Research has found that healthy and unhealthy
political behaviors can coexist and vary within the same formal institu-
tional context (Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson 2014; Anderson, Francois,
and Kotwal 2015; Banerjee, Iyer, and Somanathan 2005). The importance
of informal behavior is further highlighted in research examining persis-
tent effects of historical institutions, even when those institutions have long
disappeared and been formally replaced by others.25
     Political engagement and transparency, and the leaders selected
through it, can shift political beliefs and promote cooperative behavioral
norms among citizens. Leaders can play this role as “prominent agents”
who signal a shift in beliefs among society at large (Acemoglu and Jackson
2015).26 Growing experience with political engagement and the learning
that comes from it, such as through frustration and indignation with bad
outcomes, can contribute to endogenous changes in political behavior over
time (Bidner and Francois 2013).27
   Multiple levels for political engagement created through local electoral
institutions can enable transitions to healthy political behavior by increas-
ing the supply of leaders who have built reputations for responsible man-
agement of public resources (Myerson 2006, 2012). Both the spread of

                                                                                        15
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     local electoral competition and instruments for transparency, such as new
                     communication technologies, can lower barriers to entry for new political
                     contenders (Campante, Durante, and Sobbrio 2013). The experience of
                     political engagement at these local levels, as voters and as contenders for
                     leadership, can play a significant role in building effective institutions.
                        Local elections can also operate directly as a tool for monitoring and
                     enforcement at the local level. The need for such monitoring has grown
                     with greater devolution of public resources in developing countries to
                     local government, often with weak capacity. Lack of capacity, in turn, can
                     contribute to widespread beliefs about corruption with impunity, leading
                     to a culture of poor performance in the public sector. Such a “culture of
                     corruption” would stem not from values but rather from rational beliefs
                     about how others are behaving and about the probability of detection
                     and punishment in environments with scarce resources with which to
                     combat corruption. Local institutions for political engagement supported
                     by transparency can help solve this coordination failure by shifting beliefs
                     and behavioral norms.
                        Innovative technologies can play an important role in monitoring and
                     managing funds flows and reducing opportunities for graft (for example,
                     Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar 2014; Sacks, Ensminger, and
                     Clark 2014; World Bank 2016). By strengthening incentives and the
                     quality of leaders, transparency in combination with political engagement
                     can potentially be leveraged to complement technological solutions and
                     increase the likelihood of their take-up. In the process, transparency and
                     political engagement, along with innovative technological solutions, may
                     together contribute to shifting the political beliefs that support a culture
                     of poor performance in the public sector.
                        The lessons from research for solving government failures for the deliv-
                     ery of public goods are summarized in table O.2.

and there are many risks of unhealthy political engagement and repressive
responses by leaders. However, deliberate policy efforts for transparency
targeted at helping citizens select and sanction leaders on the basis of per-
formance in providing public goods can try to channel these forces toward
the goals of economic development.
   The report focuses its recommendations on leveraging transparency
and citizen engagement, taking existing national political institutions
as given. This pragmatic approach recognizes the difficulty of, and the
political constraints to, changing fundamental political institutions in the
short run. However, it does suggest opportunities to harness the power of

                     citizen engagement and transparency in a range of institutional settings.
                     Targeted information enables citizens to select and sanction leaders on the
                     basis of performance in delivering public goods, with far-reaching effects.
                     As discussed above, it can improve the performance of political leaders who
                     are disciplined by the threat of challengers, and it can improve behavioral
                     norms in the public sector as a whole. It can also contribute to the reforms
                     of other institutions of accountability in the public sector, in effective home-
                     grown ways, by strengthening incentives of leaders to take up reforms and
                     the behavior of public officials and citizens to support their implementation.

                     Policies toward transparency
                     Research findings suggest the following insights to inform policy actions
                     on transparency:
                     •	 Transparency is most effective when it supports the generation of spe-
                        cific, reliable, and impartial evidence on the performance of leaders
                        tasked with the delivery of public policies. The information provided
                        through transparency must be specific about both policy actions and the
                        resulting outcomes, so that citizens can use this information to select and
                        sanction leaders. Information that is not specific in this way will erode
                        the benefits of transparency. For example, information only on budget
                        allocations is of limited use without information on how these allocations
                        were spent and what the spending accomplished. Naturally, the informa-
                        tion provided must also be reliable and must be accepted as impartial and
                        untainted by partisan political considerations. This recommendation is
                        supported by a body of research on the effects of providing information
                        about the effort and performance of leaders, discussed in chapters 4 and 6.

                     •	 Policies to strengthen the functioning of media markets can be
                        a crucial part of governance strategies to foster healthy political
                        engagement. Policies in this area can promote healthy competition in
                        media markets and can be complemented by interventions to support
                        public interest programming that provides impartial information to cul-
                        tivate citizens’ political engagement. Even when media are independent
                        from state control and markets are competitive, citizens can choose to
                        access primarily entertaining programs that do not sufficiently inform
                        them about public interest issues. Sponsorship of appealing programs or
                        “infotainment” to communicate evidence on the actions of leaders and
                        the effects of public policies, has the potential to persuade citizens to
                        shift political beliefs in ways that strengthen demand for good leaders

   and good policies. This recommendation is supported by a body of
   research on characteristics of political engagement and the role of media
   that is discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6.

•	 Policies can encourage the provision of information and the access
   to media to be more relevant and timely to the political process.
   A key dimension of relevance is jurisdictional: information on the
   performance of public policies needs to be targeted to the jurisdictions
   in which citizens select leaders. Information on public goods provision
   at the local level is more relevant to voters’ decisions in local elections
   than is information at the national level. Timeliness matters as well:
   performance assessments of both current incumbents and of challeng-
   ers, delivered regularly during a term in office but also at the time of
   elections, can make it easier for citizens to use information to decide
   on how to vote. Information that enables citizens to assess the potential
   of political contenders, not just incumbents, can be useful to avoid
   incumbency bias. Relevant information broadcast through media that
   citizens actually access and pay attention to can lower barriers to entry
   for candidates to compete on platforms of improving public policies and
   government performance. This recommendation is supported by a body
   of research discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6 on how transparency and
   political engagement need to work together to enable accountability.

•	 Policies can be designed in ways that are sensitive to the nature of
   political institutions. The policy implications of this report depend
   on the design of government jurisdictions—which tasks are assigned to
   which leaders and who are the citizens who select and sanction them.
   If government jurisdictions have clearly assigned responsibilities for
   public goods, then it is easier to generate data on performance that can
   be attributed to the leaders of those jurisdictions and to communicate
   that information to enable citizens to hold those leaders accountable
   for public goods. Most places will have a complex set of political and
   bureaucratic institutions that share responsibilities for the provision of
   public goods. Higher order transparency, such as civic education about
   the roles of different government jurisdictions and officials, can play a
   role in strengthening governance. When citizens are not empowered to
   select and sanction leaders of government jurisdictions, then citizens are
   unlikely to have the capacity to use information to exact accountability.
                                                                                       19
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     Policies toward citizen engagement
                     Research findings suggest the following insights to inform efforts to
                     strengthen citizen engagement to address government failures:
                     •	 Policies can be designed to be more effective when they explicitly
                        take citizens’ and leaders’ political behavior into account. The suc-
                        cess of policy initiatives to engage citizens to improve service delivery
                        depends upon the political characteristics of the environment in which
                        those services are delivered. If citizens are asked to monitor and provide
                        feedback on the performance of powerful local elites who control service
                        delivery, citizens are unlikely to act without credible assurance that they
                        will be protected from retaliation. For example, if beneficiary feedback is
                        solicited through local elites who are the ones capturing public resources,
                        then citizens are unlikely to respond by providing reliable feedback to
                        reduce local capture (Olken 2007). In contrast, when beneficiaries are
                        informed with the purpose of strengthening their bargaining power
                        vis-à-vis local elites, then they are more likely to demand their entitle-
                        ­
                        ments and complain about poor performance (Banerjee et al. 2015).

                     •	 Policies to improve local service delivery can use local political
                        engagement and transparency. A number of social accountability
                        initiatives that seek to work outside the political realm rely on cata-
                        lyzing group action by citizens. They use transparency campaigns to
                        trigger action by committees charged with monitoring public schools,
                        health clinics, or other public spending programs. However, there
                        is little evidence that transparency alone encourages group action
                        through such committees. Survey evidence that these committees are
                        typically inactive suggests that organized group action of this type
                        can be costly for citizens. Theory suggests that this is because groups
                        rarely organize to pursue broadly shared public goods. In contrast,
                        individual actions of political engagement, such as voting, respond
                        to transparency. In pursuing the engagement of citizens to hold local
                        officials accountable, higher-tier policy makers even in authoritarian
                        national systems may consider local elections to be the mechanism
                        through which citizens are empowered to do so. The research find-
                        ings of the responsiveness of voting behavior to transparency suggests
                        that policy makers can craft transparency policies, such as public dis-
                        closure of local government audits and strengthening of local media
                        markets, to improve local political engagement as the mechanism of
                        holding local officials accountable.

Who will take up these recommendations?
In making these recommendations, this report is mindful of the funda-
mental dilemma that motivates the report: too often, leaders with the
power to choose technically sound policies are encumbered by political
constraints that prevent them from doing so. The same problem naturally
applies to the recommendations here aimed at harnessing transparency and
citizen engagement to strengthen governance.
   Nevertheless, different policy messages considered in the report may
appeal to the comparative advantage of a diverse range of policy actors,
including reform leaders within government, as well as non-government
agents such as civil society and international development partners, whose
incentives may be more aligned with development objectives.28 External
agents can play potentially transformative roles in contexts in which they are
most needed to address political impediments to development. For example,
the policy messages from research emphasize the importance of relevance,
credibility, and impartiality of information about the performance of leaders
and their policy actions. External agents might offer these attributes when
they have technical capacity to generate meaningful information from large
data and when they are regarded as politically independent and non-partisan.


Structure of the report
The first part of this report, comprising chapters 1–3, discusses the
main themes that motivate the report: government failures, political
engagement, and transparency. Each chapter presents trends and pro-
vides the context for policy action on the basis of the research covered in
the subsequent chapters.

Chapter 1 on the theme of governance describes government failures
in the provision of public goods. It presents examples and evidence from
research on how political incentives and norms of political behavior can
be at the root of government failures.

Chapter 2 on the theme of political engagement discusses growth in
the participation of citizens in selecting and sanctioning leaders. It relies
on public opinion surveys as well as other sources to provide evidence on
citizens’ perceptions of and participation in elections. Citizens, especially
the poor and less educated, report active participation in elections across a
variety of institutional contexts. Even where electoral violence and fraud,

                                                                                       21
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     vote buying, and ethnic conflict are common, citizens nevertheless express
                     beliefs that elections matter for beneficial change, that through their vote
                     they can improve their lives.

                     Chapter 3 discusses the emergence of transparency, defined as citizen
                     access to publicly available information about the actions of those in gov-
                     ernment, and the consequences of these actions. Transparency has grown
                     through deliberate policy efforts to improve governance by providing infor-
                     mation about government actions and their consequences. For example, the
                     public disclosure of information about government budgets has been pro-
                     posed as a condition for international development assistance. Civil society
                     organizations have also been making efforts to generate new information to
                     monitor and evaluate government service provision. Finally, transparency
                     has grown as a result of technological forces that allow different news media
                     to generate and broadcast information about government performance.
                     Established democracies tend to be more transparent, but there is also evi-
                     dence of growing transparency in nascent or emerging democracies, as well
                     as in autocracies, because of domestic and international pressures.

                     The second part of this report, comprising chapters 4–6, presents the
                     lessons from research on how political engagement and transparency
                     work together to improve governance. Each chapter contains different
                     pieces of the theoretical and empirical research that come together in the
                     messages summarized in this Overview.

                     Chapter 4 provides the conceptual framework for how political
                     engagement is fundamental to incentives and behavioral norms
                     within government. It shows how disciplining leaders and also selecting
                     different types of leaders matters for governance and development out-
                     comes. Transparency about both policy actions and policy consequences
                     is essential. When information about policy consequences is lacking,
                     transparency about policy actions may be counterproductive, leading to
                     pandering and populism by politicians seeking to please uninformed citi-
                     zens. In contrast, information about policy consequences can strengthen
                     the ability of citizens to hold leaders accountable for outcomes.
                        Citizen beliefs about politicians, the political process, and public policies
                     are relevant. Political norms that ingrain expectations of low performance
                     perpetuate underperformance, be it corruption, shirking, or pandering. In
                     addition, pandering is more likely when politicians are not trusted, which
                     would occur when corruption is high. Thus, by creating a culture of distrust,

                                                                                  OVERVIEW



corruption has the indirect effect of fostering pandering. Political engage-
ment and the leaders selected through it can help shift political beliefs and
norms of political behavior among citizens, potentially enabling societies to
escape low-performance traps to improve governance in the public sector.

Chapter 5 presents lessons from the empirical evidence on the impact
of political engagement. A large literature provides consistent evidence
across a variety of contexts that political engagement matters for gover-
nance, policy selection, and development outcomes in highly nuanced
ways. Both individual citizen action through electoral institutions and
organized group action can assume either healthy or unhealthy forms.
    Political engagement can improve outcomes by changing incentives and
encouraging the selection of better-quality leaders. Much of the available
empirical evidence focuses on testing the impact of political engagement
through elections. Relatively less evidence is available on the impact of
political engagement by civil society organizations outside of elections, but
it suggests that the impact of organized groups has important interactions
with and can work through the mechanisms of electoral institutions.
    By connecting and interpreting a large literature on the impact of histori-
cal institutions on development, the chapter shows how beliefs and behav-
ioral norms can vary within the same formal institutions and persist even
when formal institutions change. Persistence in political beliefs and norms
regardless of changes in formal institutions has implications for how to
think about the transition from weak to strong institutions of governance.
Building the capacity of formal institutions is not sufficient. Improvements
in the quality of political behavior are crucial for improving governance.

Chapter 6 presents lessons from the empirical evidence on the
impact of transparency. It shows how different types of information
and means of communication influence the actions, beliefs, and behavior
of citizens and leaders. Substantial evidence shows that political engage-
ment responds to transparency within and across a variety of institutional
contexts. Citizens and leaders change their actions in response to new
information. Citizens are influenced by the framing of issues and messages
broadcast by mass media. The specific design of transparency interventions
matters—the nature and credibility of the information and media of com-
munication all matter.
   In contrast to the potentially transformative role of transparency when
targeted at improving the quality of political engagement, other evidence

                                                                                        23
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     on the impact of transparency initiatives outside the political realm sug-
                     gests that it is not enough. The impact of transparency initiatives targeted
                     at engaging citizens to take actions to improve service delivery really
                     depends upon political incentives. Taken together, the pattern of evidence
                     when transparency initiatives improve service delivery outcomes and
                     reduce corruption, and when they do not, points to the important role of
                     healthy political engagement.

                     The final part of the report (chapter 7) discusses the implications
                     of the report’s findings for policy actors. In doing so, it confronts the
                     dilemma discussed above: too often those with the power to pursue poli-
                     cies that are good for development are constrained from doing so because
                     of politics, and the same constraints may prevent actions to strengthen
                     transparency and citizen engagement.
                         The bulk of development work occurs in imperfect governance environ-
                     ments where things need to get done and get done quickly. Still, development
                     practitioners may not want to discount political economy analysis as a luxury
                     or a distraction because politics has profound consequences for economic
                     development. They may also not want to treat political constraints only as
                     something to navigate using stealth and cunning. Treating perverse political
                     incentives solely as fixed constraints that have to be navigated rather than
                     relaxed may lead to second-best solutions that are not solutions at all, doing
                     little to tackle the fundamental problems of development. The alternative
                     approach recommended here on the basis of research on the emergent forces
                     of transparency and political engagement is to find ways to tackle political
                     constraints head on, harnessing these forces to relax the constraints such
                     that “first-best” solutions are more likely to be sustainably implemented.
                     Policy actors can target transparency to nourish the growing forces of politi-
                     cal engagement and thereby complement other efforts to establish effective
                     public sector institutions that avert and solve government failures.



                     The report has assembled a jigsaw puzzle from dispersed pieces of research to
                     see what picture emerges and what the missing areas look like to understand
                     and fix government failures. The co-evolution of transparency and politi-
                     cal engagement in developing countries have implications for the design of
                     appropriate public institutions in these environments that are likely to be
                     distinct from the designs adopted by the rich world in its different develop-
                     ment trajectory.29 There are large areas of future work, building upon the

findings of this report, that are highlighted as the contours of the missing
pieces of the jigsaw puzzle in the following chapters. The understanding of
the political behavior of citizens, frontline public officials, and leaders that is
offered in this report can be used to address government failures and build
public sector institutions that are capable of tackling public goods problems.
   Perhaps more important than offering ideas for specific policy action (which
may indeed not work in the face of insurmountable political problems), the
report aims to influence how development practitioners think about politics.
Practitioners may then be able to make greater contributions to incremental
change by more effectively using the levers available to them to overcome
political impediments. This approach includes not just getting governments
to adopt good policies, but designing implementation arrangements that are
more likely to succeed, based on a better understanding of political incentives
and behavioral norms in the public sector. The hope in preparing this report is
that it will invite future debate and policy experiments by applying the lessons
here to make politics work for development rather than against it.

                          ipaidabribe.com initiative that is championed by business leaders in India.
                     18. Chapter 6 provides an extensive discussion of this evidence.
                     19. Chapter 6 draws these conclusions about the importance of the design of
                          transparency by making connections across dispersed pieces of evidence.
                     20. The role of mass media in enabling coordination is examined by Yanagizawa-
                           Drott (2014), albeit for the tragic outcomes of the Rwandan genocide.
                     21. See chapter 6 for a more in-depth discussion.
                     22.  Grandvoinnet, Aslam, and Raha (2015) review the evidence and conclude
                           that political context matters.
                     23.  Burgess et al. (2012) show how local rent-seeking by public officials and
                           politicians is substitutable across different activities.
                     24.  Rodrik (2000, 3) writes: “Democracy is a meta-institution for building good
                           institutions.” Baland, Moene, and Robinson (2010, 1) write: “Understanding

     how to improve governance necessitates understanding the nature of the
     entire political equilibrium.”
25. Nunn (2014) provides a review of a large and growing literature on the per-
     sistent effects of historical institutions.
26. Beaman, Chattopadhyay, et al. (2009) and Beaman, Duflo, et al. (2012)
     provide evidence on how female leaders shift social norms related to gender.
27. A body of research examining regional differences in governance within Italy
     has attributed the presence of greater social capital and of public interest or
     “civic” voting to earlier experience with participatory democracy (Alesina and
     Giuliano 2015; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2006; Nannicini et al. 2013;
     Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti 1993).
28. Rajan and Zingales (2003) make a similar argument about the role of open-
     ness to trade in promoting good policies in financial markets. They write:
     “Why, according to us, is openness beneficial? The answer is blindingly
     simple. Openness creates competition from outsiders—outsiders that
     incumbents cannot control through political means” (Rajan and Zingales
     2003, 307).
29. A 2010 study published by the Institute of Development Studies, “An Upside-
     down View of Governance,” made the argument that it is important to
     understand local political dynamics in the worlds in which poor people live as
     a first step to thinking about how institutions different from the institutions
     in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development might be
     needed in these contexts.

CHAPTER ONE




Governance


Overview
This report is about understanding and fixing government failures to
provide the public goods needed for economic development. Governments
play a unique role in economic development by providing the institutions
that support competitive markets and by addressing those areas where
markets fail. Governments also have unique powers for redistribution
to complement other market-supporting policies to eradicate poverty
and promote shared prosperity. Taken together, the government’s role is
paraphrased in the report as providing the public goods that it is uniquely
positioned to provide. Governance is thus the process of pursuing policies
to deliver public goods, using (and debating) the best available techni-
cal evidence for this purpose. Governments fail to provide public goods
when leaders knowingly and deliberately ignore sound technical advice
and adopt and implement policies that they know are costly, despite
the availability of alternative policies that are likely to yield improved
outcomes.1
   One example of government failure that has been widely studied and
measured consists of malfeasance and mismanagement within public
bureaucracies and by political leaders. Examples include: corruption; weak
management practices that condone frequent absenteeism among public
sector workers; nepotism in the recruitment and career advancement of
public sector workers; and crony capitalism, whereby politically connected
firms receive privileged treatment by public regulators.
   Proximate factors behind widespread corruption in poor countries are
the lower capacity of governments to monitor public officials, enforce
rules, and design contracts that strengthen the economic incentives of

                                                                              33

                     public officials to refrain from corruption. Significant evidence, how-
                     ever, suggests that systemic and persistent corruption has its roots in the
                     actions of powerful leaders to extract rents from the state and deliberately
                     weaken internal checks and balances. Even when leaders change and are
                     replaced by well-intentioned reformers, the reformers can face the chal-
                     lenge of pervasive rent-seeking throughout the public sector that is sug-
                     gestive of entrenched norms of political behavior to extract private benefits
                     from public resources. Political norms are examined in this report as a
                     subset of social norms, pertaining to the behavior of citizens and public
                     officials specifically in the public sphere of governments. “Ordinary”
                     citizens who hold no public office can be a part of government failure
                     when they disregard the law and resort to bribery to avoid public interest
                     regulations.
                        Corruption is not the only government failure. Even when govern-
                     ment agencies are accountable for their actions, governance problems can
                     originate from among citizens in the form of what they choose to demand
                     and for what they hold government accountable. Citizens can be divided
                     by ideological beliefs, leading to political polarization and policy gridlock.
                     Ideological beliefs among citizens about specific public policies, such as
                     energy subsidies or immigration, can be difficult to shift with technical
                     evidence on the costs and benefits of different policy options. Similarly,
                     distributive conflict among citizens, which leads special interest groups to
                     mobilize to extract private benefits from public policies, frequently comes
                     at the expense of the broader public interest.
                        Distributive conflict among, and inefficient demands from citizens,
                     can lead to the selection of leaders who further polarize people and nur-
                     ture ideological constituencies rather than exert effort to find common
                     ground to address shared problems. These issues can also prevent reform
                     leaders from pursuing appropriate public policies. Furthermore, this class
                     of government failure is relevant for rich as well as for poor countries, and
                     in weak as well as in stronger institutional environments, where inter-
                     nal checks and balances are more effective in controlling corruption in
                     government.
                        The next section of this chapter examines trends in corruption, one
                     of the most widely studied government failures, and provides examples
                     that show how persistent corruption can be rooted in adverse political
                     incentives and perverse behavioral norms. The following section provides
                     examples of how ideological beliefs and distributive conflict among citizens
                     can be sources of government failures as well.

Trends in corruption
The vast majority of poor people live in countries with persistently
low indicators of the control of corruption. A widely used measure in
this regard is the Control of Corruption indicator of the World Bank’s
Worldwide Governance Indicators. The Control of Corruption measure
“captures perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for
private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well
as ‘capture’ of the state by elites and private interests.”2 Figure 1.1 shows
that nearly all of the world’s poor people live in countries that are almost
unanimously ranked in the bottom half of the indices of the control of
corruption.
   Not only is the control of corruption low in most developing countries,
but it is persistently low. Figure 1.2 shows that most countries where poor
people live have similar measures of corruption in 2013 as they did in 1996,
the earliest and latest years for which these data are available.

                     Note: WGI data have been rescaled such that the lowest value of 0 (zero) corresponds to lowest control
                     of corruption. The line represents the 45-degree line, where y = x. PPP = purchasing power parity.


                        Research on corruption has generally concluded that it has pernicious
                     consequences for both the efficiency with which resources are allocated and
                     for equity (Mauro 1995; Olken and Pande 2012). To highlight a few exam-
                     ples from this large literature, Fisman and Svensson (2007) find that bribes
                     pose a greater cost to firms than an equivalent amount in taxes. Using firm-
                     level data from Uganda, they find that the effect of an increase in bribery on
                     reducing firm growth is three times greater than the impact of an equivalent
                     amount of taxes. Meanwhile, Hunt (2007) shows that in Peru, victims of
                     misfortune rely more on public services and, in turn, are more likely than
                     nonvictims to need to bribe public officials. The poor do not spend a higher
                     proportion of their income on bribes, but rather public services can fail them
                     when they need it most and they can only access it through corruption.


                     Corruption in politics
                     Systemic and persistent corruption has its roots in the actions of power-
                     ful leaders to deliberately weaken internal institutions of control within

government. A striking illustration of this comes from the detailed records
of bribe payments to politicians, judges, and news media maintained
by Vladimiro Montesinos, the head of Peru’s Intelligence Service under
President Alberto Fujimori (McMillan and Zoido 2004). The average
monthly amount of bribes going to politicians was US$300,000, to judges
US$250,000, and to television channels US$3 million. Bribes tended to be
higher if the politician was part of the opposition and lower if the politician
was from Fujimori’s party. The television channel with the largest viewer-
ship received US$1.5 million monthly.
   Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer (GCB)
shows the extent of perceived corruption in politics. GCB is based on
household surveys of more than 114,000 individuals. Patterns from
the GCB in figures 1.3 and 1.4, below, reveal higher reports of corrup-
tion in political parties and the police, an instrument of the domestic
coercive power of the state, compared with other institutions. The
other institutions for which survey information was gathered include

                     business/private sector, education system, and medical/health. The
                     results, therefore, show that citizens systematically report greater cor-
                     ruption in political parties and the police than in other institutions.
                     They suggest that corruption pervades the institutions through which
                     leaders gain public office and wield power within government.


                     Political connections and corruption
                     Research provides evidence that political connections are used by economic
                     agents to gain an advantage over competitors in countries with weak con-
                     trol of corruption. Faccio (2006) examines 20,202 publicly traded firms in
                     47 countries and finds that politically connected firms are more common
                     in countries with high corruption. Moreover, political connections are
                     significantly associated with a higher share value of firms in countries with

high corruption: having a member of a firm’s board or a large shareholder
become a politician is associated with an increase in the firm’s stock value
of 4.43 percent. In contrast, there is no significant association of firm value
with political connections in countries with low corruption.
   These cross-country findings are bolstered by within-country research.
In Indonesia, Fisman (2001) finds that the value of firms depends on the
degree of their political connectedness. Following rumors of President
Suharto’s worsening health during 1995–97, the stock price of politically
connected firms fell more than that of less connected firms. Another
contrast, similar to the results in Faccio (2006) of political connections in
weak versus strong institutional environments comes from Fisman et al.’s
(2012) replication of the methodology used in Indonesia to estimate the
value of political connections in the United States to former U.S. Vice
President Dick Cheney. In contrast to political connections to President
Suharto, they find no effect of connections to Vice President Cheney.
Companies with personal connections to Vice President Cheney are unaf-
fected by events that would be expected to affect Vice President Cheney’s
capacity to give companies preferential treatment. The authors conclude
that strong institutions in the United States are effective in reining in rent-
seeking through connections to high-level politicians.
   Meanwhile, in Pakistan, Khwaja and Mian (2005) consider data on
firms’ borrowing from banks between 1996 and 2002, and find that
politically connected firms, defined as those having a politician on the
firm’s board, borrow 45 percent more and have a 50 percent higher default
rate. The effects are greater depending on whether the political party to
which the firm is connected is in power. Rijkers, Freund, and Nucifora
(2014) provide evidence from firm-level data in Tunisia that suggests
that Tunisia’s industrial policy was used as a vehicle for rent creation for
President Ben Ali and his family. Diwan, Keefer, and Schiffbauer (2015)
provide evidence from the Arab Republic of Egypt that entry by politically
connected firms slows aggregate employment growth and skews the distri-
bution of employment toward less productive, smaller firms.
   Connections are also important at the local level. Political connections
to local leaders are associated with greater absenteeism among frontline
public service providers and lower motivation on the job. Callen et al.
(2014) provide systematic evidence that politically connected doctors in
Pakistan are more likely to be absent from public health clinics. They also
find that about 40 percent of inspectors and health administrators report
political interference when they try to sanction errant doctors.

                                                                                          39
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        La Forgia et al. (2014) provide case studies from India of a thriving
                     “parallel system” for human resources management in the public health
                     sector that is based on political connections and bribes, rather than on
                     formal rules. Through connections and bribes, doctors are able to obtain
                     the public clinic posts they desire, regardless of their performance on the
                     job. Linking this study to another by Das et al. (2015) on the performance
                     of public sector doctors in India suggests that this parallel system results
                     in rampant underperformance. Das et al. (2015) show that doctors in the
                     public sector in India perform significantly worse, not only compared with
                     their counterparts in the private sector, but also when they provide services
                     through public clinics rather than in their private practices. Furthermore,
                     although provider effort and prices charged in the private sector are
                     strongly and positively correlated, there is no correlation between effort
                     and wages in the public sector.
                        Detailed case studies suggest that in environments with widespread
                     rent-seeking, all types of officials in the public sector, ranging from the
                     humble administrator and local political leader at the street level (Lipsky
                     1980) up to powerful politicians at the regional or national levels, can gear
                     their discretion, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship toward finding ways to
                     circumvent internal controls rather than solving problems in the public
                     interest.
                        The point is illustrated in a quote provided by Zimmerman (2014),
                     which is attributed to an official in the Anti-Corruption Bureau in Malawi
                     who is discussing local corruption in the implementation of national
                     programs:

                         In the early years of the fertilizer subsidy programme, politicians
                         would take the fertilizer bags at distributions in the presence of
                         the people. This was discovered and there was outrage, so then
                         fertilizer started to go missing on the journey to distributions.
                         This was discovered and there was more outrage, so then benefi-
                         ciaries who did not exist received fertilizer for a time, until this
                         was also discovered and there was more outrage once again. Lately,
                         the fertilizer is distributed to real beneficiaries during real distri-
                         butions, but in advance the bags of fertilizer have been opened
                         and diluted with sand. Some officials, seeing the anger over the
                         subsidy program, have stopped their corruption there and have
                         begun corruption in areas that do not anger the people, such as
                         manipulating district bank accounts.

In India, Aiyar and Mehta (2015) provide examples of how local political
leaders circumvent internal controls in India’s flagship antipoverty pro-
gram, established by the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act. The authors study the functioning of social audits in India,
a recent institutional arrangement aimed at checking local rent-seeking
by engaging citizens to directly monitor public spending. Their field
work was conducted in Andhra Pradesh, a state that has been lauded for
systematically investing in social audits. Aiyar and Mehta (2015) provide
examples of politicians extracting large rents from this antipoverty scheme
by circumventing the social audit altogether. Connections between local
political elites are forged and maintained for the purpose of big-ticket theft
from state funds that social audits cannot uncover.


Culture of corruption
Other evidence shows just how widespread is the practice of bribing public
officials and, in that sense, the norm of behavior in the public sector in
environments with high corruption. Bribe payments to public officials
occur in all manner of transactions in which citizens interact with the state
in poor countries, either as users of services or as owners and employers of
businesses. Such interactions follow the economic dynamics of competitive
markets for bribery. In a detailed empirical study of bribes paid by truck
drivers in Indonesia to police and military officials to avoid harassment
at checkpoints and to weigh station attendants to avoid fines for driving
overweight, Olken and Barron (2009) find that the demand for illegal pay-
ments by officials adheres to standard economic models of pricing behavior.
   Similarly, another study in Indonesia by Burgess et al. (2012) on the
incentives of local public officials and politicians to enforce forest policy
and prevent illegal logging finds evidence consistent with economic models
of how officials will behave to allow deforestation, presumably in exchange
for bribes. When a province is subdivided and a new district is created,
greater competition among the newly created jurisdictions drives down
the price for wood and increases the overall rate of deforestation in the
province. Illegal logging also increases substantially in the years leading
up to local elections. In a similar vein, Fan, Lin, and Treisman (2009) find
that firms’ reports of bribe payments to public officials are more frequent
in countries with more administrative tiers of government.
   The above evidence (such as in Olken and Barron [2009]) shows that
the behavior of public officials is sensitive to incentives, such that there

                                                                                         41

                     is little reason to believe in a “culture of corruption” that is rooted in
                     mindsets and mental models that are impervious to rational incentives
                     and hard to change. The evidence is also consistent with another view
                     of a culture of corruption that stems from rational beliefs about how
                     others are behaving and about the probability of detection and punish-
                     ment in environments with widespread corruption and scarce resources
                     to combat it. This analysis follows one element in the definition of
                     “culture” in Alesina and Giuliano (forthcoming) and Greif (1994) as
                     beliefs about the consequences of one’s actions that are based on expec-
                     tations of actions others will take.3 This view suggests that a culture
                     of corruption may not be as slow to change as other aspects of cultural
                     beliefs and values, such as those derived from religion or inherited social
                     norms. Instead, it may be more sensitive to experience and information
                     in updating beliefs.
                         Fisman and Miguel (2007) provide evidence that both cultural norms
                     and short-term changes in incentives in response to legal enforcement
                     are important determinants of corrupt behavior. They find that foreign
                     diplomats posted in New York City who come from countries with higher
                     measures of corruption accumulated significantly more unpaid parking
                     violations compared with their peers from better-governed countries.
                     This finding suggests that the elite from countries with more widespread
                     corruption have a greater proclivity to corruption than other elites in the
                     same situation. However, they also find that the apparent norm of cor-
                     ruption among foreign diplomats was quickly overcome when the laws
                     were changed to allow parking enforcement authorities to confiscate the
                     diplomatic license plates of violators.
                         The quick and large impact of a change in enforcement laws observed
                     by Fisman and Miguel (2007) was presumably facilitated by already-­
                     functioning, strong institutions of enforcement in New York City. The
                     challenge for countries with weak institutions, and low capacity and
                     resources for monitoring and enforcement to begin with, is how to leverage
                     these scarce resources to tackle widespread corruption.
                         If prevailing incentives shape corruption, then policy initiatives can be
                     designed to reshape those incentives to combat corruption. However, when
                     corruption is the norm, efforts to control it through different approaches
                     to monitoring and enforcement can be more challenging than when cor-
                     ruption is an aberration. Lui (1986) develops a multiple equilibrium model
                     showing that when corruption is widespread, it is costly to reduce and diffi-
                     cult to detect and so the economy will remain highly corrupt. Tirole (1996)

models how corruption may persist over generations. He models individual
reputations as the aggregate of collective reputations and individuals’ cur-
rent incentives as shaped by the behavior of previous generations. The
persistence of corruption among bureaucrats, for example, might reflect a
corrupt reputation of previous generations and the lack of incentives to act
honestly if enough bureaucrats are corrupt.4
   Other evidence suggests that individuals with a higher proclivity to
corruption might self-select into the public sector for rent-seeking motives.
Hanna and Wang (2013) show that students in India who cheat on a
simple task in a lab experiment are more likely to have a preference for
public sector jobs. They also find that cheating on the task predicts actual
corruption by government officials, consistent with the task capturing a
meaningful predilection for corruption. Selection of individuals into the
public sector for rent-seeking motives, or turning to corruption while in
office because of the incentives and the perceived behavioral norms among
colleagues, can lead to the persistence of corruption.


Citizens’ attitudes to corruption
Behavioral norms to extract private benefits from public resources extend
to “ordinary” citizens who hold no public office. The examples from the
research discussed above not only show widespread demand for bribes
among public officials but also that citizens supply bribes precisely for the
purpose of deriving private rents at the expense of the greater public inter-
est. Overweight trucks, as in the study by Olken and Barron (2009), dam-
age public infrastructure, but truck drivers have incentives to bribe weigh
station attendants to avoid regulations on weight. Greater deforestation
has been associated with environmental and health problems (for example,
Garg 2014), but owners of logging companies bribe local officials to get
away with illegal logging (Burgess et al. 2012).
   “Free-riding” among citizens can lead to lower contributions to the
public good of monitoring and sanctioning public officials who engage
in corruption. Few people are likely to take the costly actions needed to
monitor and sanction public officials, or to desist from colluding with
rent-seeking officials (as in the examples of overweight trucks and illegal
deforestation), especially when they believe that others are unlikely to
join them. As evidence of the free-riding problem, research has found a
significant difference in citizen monitoring of different types of corrup-
tion depending on whether the monitoring would yield immediate private

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     benefits versus more broadly shared benefits. Olken (2007) finds that
                     community members in Indonesia are more likely to monitor and demand
                     accurate wage payments from local officials who manage workfare projects,
                     the benefits from which they receive individually. In contrast, community
                     members are less likely to engage in local collective action along with oth-
                     ers to reduce leakage in project materials costs whose benefits would accrue
                     to the whole community.
                        Similarly, free-riding problems among citizens in monitoring and sanc-
                     tioning public providers—for example, school teachers in India—appears
                     in the research of Banerjee et al. (2010). The authors find that, in response
                     to an information campaign about the poor quality of education provided
                     in the village public schools, community members were willing to under-
                     take private action, such as remedial instruction for their own children out-
                     side school, but not to take collective action to improve the performance
                     of the village public school.
                        Citizens’ behavior toward the public sector can contribute to govern-
                     ment failures. One example is the widespread theft of electricity from
                     public utilities, which leads to disruptions in electricity supply that
                     cripple economic investments (Depuru, Wang, and Devabhaktuni 2011).
                     Citizens describe such theft from the public sector in particular as justifi-
                     able, even though theft in general is considered wrong. Evidence of politi-
                     cal leaders manipulating the electricity supply to facilitate an increase in
                     theft at election times suggests that citizen behavior toward the state is
                     influenced by politics (Min 2015; Min and Golden 2014). Corruption
                     and poor service delivery can diminish the legitimacy of the state and
                     lead citizens to organize for violent conflict (World Bank 2011). Such
                     disregard for state institutions and laws reflects weak norms for coopera-
                     tive behavior in the public sphere, which can keep societies trapped in
                     a situation of persistent corruption and weak institutions (Basu 2015;
                     P. Dal Bó 2007).
                        Government failures arising from beliefs about how others are behav-
                     ing, rather than because of an inherited mindset or cultural values, can
                     also change rapidly when people see changes in how others are behav-
                     ing. A quote from an Egyptian student reflecting on people cleaning up
                     Tahrir Square illustrates this: “We thought people didn’t care and just
                     threw their garbage on the street, but now we see that they just thought
                     it was h­ opeless—why bother when it’s so dirty. Why not be corrupt when
                     everything is corrupted. But now things have changed, and it’s a different
                     mood overtaking. Even I can’t stop smiling myself.” (Steavenson 2011, 45).

Ideological beliefs and distributive conflict
among citizens
Political impediments to selecting and implementing technically sound
policies can arise even when governments are accountable to citizens and
corruption is rare. Citizens’ beliefs about public policies and demands for
specific policies without full regard for the costs they may entail can ham-
per the selection of public policies on the basis of technical merit.
   Different strands of research provide evidence on three channels. First,
ideological beliefs about appropriate public policies can be resistant to
technical evidence that is contrary to those prior beliefs. Second, lack of
information or limited cognitive capacity to process information about the
consequences of different policies can also lead to demand for inefficient
policies. Third, special interests and distributive conflict among differ-
ent groups of citizens can distort policies to benefit those who organize
to pursue their interests at the expense of the greater public good. Some
leaders can exploit these political beliefs and special interests to gain and
remain in office by dividing citizens and polarizing constituencies rather
than building common cause for public goods.
   One policy area that serves to illustrate these points is that of energy or
fuel subsidies. Technical evidence and wide agreement among experts indi-
cates that fuel subsidies are inefficient and entail fiscal and environmental
costs with little justification on equity grounds (Clements et al. 2013). Fuel
subsidies in the developing world are highly regressive (Arze del Granado,
Coady, and Gillingham 2012). In India, estimates suggest that the richest
10 percent of households receive seven times more in benefits from sub-
sidies than the poorest 10 percent (Anand et al. 2013). A common view
of the regressive incidence of energy subsidies is that costly fuel subsidies
are a form of elite capture. A typical strategy used to win political support
for reforms is to replace energy subsidies with cash transfers to the poor.5
The underlying rationale is that, if people realize that the lion’s share of
subsidies accrues to the elite, they will punish political leaders who allocate
public resources to these subsidies and reward them for allocating means-
tested cash transfers to the poor.
   However, if subsidies are popular because of ideological beliefs that they
are “pro-poor,” that governments should pursue price controls in addition
to providing cash transfers to the poor, then even seeming reforms that
curtail some subsidies may be transient and ineffective. When a price
shock hits, people will be out on the streets again asking for subsidies or an

                                                                                          45

                     increase in the cash transfer to compensate for the price increase (Clements
                     et al. 2013). Little evidence is available to determine whether costly subsidy
                     policies are sustained due to capture by elites or organized special interests,
                     due to informational and cognitive constraints among citizens to recognize
                     the costs of these policies or due to ideological beliefs about the value of
                     such policies. However, some evidence from the United States on citizen
                     attitudes toward combating climate change with energy policies suggests
                     that the latter two explanations are likely to be a significant part of the
                     story for why it is difficult to reform energy subsidies.
                         Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Eyster (2013) and Sunstein (2007) provide evi-
                     dence from laboratory experiments in the United States suggesting that
                     citizens are cognitively constrained to demand policies that confer short-
                     term benefits at the expense of long-term or “equilibrium” costs. That is,
                     citizens fail to internalize the full impact of the demand for a particular
                     policy.
                         A related but different argument is proposed by Kahan (2012) and
                     Kahan, Jenkins-Smith, and Braman (2011). Also using laboratory experi-
                     ments in the United States, these authors show that those who score highest
                     on cognitive abilities are also the most likely to adopt ideological beliefs in
                     defiance of technical evidence. The authors explain this as “motivated rea-
                     soning” that is adopted by people to conform to the values of the cultural
                     groups to which they belong. Their findings suggest that public divisions
                     over climate change are not a reflection of the public’s lack of knowledge
                     or misunderstanding of science; rather, divisions stem from conflicting
                     interests—between an individual’s interests in adopting common beliefs
                     held by one’s community versus a collective interest in making decisions
                     to promote common welfare. Holding a viewpoint that goes against one’s
                     surrounding cultural community can exact a cost. When this cost is high,
                     it is rational for individuals to adopt the reasoning prevailing in the group.
                         Together, this work substantiates the role of beliefs and behavioral
                     norms in shaping citizens’ demands for public policies. They differ in their
                     view of the extent to which citizens’ resistance to technical evidence is
                     caused by cognitive constraints. Kahan (2012) and Kahan, Jenkins-Smith,
                     and Braman (2011) highlight the importance of cultural norms instead of
                     cognitive constraints, arguing that citizens engage in motivated reason-
                     ing to conform an assessment of available facts to the beliefs of the social
                     groups to which they belong.
                         This research from the United States on citizens’ beliefs and attitudes
                     toward public policies suggests that rigorous scientific methods need to be

                                                                                GOVERNANCE



applied to develop an understanding of the sources of political impedi-
ments rather than assuming a “common sense” understanding of it. It
also has implications for communicating technical evidence to people,
highlighting the issues of social and ideological divisions and resistance to
such evidence even among educated citizens. Scientific rigor is also needed
to understand how communication can be persuasive and shift beliefs.
That is, simply providing information assuming that it will address an
information asymmetry will not work if the problem is rooted in beliefs
and behavioral norms. The following chapters of this report are aimed at
reviewing available research on how transparency and political engage-
ment, and the leaders selected through it, play a role in shifting beliefs.
   In addition to holding ideological beliefs and the existence of cognitive
capacity constraints, special interest groups and elite capture are the third
channel through which citizens’ behavior poses political impediments to
the adoption of sound public policies. The theory and evidence on special
interest groups shows how citizens can organize to distort policies away
from the broad public interest and toward conferring narrow benefits to
group members (Grossman and Helpman 2001). This work focuses on
environments with strong institutional constraints such as in the United
States, showing that political impediments can arise from among citizens
even when accountability institutions function well. Gilens and Page
(2014) provide evidence to suggest that economic elites and organized
groups representing business interests substantially influence U.S. govern-
ment policy. In their seminal work in the developing world, Bardhan and
Mookherjee (2000) model elite capture similarly to the modeling of special
interests in the U.S. literature.
   A related strand of research provides evidence on how ideological
commitment to political parties can yield policy gridlock due to politi-
cal polarization in rich countries (Glaeser and Sunstein 2013). Although
well-functioning political parties, organized around policy programs, can
solve some collective action problems (Keefer and Vlaicu 2007), they can
contribute to other problems that arise from the ideological preferences of
voters. In addition to policy gridlock in advanced institutional contexts,
partisan preferences can facilitate corruption and rent-seeking in weak
institutional environments (Bardhan and Mookherjee 2010).
   Bardhan and Mookherjee (2010) find evidence suggesting that politi-
cal parties can use partisan attachment among voters to pursue rents and
reduce effort rather than to deliver the policies that their party espouses.
The authors use data on a sample of villages spanning 1974–98 to

                                                                                        47
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     investigate the political determinants of land reform implementation in
                     the Indian state of West Bengal. A relatively well-organized and program-
                     matic party used to dominate the political arena in West Bengal during
                     this period—the Communist Party of India (Marxist) with a strong politi-
                     cal commitment to land reform. The authors find that the relationship
                     between the party’s control of local governments and implementation of
                     land reform is consistent with both reelection concerns and rent-seeking.
                     Villages with more closely contested elections experience more land
                     reform. However, once the party gains a majority, land reform decreases
                     despite the party’s commitment to it.
                        Redistributive conflict among groups of citizens who are divided along
                     different cleavages, such as ethnic identity, is a related source of impedi-
                     ments to policies for public goods. Ethnic divisions are regarded by some
                     scholars as central to the explanation of why some regions of the world are
                     rich and others are persistently poor (Ashraf and Galor 2013). Substantial
                     evidence exists of an association between ethnic fragmentation and
                     low investment in public goods (Habyarimana et al. 2009; Miguel and
                     Gugerty 2005).
                        Alesina, Michalopoulos, and Papaioannou (forthcoming) find that it
                     is not ethnic fragmentation per se that matters in explaining variations in
                     economic development, but rather its interaction with economic inequal-
                     ity. Economic inequality between ethnic groups, largely arising from
                     differences in geographic endowments across their historic homelands, is
                     associated with lower real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The
                     typical measure of ethno-linguistic fragmentation used in the literature
                     loses its significance when the authors’ measure of economic inequality
                     between ethnic groups is included. This result is consistent with the view
                     that redistributive conflict between groups can contribute to political
                     failures to select and implement appropriate public policies that promote
                     economic development.
                        Banerjee and Pande (2007) provide micro evidence in support of the
                     hypothesis that redistributive conflict among citizens contributes to lead-
                     ers’ weak political incentives to provide public goods. They document that,
                     in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, political parties are organized to
                     appeal to caste identity and regularly field candidates against whom there
                     are allegations of corruption and criminality. The authors explain this
                     through a model in which greater corruption arises in ethnic parties
                     because citizens value honesty in political leaders less than reliable redis-
                     tribution based on shared ethnic identity. At the same time, in other work

                                                                                       GOVERNANCE



these authors show that voter preferences regarding ethnic identity are
malleable and responsive to information about the severity of allegations
of transgression (Banerjee et al. 2009; Banerjee et al. 2014).
   As the evidence grows on both ethnic politics in the developing world
and ideological politics in the rich world, it appears that both types of
divisions play a similar role of stoking conflict among citizens over the dis-
tribution of public resources, which undermines the use of these resources
in addressing shared problems of public goods.


This chapter has set the stage by describing government failures that affect
countries around the world and the need to solve these so that public sector
institutions are capable of tackling problems of public goods. Incentives
and behavioral norms among political leaders, public officials, frontline
public service providers, and citizens alike can contribute to government
failure. Persistent and widespread corruption in developing countries is
consistent with a culture of corruption based on rational beliefs about
how others are behaving in the public sector. Corruption is not the only
government failure. Ideological beliefs about public policies and distribu-
tive conflict among citizens over the allocation of public resources also
contribute to government failure. These problems are shared by rich and
poor countries, and those with strong and weak institutions to control
malfeasance and mismanagement within government.
   The objective of the report is to examine how these government failures
can be overcome by harnessing two forces that are spreading around the
world: citizen engagement and transparency in political processes. The
next two chapters examine these trends.

   to do to tackle new problems as they emerge. Such mistakes, uncertainties, or
   technical debates about appropriate public policies are not part of how govern-
   ment failure is defined in this report. Government failure is defined on the
   basis of purpose, intent, and incentives of leaders to not pursue public policies
   in the public interest. In chapter 4, the conceptual framework of the report
   reviews the economic theory supporting this view of government failure.

                         overlaps with what others have described as “informal institutions.” They also
                         discuss the links between the view of culture as a set of rational beliefs with
                         the view of “mental constructs” that generate different beliefs and can persist
                         over time (Benabou 2008).
                     4. The evidence shows that even in environments with widespread corruption,
                         when policy initiatives provide credible incentives, monitoring, and enforce-
                         ment, corruption is reduced (for example, Di Tella and Schargrodsky [2003];
                         Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar [2014]). The discussion in this
                         section is not intended to underestimate the role of technologies that reduce
                         opportunities for corruption or of investments in monitoring and enforce-
                         ment. It is aimed at including the concepts of how beliefs and behavioral
                         norms might matter as well. This discussion is important for exploring how
                         other policy areas aimed at strengthening political incentives and changing
                         political beliefs and behavioral norms can complement technological solutions
                         to governance problems and increase the likelihood of take-up.

Political Engagement


Overview
The role of citizens in influencing governance is the central theme of
this report. Citizen engagement in government comes in many varieties,
including non-political ways in which citizens can participate in service
delivery, provide inputs and feedback at the invitation of government
officials, and play a role in monitoring the performance of government
agencies. This report emphasizes the crucial role of citizens’ political
engagement, distinguishing it from other non-political forms of citizen
engagement.
   Political engagement is the participation of citizens in selecting and
sanctioning the leaders who wield power in government, including by
entering themselves as contenders for leadership. Political engagement
includes citizen actions as voters, as actual and potential challengers for
leadership positions in government, and in organized groups that pressure
elected politicians and appointed public officials through civil society
action and public protests.
   The leaders who are selected through political engagement, in turn, del-
egate to public officials and frontline providers the many tasks of delivering
public goods and services. These leaders also choose policies for citizen
engagement in the business of government.
   Some forms engage citizens as “co-producers” of public goods, such as
by managing and allocating budgets and delivering services, while other
forms try to make public officials and frontline providers more account-
able for good performance by engaging citizens to monitor their delivery of
public goods. The assumption is that, even without formal powers to select
and sanction officials, citizens will be able to exact accountability through

                                                                                 55
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     social pressure. Reviews of research on the impact of social accountability
                     initiatives conclude that their benefits are limited in the face of funda-
                     mental failures in the political process and low incentives for leaders to
                     respond to citizens (Grandvoinnet, Aslam, and Raha 2015; Mansuri and
                     Rao 2013). Effectiveness of social accountability initiatives will depend
                     on the incentives of leaders to take citizen monitoring, feedback, and
                     complaints seriously and use their formal powers over public officials to
                     ultimately hold them accountable. This point will be supported by the
                     research reviews contained in the latter chapters of this report.
                        This chapter presents evidence of growing trends in political engage-
                     ment across and within countries, through electoral institutions, public
                     protests, and civil society organizations.



                     Political engagement through elections
                     Political engagement happens in every institutional context, from democ-
                     racies to autocracies, albeit in different ways. A variety of formal political
                     institutions are found around the world that structure the degree to which
                     the power to select and sanction leaders is diffused across many citizens
                     acting as individual voters versus concentrated among elites or organized
                     groups such as political parties. Even when formal institutions restrict the
                     power of “ordinary” citizens, who hold no public office and are not orga-
                     nized into influential groups, research suggests that leaders are nevertheless
                     constrained by the informal powers of non-elite citizens to engage in pro-
                     tests or revolts. At the same time, formal electoral institutions have spread
                     across and within countries, expanding the power of individuals to select
                     and sanction leaders as voters. Citizen responses to public opinion surveys
                     provide evidence of citizens’ perceptions of and participation in elections.
                     Citizens, especially the poor and less educated, report active participation
                     in elections across a variety of institutional contexts. Even where electoral
                     violence and fraud, vote buying, and ethnic conflict are common, citizens
                     nevertheless express their beliefs that elections matter for beneficial change
                     and that through their vote, they can improve their lives.
                        Figure 2.1 plots the distribution of countries ranked by the Polity IV
                     measure of democracy, with higher values corresponding to greater space
                     for political engagement by citizens.1 During the past three and a half
                     decades, the overall distribution of political institutions across countries
                     has steadily shifted toward those that allow greater political engagement.

Source: Data from the Polity IV project. The Polity IV Score is a measure of state authority that is
widely used in research, varying on a 21-point scale ranging from −10 (which corresponds to hereditary
monarchy) to +10 (which corresponds to the Polity IV view of consolidated democracy). Higher values
­
are thus associated with more democratic institutions.




Although some individual countries have experienced reversals to more
autocratic institutions or have seen little change, the overall trend has been
toward greater opportunities for political engagement.
   Figure 2.2 shows that between 1980 and 2013, the fraction of
democratic countries measured by Polity IV doubled from 28 percent
to 56 percent and the fraction of autocratic countries declined from
54 percent to 12 percent.2 Another initiative that measures opportu-
nities for political engagement, Freedom House, provides indicators
that are consistent with the Polity IV trends. Rather than assessing the
characteristics of government institutions, as in the case of Polity IV,
Freedom House measures the freedoms enjoyed by individuals. Figure
2.2 also shows that the fraction of countries rated as “free” by Freedom
House increased over the same period from 31 percent to 46 percent,
while the fraction of “not free” countries declined from 37 percent to
26 percent.3
   Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show a clear trend toward greater space for political
engagement by citizens. However, scrutiny of recent years indicates that
such trends have plateaued with comparably negligible gains in recent

                     and civil liberties. During 2014, nearly twice as many countries saw down-
                     turns as gains in democratic indicators, a trend that was not confined to
                     any geographic area (Puddington 2015).


                     Self-reported voter turnout and interest in elections
                     Public opinion surveys—the World Values Survey, the Gallup World Poll, and
                     the Afrobarometer—provide evidence of citizens’ perceptions and participation
                     in elections. Citizens report active participation in elections across a variety of
                     institutional contexts (figure 2.3). More than 85 percent of all respondents in the
                     regions of Europe and Central Asia, Latin America, and in the Organisation for
                     Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), report voting in the most
                     recent election in their country. In the regions where most of the poorest people
                     live, Africa and South Asia, more than 70 percent of respondents report voting.
                     In these regions, citizens with less than a primary education, and therefore likely
                     to be relatively poor, are more likely to report voting. For example, citizens in
                     Africa with less than a primary education report voting 7 percentage points more
                     than others and in South Asia 10 percentage points more than others.
                         Self-reported voting rates need to be interpreted cautiously due to the
                     well-known problem that reported voting is likely to be greater than actual

voting. For example, although Afrobarometer survey data show that more
than 80 percent of Ugandans report voting in the February 2011 elections,
actual turnout reported by the election committee was slightly less than
60 percent. Yet, the pattern reported in figure 2.3 of less-educated citizens
voting at higher rates than more educated citizens in some of the poor
regions of the world is supported by other research evidence. Pande (2011)
estimates that in many developing countries, less-educated and income-
poor citizens tend to be more politically active than those with greater
education and income. In contrast, in developed countries, the richer and
more-educated citizens are clearly more politically active. Evidence also
suggests that in autocratic institutional environments, more-educated citi-
zens are likely to “deliberately disengage” from political processes because
they are more critical of the legitimacy and effectiveness of those processes
(Croke et al. 2015).

                        Surveys also reveal that citizens question the fairness and integrity of
                     elections. Figure 2.4 shows that according to Gallup, fewer than half of
                     respondents globally said they had confidence in the honesty of elections.
                     Interestingly, reported confidence was lowest in Europe and Central Asia,
                     yet that is the region with the highest reported level of participation in
                     elections.
                        Other evidence suggests that citizens in the developing world
                     experience widespread problems in political engagement. Responses
                     to several questions asked in Wave 6 (2010–14) of the World Values
                     Survey reveal a high degree of perceived incidence of violence, vote
                     buying, and electoral fraud in developing countries, in sharp contrast
                     to the lack of such problems reported in OECD countries. The four
                     panels in figure 2.5 show the global distribution of responses to the
                     following questions: “In your view, how often do the following things
                     occur in this country’s elections: Voters are bribed? Rich people buy
                     elections? Voters are threatened by violence at the polls? Votes are
                     counted fairly?”4
                        Panel a of figure 2.5 shows the extent to which respondents perceive
                     voters as being bribed in their countries. In countries in South Asia and

                     Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Consistent with the pattern of responses on
                     the voter-bribing question, respondents in the poorer regions of the world
                     are more likely to believe that the economic elites in their countries can
                     purchase election outcomes for their benefit (figure 2.5, panel b).
                         Panel c of figure 2.5 shows the prevalence of violence in elections in
                     the developing regions of the world, compared with the OECD countries.
                     Similarly, responses to the questions on whether the government agencies
                     responsible for the conduct of elections perform their functions to support
                     free and fair elections show a pronounced difference between the poor and
                     richer regions of the world (figure 2.5, panel d).
                         Experience with violence, electoral fraud, vote buying, and ethnic con-
                     flict in the developing world has prompted several investigative journalists
                     and commentators to question the value of elections in weakly governed
                     societies and the capacity of poor and uneducated voters to exercise their
                     franchise responsibly. Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005, 50) provide the follow-

                         reasonable health, democracy can be not only risky but disas-
                         trous.” Fareed Zakaria (2003, p. 98) points out that “although
                         democracy has in many ways opened up African politics and
                         brought people liberty, it has also produced a degree of chaos
                         and instability that has actually made corruption and lawlessness
                         worse in many countries.” Amy Chua (2002, p. 124) argues that:
                         ‘“... in the numerous countries around the world with a market-
                         dominant minority, adding democracy to markets has been a
                         recipe for instability, upheaval, and ethnic conflagration.”

                     In contrast to the above opinions among external observers of electoral
                     malpractice, citizens still tend to believe that elections matter for beneficial
                     change, that through their votes they can improve their lives. The two
                     panels of figure 2.6 show the share of individuals by region who described
                     elections as being very or rather important on a personal and national level,
                     respectively.
                        Similar patterns were obtained from two Afrobarometer surveys that
                     were undertaken in Uganda and Nigeria on the eve of their elections in
                     2011 and 2007, respectively. In these surveys, about 80 percent of respon-
                     dents in Uganda and 70 percent in Nigeria said that they believed the way
                     they voted could make things better (figure 2.7). Those respondents who

are just as likely as others to express the belief that the way they vote could
make things better.

                         Not only do Ugandan and Nigerian citizens report strong beliefs about
                     the importance of voting and vote at high rates, but they also express
                     interest in receiving information about elections. More than 80 percent
                     of respondents said they wanted a little more or a lot more information
                     ahead of the 2007 elections in Nigeria and the 2011 elections in Uganda
                     (figure 2.8). Again, those with less education and food insecurity are just

happening through the spread of elections at local levels of government,
widespread citizen participation in these elections as voters and as con-
tenders for leadership, and the rise of civil society organizations. Changes
in political engagement at the local level could potentially translate into
larger changes at the national level, with local levels serving as the training
ground for citizens to develop their political beliefs and political behavioral
norms (Giuliano and Nunn 2013). The local level can also serve to develop
a supply of good leaders who have built reputations for responsible manage-
ment of public resources (Myerson 2006, 2012).

                     national political institutions. During the past three decades, these three
                     countries have had dissimilar trajectories in institutional reform and political
                     change, as reflected in their respective Polity IV trends in figure 2.9. India has
                     maintained functioning representative democratic institutions, reflected in
                     its Polity score of 8 until 1995, and thereafter 9. Meanwhile, Indonesia rep-
                     resents a transitional case, having jumped from −7 to 8 in the time frame of
                     seven years following the end of President Suharto’s rule. Finally, Uganda has
                     seen comparatively smaller changes in measures of regime authority, shifting
                     upward from −7 to −1. Each of these country cases, therefore, ­       illustrates a
                     distinct regime at the national level—consistently strongly democratic (at
                     least as measured on Polity IV), rapidly transitional, and slow institutional
                     change out of weak democracy (again, as measured by Polity IV).
                         Despite such contrasting measures of institutional trends at the national
                     level, political engagement at the subnational level has been growing in all

three countries. In Indonesia and Uganda, for example, space for political
engagement has grown as the result of proliferation of new subnational
political units. And India has seen a marked increase in contending politi-
cal parties in state elections.


The case of India
Changes in political engagement within India appear to take the form of
more citizens engaging as contenders for leadership rather than greater par-
ticipation as voters. Figure 2.10 shows the rise of political parties in India
that contest elections at the state level. This trend is directly linked to a fall
in the number of political candidates who are registered as “independents,”
demonstrating increasing political organization of parties. Figure 2.10 also
shows that voter turnout has been relatively stable over time.
   At the same time, however, India exhibits substantial volatility in the
vote shares accruing to different political parties. Electoral volatility

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                                       in India is orders of magnitude higher than in any other country that
                                       experiences regular and contested elections (Nooruddin and Chhibber
                                       2008).
                                          All together, the patterns for India, the largest and poorest democracy
                                       in the developing world, suggest vigorous political competition resulting
                                       from political engagement by citizens. Citizens contribute to competition
                                       for leadership in government by engaging as critical voters who shift their
                                       votes across multiple political parties and as contesting candidates.


                                       The case of Indonesia
                                       Indonesia’s “big bang” decentralization in 2001 substantially increased the
                                       number of jurisdictions in which citizens can engage to select and sanction
                                       the leaders who manage those jurisdictions (table 2.1). The number of
                                       districts increased from 336 in 2001, to 477 in 2010 (Skoufias et al. 2014).

A significant element of decentralization was the introduction of regional
autonomy and the proliferation of local governments at the district level,
with the avowed intent of improving public service delivery and govern-
ment effectiveness.
    Beginning in 2001, local governments in Indonesia were able to lobby
the central government to split their districts. Pierskalla and Sacks (2014)
consider the underlying motivations behind this district proliferation.
More important than efficiency in public goods provision, Pierskalla and
Sacks (2014) argue that ethnic homogeneity is a chief reason for district
growth. Beyond ethnic considerations, this study also indicates that local
elites’ political capacity to lobby for new districts is an important deter-
minant of local government growth. These findings update research by
Fitrani, Hofman, and Kaiser (2005), who consider a similar question in a
more limited time period, 1999–2004. They identify three determinants
of district growth in Indonesia: geographic considerations, ethnic cluster-
ing, and relative size of government.
    The decentralization reforms in Indonesia included a provision requir-
ing members of the local legislature to be elected by popular vote rather
than be appointed. In 2005, parliamentary elections for district heads were
replaced by direct elections, known as pilkada.5
    Figure 2.11 panel a illustrates the striking fact that no district in the
first local election was uncontested, and, on average, four candidates
contested each district. Figure 2.11 panel b shows the distribution of the
share of votes received by the winner. The modal winning vote share was

                     roughly 40 percent, indicating that elections were competitive with few
                     overwhelming margins of victory.
                        The proliferation of local jurisdictions in which leaders can be elected is
                     significant because it provides space for citizens to engage not only as voters
                     but also as contenders for leadership. Competition at this level can serve as
                     an incubator for candidates at the national level. For example, Indonesian
                     President Joko Widodo served as mayor of Surakarta, a city of 520,000 in
                     Central Java Province, and then as governor of Jakarta, a city of more than
                     8 million, before becoming president of the country. President Widodo’s
                     trajectory from the local to the national level reflects this broadening of
                     the political arena.
                        Competition is a feature of elections in Indonesia at all levels.
                     Indonesia’s 2014 legislative elections occurred on a strikingly large
                     scale. Seats contested in the legislative elections, including the national,
                     provincial, and district levels, numbered 19,699, for which there were
                     235,637 candidates or, an average, nearly 12 contestants per seat. Some
                     6,608 candidates competed for 560 seats in the lower house of the
                     national assembly, again corresponding to roughly 12 contestants per
                     seat (Rachman 2014).


                     The case of Uganda
                     In Uganda, the rise of the National Resistance Movement in the 1980s
                     led to the implementation of decentralization reforms. Direct popular
                     elections were mandated at all levels of local government, and the Local
                     Government Act of 1997 increased the powers of local councils, such as
                     power over the recruitment and firing of local civil servants (Green 2010).
                     There are five tiers of local authority. The primary unit of local govern-
                     ment is the district council, which contains within its boundaries between
                     one and five second-tier county and municipal councils. These, in turn,
                     contain third-tier subcounty and town councils, which are subdivided into
                     fourth-tier parish councils. At the lowest, fifth-tier level of local govern-
                     ment are village (rural) or ward (urban) councils. Districts are responsible
                     for managing transfers from the central government and are able to impose
                     taxes and legislate bylaws. Following decentralization reforms, the number
                     of districts in Uganda increased from 39 in 1995, to 70 in 2005, to 112 in
                     2011 (figure 2.12).
                        As in Indonesia’s 2014 legislative elections, Uganda’s 2011 elections
                     saw the country’s largest number of electoral seats being contested:

375 members of parliament; 112 district chairpersons and their 2,817 dis-
trict councilors; 27 municipality or city division chairpersons and 3,586
councilors; and 1,327 subcounty, town, or municipal division chairpersons
and 20,524 councilors (Uganda Electoral Commission). The number of
electoral areas in Uganda increased markedly between 2001 and 2011.
For example, table 2.2 shows that the number of district chairpersons
doubled, while the number of directly elected district councilors increased
nearly 40 percent. Between Uganda’s 2006 and 2011 elections, an addi-
tional 14 counties and 9 municipalities were created, which became new
parliamentary constituencies. Figure 2.13 shows that there was an average
of 3.5 contenders for each position and only 21 district councilors ran
uncontested, out of 355 positions. Meanwhile, the average share of votes
won by the winning district councilor was 54 percent.

   The creation of new local governments and rising competition for legisla-
tive positions raise questions about the causes behind the formation of new
districts, which could influence the nature of electoral contestation in these
new jurisdictions. The spread of local direct elections does not guarantee a
commensurate increase in accountability or lowering of barriers to entry for
new leaders. In fact, decentralization of political and administrative authority
might increase capture of local government and raise barriers to entry if local
interest groups collude. The net impact of local government proliferation on
regional development and fragmentation is not evident (Mookherjee 2015).
   Similar to findings in Indonesia, Grossman and Lewis (2014) show
that counties in Uganda are more likely to secede and form a new district
when they are underrepresented in district committees that oversee the
allocation of intra-district resources. Moreover, in counties where the larg-
est ethnic group differs from that of the district, the county is more likely
to secede. From a national perspective, elevating a county to the level of a
district is associated with greater political support in that county for the
national ruling party. Green (2010) argues that as reforms have dried up
national-level channels of patronage, new districts have provided alternate
channels. For example, in the 2005 presidential election, the vote share in
favor of the national ruling party in newly created districts was 74 percent
in comparison with the national Ugandan average of 60 percent (Green
2010). These patterns in the data on district creation in Uganda are consis-
tent with the theoretical arguments in Khemani (2015) about how creation
of local political jurisdictions can enable leaders to maintain clientelist
relationships of vote buying and patronage. While the motivation behind
the spread of local electoral institutions might not be encouraging about
the prospects of healthy political competition, nevertheless, these three case
studies show that space has grown at the local level for citizens to engage
in political processes both as voters and as contenders for leadership. This
spread of electoral institutions at the local level provides a fertile context to
apply the lessons distilled in the following chapters of the report on lever-
aging transparency to improve the quality of local political engagement.



Political engagement by civil society
Political engagement happens not only through individual citizen’s actions
in elections alone, but also through the activities of organized groups
in civil society across different national political systems. For example,

                                                                                                      73
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     Ortiz et al. (2013) report that nonelectoral forms of political engagement
                     such as public protests are growing over time. In the social accountability lit-
                     erature, political engagement by civil society groups outside of elections has
                     been regarded as part of “social” accountability. 6 Civil society organizations
                     carry out a diverse repertoire of activities that seek to pressure public offi-
                     cials through, for example, participatory monitoring and feedback, public
                     complaint and grievance redress mechanisms, and participation in resource
                     allocation decisions (Fox 2014; Malena, Forster, and Singh 2004). 7 Social
                     accountability scholars have acknowledged, however, that there is little
                     substantive distinction from political engagement, as defined in this report,
                     when civil society activities are directed toward seeking accountability from
                     leaders who wield power in government. McGee and Gaventa (2011, 8), for
                     example, write, “The fact that these transparency and accountability ini-
                     tiatives are ‘social’ and ‘citizen-led’ rather than political or bureaucratic in
                     nature should not eclipse the deeply political nature of the stakes.” Claasen
                     and Alpín-Lardiés state that social accountability “is about how citizens
                     demand and enforce accountability from those in power” (2010, 3).
                         There are few sources of reliable data available to examine growth in
                     citizen organizations. Part of the data gathering challenge lies in how citizen
                     organizations are defined. An extensive literature in sociology makes a dis-
                     tinction between “civil society organizations” and “nongovernmental orga-
                     nizations” (CSOs and NGOs), with NGOs being typically associated with
                     foreign-aid financed delivery of services and development programs (Lewis
                     and Kanji 2007; Mercer 2002; Pearce 2000). While NGOs may be engaged
                     first and foremost for the purpose of service delivery, under contract with
                     international donors and government ministries, they can be a latent force
                     for political engagement should they choose to extend their organizational
                     capabilities to making demands upon and sanction leaders in government.
                         The United Nations (UN) provides data on the number of organiza-
                     tions that are registered with their national governments as NGOs, and
                     as having an official headquarters, a democratically adopted constitution,
                     and a transparent accounting system. These organizations have official
                     consultative status with the UN. The UN data show a steady rise of these
                     NGOs with consultative status, from 1,226 in 1996, to 4,045 in 2014
                     (figure 2.14). The numbers appear to be conservative compared with other
                     estimates of the numbers of CSOs operating in countries, but without
                     official status with the UN. According to data on CSOs compiled by the
                     Quality of Government (QOG) initiative at the University of Gothenburg,
                     Africa has 5,811, Latin America 3,504, South Asia 2,281, and East Asia

1,516 CSOs, as of 2014.8 However, the QOG data are only available for a
cross-section of countries rather than over time.
   Using a broader definition of citizen organization, the Johns Hopkins
Center for Civil Society has gathered data on nonprofit NGOs. In their
estimates, using data for 22 countries, the NGO sector is worth $1.1 tril-
lion and employs more than 19 million people (Salamon et al. 1999).
In other words, if the nonprofit sector in these countries were a separate
national economy, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world,
ahead of Brazil, the Russian Federation, Canada, and Spain. In Sub-
Saharan Africa, about 79,000 national NGOs are in operation and are
growing at a rate of 12 percent annually. There are approximately 54,000
national NGOs in South Asia and 68,000 in the Middle East and North
Africa (both growing at 8 percent annually).9
   Scholarship in sociology has highlighted the role of civil society in
“deepening democracy” and influencing politics (Fox 1994; Heller 2009).
First, it is argued that, “civil society can facilitate the mobilization of under-
represented groups, who despite enjoying formal rights of citizenship, cannot
process their claims through institutionalized channels. New collective actors
in civil society can help to break through the self-reinforcing equilibrium
of representative democracy in which those who have privilege (in terms of
formal rights or heightened capacity to use those rights) can use politics to

                                                                                                       75
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     reinforce that privilege ” (Baiocchi, Heller, and Kunrath Silva 2011, 142).
                     Second, the literature argues that a vibrant civil society can generate better
                     societal preferences, through collectively thinking about issues, to reach
                     new understandings of what society should value. Thus, they argue that
                     associations are crucial complements to political parties because they are
                     potentially more responsive to the inherent diversity of societal interests
                     (Fox 1994). As defined in Baiocchi, Heller, and Kunrath Silva (2011, 20),
                     “in its ideal typical democratic incarnation, civil society is characterized by
                     voluntary forms of association that are constituted by and protective of com-
                     municative power and seek to exert their influence by specifically engaging with
                     and seeking support in the public sphere.”10 However, some of the available
                     evidence, reviewed in chapter 5, suggests that in practice, civil society
                     can also be captured by political and elite interests (Acemoglu, Reed, and
                     Robinson 2014; Satyanath, Voigtlaender, and Voth 2013).
                        Civil society organizations around the world are undertaking actions to
                     directly influence political engagement through electoral institutions. In
                     Nigeria, Action Aid campaigned against political violence in 12 villages
                     before the 2007 elections, effectively increasing voter turnout and reducing
                     the incidence of electoral violence. Action Aid’s country office in Nigeria
                     partnered with other state-level local CSOs, carrying out town meetings
                     and public theaters, and distributing informational posters to reduce politi-
                     cians’ ability to intimidate voters (Collier and Vicente 2013).
                        Similarly, in Mozambique, a national CSO consortium, Observatorio
                     Eleitoral , together with a free newspaper company, @Verdade, provided
                     citizens with similar information through a newspaper, mobile phones,
                     and leaflets, and established a mobile phone hotline for reporting prob-
                     lems (Aker, Collier, and Vicente 2013). In Uganda, the Africa Leadership
                     Institute, a Kampala-based CSO, partnered with Columbia and Stanford
                     universities to compile information about the legislative performance
                     of political leaders. A parliamentary scorecard was developed to influ-
                     ence how citizens assess the performance of members of parliament
                     (Humphreys and Weinstein 2012). In the Philippines, the Parish Pastoral
                     Council for Responsible Voting distributed information to voters about
                     the existence of a major spending program and the mayor’s promises just
                     ahead of the 2013 mayoral elections (Cruz, Keefer, and Labonne 2015).
                        CSOs have also organized themselves into political parties to contest
                     elections on the basis of platforms of good governance. India’s Aam Aadmi
                     Party, which won the Delhi state elections by a landslide, was born out
                     of an anticorruption movement in 2011. Registered only in late 2012, the

party was created by a group of civil society leaders who felt that politi-
cal formation was needed to reinforce their ideas of fighting corruption
(Palshikar 2013). The Middle East similarly witnessed a rise of several
Islamist parties such as the Justice and Development Party in Turkey,
Hamas in Gaza, the Justice and Development Party in Morocco, and the
Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab Republic of Egypt, all of which have
organized as civil society actors under conditions of political repression.
Cammett and Luong (2014) argue that it is primarily their “reputation for
good governance” that wins them political support rather than popular
explanations such as social service provision, organizational capacity, or
ideological hegemony.


In sum, the trends discussed in this chapter suggest that political engage-
ment by citizens, as voters, as candidates for public office, and through
civil society groups, is gaining strength around the world, across a variety
of institutional contexts. The next chapter presents evidence of trends in
transparency that goes together with political engagement in large parts
of the world.

                           legislative investigative commissions); (2) fiscal mechanisms (for example,
                           formal systems of auditing and financial accounting); (3) administrative
                           mechanisms (for example, hierarchical reporting, norms of public sector
                           probity, public service codes of conduct, rules and procedures regarding
                           transparency, and public oversight); and (4) legal mechanisms (for example,
                           corruption control agencies, ombudsmen, and the judiciary), in that it takes
                           place through direct citizen engagement with state bureaucrats (McNeil and
                           Malena 2010).

CHAPTER THREE




Transparency


Overview
Transparency is defined in this report as citizen access to publicly avail-
able information about the actions of those in government and the conse-
quences of these actions. Public disclosure policies are bringing out greater
information about the functioning of government and the actions of those
in power. Greater information is available not only due to disclosure by
governments, but also by non-government agents, such as investigative
journalists and civil society groups. New media technologies broadcast
information about government performance at all levels. The public avail-
ability of information, for all to see, is a fundamental part of the many
prevailing definitions of transparency and is the basic concept used in this
report.
   Several initiatives that seek to promote transparency go beyond the
availability of information to include in its definition its specific content,
how it should be available, and for what purposes it should be used. The
use of transparency as a tool to engage citizens to hold public officials and
frontline providers accountable is prominent among these initiatives.1 This
report examines research evaluating the contention that transparency—
defined as citizen access to publicly available information—improves
political engagement and government accountability.
   Sorting out causality between transparency, political engagement, and
governance is challenging. Transparency can be an outcome of political
engagement and the governance environment as much as a lever to influence
governance. Government agencies’ provision of information is subject to the
same political economy and governance problems that transparency advocates
often intend to solve.2 The quality and quantity of economic data released by

                                                                                 81
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     governments are significantly correlated with measures of governance and polit-
                     ical engagement (Hollyer, Rosendorff, and Vreeland 2011; Islam 2006; Lebovic
                     2006; Williams 2009), again likely reflecting causation in both directions.
                         Whether governments allow other nongovernment agencies of transpar-
                     ency, such as civil society and an independent press, to flourish is also an
                     outcome of political incentives. The example provided in chapter 1 of the
                     bribing of accountability institutions by Vladimiro Montesinos, the head
                     of Peru’s intelligence service under President Alberto Fujimori, is relevant
                     here. McMillan and Zoido (2004) analyze the unique data obtained from
                     the detailed records maintained by Montesinos to find that bribe payments
                     to purchase the acquiescence of media owners was an order of magnitude
                     greater than those paid to politicians and judges. They further describe
                     how Montesinos was unable to purchase the support of one television
                     channel, which continued to criticize the political regime in Peru. This
                     channel ultimately contributed to the demise of the regime by broadcasting
                     taped evidence of Montesinos’ corrupt practices.
                         Different government, nongovernment, and media actors can undertake
                     transparency interventions to bring data and information into public debate.
                     The meaning of information from different sources—what is accurate, what
                     is not, how it should be interpreted, and what it conveys about the function-
                     ing of government and the consequences of public p     ­ olicies—all matter for
                     the effects of these interventions. For example, Glaeser and Sunstein (2013)
                     provide evidence from experiments conducted in the United States that
                     balanced information can intensify previously held polarized opinions. If a
                     person believes in the information’s source, then the new information will
                     trigger a rational updating and bolster previous beliefs. In contrast, if a source
                     is perceived to be dubious, the new information will reinforce a person’s
                     original doubts. Chapter 6 distills lessons from available research on how
                     people respond to different types of media and transparency initiatives, and
                     how citizen actions in turn affect governance and development outcomes.
                         As with other aspects of governance discussed in previous chapters,
                     transparency is difficult to measure.3 To date, no single comprehensive
                     index of transparency exists. In the absence of such a measure, this chapter
                     assembles a variety of measures of different dimensions of transparency
                     from different sources, including civil society organizations and interna-
                     tional development partners. Transparency has spread through deliberate
                     policy efforts to improve governance by providing information about gov-
                     ernment actions and their consequences. For example, the public disclosure
                     of information about government budgets has been proposed as a condi-
                     tion for international development assistance. Civil society organizations

have also been making efforts to generate new information to monitor
and evaluate government service provision. Finally, transparency has also
grown as a result of technological forces that allow different news media
to generate and broadcast information about government performance.
   The following sections describe the global emergence of transparency
through a combination of government policy changes, civil society actions,
and the dynamics of media markets.



Government disclosure policies
One focus of transparency efforts is on the legal framework for access to
information from the government. According to the data gathered by a
global network of civil society organizations that advocates for disclosure
policies, freedominfo.org, 99 countries have enacted right-to-information
legislation as of 2014, compared with only 29 countries that had done so
by 2000 (figure 3.1).

                        The existence of a right-to-information law does not guarantee that citi-
                     zens are in fact able to access government information in a timely, affordable
                     manner. As a measure of actual access, in 2010, a collection of groups—the
                     International Budget Partnership, Centre for Law and Democracy, and
                     Access Info Europe—organized the “Ask Your Government! The 6 Question
                     Campaign,” which made identical budget information requests to 80 govern-
                     ments. The requests included two questions in each of the following categories:
                     maternal health, aid effectiveness, and environmental protection. The responses
                     showed much progress is yet to be made (figure 3.2). Across all countries, only
                     one in four requests was met with the full amount of information; nearly
                     40 percent provided no response at all. Not surprisingly, countries with right-
                     to-information laws were much more responsive, on average, and response rates
                     were higher the longer the law had been in place. Newer democracies or those
                     in the developing world in particular tended to be more transparent: Georgia,
                     India, and Namibia, for example, complied with all six information requests.
                     Only 2 of the top 15 respondents were western d  ­ emocracies—New Zealand

and Germany. In general, established democracies performed no better than
other governments with right-to-information laws. The Middle East region
was the worst performer in every category by a wide margin.
   Another effort to measure government transparency is the International
Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Index (OBI), a biennial expert assess-
ment of the availability, timeliness, and quality of central government
budget documents. The measure has expanded in scope from 59 countries
when it was launched in 2006, to about 100 countries in 2015. The OBI
assigns countries a transparency score on a 100-point scale using a set of
survey questions that focus on whether the government provides the public
with timely access to information contained in eight key budget docu-
ments in accordance with international good practice standards.
   Efforts to measure budget transparency extend to the local government
level. Survey data from Afrobarometer indicate that more than half of the
respondents in Africa are unhappy with how well their local councils are
providing citizens with information about their budgets (figure 3.3). Such
survey evidence on citizens’ experience with accessing information about
government budgets suggests scope for much improvement in the effective-
ness of transparency policies.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        One specific aspect of transparency that has been emphasized in inter-
                     national policy dialogue is the disclosure of how revenue from natural
                     resources is managed. The Resource Governance Index (RGI) measures
                     the quality of governance in the oil, gas, and mining sectors of 58 coun-
                     tries. The RGI scores and ranks the countries using a questionnaire
                     completed by researchers with expertise in the extractive industries. The
                     questionnaire is designed to assess the quality of the institutional and
                     legal setting, reporting practices, safeguards, and quality controls. It also
                     includes information on state-owned companies, natural resource funds,
                     and subnational revenue transfers that are common channels for revenue
                     flows from natural resources.
                        The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global
                     coalition of governments, companies, and civil society working together to
                     improve openness and further accountable management of revenues from
                     natural resources. As a membership requirement, countries must fully
                     disclose taxes and other payments made by oil, gas, and mining companies
                     to the government in an annual, actively promoted report. Participation is
                     voluntary, and as of 2014, 35 countries had produced at least one report.
                        Even the transparency of international organizations is subject to mea-
                     surement. One World Trust’s 2006, 2007, and 2008 Global Accountability
                     Reports include a measure of how consistently international organizations
                     publicly disclosed information and responded to information requests.
                     Scorecards prepared by the Global Transparency Initiative have likewise
                     rated international financial institutions’ disclosure policies and informa-
                     tion request procedures. The Aid Transparency Index produced by Publish
                     What You Fund annually rates the level of transparency for about 70
                     bilateral and multilateral agencies, climate finance funds, humanitarian
                     agencies, development finance institutions, and private foundations. In
                     2014, the World Bank Group’s International Development Association
                     was ranked 7th overall with noted commitment to the International Aid
                     Transparency Initiative, while the International Finance Corporation,
                     came in 39th.4



                     Civil society and the private sector as sources of
                     information
                     Governments are not the only providers of information about their
                     actions and performance. Civil society organizations, the private sector,

investigative journalists, researchers, and international development and
global agencies use enhanced technologies and research methodologies to
directly observe government actions, gather data, and draw conclusions
about the consequences of government actions for development outcomes.
For example, researchers have used satellite imagery data compiled by the
U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational
Linescan System to generate new information on the performance of gov-
ernments in delivering electricity to villages, finding that voting patterns of
villages are a significant predictor of whether the village receives electricity
(Baskaran, Min, and Uppal 2015).5
   Civil society organizations have also been making efforts to generate
new information to monitor and evaluate government service provision.
For example, Uwezo in East Africa and the Annual Status of Education
Report in India measure education service delivery and learning outcomes
on a large scale, enabling performance measures to be computed at disag-
gregated jurisdictional levels, such as districts, that are managed by directly
elected leaders.
   Global Integrity is an example of an international nongovernmental
organization that works with local partners in developing countries to
generate data about government performance through the participation
of local civil society and investigative reporters.6 One of the areas of
governance measured through their methodology is the extent to which
legal frameworks for anticorruption policies in countries are effectively
implemented, both at the national level and in select local governments.
   In addition to civil society organizations, multilateral efforts are under
way to promote transparency, notably the Open Government Partnership,
which includes 65 countries. Member countries are required to make
available information on governmental activities and to support civic par-
ticipation. As a complement to broader commitments to transparency and
good governance, several countries have implemented open data initiatives
to provide greater coordination and share resources between civil society
organizations to take advantage of open government data (Bayern 2015).



Media markets and technological forces
New technologies and communications media are being harnessed to widely
distribute information. The Internet is perhaps the most obvious example
of such technology. Figure 3.4 shows the growth in the number of Internet

                                                                                             87

                     gence or the move to a common digital platform is transforming the media

                     of news, current affairs, and entertainment, even in developing countries.

                     creating information curation services and even hiring journalists to help
                     them manage these services. For instance, Facebook drives about 20 per-
                     cent of the traffic to news sites (Somaiya 2014).
                         Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, among others, have projects

communities. For instance, Facebook introduced Internet.org to make it
easier for any mobile operator to sign up to offer free Internet access and
basic online services. Internet.org was first launched in Africa, but has
since expanded and is now available in 17 countries—including countries
with very large populations such as India—spanning three continents, but
only works with select operators. Facebook is now attempting to encour-
age more mobile operators to join the program, announcing a dedicated
portal through which operators can sign up.7
    Google has announced path-breaking projects to expand Internet access
such as Project Loon, a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space,
designed to connect people in rural and remote areas to the Internet.8
Project Loon’s efforts first began in June 2013, when Google launched
several balloons to heights of about 65,000 feet above Earth’s surface (Barr
and Greenwald 2015). Another example is Microsoft’s support for closing
the digital divide in India. According to Microsoft, its White-Fi technol-
ogy, which uses the unused spectrum in frequencies used for broadcasting
television signals, can provide free Wi-Fi connectivity to tackle the prob-
lem of last-mile broadband connectivity in India. 
    More and more state-owned news organizations are active globally.
Several countries are setting up powerful news organizations, stretch-
ing their public diplomacy efforts into many corners of the world. The
British Broadcasting Corporation is the global leader in news and cur-
rent affairs programming targeting the world. Germany and France offer
Deutsche Welle and France 24, respectively. The European Union has
its own transnational news network, Euronews. The United States is a
giant in the field, deploying Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio
Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Radio and TV Marti, Worldnet, and Middle
East Broadcasting Networks. The Russian Federation has RT. China has
deployed Chinese Central Television and Xinhua, China’s state-run news
agency. All these public diplomacy instruments are broadcasting in more
and more languages in more and more countries. They also have powerful
online presences. This trend implies that there are no hermetically sealed
national media environments; agendas from a variety of sources are being
pushed into different media markets.
    Satellite broadcasting is now a major feature of the global media space,
allowing programming to be beamed across national boundaries. Among
the big players are SES (Luxembourg) with a global fleet of 53 geostationary
satellites that together cover 99 percent of the world’s population, Intelsat
(Luxembourg), Eutelsat (France), Telesat Canada, and JSAT (Japan).

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                         Satellite broadcasting is not only a massive cultural force (as a purveyor
                     of entertainment programming), but also a force for transparency about
                     government actions because they beam news and current affairs program-
                     ming from different sources into a variety of countries. For instance, satel-
                     lite broadcasting has created a virtual pan-Arab media space. According to
                     the latest report from Digital TV Research on the Middle East and North
                     Africa (2015),9 there are 34.3 million Arabic-speaking, free-to-air, satellite
                     TV homes in the region.
                         Deregulation and commercialization have reduced the number of
                     state media monopolies, especially broadcast monopolies. At indepen-
                     dence, most developing countries inherited state media monopolies. In
                     the 1970s, broadcast monopolies loyal to the government of the day were
                     the norm. But in the 1980s and 1990s, a wave of media deregulation
                     spread around the world. Perhaps because of the democratization wave or
                     simply because state broadcasters became too expensive for many devel-
                     oping country governments to maintain, space began to be opened up
                     for commercial broadcasters, first in radio, then television. Some of this
                     movement could be described as deregulation to trusted friends, where
                     authoritarian governments gave broadcast licenses to allies of specific
                     regimes (Carpentier 2014; Das and Parthasarathi 2014). This trend has
                     had a transformational impact in many countries, opening up media
                     systems and promoting a diversity of voices. In contrast, public service
                     broadcasting and community radio are not thriving. The trends noted
                     above have led to more commercial broadcasting. More citizens in more
                     countries have numerous media options, reducing the demand for public
                     service broadcasting.


                     Citizens’ reports on the media they use
                     Data from the Gallup World Poll, the World Values Survey, and the
                     Afrobarometer survey provide insights into the types of media citizens
                     use to access information. Cell phone penetration is about 85 per-
                     cent worldwide. Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of cell phone
                     ownership is greater than 60 percent (figure 3.5, panel a). Landline
                     penetration is far lower worldwide and practically nonexistent in
                     Africa and South Asia (figure 3.5, panel b). Since landline technol-
                     ogy is older, these regions have “leapfrogged” that technology and
                     directly adopted the new technology once they reached the level of
                     development at which it became practical. The use of social media over

cell-phone-based platforms in the Arab Spring provides an example
of how technology is enabling citizens to access information through
different sources, bypassing the hurdles that might be put in place by
repressive regimes.
   In contrast, rates of access to a computer and to the Internet are quite
low in all regions outside of the high-income Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (figure 3.5, panels c
and d). This fact is important when designing transparency initiatives.
Although it may seem tempting from the perspective of many development
practitioners to make information available online because of the perva-
siveness of that platform in the OECD, in fact there may be other media

more than 80 percent listen at least once a week. Newspaper readership, in
contrast, is low, with daily readership rates of less than 20 percent world-
wide (figure 3.6, panel a).
    Figure 3.7 shows responses to a Gallup World poll question about the
source people deem most important for becoming well-informed about
events in their countries. Domestic (national) television is cited by a major-
ity of people in all regions but Sub-Saharan Africa, where radio dominates.
Radio is the most significant source of information for 61 percent of
African respondents.
    Although domestic sources are the most important in all regions, inter-
national radio and television also hold a degree of importance, particularly
in the Middle East and North Africa, where nearly a quarter of respondents
said international TV was their most important news source about domes-
tic events. One hypothesis is that if citizens are dissatisfied with the quality
of information provided domestically, they may be willing to look abroad
to find more trustworthy sources. It is notable in this regard that confidence

                     sources or the Internet (which is a global source) for news (figure 3.7).


                     Independence and plurality in media markets
                     Because the media can play a large role in transparency by monitoring
                     government officials, informing citizens, and serving as a forum for public
                     debate, plurality of media sources and independence from state control
                     can to some extent also serve as a barometer for transparency itself.
                     Developments in communications technology provide citizens across the
                     world with access to different types of news and social media. However,
                     the quality of the available information is likely to be shaped by who owns
                     and controls these media. Djankov et al. (2003) consider 97 countries
                     and find that in nearly all cases, ownership is concentrated in the national
                     government or a few private family-firms who own the largest media.
                     Government ownership is more common in broadcasting than in print

media. Based on total circulation and share of viewing, state ownership of
the top five media firms is 29 percent for newspapers, 60 percent for televi-
sion stations, and 72 percent for the top radio stations. Government own-
ership of media is higher in poor countries as well as in nondemocracies.
In cross-country regressions, Djankov et al. (2003) find that government
ownership of media firms is associated with less press freedom, more cor-
ruption, weaker property rights, and worse health and education outcomes.
   Press “freedom” is another dimension on which several organizations
rate governments. Reporters Without Borders, for example, incorporates
quantitative measures such as imprisonment and the death of journalists
and citizens in its press freedom index, along with qualitative information
reported in surveys sent to nongovernmental organizations, researchers,
journalists, and human rights activists.10 The 2015 index shows that con-
ditions for journalists are problematic, difficult, or serious in almost all
regions of the world. A striking feature of these ratings is that Africa is not
that different from the rest of the world. The African continent exhibits
large variation, just like the rest of the world, rather than being uniformly
poor on indicators of media freedom.
   Freedom House also rates countries on freedom of the press. Freedom
House’s methodology comprises 23 questions and 132 indicators that are
divided into three broad categories: the legal environment, the political
environment, and the economic environment. It focuses on the “enabling
environment,” that is, the extent to which governments can apply pressure
on the nature and flow of information and intimidate journalists.11 The
ratings of press freedom by Reporters Without Borders generally point in
the same direction that press freedoms are greater in rich countries than
in the developing world.
   Not surprisingly, indicators of media freedom are correlated with
indicators of political freedom. Figure 3.9 shows that countries that are
measured as more democratic using Polity IV indicators also tend to
have greater measures of press freedom, suggesting that these two forces
go hand-in-hand in many countries. At the same time, countries with
intermediate levels of media freedom are spread across the measures of
democracy on Polity IV. That is, even countries measured as autocracies
allow some degree of media freedom or perhaps are unable to fully control
media.12
   Figure 3.10 shows that there is a positive association between media
freedom and the control of corruption. However, as indicated at the outset,
such correlations are difficult to interpret and could reflect a direction of

                                                                                            95

causation from better governance to better-functioning media markets.
The research evidence on the role of mass media (covered in chapter 6) is
much more nuanced and is focused on situations in which it is possible to
correlate exogenous changes in media access with governance outcomes.


In sum, the trends discussed in this chapter suggest transparency is on the
rise across a variety of institutional contexts. Several reasons likely explain
this emergence, including international and domestic political pressure,
but also the spread of market forces and information and communica-
tions technology. Transparency and political engagement, in short, are
together gaining strength around the world as interlinked forces that can
potentially affect governance for economic development. The following
chapters use available research to probe how these forces might improve
governance and strengthen public sector institutions for the goals of eco-
nomic development.



Notes
     For example, the Transparency International website contains the following
  1. 
     description of what transparency is about (http://www.transparency.org/
     what-is-corruption/#what-is-transparency): “Transparency is about shedding
     light on rules, plans, processes and actions. It is knowing why, how, what, and
     how much. Transparency ensures that public officials, civil servants, manag-
     ers, board members and businesspeople act visibly and understandably, and
     report on their activities. And it means that the general public can hold them
     to account. It is the surest way of guarding against corruption, and helps
     increase trust in the people and institutions on which our futures depend.”
     The World Bank’s public sector work also uses the term transparency to refer
     to the greater availability of information between government departments
     as well as greater clarity about government processes, rules, and definitions
     (Trapnell 2014). This report focuses on transparency for citizens rather than
     between government departments to examine the role of citizens as external
     checks upon those who wield power within the government. This report also
     distinguishes outcomes (greater clarity of government processes and rules)
     that depend upon the political incentives, from the input of greater avail-
     ability of information. For example, government processes and rules might
     be deliberately clouded when it serves the incentives of leaders to use their
     discretionary powers for rent-seeking and providing preferential treatment.
     A recent example related to the provision of public access to informa-
  2. 
     tion under access-to-information laws comes from the province of British
     Columbia in Canada, where the province’s Information and Privacy
     Commissioner uncovered a “culture of suppression of information.” This
     culture manifested itself in avoidance of documenting government policy
                                                                                                 97

                           decisions and an informal policy of systemic “triple deletion” of emails (see
                           Denham 2015). The handling of emails offers an example of mounting evi-
                           dence that the introduction of information and communications technology
                           within governments can have offsetting effects on accountability and trans-
                           parency. Without proper regulatory safeguards in place, new digital forms of
                           communication make it easier to perpetrate fraud and corrupt practices and
                           to erase records or to avoid capturing them altogether (see Lemieux 2015).
                           In countries with independent monitoring and oversight of public access to
                           information and media that are aware of the issue, attempts to subvert public
                           access to information can be uncovered, forcing the politicians to change
                           their behavior. In many countries, however, these preconditions are not met,
                           so such behaviors often go undetected.

                           ency draw on background research prepared by Scott Abrahams for this

                           increase the provision of electricity. Manipulation of electricity provision is
                           more pronounced when elections are closely contested and in localities where
                           the state government only holds a small majority.

                           media freedom when they need the information generated by a free press to
                           manage the far-flung, lower-tier public officials in their countries. Media-
                           generated information is critical, in their argument, because it enables leaders
                           to establish strong incentive systems for lower-level officials.

Learning from the Logic of
the Theoretical Literature

Overview: Government failures as principal-agent
problems
This chapter provides the conceptual framework of the report, drawing on
the logic of the theoretical literature in economics. It defines the notion of
government failure on the basis of economic theory, using the framework
of “principal-agent” relationships between government officials who act as
the agents of society or of citizens (who are the principals). Accountability
problems in government are examined as a series of principal-agent prob-
lems, as follows: (i) between citizens and political leaders; (ii) between
political leaders and public officials who lead government agencies; and
(iii) between public officials and frontline providers. Political engagement
and transparency shape all three of these principal-agent relationships.
    The next section examines how political engagement is the funda-
mental role that citizens can play in governance. Unhealthy political
engagement, when leaders are selected and sanctioned on the basis of their
provision of private benefits rather than public goods, arises as a result of
conflict of interest among citizens. It leads to accountability failures in the
functioning of a myriad within-government principal-agent relationships
between leaders, public officials, and frontline providers. Some of these
accountability failures can be examined as the “inversion” of principal-
agent relationships. For example, vote buying and violence in elections
involves political leaders holding voters accountable for political support.
Public officials and frontline providers can be organized as powerful
interest groups who control political leaders and thwart citizen action to
monitor their performance. Such government failures can occur in both
more and less democratic settings, and depend upon whether leaders who

                                                                                  101

                     wield power within government are held accountable for public goods or
                     private rents.
                         A defining feature of principal-agent problems are informational asym-
                     metries, which exist even when political engagement happens in healthy
                     ways to select and sanction leaders on the basis of performance in providing
                     public goods. Principals have imperfect information about the actions of
                     agents and the consequences of these actions. Transparency, which pro-
                     vides such information, is therefore central to addressing principal-agent
                     problems in government. The following section reviews the literature
                     examining how transparency can improve the quality of political engage-
                     ment, enabling citizens to hold leaders accountable for public goods and
                     select better-quality leaders.
                         The last section examines how political engagement and transparency
                     shape the beliefs and behavioral norms of citizens, political leaders, public
                     officials, and frontline providers. These are topics on the research fron-
                     tiers. One strand shows how political engagement and the leaders selected
                     through it can shape norms of cooperation among citizens or in society.
                     Another strand shows how the legitimacy of leaders matters for improving
                     the functioning of public sector organizations and the behavior of pub-
                     lic officials. The picture that emerges by putting together the dispersed
                     pieces of theoretical research provides guidance for future work on how
                     healthy political engagement, nourished by transparency, may contribute
                     to strengthening norms and building legitimacy for effective public sector
                     institutions.


                     Political engagement is the fundamental role that
                     citizens play in the principal-agent problems of
                     government
                     Political engagement directly shapes the relationship between citizens as
                     principals and government leaders as the agents of citizens. Citizens play
                     this role as principals in different ways across institutional contexts. For
                     example, in countries with more democratic institutions, the power to
                     select and sanction leaders is more dispersed among a large number of
                     “ordinary” or non-elite citizens. In countries with less democratic or more
                     autocratic institutions, the power is instead more concentrated among
                     elites or well-organized citizens, such as political parties. However, even
                     when formal electoral institutions are lacking, the threat of political

engagement by nonelite citizens through informal means, such as pro-
tests and revolutions, can serve as a constraint on leaders (Acemoglu and
Robinson 2000, 2006a).
    Political leaders, in turn, delegate tasks to public officials who manage
a myriad of agencies within the government. Political leaders are therefore
the principals of a variety of lower-level public officials within the govern-
ment. These public officials who lead government agencies are, in turn,
the principals of frontline providers who deliver public services. Figure 4.1
illustrates this series of principal-agent relationships in government. Most
government systems around the world are a complex mix of power being
shared between appointed and elected officials across multiple jurisdic-
tions. For example, responsibilities over the management of public schools
can be divided between locally elected governments or elected school
boards, on the one hand, and appointed administrative officers on the
other hand. Theoretical research has examined how different tasks of gov-
ernment should be assigned to an appointed public official or to an elected
politician across these multiple jurisdictions, depending on the nature of
the different principal-agent problems (Alesina and Tabellini 2007).
    Non-political citizen engagement has become a prominent feature
of policy efforts to improve government performance. Figure 4.1 also
shows how these initiatives of non-political citizen engagement fit into
the principal-agent problems of government. Officials who hold leader-
ship positions in government can engage the help of citizens in making
government agencies perform better. In the principal-agent setting, non-
political ways of engaging citizens to solve accountability problems include

                     using citizens to monitor lower-level government officials and providing
                     feedback to higher-level leaders, which these leaders can then use to solve
                     within-government accountability problems. For example, a district execu-
                     tive officer with formal powers over teachers, health workers, agricultural
                     extension workers, road works contractors, and so on, can engage civil
                     society organizations and request feedback from beneficiaries as an input
                     into internal management practices. Non-political citizen engagement is
                     thus part of the management practices within government.1
                        Citizens’ political engagement shapes the incentives and characteristics
                     of leaders who, in turn, select within-government management policies to
                     address the principal-agent problem vis-à-vis public officials and providers.
                     Leaders and public officials also determine whether to provide citizens with
                     any powers of monitoring and feedback on frontline providers. Citizens’
                     political behavior—what issues they consider when selecting and disciplin-
                     ing leaders, and their attitudes toward the public sector—­    underpins the
                     functioning of all three principal-agent relationships. Political engagement
                     thus indirectly influences all three principal-agent relationships through
                     how it shapes the incentives and characteristics of leaders who exercise
                     power within government.


                     Unhealthy political engagement can “invert” principal-agent relationships
                     Unhealthy political engagement, when the leaders who wield power within
                     government are selected and sanctioned on the basis of their provision of
                     private benefits rather than public goods, arises out of conflict of interest
                     among citizens. It exacerbates the accountability problem and can lead to
                     “inversions” in each of the principal-agent relationships of government.
                     Powerful elites with control over the coercive institutions of the state can
                     subvert formal democratic and governance institutions. For example,
                     the first principal-agent problem can become one in which leaders hold
                     citizens accountable for providing political support by using violence and
                     clientelist strategies such as vote buying (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006b;
                     Stokes 2005).
                        Unhealthy political engagement can diminish accountability not only
                     of elected leaders but also within the principal-agent relationships between
                     leaders, public officials, and frontline providers. For example, if political
                     norms allow vote buying and patronage to flourish in elections, those same
                     norms would influence how leaders manage public officials and how public
                     officials manage frontline providers. Leaders who can get away with poor

service delivery during their term in office by purchasing votes at election
time also tend to provide jobs to public officials and to frontline providers
as political patronage and not hold them accountable for service delivery.
When frontline providers are patronage appointees, citizens do not expect
that monitoring them or providing feedback on their performance will
have any effect and therefore, do not engage to improve the third principal-
agent problem. Citizens’ expectations of how political power is exercised
within government can maintain this vicious cycle, leading to citizens’
demands for private benefits and the persistence of unhealthy political
engagement.
   Citizens’ roles as monitors in the third type of principal-agent problem
is also subject to free-riding problems, when each individual citizen con-
tributes little to the public good of monitoring. An influential strand of
the literature has focused on the free-rider problems that plague collective
action and how group organization and cohesion play a role in outcomes.2
Powerful local elites can also capture civil society and invert the role of
citizens in the third principal-agent problem, again, through their control
over local institutions of coercion or economic resources (Acemoglu, Reed,
and Robinson 2014; Anderson, Francois, and Kotwal 2015). Rather than
being engaged to hold public officials accountable, citizens can be engaged
to deliver public services for themselves, letting leaders and public officials
abdicate their responsibilities.
   Even in contexts where power is more dispersed among citizens, rather
than controlled by only a few elites, there can nevertheless be a conflict of
interest among citizens with pernicious consequences for accountability for
public goods. Citizens are heterogeneous in their beliefs about the role of
government and what they demand from public policies and government
leaders. Subsets of citizens organized as special interests can capture leaders
and extract private rents from public policies (for example, as examined by
Grossman and Helpman [2001]). Groups can form to engage in collective
action with the objective of obtaining group-specific benefits that may
come at the expense of public benefits that are shared with other citizens
who are not organized (this is clearly conveyed, for instance, in Grossman
and Helpman [1996]). Public officials and frontline providers can each
organize as special interests (for example, teacher unions) that wield politi-
cal power over leaders, thus inverting the second two principal-agent rela-
tionships within government. Social conflict leads to inefficient outcomes
because those in power can choose policies to serve their interest and there
is no outside agency with the capacity to control them (Acemoglu 2003).

                                                                                     105
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        A point emerging from this discussion is that group organization may
                     deviate from, and reconfigure, the set of political rights agreed upon ex
                     ante and expressed in constitutional arrangements. A crucial aspect of the
                     political process is therefore the extent to which group pressures can be
                     accommodated in a way that maintains balance among competing inter-
                     ests without causing serious distortions to commonly shared interests. The
                     Virginia school, associated with the work of Buchanan and Tullock (1962),
                     called attention to the potential inefficiencies that emerge from the de facto
                     political process. The Chicago school, associated with the contributions
                     of Becker (1983) and Wittman (1989) emphasized that the democratic
                     process embodies a strong tendency to efficiency once competition and
                     incentives for political entrepreneurship are taken into account.
                        An additional point emerging from the literature on collective action is
                     that political parties can be a vehicle for organizing citizens in a way that
                     makes rulers more responsive to citizen needs. But the way parties interact
                     depends on electoral and representation institutions. For example, Persson,
                     Roland, and Tabellini (2007) analyze the way in which, by affecting the
                     accountability regime, presidential-congressional systems generate less
                     spending and public goods provision than parliamentary systems (see also
                     Persson and Tabellini [2004] and references therein). Although political
                     parties are expected to play a large role in democracies, they may also play
                     a surprisingly important role in some nondemocracies (Keefer 2011). The
                     main body of this chapter largely abstracts from these themes to focus on
                     arguments that can be made in more institution-neutral principal-agent
                     models.
                        The specific characteristics of political engagement therefore matter
                     in how it shapes the three principal-agent problems between citizens and
                     leaders within each formal institutional context. These characteristics per-
                     tain to how active and organized different groups of citizens are, to what
                     extent elite groups are in de facto control of state institutions, and to what
                     are citizens’ beliefs about public policies and demands from governments.


                     Even healthy political engagement is constrained by
                     information asymmetries
                     A large literature examines how, even if citizens have political power over
                     leaders and want to hold them accountable for the delivery of public goods,
                     they are constrained by a lack of information about the actions of leaders
                     and the consequences of those actions. The transparency regime within

106
                                  LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



which each of the principal-agent relationships plays out determines what
type of information is available to citizens and voters.
    The accountability problem in principal-agent relationships arises
because agents pursue objectives different from that of the principal and
have access to private information that the principals lack. In the absence
of these factors—if agents shared the objectives of principals, or if prin-
cipals had full information—there would be no principal-agent problem.
Leaders, public officials, and frontline providers undertake tasks to maxi-
mize their own payoffs comprising policy interests, reelection concerns,
rent extraction, and so on. The ability of voters to decide whether political
leaders have delivered the right policies and, as a result, whether those
politicians should be reelected, depends on what information voters have
about what policy was implemented, what level of welfare they perceive,
and if policy is observed, whether circumstances warranted that particular
policy choice. Similarly, voters may obtain information about the quality
of political leaders themselves via disclosure rules (for example, individual
assets) or through the media. An important question is what types of
information are beneficial to citizens and when, both to better discipline
officials and to sort good ones from bad ones.
    Information problems are also acute in the within-government
­
principal-agent problems between political leaders and public officials,
and between public officials and frontline providers. Government agencies
t ypically operate in areas where markets fail, which has profound impli-
­
cations for accountability. Market-based indicators of performance, such
as profits, which discipline firms, cannot be used to discipline agents in
government. This is one of the key conditions giving rise to bureaucracy,
which instead disciplines agents by keeping track of inputs and imposing
procedural constraints (Downs 1965; Wilson 1989). Procedural con-
straints (that is, red tape) then also become a potential source of misgover-
nance. Because relying on market forces is infeasible, red tape may be used
not just to control agents, but also to screen clients—another potential
source of misgovernance (Banerjee 1997).
    Within firms, more complete incentive contracts can be written that
reward agents for performance. Within government, good metrics of
performance may be unavailable, making incentive contracts impractical.
Multitasking distortions, which occur when agents shift effort away from
valuable tasks in which their performance is difficult to measure in favor of
those tasks where performance is more easily measured, are more common
in government. These characteristics of principal-agent problems within

                                                                                    107

                     government mean that even well-intentioned leaders will face the challenge
                     of designing appropriate institutions to influence incentives for some tasks,
                     but also to shape professional norms of behavior for others where incentives
                     alone will be insufficient (Dixit 2002).
                        Information is a special good. It is a public good whose use is nonrival,
                     hence it will typically be underprovided by the market system. Government
                     intervention can help address this market failure and help information to
                     be provided at more satisfactory levels in markets. A problem arises when
                     the information that must be generated is about the government itself.
                     Information is a crucial ingredient for solving principal-agent problems
                     of the kind discussed above that particularly plague government agencies.
                     Like any other industry, the government may have perverse incentives to
                     aggravate the market failures that arise in the provision of information.
                     But unlike any other industry, the government also has the means to do
                     so. Against this backdrop, as will be discussed in greater detail further
                     below in this chapter, third-party actors such as the media are critical to
                     accountability relationships because they can provide information about
                     the government that the government may prefer remain undisclosed.


                     Transparency can strengthen political engagement to
                     improve incentives of and select better-quality leaders
                     The theoretical literature on the role of transparency focuses on institu-
                     tional contexts in which citizens can exercise electoral power to select and
                     discipline political leaders. The first contribution on electoral discipline as
                     a constraint on shirking and rent extraction is by Barro (1973), although
                     this work did not include an informational advantage for the politician.
                     Ferejohn (1986) expanded the analysis to consider a politician who has
                     greater knowledge than do voters about economic circumstances. This
                     asymmetric knowledge allows politicians to gain higher rents from office.
                     In this model, policy amounts to the choice of an effort level by the politi-
                     cian, that is, policy is vertical, and more is always better for the citizen.
                     As a result, information is good for the voter because it allows him or her
                     to fine-tune the use of elections as a source of discipline. Voters do not
                     observe actions, but only the consequences of those actions as evident
                     in resulting welfare. This result parallels that in Holmström (1979), in
                     which information about the agent can never hurt the principal as long as
                     an optimal contract can always be improved to exploit that information.

In politics, however, the “contracting” environment is very limited, and
electorates often face other objectives in addition to providing incentives
for pure effort.


Ambiguous effects of transparency: Details matter
Unfortunately, the basic lesson that more information is always better
does not generalize over many relevant political settings. A case in point
arises in models in which policy can be differentiated in a horizontal
rather than vertical fashion (for example, left versus right, well adapted to
circumstances versus not) and voters can only choose to retain an agent
or not. When politicians have “career concerns,” they may want to pick
policy with an eye toward generating a favorable image of themselves. An
early example of this phenomenon is in models of biased advisors (Morris
2001). Harrington (1993) makes the point that when voters have strong
views about what policy ought to be picked and politicians have strong
office motivation, pandering will result. In other words, politicians will do
what voters demand even when politicians have better private information
than voters that suggests an alternative policy would be better.
    Canes-Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001) prove this pandering tendency
is present even when politicians are benevolent rather than directly office-
minded, but desire to be perceived as competent so they can continue to
have the chance to set good policy. Maskin and Tirole (2004) allow for
office motivation but consider politicians who do not want to project com-
petence but, instead, congruence with the electorate’s tastes. In both of the
last two models, pandering is eliminated if the probability that voters will
observe the consequences of actions is high enough. The key distortion is
that certain policy actions, which are observable, are a priori tied to certain
types of politician (competent or congruent) who are more desirable. It is
the voters’ desire to use information to weed out bad incumbents that cre-
ates a cost in the form of forgone discipline.
    Prat (2005) studies a situation in which the politician does not have
superior information about his or her level of expertise but is concerned
with the perception of competence. The politician shows that transparency
about actions can distort incentives when the politician wants to increase
the voters’ perception of his or her competence. The key condition is that
a sufficiently strong correlation be present between a certain type of politi-
cian and the actions the voters tend to consider appropriate. An ancillary
yet interesting aspect of models à la Prat is that if the principal could

                                                                                     109

                     observe the same signal that the agent observed, the agent’s incentives to
                     manipulate his or her actions would disappear. In other words, the negative
                     effect of information on actions stems both from opacity of consequences
                     as well as of “process.” An additional distinction is between transparency of
                     revenues versus transparency of expenditures (Gavazza and Lizzeri 2007b).
                     Transparency of revenues may have negative effects if expenditures are not
                     fully transparent.
                        In summary, the theoretical literature yields a few key insights. First,
                     information about policy actions may distort incentives and discipline
                     when agents want to be perceived as competent or congruent with princi-
                     pals. This situation happens when information about policy consequences
                     is poor. In those circumstances, somewhat paradoxically, transparency
                     about actions may be counterproductive. When that happens, account-
                     ability leads to a form of “excess responsiveness” in which informed agents
                     disregard valuable information and take actions to please their uninformed
                     principals. In contrast, information about policy consequences (as opposed
                     to actions) is typically beneficial. Finally, direct “information on informa-
                     tion,” that is, about the agent’s signal, eliminates the bad effects of infor-
                     mation on actions, suggesting that giving citizens information about the
                     policy-making process is beneficial.


                     Discipline effects versus selection and sorting effects of transparency
                     Papers in the Downsian tradition of economic analysis of political markets
                     (Downs 1957) typically take the set of candidates and the set of voters as
                     given and show how the preferences of voters, as well as the competitive
                     nature of elections, shape policy outcomes. The typical question is whether
                     convergence to the median voter’s preferred policy occurs.
                         The citizen-candidate tradition (Besley and Coate 1997; Osborne and
                     Slivinski 1996) considers endogenous entry. The nature of the electorate,
                     the costs of running, and competition are key determinants of who runs
                     and subsequently what policies are implemented. In other words, the rules
                     of the democratic game affect who gets elected to office. Although it is
                     tacit, a clear message in this work is that the composition of the electorate
                     is important. Therefore, citizens’ political engagement as voters matters
                     directly for policy outcomes.
                         To the extent that partisanship and other politician characteristics have
                     a bearing on policy, candidate self-selection and screening by voters are also
                     relevant to outcomes. Political engagement matters for outcomes through

                                   LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



leader selection even in strong institutional environments because leader
characteristics play a role in policy selection and implementation. That
is, elections do not only serve to choose between competing policies but
also in the selection of the “quality” of leaders. A theoretical literature has
examined the effect of various factors on political selection, for example,
compensation on the quality and integrity of politicians (for example,
Caselli and Morelli 2004; Messner and Polborn 2004). Other papers
have considered whether candidates with good “character” are likely to
arise endogenously (and be elected). Callander (2008) shows that candi-
dates who care about policy and not just office will in equilibrium come
forward and signal their genuine interest in policy by diverging from the
median.3 Myerson (2006) shows how federal electoral institutions can
enable local leaders, who have built reputations for responsibly managing
public resources at local levels, to emerge as credible contenders in national
politics.
    Abstracting from selection, Alesina and Spear (1988), Harrington
(1993), and Keefer (2011) discuss the role of political parties in disciplining
politicians. The key idea is that opportunistic deviations trigger some pun-
ishment of the politician. One important question is whether institutions
that discipline politicians—be they parties or forms of accountability—in
office can have effects on what type of politician reaches office. It has been
argued that in polities in which policy makers face coercive pressures, the
presence of political parties as protection or insurance devices can improve
outcomes and attract better candidates (Dal Bó and Di Tella 2003).
    Besley (2004) integrates the analysis of disciplining and selection
effects. The key tension is that when reelection incentives lead noncon-
gruent politicians to choose policies voters want, voters lose the ability to
distinguish between congruent and noncongruent politicians. Knowledge
of the politician’s type is directly valuable because it allows the weeding
out of noncongruent types. However, a higher rate of direct revelations
about the politician’s type can backfire because it weakens the incentives
of a noncongruent type to mimic the policy choices of a congruent type.
For example, the politicians might think, “If the media will reveal I am
a crook, I might as well behave like one.” The idea that more precise
information about the agent’s type can weaken discipline goes back to
Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Tirole (1999) and Holmström (1979).
    In summary, theoretical models of the role of transparency and politi-
cal engagement in the selection of leaders have three main predictions.
First, citizen engagement matters through citizens’ direct participation

                                                                                     111
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     as candidates, and in many contexts, the personal qualities of those who
                     participate will translate into policy outcomes. Second, the compensation,
                     the expected impact on policy, and the conditions surrounding policy
                     making (for example, the protections afforded to policy makers) will affect
                     political selection. Third, information about the (bad) quality of politi-
                     cians has counteracting effects: although it may help the electorate weed
                     out noncongruent politicians, it can also weaken discipline.


                     Role of the media and consequences of media slant
                     The media can reveal information about the effort of politicians, which is
                     valuable because it provides incentives for politicians to exert effort that
                     benefits citizens (as in the model in Besley and Burgess 2002), thereby
                     mitigating the principal-agent problem between citizens and politicians.
                     The media can also reveal information about the politician’s type. This
                     information will help the electorate weed out incumbents with preferences
                     that are not congruent with those of voters, but will also decrease the abil-
                     ity of the electorate to discipline bad incumbents. If bad incumbents know
                     they will be seen as such, they will lose the incentive to mimic the policies
                     of more congruent types (Besley 2004). This outcome will be an acceptable
                     trade-off for an electorate that is primarily concerned with weeding out
                     bad incumbents (Besley and Prat 2006).
                         Some papers have analyzed the special properties of information in
                     models in which voters must seek out that information (for example,
                     Martinelli 2006). The basic lesson is that, although costly, information
                     is acquired in a way that permits information aggregation and the correct
                     collective decision to be made.
                         Another strand of papers on voting and elections incorporates the media
                     and the possibility that media are biased in a way that affects political
                     outcomes. The predictions for voter welfare from adding profit-oriented
                     media are at variance with each other. For example, Bernhardt, Krasa, and
                     Polborn (2008) consider a model in which for-profit media may suppress
                     information to cater to partisan voters and increase profits. The result of
                     information suppression is potentially inefficient political outcomes. Chan
                     and Suen (2008) analyze a model in which media seeking to maximize their
                     audience by partially informing voters leads parties to be more likely to select
                     platforms that cater to the median voter. Prat and Strömberg (2013) syn-
                     thesize approaches considering for-profit media, politicians that seek rents
                     from office, and voters interested in selecting and disciplining politicians.4

A prediction of their model is that groups that are larger and have more
potential as advertising markets will see more coverage of the issues in
which they are interested and be able to attract more public policy efforts
by officials. This finding qualifies the discoveries in Besley and Burgess
(2002): officials will exert more effort to protect the vulnerable if there is
media coverage of the issues pertinent to that population. But this is a big
“if.” On the contrary, if a profit-seeking member of the media caters to
either the numerous or the elite, public policy will also. This result raises
the question of how to level the playing field in issue coverage for more
vulnerable sectors of the population.
    Most of the political entry models (for example, citizen-candidate
models) pertain to ideological selection. But the point has been made that
transparency about politicians may affect equilibrium selection along a
valence dimension, that is, pertaining to the competence of politicians.
Caselli and Morelli (2004) show that more precise information about
politicians’ types leads to higher-quality politicians. This effect acts
through candidates’ decisions to run and is additional to the effect high-
lighted by Besley (2004) of voters being able to select better types among
a given set of incumbents. Counterintuitive results have been found,
however, wherein more transparency (meaning better information about
individual talent being available to the private sector) lowers the quality
of politicians, because talented individuals are more likely to move into
the private sector and select out of political entrepreneurship (Mattozzi
and Merlo 2007).
    Prat and Strömberg (2013) derive predictions of media coverage of
issues relevant to a group for the expected competence of representatives
along those issues. Groups whose issues are covered more can expect to see
not only more effort directed to their issues but also higher competence.
    There are strong theoretical links between political selection and
capture of media by powerful or special interests. Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and
Di Tella (2006) derive results emphasizing negative effects on politician
quality when honest policy makers are subjected to coercive pressures that
the judiciary cannot neutralize, and that the captured media may be used
to amplify through targeted press operations. If much of what is good in
public policy occurs as the result of benevolent political entrepreneurs,
this adverse selection of politicians is a first-order problem since higher
media capture will diminish the availability of those benevolent political
entrepreneurs. This result has the effect of harming policy and reducing
the quality of politicians.

                                                                                     113
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                         Rather obviously, bad incumbents prefer an opaque regime in which
                     their types are not revealed directly; their actions, when related to rent
                     extraction, are not observed; and the negative consequences of their actions
                     are not known. Governments may then have incentives to suppress infor-
                     mation. A key lesson in Besley and Prat (2006) is that a more numerous
                     and diverse media industry, that is, more plural media, raises the costs for
                     the government to suppress information, leading to better ability to weed
                     out bad incumbents. Apart from government, special interest groups can
                     also capture media in the pursuit of their group interests (Grossman and
                     Helpman 2001). When a society faces hurdles in diversifying its internal
                     press sources, international partners may have a potential role in helping
                     remove the hurdles on the path toward plural media, with healthy compe-
                     tition among diverse sources and low risk of capture by the state or special
                     interests.
                         In summary, theory predicts positive effects of transparency on effort,
                     although in a multigroup society with for-profit media, the discipline
                     effects may be biased in favor of specific groups for reasons other than
                     merit. In addition, most theories predict positive effects of free media
                     and transparency in particular, and “clean” politics (in which unhealthy
                     practices such as violence, intimidation, and vote buying do not invert the
                     principal-agent relationship) in general, on selection. The theoretical work
                     on the link between transparency and selection is scarce, but the empirical
                     work is even scarcer, suggesting the need for studies on the topic.


                     Importance of citizen capacity and modes of engagement in
                     using transparency
                     A key question is what citizens do with information they obtain as a result
                     of transparency, beyond individual actions of complaining or optimally
                     choosing what part of the bureaucracy to engage with. In most of the
                     models already reviewed, citizens use information to vote politicians in or
                     out of office. However, a lot of the effective control takes place through
                     civil society activities such as petitioning, lobbying, and challenging
                     official decisions in court. Examples of this are the actions of consumer
                     advocate organizations, unions, and business associations. As mentioned
                     in the context of the logic of collective action, group activity may pursue
                     particularistic objectives rather than the general interest. A good system
                     will maintain a balance between competing special interests, and more
                     transparency is likely to aid all groups in mutually checking each other.

                                    LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



    Political scientists have advanced the view that transparency and
accountability can be created by design in the regulation of agencies,
guaranteeing a level playing field for various interests to engage with the
rule-making process (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987). In this view,
citizens can be empowered via the design of administrative procedures
to act as monitors (in the third type of principal-agent relationship) and
as principals themselves. Certain aspects of administrative procedure
are directly linked to transparency, such as freedom of information acts.
Another relevant concept in the United States is the Government in the
Sunshine Act (1976), which limits what parts of the policy-making process
can remain opaque.
    Citizens’ capacity to influence bureaucratic processes is unequally
distributed. As stated by McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987, 261),
“the resources available for representation in the administrative process
vary systematically and predictably among interests.” This motivates the
question of how groups organize and what institutions and initiatives
facilitate pluralistic citizen organization along healthy lines. This question
is important because, according to the Olsonian logic of collective action,
endeavors that might be costly when undertaken individually may become
affordable when undertaken collectively (Olson 1965). This “cost savings”
is especially true for actions that resemble public goods, like generating
and using information to hold leaders accountable, challenging official
decisions in court, and counterbalancing another interest group.
    Transparency can have ambiguous effects even with citizens as moni-
tors. Gavazza and Lizzeri (2007a) study cases in which publicizing the best
bureaus permits more efficient queuing, but may dampen the incentives of
the better bureaucrats to invest in lowering waiting times.
    Another mode of citizen engagement is through complaint. Prendergast
(2003) studies how complaints may yield value to the management of the
bureaucracy. A central government may rely on elections at the local level
or even permit rioting as an additional way to monitor the performance
of local governments.
    One important problem in citizens’ ability to hold powerful lead-
ers accountable is the phenomena of clientelism, vote buying, and elite
control over coercive state institutions. Some early contributions to the
vote-­buying literature expanded principal-agent models to cases wherein a
special interest (a principal) sought to provide incentives to legislators, seen
as agents (Groseclose and Snyder 1996; Snyder 1991). A highly stripped-
down model of vote buying that aids in the understanding of influence

                                                                                      115

                     over both committees and general electorates is analyzed in E. Dal Bó
                     (2007), where again principals can direct payments to voters who act as
                     agents. The analysis shows that when voters care about the outcome (rather
                     than just about how they vote), each voter exerts a “voting externality” over
                     the others, which causes inefficiencies to arise. This is the fundamental
                     difference between a market for typical goods and a market for votes.
                         Because the market for government policies is very different from the
                     market for goods, establishing protections for the independence of the vote
                     can be valuable. E. Dal Bó (2007) introduces analysis of the secrecy of the
                     ballot when vote buying is a concern and finds that secret ballots can help
                     when voters care about the outcome (as in general elections), but may hurt
                     when voters care about their vote per se (as with legislators voting under
                     monitoring by their constituencies, suggesting that voting in legislatures
                     should be public, but ballots in general elections should be secret).5
                         Dekel, Jackson, and Wolinsky (2008) consider a dynamic setup in
                     which principals can compete for votes. They show that voters tend to be
                     better off when vote buyers cannot directly buy votes up front, but can
                     only make promises contingent on winning (that is, campaign promises),
                     a result that would also recommend secret ballots. Note that secret bal-
                     lots are a constraint on transparency, but may help maintain citizens as
                     principals in the political game rather than agents. Baland and Robinson
                     (2008) study a model in which landowners sell the votes of their workers
                     and, in turn, offer them contracts that leave rents but stipulate their politi-
                     cal behavior. The authors examine the introduction of the secret ballot in
                     Chile in 1958 and show how it decreased the vote for the right wing more
                     where there were more rural workers who were dependent on landowner
                     contracts, suggesting that the secret ballot increased the independence of
                     the vote.
                         Powerful leaders, whether landowning patrons or political leaders, may
                     offer compensation other than direct cash. To provide two examples from
                     the vast literature on clientelism and electoral particularism, Anderson,
                     Francois, and Kotwal (2015) consider the exchange of insurance for
                     votes in rural India. Lizzeri and Persico (2001, 2004) consider political
                     elites who compete using two instruments: particularistic transfers (as in
                     Myerson [1993]) and public goods with diffuse benefits. Conditional on
                     the cost of producing public goods, transfers confer an advantage at court-
                     ing voters because transfers can be targeted more narrowly. These papers
                     study factors that can mitigate the underprovision of public goods. Lizzeri
                     and Persico (2001) compare the advantages of proportional representation

116
                                  LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



versus winner-take-all systems, and Lizzeri and Persico (2004) examine
the extension of the franchise as an inducement toward less particular-
ism. Lizzeri and Persico (2004) show that when voters can be courted in
these ways, more political competition (a higher number of parties) can
exacerbate the incentives to cultivate narrow constituencies, leading to less
efficient outcomes.


Political engagement and transparency
shape beliefs and behavioral norms
The analysis of norms and, in particular, of what might create informal
authority and legitimacy are difficult topics in the research frontier.
However, several approaches yield valuable insights. To begin with, citizen
beliefs can matter to political accountability in several natural ways. In
models of electoral discipline, citizen expectations about officials’ per-
formance can drive equilibria to display high or low performance (Barro
1973; Myerson 2006). But central aspects of the institutional architecture,
such as federalism, can contribute to pinning down beliefs, thereby ruling
out systematic bad equilibria (Myerson 2006). This implies that institu-
tions and norms can interact, with certain types of institutions preventing
“bad-norm equilibria.” The beliefs of citizens can also be important in
driving outcomes in settings where pandering, rather than shirking, is a
possibility. Frisell (2009) studies how widespread beliefs about the corrupt-
ibility of officials make idiosyncratic policy choices seem suspect, thereby
providing honest politicians with incentives to pander (“populism”).6
   Citizen norms can also affect how a particular institution (for example,
unemployment benefits) affects outcomes. For example, if living off of
benefits is deemed acceptable, moral hazard will be acute and taxpay-
ers will desire low welfare benefits in political equilibrium (Lindbeck,
Nyberg, and Weibull 1999). In a more abstract environment, P. Dal Bó
(2007) shows that under community enforcement, beliefs can support not
only cooperative equilibria, as typically characterized by folk theorems
pertaining to bilateral games, but also highly unequal and “discrimina-
tory” equilibria. These equilibria include “royal” equilibria in which one
actor always defects to take an action with social cost on others, but enjoys
cooperative behavior by all others, and a “caste” equilibrium in which
each higher caste takes an action that imposes a cost on lower castes but
enjoys cooperation from them. Thus, citizen beliefs can undergird social

                                                                                    117
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     structures that shape basic patterns of social interaction. Can these patterns
                     be improved? Expectations about mutual behavior do much to determine
                     what is perceived as legitimate behavior. This situation, however, only begs
                     the question of what exactly legitimate behavior might be and what could
                     enhance it.
                         Dal Bó, Foster, and Putterman (2010) offer an experimental design
                     that enables a view of legitimacy and legitimate behavior as what arises
                     when people choose their own rules of the game. In their experiment,
                     subjects can vote for a policy (or institutional) reform that will transform
                     a prisoners’ dilemma game into a coordination game. Subjects may then
                     find themselves in the new game either as a result of their own votes
                     (an endogenous, “organic,” reform), or as a result of an arbitrary, random
                     decision of the computer (an exogenous reform). Subjects coordinate in the
                     good equilibrium significantly more often when they access the coordina-
                     tion game because of their own decision rather than the computer’s, even
                     if the information about the vote is held constant, suggesting a buy-in or
                     legitimating effect, of the reform bestowed by the democratic process. If
                     homegrown policies and institutions will be more effective at improving
                     behavior, it would be important to enable healthy political engagement
                     wherever possible to select both policies and new institutions.
                         Akerlof (2015) offers a model of legitimacy-based authority, that is, the
                     level of orders that a principal can give that will be carried out by the agent
                     because following orders is a “duty.” The model can be applied to gain an
                     understanding of performance and behavioral norms in complex public
                     bureaucracies. Akerlof shows how the model is operationally equivalent
                     to agents monitoring each other to ensure compliance with orders when
                     leaders have greater legitimacy. If legitimacy is lacking, however, the agent
                     will reject that there is a duty and revert to considering the incentives to
                     comply, as in standard principal-agent models with moral hazard.
                         However, the origins of legitimacy are not modeled in Akerlof (2015).
                     Bolstering legitimacy is treated as an investment decision of leaders. The
                     notion of legitimacy of leadership links with the previously mentioned
                     work on how legitimacy for cooperative behavior can arise from democratic
                     processes (Dal Bó, Foster, and Putterman 2010).
                         A way to improve interactions both among people and between people
                     and officials might be to have leaders that exemplify certain types of
                     behavior. Hermalin (1998) provides an early analysis of how an informed
                     leader may promote efforts by others through his or her own effort, thereby
                     signaling the worth of a task (see also Komai et al. [2007]). The behavior

118
                                    LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



of leaders can also shift political norms under which citizens feel indignant
about bad performance and act to hold leaders accountable (Bidner and
Francois 2013). Acemoglu and Jackson (2015) also offer a theory in which
the behavior of leaders (actors whose actions are visible to all) affects norms
(citizen beliefs about mutual behavior). In the last three papers, leaders can
take actions that subsequently lead to citizens’ adopting cooperative social
or political norms.
    Taken together, this body of work suggests a pathway from political
changes to the strengthening of bureaucratic institutions for service deliv-
ery. If “clean” politics can bolster the legitimacy of leaders for delivering
public goods and the reverse is true when politics is “dirty,” cleaning up
politics can be an avenue for larger changes in how bureaucratic institu-
tions function. Bolstered legitimacy of political leaders for delivering pub-
lic goods and leaders’ roles in signaling a shift in behavioral norms, might
translate into improvements to the culture of performance in bureaucra-
cies. In environments in which politics is becoming cleaner, public officials
and frontline service providers may be more inclined to monitor each other
to comply with rules rather than bend them for private gain.
    The theme of legitimacy is also raised in Basu (2015), who is motivated
by the question of the interplay of laws and norms. He argues that behav-
ioral traits as well as citizen beliefs can result in a change in the incentives
of enforcers and generate multiple equilibria. In that context, the law
may have an expressive component that acts as an equilibrium-selection
device. Acemoglu and Jackson (2015) analyze the interplay between laws
and norms through a model in which private parties choose complemen-
tary levels of a behavior before being matched with each other. The law
stipulates a threshold beyond which behavior is illegal. Multiple equilibria
arise; aside from actions being complementary, detection of illegality by
enforcers depends on whistleblowing by the parties, which leads to mutual
expectations of behavior relevant to expectations of law enforcement. In
this context, tighter laws affect the prevalence of law breaking, as well as
the level choices of law breakers and law abiders, in relation to prevalent
mutual expectations. Thus, the effectiveness of the law at shaping behavior
(and setting future norms) depends on initially prevalent norms.


Emergence of citizens’ demands for public goods
The very experience of political engagement and the outcomes it produces
for quality of government and service delivery, can lead to evolution

                                                                                      119
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     in political behavior toward the larger public interest. The previously
                     mentioned work of Bidner and Francois (2013) has this flavor, whereby
                     citizens become frustrated with corruption and increasingly intolerant of
                     transgressions by leaders. This situation leads to a shift in political norms
                     toward punishing corruption. Establishing anticorruption norms among
                     citizens is also the idea in Dixit (2015), who examines the role of the busi-
                     ness community in reducing the supply of bribes to government officials
                     in the award of licenses and contracts.
                        A rise in demand among the elite for public goods has been linked
                     to historical episodes of institutional reform. Lizzeri and Persico (2004)
                     explain the extension of suffrage by English elites in the mid- to late-1800s
                     as arising from an increase in the value of urban public goods following
                     the industrial revolution (public health infrastructure such as sewerage,
                     waterworks, and paved roads). A majority of the franchised elite pushed for
                     reforms to extend the suffrage so that political parties would have stronger
                     incentives to deliver these public goods. Consistent with their explanation,
                     the authors document that following suffrage reforms, spending by munic-
                     ipal corporations on public health infrastructure increased substantially.
                        Demand for common-interest public goods and inclusive political
                     institutions are highlighted by Besley and Persson (2009) as part of the
                     explanation for the origins of state capacity. The building of legal and fis-
                     cal institutions of the state, which are needed to support markets, protect
                     property rights, and provide public goods, are linked in their model to
                     conditions that enable citizens to come together for a common purpose.
                        If citizen beliefs and demands are important because of how they interact
                     with institutions and with politicians, one avenue to improving outcomes
                     would be to foster interventions that affect those beliefs and demands for
                     common-interest public goods. The literature on persuasion offers guid-
                     ance on how to approach that agenda7 and is part of the review of empirical
                     evidence in chapter 6. An important question is whether transparency may
                     affect beliefs, and thereby change how citizens engage with institutions,
                     leading to an interaction between transparency and modes of engagement.
                     Transparency can increase the value of specific modes of engagement
                     and do so in ways that increase the value of transparency.8 Elections and
                     mass media are two institutional elements through which transparency
                     and citizen engagement can potentially interact as strategic complements.
                     Both elections and media have the potential to coordinate citizen action.
                     Fearon (2011) offers a theory in which elections coordinate voters’ beliefs
                     about compliance by the ruler and thus also coordinate their readiness to

120
                                    LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



revolt when incumbents ignore the electoral calendar or results. A similar
role is played by royal courts in the model by Myerson (2008), wherein a
common venue allows the nobles to learn how the king is treating each
of them. Yanagizawa-Drott (2014) offers a model in which media play a
similar role as a coordination device. Although the effects of media in
politics have been studied, disentangling pure coordinating effects from
other, more direct, encouragement effects is difficult. The evidence in
Yanagizawa-Drott (2014) shows that media can be used to manipulate
citizens and coordinate actions, and even do so in negative directions, as
in the role of radio in promoting participation in the Rwandan genocide.
    This issue links back to the discussion of how media can affect political
selection and incentives depending upon the nature of its programming
content—whether it reflects capture by political leaders or by special inter-
ests, or whether more diverse and plural media flourish to reveal informa-
tion that is relevant for accountability. Empirical advances discussed in
chapter 6 suggest that the role of media is a challenging yet crucial area for
governance policy. The challenges arise from how even plural media that
are independent of state control can sometimes work to reduce political
engagement and polarize the electorate.
    Previous sections deal with the fact that politicians may gain from
opacity and media slant, and may prevent all valuable information from
reaching voters. The chapter also covers the fact that voters may face
­collective-action issues in acting on the information they do have. Problems
 with clientelism notwithstanding, voting is a low-cost activity and could be
 relied upon more when it comes to engaging citizens in decision making.
 But voter capacity issues arise—voters may lack the capacity to keep track
 of all relevant issues and metrics. A literature on political behavior9 studies
the ability of voters to compose a “political picture” by relying on partisan
cues and other information-economizing heuristics. But as Caplan (2007)
shows, substantial gaps remain between the policy opinions of experts and
average voters. Bartels (1996) argues that voter information gaps can have
large political consequences. Several voter biases have been characterized,
such as antimarket and antiforeign biases. However, little is known about
structural characteristics that may lead voters to error. This situation is
intriguing given that the possibility of voter error is an assumption in the
pandering models reviewed previously.
    Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Eyster (2013) propose a conceptual framework
based on the idea that voters may underappreciate equilibrium effects,
leading to a demand on their part for inefficient policies and institutions,

                                                                                      121
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     and show experimental evidence to support this idea. According to the
                     evidence, voters fail to democratically solve social dilemmas (such as
                     getting out of the tragedy of the commons) because they perceive the
                     direct effects of policy on payoffs, but not its indirect effects through the
                     induced changes in the behavior of other players. Voters reject Pigovian
                     taxes that help internalize externalities and improve equilibrium payoffs
                     because their immediate, visible effect, being a tax, is to lower payoffs.
                     The evidence suggests that experience with all policy options, or at
                     least voter education on the relevant options, is a necessary condition
                     for overcoming this type of voting failure. Understanding the way in
                     which civil society can expand voter capacity is a pending assignment
                     for future research.


                     This chapter has cast governance problems as a sequence of principal-agent
                     problems, as follows: (i) between citizens and political leaders; (ii) between
                     political leaders and public officials who lead government agencies; and
                     (iii) between public officials and frontline providers. Political engagement
                     and transparency shape all three of these principal-agent relationships in
                     fundamental ways.
                         Citizen engagement matters to governance outcomes. Engagement
                     involves various dimensions: whether citizens act as principals or agents,
                     citizen beliefs and expectations, and citizens’ empowerment to act on
                     information. When citizens are engaged as agents rather than princi-
                     pals, for example, as a result of vote buying, this typically leads to inef-
                     ficiency. This outcome is true even when candidates compete for votes,
                     because competition may push candidates to target narrow majorities
                     via particularistic benefits, eschewing public goods. This situation is
                     typical of clientelist systems. The ability of different groups to engage,
                     cooperate with each other, and achieve tighter accountability varies,
                     sometimes with socioeconomic characteristics, but also with aspects
                     of the design of the policy process and institutions, such as democratic
                     mechanisms and federalism. If citizen collective action is an important
                     component of engagement, a crucial question is how best to promote
                     pluralistic citizen organization.
                         The chapter shows how disciplining leaders and selecting different
                     types of leaders matters for governance and development outcomes.
                     Transparency about both policy actions and policy consequences is essen-
                     tial. When information about policy consequences is lacking, transparency

122
                                      LEARNING FROM THE LOGIC OF THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE



about policy actions may be counterproductive, leading to pandering and
populism by politicians seeking to please uninformed citizens. In contrast,
information about policy consequences can strengthen the ability of citi-
zens to hold leaders accountable for outcomes.
   Citizen beliefs about politicians, the political process, and public
policies are relevant. Political norms that ingrain expectations of low
performance perpetuate underperformance, be it corruption, shirking, or
pandering. In addition, pandering is more likely when politicians are not
trusted, which would occur when corruption is high. Thus, corruption, by
creating a culture of distrust, has the indirect effect of fostering pandering.
Political engagement, and the leaders selected through it, can help shift
political beliefs and norms of political behavior among citizens, potentially
enabling societies to escape low-performance traps to improve governance

  1. Direct citizen participation in providing public goods is separate from this
      principal-agent setting because it consists of citizens directly contributing
      their labor and monetary resources to the maintenance of local public goods
      and the management of funds that are devolved to community-based orga-
      nizations. Citizen engagement by public officials to provide technical inputs
      into the formulation of public policies, such as, for example, regulatory
      agencies seeking feedback from businesses in rule-making, is also separate
      from this principal-agent setting. These forms of direct citizen participation
      in the provision of public goods and in the crafting of public policies and
      regulations, are not within the scope of this report.
  2.  See, for example, the seminal work by Olson (1965).
  3. On the issue of candidate character, see also Kartik and McAffee (2007) and
      Bernheim and Kartik (2014).
  4.  Their treatment draws on Strömberg (2004a, 2004b).
  5. Levy (2007) considers transparency in committees where members are not
      targeted by vote buyers but where members care about their reputation. She
      shows that transparency in committees, by allowing a tighter attribution of a
      collective decision to individual inputs, may make committees less “conform-
      ist” and more likely to pass reforms.
  6.  On populism, see also Acemoglu, Egorov, and Sonin (2013).
  7.  See DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2010) for a review of the literature.
  8. A different example of the interaction between transparency and modes of
      engagement is provided earlier in the chapter, in the context of information
      about different government bureaus that can lead to actions (queuing) that
      lower the value of transparency (Gavazza and Lizzeri 2007a).

CHAPTER FIVE




Evidence on the Impact
of Political Engagement

Overview
This chapter provides evidence from research across a variety of contexts
that political engagement has profound consequences for governance, pol-
icy selection, and development outcomes, often in highly nuanced ways.
Healthy political engagement, when citizens select and sanction leaders on
the basis of performance in delivering public goods, can improve develop-
ment outcomes by changing the incentives of and encouraging the selec-
tion of better-quality leaders. Unhealthy political engagement, conversely,
create incentives for leaders to extract private rents from public resources,
at the expense of the public goods needed for development. The next two
sections cover this evidence on the nuanced effects of political engage-
ment on incentives and selection of different types of leaders. Much of the
available evidence focuses on testing the impact of political engagement
by individual voters through elections. Less evidence is available on the
impact of political engagement by elite citizens and by civil society orga-
nizations outside of elections. What is available suggests that the impact
of organized groups has important interactions with and ultimately works
through electoral institutions.
   The next section reviews empirical research which supports the theo-
retical insights (in chapter 4) that the experience of political engagement
and the leaders selected through it shape behavioral norms. It first reviews
the evidence on how the leaders selected through political engagement
themselves influence norms. Second, it reviews a literature on the impact of

ness of those institutions influences norms. More inclusive institutions that
facilitated the engagement of larger groups of citizens are associated with

                     norms of cooperation among citizens. A history of cooperative norms is, in
                     turn, associated with political engagement functioning in healthy ways in
                     current times. Conversely, exclusionary historical institutions, which con-
                     centrated power in the hands of a few elites, are associated with unhealthy
                     political engagement and worse development outcomes.
                        Finally, the last section of this chapter shows that strengthening public
                     sector institutions through formal capacity building is not enough because
                     informal norms of political behavior play a significant role in how those
                     institutions actually function. Persistence in norms regardless of changes
                     in formal institutions has implications for the transition from weak to
                     strong institutions of government. Historical accounts of how effective
                     state capacity and institutional change comes about are consistent with
                     the role of healthy political engagement in creating the conditions for that
                     change. Improvements in the quality of political engagement are crucial
                     for improving governance.


                     Impact of political engagement on the incentives
                     of leaders
                     This section reviews the literature on the impact of political engagement
                     on governance, policy selection, and development outcomes, which oper-
                     ates through its impact on the incentives of leaders. It begins by briefly
                     reviewing cross-country evidence on the correlation between national-
                     level indicators of political engagement and growth. It then moves on to
                     discuss the evidence of the impact of political engagement on outcomes
                     within countries.
                        Political engagement happens in every institutional context, democra-
                     cies and autocracies, albeit in different ways. The main effect examined
                     in the literature is when there is scope for greater political engagement by
                     a large number of individual citizens acting as voters and as contenders
                     for leadership because of electoral institutions, versus when they do not,
                     that is, when power over leaders is instead concentrated among elites or
                     organized groups.


                     Cross-country evidence
                     A wave of cross-country research has examined whether countries with
                     electoral institutions exhibit different economic performance than those

with nonelectoral institutions that restrict the power of citizens to disci-
pline leaders. While the cross-country correlation between democracy and
economic growth is much debated, recent research reports a robust positive
association. On average, this evidence suggests that political engagement
through electoral institutions leads to better development outcomes. Yet,
clear examples can be pointed to where autocracies outperform democra-
cies. Research examining these differences in outcomes concludes that the
key question that applies to both autocracies and democracies is whether
leaders are selected and sanctioned on the basis of performance in deliv-
ering public goods. That is, the variation across countries shows that
the impact of political engagement on economic outcomes depends on
whether it is healthy or unhealthy.
   Acemoglu et al. (2014) provide robust evidence that democratic institu-
tions lead to greater growth in the long run, using data from both Freedom
House and Polity IV. They study the effect of democratization within
countries over time, controlling for forms of institutional variation across
countries other than democracy. They report extensive robustness tests,
using different measures of democracy and different methods of estima-
tion, including to account for the dynamics inherent in how gross domestic
product (GDP) changes over time. Their finding is that democratization
contributes to a sustained positive impact on economic growth.
   Other recent work examining the political determinants of variation
across countries in economic growth is consistent with the results and
conclusions of Acemoglu et al. (2014). Papaioannou and Siourounis (2008)
look at the growth effects of permanent democratic transitions, building
on the Polity IV data. They find that transitions to democracy are associ-
ated with a roughly one percent increase in annual real per capita GDP
growth. Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) also identify transitions to democ-
racy using Polity IV data. They find that transitions to democracy do not
take place at the expense of economic growth and often lead to short-term
boosts in growth and reductions in economic volatility. Mobarak (2005)
uses Polity IV data and finds a negative correlation between democracy
and economic volatility. Rodrik (2000) provides a range of evidence—that
democracies have more stable and predictable growth, handle adverse
shocks better, and deliver better distributional outcomes—to support the
contention that democracies are able to build better institutions that are
suited to local conditions, to support economic outcomes.
   Andersen et al. (2014) link the democracy measures in Polity IV to
corruption outcomes. The authors find that changes in the world price of

                                                                                      131

                     oil, resulting in exogenous shocks to petroleum rents, lead to an increase
                     in hidden wealth abroad (measured by bank deposits in offshore finan-
                     cial centers) in petroleum-rich autocracies, but with no similar effect for
                     petroleum-rich democracies. They interpret this evidence as follows: politi-
                     cal elites are more easily able to turn petroleum rents into political rents in
                     countries that lack political constraints, as measured using Polity IV data.
                        Easterly (2011) examines the notion of a “benevolent autocrat” that has
                     been regarded in some public policy quarters as a way of achieving eco-
                     nomic development goals. In fixed-effects regressions decomposing growth
                     variation into variation between leaders and within leaders, Easterly (2011)
                     finds no results supporting growth effects for autocrats. He reports that the
                     effect of leaders accounts for more of the variation in growth in democra-
                     cies than in autocracies. He further argues that the notion of a benevolent
                     autocrat as a leadership paradigm is in large part rooted in cognitive biases.
                     For example, trends in newspaper coverage show considerably more report-
                     ing of successful autocrats compared with unsuccessful ones. As a result
                     of overreporting and relatively abundant information, individuals’ percep-
                     tions of an autocrat achieving high growth rates may be upwardly biased.
                        The above-reviewed evidence does not mean that democracies invari-
                     ably produce better outcomes. In fact, Besley and Kudamatsu (2008) and
                     Keefer (2011) provide evidence that some autocracies are more success-
                     ful than many democracies. Besley and Kudamatsu (2008) model the
                     conditions under which autocracies can produce better outcomes than
                     democracies. Their main argument is that if an autocracy is governed by a
                     selectorate (that is, a group of presumably elite citizens with the power to
                     select the leader), and if the selectorate exercises control to discipline poor
                     performance, then the autocracy will promote good policies. Societies in
                     which elites do not have norms and capacity to sanction leaders, or where
                     elites benefit from leaders staying in office despite poor performance,
                     would not satisfy the criteria for successful autocracies. Empirically, the
                     authors characterize successful autocracies as those that had a growth rate
                     above the 80th percentile of the distribution. Consistent with their theo-
                     retical explanation, they show that autocracies that are successful accord-
                     ing to their definition of high growth are associated with more leadership
                     turnover.
                        Keefer’s (2011) argument is conceptually similar. He shows that orga-
                     nized political parties can solve collective-action problems by holding
                     leaders accountable for performance. The analog to the selectorate in his
                     work is the organized party. Empirically, he finds that measures of party

organization outperform measures of democracy in explaining variation
in governance and growth across countries. Keefer (2007) provides other
evidence of differences between nascent and established democracies that
is consistent with the importance of organized political parties in democra-
cies in holding leaders accountable. Younger democracies are more corrupt;
exhibit less rule of law, lower levels of bureaucratic quality, and secondary
school enrollment; and spend more on public investment and government
workers.
    A common thread in this literature that applies to both democratic and
autocratic institutional arrangements, is whether leaders are selected and
sanctioned on the basis of performance. Besley and Kudamatsu (2008)
show how the performance of both democracies and autocracies depends
on the political environment within which each system of government is
implemented. They show that although a successful autocracy performs
better than a polarized democracy in which elections do not reward
public interest policies, the autocracy is, in turn, outperformed by a well-­
functioning democracy in which public interest policies are politically
salient. The worst of all systems in their model are autocracies in which
leaders are able to maintain their grip on power despite bad performance.
Consistent with their model and with other work (Mobarak 2005; Rodrik
2000), they document a high degree of variance of growth under autocra-
cies compared with democracies.


Within-country evidence
This report is not about whether electoral institutions at the national level
are better or worse than other national political systems. It moves beyond
cross-country evidence on the effects of national political systems, to focus
on within-country evidence on the nuances of political engagement within
the same national context and how its specific characteristics matter for
governance and for development outcomes.
   Research is growing on the impact of electoral institutions within
countries across the spectrum of national political systems. One body of
evidence uses institutional variation in term limits across local political
jurisdictions to examine the effects of reelection incentives on leaders’
behavior. Besley and Case (1995) pioneered this literature, showing that
term limits affect the fiscal policies chosen by U.S. governors. Between
1950 and 1986, per capita taxes were higher during the final term of term-
limited governors who did not have to face voters again. This shows that

                                                                                       133
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     in a context where taxation, or the size of government, is the most salient
                     policy issue in political competition, as in the United States political
                     engagement shapes leaders’ incentives toward that policy. List and Sturm
                     (2006) build upon Besley and Case (1995) to provide evidence that elec-
                     toral incentives influence other policy areas in the United States as well,
                     which are not as salient as taxation, such as environmental policy.
                        The methodology for estimating the impact of electoral institutions has
                     been fruitfully applied to a wide variety of developing countries. Several
                     papers examine variation across municipalities within Brazil when directly
                     elected mayors face term limits versus when they are eligible for reelection.
                     Ferraz and Finan (2011) show that reelection incentives reduce corruption.
                     Comparing mayors who are in their first terms with those who are in their
                     second terms and can no longer be reelected, they find that second-term
                     mayors have greater indicators of corruption. Second-term corruption is
                     more pronounced among municipalities with less access to information
                     and where the likelihood of judicial punishment is lower.
                        De Janvry, Finan, and Sadoulet (2012) examine whether reelection
                     incentives affect the performance of a decentralized conditional cash
                     transfer program in Brazil. They too exploit the variation in reelection
                     incentives induced by term limits. They show that although this federal
                     program successfully reduced school dropout rates by 8 percentage points,
                     the program’s impact was 36 percent larger in municipalities governed
                     by mayors who faced reelection possibilities compared with those with
                     lame-duck mayors. First-term mayors with good program performance
                     were much more likely to get reelected. These mayors adopted program
                     implementation practices that were not only more transparent, but also
                     were associated with better program outcomes.
                        Burgess et al. (2015) and Casey (2015) provide evidence of the impor-
                     tance of electoral competition in Sub-Saharan Africa where ethnic favorit-
                     ism distorts economic policies. They find that electoral competition can
                     reduce ethnicity-related policy distortions. Burgess et al. (2015) quantify
                     ethnic favoritism in public investment, in particular, road construction in
                     Kenya. They show that during the 1963–2011 period, districts in Kenya
                     that shared ethnicity with the president received twice as much expenditure
                     on roads and had four times the length of paved roads built. They further
                     show that this patronage took place mostly during autocratic periods and
                     not during the periods of multiparty political competition. Casey (2015)
                     examines whether local elections, where voters may have more informa-
                     tion about local candidates compared with national-level elections, helps

relax ethnic and partisan loyalties in Sierra Leone. She finds that in local
elections, citizens exhibit greater willingness to cross ethnic-party lines.1
   Evidence is also available from China—where elections are held at the
village level. Martínez-Bravo et al. (2011) argue that local elections in
China support accountability of local leaders to citizens. In a companion
paper, Martínez-Bravo et al. (2014) argue that local electoral institutions
can improve local government performance in delivering public goods,
compared with bureaucratic monitoring through upper-level governments.
For this work, the authors construct a panel data set of village administra-
tive records to document the history of political reforms and economic
policies for more than 200 villages. The research design relies on the stag-
gered timing of the introduction of village elections to identify its effects.2
   Other results are available on the role of local elections within autocratic
national political systems. Martínez-Bravo (2014) examines the behavior
of local officials during the transition to democracy in Indonesia after
1999. Specifically, she examines whether local officials’ incentives differ
depending on whether the local officials are appointed or elected. The
method of selecting local officials varies across Indonesia. The country is
divided into two types of villages: desa , where the village head is elected
by villagers; and kelurahan , where the village head is appointed by the
district mayor. Martínez-Bravo (2014) finds that President Suharto’s party
was 5.5 percentage points more likely to win in villages that had appointed
heads, relative to villages that had elected heads. The results suggest that
in villages where the people elected their local leaders, they were more able
to vote against the dominant party in contrast to where the local leaders
were appointed by that party. The results also show that elected leaders
can influence governance through their control over appointed public
officials. Within districts where the main opposition party won by a tight
margin, the villages where President Suharto’s party won experienced a
    percentage point higher probability of turnover of their appointed
7.4 ­
village heads than did the villages where another party won. Similarly,
within districts where President Suharto’s party won by a tight margin, the
probability of appointed village head turnover was 19 percentage points
lower in villages where President Suharto’s party won than in villages
where another party won.
   The above studies undertaken in the contexts of local elections within
nondemocratic national regimes are linked to the results of Enikolopov
and Zhuravskaya (2007), who show that appointing local politicians rather
than electing them does not improve the results of fiscal decentralization.

                                                                                        135

                     That is, local electoral institutions through which citizens select leaders,
                     rather than appointments by higher-tier authorities, makes a significant
                     difference for local accountability across a variety of national political
                     systems.
                        Evidence of the importance of electoral institutions for accountabil-
                     ity also comes from a strand of literature that finds that restrictions on
                     political engagement by individual voters—because of limited suffrage
                     laws, or voter capacity constraints, or because of elite control of economic
                     resources—are associated with worse outcomes than when larger numbers
                     of citizens are effectively enfranchised.
                        Miller (2008) examines the effects of enfranchisement on policy out-
                     comes in the United States. He uses the staggered introduction of women’s
                     suffrage in the United States to show that suffrage laws were followed by
                     immediate shifts in legislative behavior and sudden large increases in local
                     public health spending. This growth in public health spending fueled
                     large-scale door-to-door hygiene campaigns, and child mortality declined
                     by 8–15 percent (or 20,000 annual child deaths nationwide).
                        Contrasting the impact of women’s suffrage with the continuing dis-
                     enfranchisement of black southerners in the United States, Carruthers
                     and Wanamaker (2015) provide further evidence of the importance of
                     voting for public service outcomes. They find that female voter enfran-
                     chisement can account for up to one-third of the 1920–40 rise in public
                     school expenditures. Yet, these increases in school resources were dispro-
                     portionately targeted at white schools, where gains far outpaced those for
                     schools serving the black population. As a result, the authors conclude that
                     women’s suffrage exacerbated racial inequality in education expenditures
                     and substantially delayed relative gains in black human capital observed
                     later in the century.
                        Fujiwara (2015) studies the introduction of electronic voting in Brazil
                     and finds that it improved health services by effectively enfranchising poor
                     and less educated voters. Electronic voting was introduced at scale in the
                     1998 elections. But because of a limited supply of devices, only munici-
                     palities with more than 40,500 registered voters used the new technology.
                     Using a regression discontinuity design, Fujiwara finds that electronic
                     voting reduced residual votes, or those that are not counted because of
                     irregularities at the polling booth, in state legislature elections by a magni-
                     tude larger than 10 percent of total turnout, thus effectively enfranchising
                     millions of voters. Consistent with the hypothesis that these voters were
                     more likely to be less educated, the effects are larger in municipalities with

higher illiteracy rates. Moreover, electronic voting raises the vote shares of
left-wing parties. These results are not driven by the (nonexistent) effects
on turnout or candidate entry. The author finds that electronic voting was
associated with a rise in the number of prenatal visits by health profession-
als and a drop in the prevalence of low-weight births (below 2,500 grams)
by less educated women, but not for the more educated. The effects on
health outcomes are striking, but should be treated with caution because
the variables are measured at the state level, with consequently lower
power of the empirical test to identify the impact of electronic voting at
the municipal level.
    Kudamatsu (2012) finds that the emergence of democracy in Sub-
Saharan Africa in the post–Cold War period reduces infant mortality
by 1.2 percentage points or 12 percent of the sample mean. He compiles
indicators of political competition and leader turnover, and links it to a
Demographic and Health Survey retrospective panel of mother-level fer-
tility and infant mortality data to study 11 episodes of democratization
since 1990. He compares the survival of infants (up to 12 months) born
to the same mother before and after democratization. He shows that this
association is robust to a variety of controls including the possible effects
of official development assistance, mother age at the birth of the child,
country-specific birth order, time and other trends, mother asset ownership
and education level, and country-level GDP.
    Elections are not the only way through which large groups of nonelite
citizens can impact the incentives of leaders. Public protests and “revolu-
tions” are also means through which citizens can discipline leaders, the
theory of which was discussed in chapter 4. Empirical evidence is lagging
that theory, but is beginning to emerge. Aidt and Jensen (2014) provide
econometric support for the theory, showing that the threat of revolution
leads to extension of franchise. Acemoglu, Hassan, and Tahoun (2014)
find a negative correlation between the size of street protests in the Arab
Republic of Egypt and the stock market value of politically connected
firms, suggesting that protests can restrict the ability of connected firms
to profit from corruption and favoritism. The authors conduct a series of
event studies around the Arab Spring. They find that in the nine trading
days following Mubarak’s fall, the value of firms connected to the National
Democratic Party fell by about 13 percent relative to the value of noncon-
nected firms. They then use information from Egyptian and international
print and online media to construct a daily estimate of the number of
protesters in Tahrir Square and analyze the effect of these protests on the

                                                                                       137

                     returns of firms connected to the group then in power. Their specifications
                     estimate the differential changes in the stock market values of different
                     types of connected firms relative to nonconnected firms as a function of
                     the size of the protests. They find that a turnout of 500,000 protesters
                     in Tahrir Square lowered the market valuation of firms connected to the
                     incumbent group by 0.8 percent relative to nonconnected firms.
                        Other evidence on the impact of organized groups outside of elections
                     shows that their impact interacts with and works through electoral insti-
                     tutions. Madestam et al. (2013) examine the Tea Party movement in the
                     United States and provide evidence of the effects of political protests on
                     policy making through changes in voting behavior. The paper analyzes the
                     effects of the 2009 nationwide Tax Day Rallies of the Tea Party movement.
                     On April 15, 2009, members of the nascent movement held more than
                     500 protests in cities all across the United States. The authors investigate
                     whether the size of these protests increased public support for the Tea Party
                     position and led to more Republican votes in the 2010 midterm elections.
                     To causally identify these relationships, the authors use rainfall on the
                     protest day as an instrument. The authors show that the size of the protest
                     led to more campaign contributions and changes in voting behavior and
                     policy stances of incumbent politicians.


                     Unhealthy political engagement can weaken incentives of leaders
                     Political competition can involve the practices of vote buying, electoral
                     fraud, violence, and appeals to ethnic identity, with pernicious conse-
                     quences for public goods. Unhealthy political engagement is not confined
                     to voting by individual citizens in elections but can also characterize the
                     actions of organized groups. For example, the findings in Burgess et al.
                     (2015), discussed earlier, that ethnic favoritism in public investment in
                     Kenya occurred particularly under authoritarian regimes, with reductions
                     in ethnicity-based policy distortions during periods of multiparty electoral
                     competition, suggest that groups can organize around ethnic identity to
                     extract targeted benefits.
                        The effects of unhealthy political engagement extend well beyond
                     what individual research papers are in a position to assess. For example,
                     the impact of political engagement around ethnic groups is unlikely to be
                     restricted to the distribution of road investments in Kenya. Theory and
                     available analysis of comparative development in the history of nations
                     (which will be reviewed in the next section), suggest that these political

behaviors can accumulate for far-reaching effects across the economy
through the poor functioning of public sector institutions.
   Elite control over institutions of violence and coercion can account for
unhealthy political engagement and is associated with worse outcomes.
Acemoglu and Robinson (2006a) provide accounts from Colombia and the
U.S. South of the persistence of elite capture of state institutions despite
the de jure extension of voting rights. They show how political elites use
violence against opponents, and coercion and economic sanctions against
voters, to maintain their hold on power despite the formal existence of
electoral institutions and despite poor performance.
   Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson (2014) use variation in the colonial
organization of chieftaincy in Sierra Leone to show that chiefs face fewer
constraints and less political competition in chiefdoms with fewer ruling
families. Places with fewer ruling families have significantly worse devel-
opment outcomes today—in particular, lower rates of educational attain-
ment, child health, nonagricultural employment, and asset ownership.
Similar results are provided by Anderson, Francois, and Kotwal (2015)
from India: variation across villages within a state in the domination of
landed, high-caste elites is associated with variation in the provision of
public investments to fight poverty. Elite domination is likely to lead to
lower levels of antipoverty spending.
   However, the above examples from Sierra Leone and India of the persis-
tence of elite control in some parts of the country also show that in other
parts of the same country, electoral competition has enabled citizens to
weaken elite power. To the extent that government performance in these
other parts, where elite control is presumably weak, continues to exhibit
high levels of corruption and mismanagement, other explanations are
needed for why political engagement does not further improve outcomes.
This is where other research comes in showing widespread electoral mal-
practices that can weaken the ability of voters to hold leaders accountable
(Collier 2009; Vicente and Wantchekon 2009).
   A large body of political science research documents how political rights
of voters, particularly among poor people, are undermined through the
practice of vote buying at election time (Kitschelt and Wilkinson 2008;
Schaffer 2007; Stokes 2005, 2007). The offering of “gifts” or money in
exchange for votes has been found to be widespread in poor democracies,
despite the existence of secret ballots. Khemani (2015) shows that vote buy-
ing is associated with lower provision of broadly delivered pro-poor public
services in health and education.3 The central finding is that in places

                                                                                      139
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     where households report greater vote buying (in direct response to ques-
                     tions about offers of money in exchange for votes at the time of elections),
                     village facility records show lower investment in basic health services for
                     mothers and children. Furthermore, in places with greater vote buying, a
                     higher proportion of children are severely underweight, possibly as a result
                     of the lower public investments.
                        To corroborate the evidence from the Philippines in other countries,
                     Khemani (2015) turns to survey data from the Afrobarometer initiative.
                     In round 5 of the Afrobarometer surveys, respondents were asked whether
                     they had been offered something in exchange for their vote in the most
                     recently concluded elections. A separate and standardized module on
                     experience with service delivery asked about the quality of public schools
                     and health clinics—whether households had experienced any problems in
                     schools and health facilities. Among the 33 countries for which variables
                     measuring both vote buying and service delivery are available, three-
                     quarters of them, or 25, exhibit a robust association between experiencing
                     vote buying and experiencing problems in service delivery. Pooling the data
                     across countries, and including country fixed effects, also yields a highly
                     significant and robust association between vote buying and problems in
                     public schools and health clinics.
                        Anderson, Francois, and Kotwal (2015) similarly show that weakening
                     enfranchisement through clientelist relations between land-owning elite
                     families and agricultural households in Indian villages is associated with
                     lower public investments in social safety nets and antipoverty programs. In
                     related results, Baland and Robinson (2008) find historical evidence that
                     the introduction of the secret ballot in Chile was associated with a decline
                     in votes for right-wing parties and a drop in the price of land (both of
                     which are consistent with a reduction in the power of clientelist relations).
                        Banerjee and Pande (2009) show that caste- or ethnicity-based political
                     parties in India, which mobilize support primarily on the basis of identity
                     appeals, are associated with greater corruption. The economic effects of the
                     ethnic conflict that occurred after Kenya’s 2008 election are examined by
                     Ksoll, Macchiavello, and Morjaria (2014). They put together a rich data set
                     on Kenya’s flower exports market. The authors use daily data on exports
                     from 2004 through 2010 for 104 producers (representing about 90 percent
                     of Kenya’s floriculture market). They combine these data with a firm-level
                     survey conducted after the electoral violence to uncover mechanisms
                     through which the electoral violence affected economic outcomes. They
                     use data from the Red Cross to discern the areas of Kenya where electoral

violence broke out. They then estimate a difference-in-differences model
comparing firms located in areas affected by the violence with firms located
in areas unaffected by the violence over time. The authors find that the
effects of violence reduced export volumes by about 40 percent. The main
mechanism for this drop was a reduction in the labor force (as opposed to
disruption in transportation). At the peak of the violence, work absence
reached close to 50 percent.
   Callen and Long (2015) examine electoral fraud in Afghanistan. First,
they show that fraudulent practices are greater among electoral officials
with political connections. Second, they show how available technology
can support electoral institutions to reduce elite power. The authors imple-
ment an experiment to estimate the causal effect of “photo quick count”—
a technology that allows monitoring of voter tally sheets at polling sta-
tions both prior to and after their aggregation into final vote counts that
would determine the winner of the election. This technology is intended
to reduce fraud in the counting of votes. They provide evidence on the
response of fraud to the credible threat of discovery through monitoring by
announcing photo quick-count measurements to election officials. Photo
quick-count announcements reduced the damaging of election materials
by candidate representatives to 8.1 percent from 18.9 percent. It reduced
votes for politically powerful candidates at a given polling location from
about 21 percent to about 15 percent. This evidence suggests that technol-
ogy can play a role in reducing unhealthy political practices. Although
technology and capacity building are likely needed and play crucial roles
in improving outcomes, investments in technical solutions alone can be
undermined by political incentives and behavioral norms, as further dis-
cussed later in this chapter.


Impact of political engagement through the selection
of different types of leaders
The previous section shows that political engagement can improve gov-
ernance and development outcomes by making leaders accountable to
citizens. Political engagement can also improve outcomes through the
selection of leaders with better characteristics. For example, political
engagement by disadvantaged social groups can lead to the selection of
leaders who are more likely to provide health, education, and targeted
benefits for poverty reduction. Another strand of evidence shows that

                                                                                      141
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     political engagement can enable more competent leaders to be selected,
                     who perform better in governing public resources.
                         Isolating the political engagement effects on economic outcomes
                     through the mechanism of improving leader characteristics, separately
                     from the effect on incentives, is challenging because it requires data on
                     leader characteristics. The bulk of the literature from developing countries
                     is focused on issues of identity—whether being a woman or of a particular
                     caste or religion matters for policy actions of leaders in office. Plausibly
                     exogenous variation in the identity of politicians is often available because
                     of changes in political reservations, creating “natural experiments” from
                     which to draw reliable lessons. The existence of policy instruments that tar-
                     get benefits to specific social groups also makes it possible to measure policy
                     outcomes that are preferred by particular groups to which leaders belong.
                         Empirical work on leader selection is lagging behind theoretical devel-
                     opments. For example, Bernheim and Kartik (2014) and Caselli and
                     Morelli (2004) provide models in which adverse selection of dishonest and
                     incompetent candidates as leaders plays a key role in determining govern-
                     ment performance. Yet little empirical work is available that measures such
                     attributes directly and examines the conditions under which selection can
                     improve. Some strides have been made in the realm of measuring the char-
                     acteristics of public officials and frontline providers (Banuri and Keefer
                     2013; Dal Bó, Finan, and Rossi 2013; Hanna and Wang 2013). This work
                     can be extended to political leaders and to understanding the interaction
                     between the selection of leaders and public officials. Future work also needs
                     to examine the influence of platforms of political competition—whether
                     they consist of broad public goods programs—on the selection of public
                     officials and the environment in which they work.
                         With these caveats in mind, the following discussion suggests that
                     leaders matter and political competition can be important in selecting
                     better-quality leaders. Furthermore, other work suggests that attention to
                     selection is important because elections are a blunt tool for accountability.
                     Good performance of government relies on the capacity of institutions to
                     select leaders who have intrinsic motivation to use their public office for
                     the public good (Besley 2005).


                     The characteristics of leaders matter
                     A body of evidence shows that the characteristics of leaders matter. Jones
                     and Olken (2005) use the deaths by natural causes of leaders while in

142
                                             EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT



office as a source of exogenous variation in leadership, and show that
leaders have an impact on growth. The effects of individual leaders are
strongest in autocratic settings where there are fewer constraints on a
leader’s power. Besley, Montalvo, and Reynal-Querol (2011) build on
Jones and Olken (2005) and extend the data set to include more than
1,000 political leaders between 1875 and 2004. They show that the indi-
vidual characteristics of leaders, particularly education, are important
for growth.
   Using data on the composition of central government expenditures in
a panel of 71 democracies for the period 1972–2003, Brender and Drazen
(2009) test whether changes in leadership induce significant changes in
spending composition. They find that the replacement of a leader tends to
have no significant effect on expenditure composition in the short run. In
the medium term, leadership changes are associated with larger changes in
expenditure composition, mostly in developed countries.
   Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004) provide evidence supporting the
notion that the ideological beliefs of leaders matter in what policies they
decide to support. The evidence shows that successful leaders from the
Democratic party in the United States who win closely contested elections
cast similar votes in congressional proceedings as Democrats who win by
large margins. The authors show how this pattern is consistent with lead-
ers voting for policies according to their own ideological position rather
than responding to the different preferences among their voters in closely
contested versus safe districts. Similarly, they find that Democrats and
Republicans who win by extremely narrow margins are as dissimilar in
their voting patterns as those who win by large margins.
   Alt, de Mesquita, and Rose (2011) build upon Besley and Case (1995)
to try to separate the incentives effects from the selection effects that elec-
tions induce. Their argument is as follows: conditional on the number of
terms, the difference between incumbents who face reelection incentives
and those who do not reflects whether they are subject to the incentives
effect or the accountability effect. The relative performance of term-
limited incumbents in different terms reflects the competence or selection
effect, since each has been reelected a different number of times but has the
same incentive to take costly action on behalf of voters. The authors find
that economic growth is higher and taxes, spending, and borrowing costs
are lower under reelection-eligible incumbents than under term-limited
incumbents, holding tenure in office constant (evidence of an account-
ability effect), and under second-term incumbents than under first-term

                                                                                        143

                     incumbents, holding term-limit status constant (evidence of a selection
                     effect). These two effects are of comparable magnitudes.
                        Humphreys, Masters, and Sandu (2007) conducted a field experiment
                     in democratic deliberation in São Tomé and Príncipe. In these delibera-
                     tions, meetings were moderated by discussion leaders who were randomly
                     assigned to run meetings in 56 sites around the country. The authors show
                     that leadership effects were extremely large, accounting for more than one-
                     third of all variation in the outcomes of the national discussions. They also
                     find a strong correlation between the preferences of the leaders and the
                     outcomes of the meetings.


                     Political competition is associated with the selection
                     of better-quality leaders
                     One strand of evidence shows that political competition is associated with
                     the selection of better-quality leaders, typically measured as the education
                     levels of leaders. Besley and Reynal-Querol (2011) use a data set on 1,400
                     world leaders between 1848 and 2004 and find that compared with autoc-
                     racies, democracies select better educated leaders. Controlling for country
                     and year fixed effects, they find that democracies are 20 percent more
                     likely to select highly educated leaders. Besley, Persson, and Sturm (2005,
                     2010) investigate the effect of political competition in the United States
                     on incentives and selection of better-quality leaders and find a positive
                     relationship. They conclude that greater competition led to the selection
                     of better-quality leaders who pursued better public policies for economic
                     growth rather than extract private rents.
                        Martínez-Bravo (2014) provides evidence that the education of leaders
                     matters for outcomes. She constructs a village-level panel of more than
                     10,000 villages on the island of Java between 1986 and 2003. She inves-
                     tigates the impact of a large school construction program in Indonesia on
                     village governance and public goods provision. Between 1974 and 1978,
                     61,000 new schools were constructed, which doubled the existing stock
                     of schools. This program was associated with a sharp increase in the edu-
                     cational attainment of village heads a decade or more later: their average
                     number of years of schooling increased from 7.6 to 10.2. Examining the
                     impact of the first election in which new educated cohorts run as candi-
                     dates, she finds that this election led to important increases in the provision
                     of key public goods: the number of doctors, the number of schools, and
                     the number of kindergartens.

   Galasso and Nannicini (2011) use a data set on Italian members of par-
liament elected in majoritarian districts from 1994 to 2006 to test whether
political competition results in better politicians. They measure political
contestability in two ways: the margin of victory in the previous political
election, and the district-specific ratio of the number of swing voters to
the difference between the numbers of ideological voters of the two main
coalitions. The quality of a politician is measured by years of schooling,
previous income, and experience in local government. They find that poli-
ticians with more years of schooling, higher preelection income, and more
local experience tend to emerge in more competitive districts.


Inclusive political engagement yields leaders who reduce poverty and
improve human development outcomes
Research on the impact of institutional reforms that made political engage-
ment more inclusive of socially and economically disadvantaged groups
shows that it yielded leaders who are more likely to reduce poverty, improve
human development outcomes, and reduce social discrimination.
   Pande (2003) uses political reservations in India to examine the role of
mandated political representation in providing disadvantaged groups influ-
ence over policy making. The variation used in this paper is at the state
level, and it exploits the fact that the extent of state-level political reserva-
tion enjoyed by a minority group varies by its population share, but is only
revised during census population estimates. This situation creates discrete
changes in representation even though the underlying population share is
continuous. The paper finds that political reservations in Indian states that
yielded more leaders from lower caste groups has increased redistribution
of resources, such as increases in spending on public education programs,
which benefits low-caste groups.
   The impact on poverty of political reservation for disadvantaged minor-
ity groups is examined by Chin and Prakash (2011). The authors find that
increasing the share of seats reserved for the most disadvantaged groups,
the Scheduled Tribes of India, significantly reduces poverty. Greater space
for political engagement by disadvantaged groups has a greater effect on
rural poverty than urban poverty, and appears to benefit people near the
poverty line as well as those far below it.
   Using close election races at the state level in India from which women
emerged as leaders, Clots-Figueras (2011) examines the effect of the gen-
der of leaders on policy choices. The focus on the state level allows her to

                                                                                         145

                     examine the effect of leader identity on a larger set of policy instruments.
                     She finds an important interaction of gender with caste identity. Women
                     elected for state legislative assembly seats that are reserved for historically
                     disadvantaged low-caste groups behave differently from women elected
                     from unreserved constituencies. In reserved constituencies, female legisla-
                     tors spend more on health and less on education and are more likely to
                     support “women-friendly” inheritance laws and pro-poor land reforms
                     compared with male legislators. Female legislators elected from unreserved
                     constituencies are no different from their male counterparts in their sup-
                     port for “women-friendly” laws and are more likely than men to oppose
                     land reforms. They are also different from male legislators in spending
                     patterns, investing more in higher tiers of education and less on social
                     expenditures. Taken together, these results provide significant evidence
                     that promoting the inclusion of historically disadvantaged groups as lead-
                     ers has significant impact on a range of policy choices.
                         Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras (2014) examine whether women state leg-
                     islators in India influence health outcomes for individuals in the districts
                     from which they are elected through the health policy levers available to
                     them. The authors match data on health outcomes, health-related behav-
                     iors, and village-level access to health facilities for a large representative
                     sample of individuals to the gender composition of state legislators around
                     the time of their birth and in the district of their birth. They find that
                     greater representation of women in the state legislature in the birth year
                     and in the two years preceding birth is associated with a significant reduc-
                     tion in neonatal mortality. Additional evidence supports the finding that
                     the mechanism of impact is greater public health investments by women
                     leaders. Female political leaders are more likely to invest in village-level
                     public health facilities, whereas male leaders are associated with greater
                     availability of financial (and telecommunications) infrastructure. Female
                     leaders are also associated with higher probabilities that women attend
                     antenatal care, take iron supplements during pregnancy, give birth in
                     a government facility as opposed to at home, and initiate breastfeeding
                     early. Correlation of women leaders with outcomes that are not dependent
                     upon public health infrastructure, such as breastfeeding, suggests that
                     female leaders are more likely to promote health outreach and education
                     campaigns.
                         Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) use political reservations for women
                     in India to study the impact of women’s leadership on policy decisions.
                     There are two key features of this study: first, since the mid-1990s,

146
                                            EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT



one-third of village council head positions have been randomly reserved
for a woman, which allows for causal interpretation of the results. Second,
the study conducted a survey to elicit women’s preferences on public goods.
The main finding is that policy decisions better reflected the preferences
of women when the village council head was a woman.
    Rehavi (2007) uses variation in the number of female state legislators
created by the outcomes of close elections in the United States to examine
the impact of the leader’s gender. The analysis finds that the increase of
women in U.S. statehouses over the past quarter-century was responsible
for a significant 15 percent share of the rise in state health spending. There
was no effect on the share of spending on education.
    Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) examine the effects of female leadership
using a data set of U.S. mayoral elections from 1950 to 2005. They find
no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes related to the size of
local government, the composition of municipal spending and employ-
ment, or crime rates. Although female mayors do not implement different
policies, they do appear to have higher unobserved political skills, given
that they have a 6–7 percentage point higher incumbent effect than a
comparable male.
    Washington (2008) shows that U.S. members of Congress who have
daughters tend to vote more liberally on women’s issues bills. She uses
congressional voting record scores compiled by the American Association
of University Women and the National Organization for Women, and
exploits the fact that the gender of a child is exogenous conditional on fam-
ily size. She finds that, conditional on total children parented, each female
child parented is associated with a score increase that is approximately one-
quarter of the difference in the score accounted for by a congressperson’s
own gender.


Unhealthy political engagement yields bad-quality leaders
Other research shows that when political parties and special interest groups
are organized to extract private rents, they support the selection of bad-
quality leaders. Political parties in India that are organized on the basis of
ethnic identity and win support by targeting private benefits to members
of their ethnic groups are also more likely to field candidates against whom
there are serious criminal allegations (Aidt, Golden, and Tiwari 2011).
Political parties in India are more likely to select alleged criminal candi-
dates when confronting greater electoral volatility and in parliamentary

                                                                                       147

                     constituencies with lower literacy. Prakash, Rockmore, and Uppal (2014)
                     provide evidence that there are large economic costs of electing criminally
                     accused politicians.
                         Daniele and Geys (2015) examine the role of organized crime groups
                     in Italy in influencing the quality of elected politicians. They test the
                     hypothesis that organized crime groups can lower the quality of politi-
                     cians through bribery and coercion. To undertake this test, they rely on
                     the assumption that the negative correlation between organized crime
                     and quality of politicians is likely to be weaker when law enforcement is
                     strengthened. The authors use data on the presence and activity of orga-
                     nized crime in Italian municipalities during the period 1985–2011. During
                     this time, when there was the presumption of ties between local politicians
                     and organized crime, the national government had the ability to dissolve
                     the local government and replace it with a commission. The authors show
                     that the dissolution of a local government as a result of Mafia infiltration
                     induces a significant upward shift in the quality of local politicians, as
                     measured by education. Similarly, Acemoglu, Robinson, and Santos (2013)
                     use data from Colombia between 1991 and 2006 to show that paramilitary
                     groups can have significant effects on elections for the legislature and the
                     executive.
                         Other evidence from Germany on the rise of the Nazi party also
                     shows how organized groups can reduce the quality of elected politicians.
                     Satyanath, Voigtlaender, and Voth (2013) find that civil society organiza-
                     tions in Germany facilitated the rise of the Nazi party through democratic
                     institutions, which ultimately led to the downfall of democracy in interwar
                     Germany. The authors combine individual-level records of Nazi party
                     membership from Falter and Brustein (2015) with more recently collected
                     information on civic associations from a cross-section of 229 towns and
                     cities from all over Germany in the 1920s. Their results show that the Nazi
                     party grew more quickly where association density was higher. A diverse
                     range of civil society groups, such as veterans’ associations, animal breed-
                     ers, chess clubs, and choirs, all positively predict the entry of the Nazi
                     party. Party membership, in turn, is correlated with electoral success.
                     Similar in essence to these results from Germany of the political capture
                     of civil society, Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson (2014) interpret evidence
                     on the impact of traditional ruling families in Sierra Leone as suggesting
                     that they can capture civil society to maintain their power.
                         Another strand of evidence provides indirect support to theoretical
                     hypotheses that dishonest citizens may be more likely to seek public office

because there are rents to be had. Leaders can use their time in office to
find a variety of ingenious ways of enriching themselves that are difficult
for voters to monitor. Voters are limited in their ability to monitor every
action and enforce accountability. On the one hand, this points to the
importance of other internal checks and balances, and the bluntness of
elections as institutions of accountability, but on the other, it underscores
the importance of understanding how political institutions can shape the
intrinsic characteristics and behavioral norms among leaders.
   Gehlbach, Sonin, and Zhuravskaya (2010) document the high share of
businessmen who run for public office in the Russian Federation. Using
data from Russian gubernatorial elections, they show that “businessman
candidates” emerge in regions with low media freedom and government
transparency. The authors suggest that this pattern may be indicative of
candidates entering the political market with the objective of extracting
private rents once in office.
   Pande (2007) provides a review of evidence and case studies on the
type of citizen who selects to become a politician. The pattern is consistent
with the suggestion that political entrepreneurs can select into becoming
politicians with rent-seeking motives. Her review further points out that
business interests in politics in low-income countries is similar to the situ-
ation in the United States in the nineteenth century, when the business
elite dominated urban politics and urban politics was associated with
significant corruption.



Political engagement and behavioral norms
This section examines the available evidence that links political engage-
ment to behavioral norms. Chapter 1 distinguished political norms as a
subset of social norms, pertaining specifically to the behavior of citizens
and public officials in the public sector. The theoretical literature reviewed
in chapter 4 shows how unhealthy political engagement can be understood
as behavioral norms to extract private benefits from public resources.
Behavioral norms can vary within the same formal institutions and persist
even when formal institutions change. The theory suggests that transitions
between healthy and unhealthy behavioral norms happen through the
experience of political engagement over time and through the role of lead-
ers as prominent agents. There are no currently available direct empirical
tests of the theory, or clear empirical strategies to measure political norms

                                                                                       149
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     beyond qualitative descriptions. This section provides empirical support
                     for the theoretical insights by connecting and interpreting a large literature
                     on the impact of historical institutions on development and the role of
                     leaders in shaping social norms.


                     Leaders influence norms
                     Significant evidence shows that political engagement and the leaders
                     selected through it shape social norms related to gender and caste. Beaman
                     et al. (2009) and Beaman et al. (2012) examine the impact of political
                     reservations for women in the leadership of village governments in India
                     on gender norms. The state of West Bengal began implementing the con-
                     stitutional amendment in India that mandates political reservations for
                     women leaders in 1998 and assigned the reservation to a random set of
                     villages. These studies find that the experience of living under a woman
                     leader reduces men’s prejudice against women leaders by many measures.
                     The experience of living under a woman leader also reduced the gender
                     gap in parental aspirations for children. In villages that had had women
                     leaders, parents’ expectations for their daughters were higher and girls went
                     to school longer and had somewhat fewer hours of housework. After the
                     reservations ended in a village, women have run for free elections in higher
                     percentages and in many cases won.
                         Several other papers exploit the variation in leader selection afforded by
                     political reservations in India to examine the impact on behavioral norms.
                     Deininger et al. (2015) examine the effect on individuals’ political participa-
                     tion. The main outcome variables are individuals’ levels of political partici-
                     pation, willingness to make a matching contribution to provide local public
                     goods, and self-reported ability to hold leaders to account. The authors use
                     data collected 15 years after the introduction of the policy to explore the
                     persistence of reservation-induced effects and to distinguish short- from
                     long-term effects. They find that reservations prompted a decline in the
                     perceived quality of leaders and public goods provision, but an increase in
                     the extent and nature of females’ political participation. These effects persist
                     over time, consistent with effects on long-lasting behavioral norms.
                         Iyer et al. (2011) use state-level variation in the timing of political res-
                     ervations in India to find that an increase in female representation in local
                     government induces a large and significant rise in documented crimes
                     against women in India. Their evidence suggests that this increase is good
                     news, driven primarily by greater reporting rather than greater incidence

150
                                             EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT



of such crimes. In contrast, they find no increase in crimes against men or
gender-neutral crimes. They also examine the effectiveness of alternative
forms of political representation: large-scale membership of women in
local councils affects crime against them more than does their presence in
higher-level leadership positions.
   Contrasting results on the impact of mandated political participation
comes from Afghanistan. Beath et al. (2014) examine a development pro-
gram that mandated women’s community participation. The community-
driven development program (CDD) was part of a randomized controlled
trial in 500 villages in Afghanistan. As part of the CDD, the village had
to establish a development council with equal participation of men and
women in the election of the council and in the selection of development
projects. The study finds that increased female participation had an impact
in various activities, both political and economic. However, no effects were
found on the norms of intrafamily decision making or on attitudes toward
the general role of women in society.
   Another study shows how political parties with a particular social ideol-
ogy can affect gender outcomes. Meyersson (2014) uses a regression dis-
continuity design to compare municipalities in Turkey, where the Islamic
party barely won or lost the election and finds that in places where they
won, Islamic rule increased female secular high school education. These
effects persisted in the long run (17 years later), reduced adolescent mar-
riages, and increased female political participation.


A history of inclusive political engagement influences norms
Research finds variation in outcomes across local places that are currently
governed by the same set of formal institutions but vary in their experi-
ence with historical institutions. This evidence shows that the effects of
historical institutions persist over time, long after those formal institutions
have disappeared. Such persistence of effects of historical institutions is due
to the importance of behavioral norms that have been variously defined
as “informal institutions” or “culture,” to distinguish them from formal
institutions (Alesina and Giuliano 2015). This general interpretation is
open to several different types of mechanisms through which behavioral
norms could work, as follows:
•	 One, citizens could fail to make the local contributions that are needed
   for state-provided public services to work effectively, such as local main-
   tenance (for example, village health committees gathering contributions

                                                                                        151

                        from community members to maintain and equip the health clinics);
                        local cooperation with public service providers, or conversely, local
                        social sanctions on errant workers (for example, social pressure on
                        nurses and doctors to show up to work at the health clinic); or local
                        take-up of services (for example, mothers taking their young children
                        for immunization).

                     •	 Two, citizens could fail to coordinate their political actions, such as
                        voting, to demand the collective social welfare. This failure can lead
                        to worse outcomes by reducing the incentives and quality of leaders to
                        make the public sector perform better for citizens. Political beliefs and
                        behavioral norms can be clientelist—with citizens likely to reward politi-
                        cians who provide them with targeted private benefits, or who share their
                        social identity, at the expense of broadly delivered public services. This
                        course can shape both the incentives and the characteristics of those who
                        select to become political leaders—the extent to which leaders have the
                        incentives, the motivation, and the competence to use their positions of
                        leadership in the public sphere to serve the public interest rather than to
                        extract private rents.
                         Pandey (2010) provides direct evidence linking historical institutions of
                     power concentration to subsequent political behavior and the delivery of
                     public services. She takes advantage of historical variation across districts
                     in India in colonial land revenue institutions that concentrated power
                     among elite landlords. Landlord districts had more oppressive revenue
                     systems that gave greater power to elite landlords rather than to peas-
                     ants. In districts with nonlandlord control, village bodies that were more
                     representative of peasants were responsible for collecting revenue. The
                     results show that in ex-landlord control districts, elections are more likely
                     to be won by leaders belonging to high-caste groups, who are the social
                     elite. These high-caste groups are less likely to send their children to the
                     public schools in the villages, as compared with low-caste groups. Lower-
                     caste children are overrepresented and high- and middle-caste children
                     underrepresented in enrollment rates in public schools relative to their
                     respective populations. Teacher effort is significantly lower in villages in
                     ex-landlord districts. When results are analyzed by teacher caste, the dif-
                     ference in teacher effort between ex-landlord and ex-nonlandlord districts
                     is significant for high- or middle-caste teachers who would be considered
                     elites (based on their caste status). For low-caste teachers, the difference
                     in effort between ex-landlord and ex-nonlandlord areas is not significant.

This suggests that low-performing teachers may be protected by the local
political leaders who often share common castes and class backgrounds
because a large fraction of the teachers is upper caste and landed (Drèze
and Saran 1995). Finally, student test scores and school infrastructure are
significantly worse in villages belonging to ex-landlord districts.
   The study by Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson (2014) on the chieftaincy
in Sierra Leone not only shows that chiefdoms with less political competi-
tion have significantly worse development outcomes today, but also sug-
gests that the worse development outcomes are a function of weak political
behavioral norms to hold leaders accountable. They find that despite worse
performance of current political leaders in bringing public investments to
their communities, chiefdoms with fewer ruling families are also associ-
ated with greater measures of citizen acceptance of the authority of chiefs
and more “social capital” or cooperative behavior in communities (such as
engaging in road brushing—a form of communal labor to maintain local
assets). The authors interpret this pattern as suggesting elite capture of civil
society, implicitly through the power of elites to exact obedience from civil
society. Similar results and arguments are provided by Anderson, Francois,
and Kotwal (2015) from India, that in villages dominated by landed, high-
caste elites, there are greater reports of citizen satisfaction with leaders and
willingness of citizens to contribute to local public goods, at the same time
that public investments by the state to fight poverty are low.
   This evidence from India and Sierra Leone suggests that political
beliefs about the legitimacy of elite leaders and political behavioral norms
to accept their authority can facilitate the persistence of power and influ-
ence of some groups, who have historically been in positions of power,
despite changes in formal political institutions toward democracy and
competitive elections. Local collective action to solve problems of local
public goods can be a form of elite capture of civil society, contributing
to the persistence of elite power and preventing citizens from organizing
to demand political accountability from their leaders. Indonesia provides
further suggestive evidence of this tension between local collective action
to solve local problems versus holding leaders accountable for using their
positions of leadership to service the community. Freire, Henderson, and
Kuncoro (2011) provide evidence that the introduction of democratic elec-
tions at the village level in Indonesia led to a replacement of traditional
village leaders drawn from the village elite, and a simultaneous reduction
in volunteer labor that village elites previously mobilized for building local
public infrastructure.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        A strand of literature examining regional differences in the qual-
                     ity of government and social norms within Italy, between the center-
                     north and the south, ultimately attributes better performance to earlier
                     experience with participatory democracy, dating back to the twelfth
                     century (Alesina and Giuliano 2015; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales
                     2006; Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti 1993). The inclusiveness of
                     political institutions in “free cities”—a formal institution in the twelfth
                     century—­   triggered a set of cultural traits (civic and cooperative behav-
                     ior) whose effects persist today. Regions that were not free cities in the
                     twelfth century but that currently have institutions of local political
                     engagement are argued to suffer from “uncivic” voting, which allows
                     corruption by political leaders to go unpunished (Nannicini et al. 2013).
                     This series of arguments on variation in governance outcomes within
                     Italy thus supports the notion of improvements in political norms com-
                     ing about through the experience of political engagement over time. The
                     earlier experience with democratic institutions and greater accumulation
                     of such experience over time are the underlying source of differences in
                     governance within Italy today.4
                        Nannicini et al. (2013) build on the previous work on variation in social
                     capital across provinces within Italy. Social capital is defined as norms for
                     cooperative behavior in society. The authors’ main empirical measure of
                     social capital is average per capita blood donations in the Italian provinces
                     (following Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2006). They link social norms
                     to the notion of “civic” versus “uncivic” voting behavior, depending on
                     whether voters assess politicians on the basis of general public interest and
                     punish transgressions even when they have been the recipients of private
                     favors from the politician. The authors use two indicators of transgression
                     or misbehavior of incumbents in national elections: prosecutors’ requests
                     to proceed with a criminal investigation against a member of parliament;
                     and the absenteeism rate in electronic votes by members of parliament
                     over the legislative term. They find that both indicators are more frequent
                     in electoral districts with less social capital. More important, the electoral
                     punishment of the incumbent’s misbehavior is stronger in districts with
                     more social capital.
                        Finan and Schechter (2012) also show how social and political norms
                     are linked, providing evidence from a field experiment in Paraguay.
                     Politicians hire respected community leaders in each village to interact
                     with voters to promote their candidacy and offer them money and other
                     forms of aid in exchange for the promise of their vote. The authors

conducted a survey with these community leaders who typically broker
the vote-buying exchanges between voters and politicians. They com-
bined survey information on vote buying experienced in a 2006 munici-
pal election with experimental data on individual intrinsic reciprocity.
They find that political brokers target vote-buying offers to individuals
who have strong norms of reciprocity. It is interesting to note that a robust
negative association between vote buying and public services in Khemani
(2015), discussed earlier, is obtained from a country—the Philippines—
that has been described as having cultural norms of reciprocity (utang
na loob, or the obligation to appropriately repay a person who has done
one a favor).
   Historical inequality in the distribution of economic endowments
can also explain unhealthy political behavioral norms. Sokoloff and
Engerman (2000) argue that historically unequal economic institu-
tions in Latin America, compared with those in the United States and
Canada, were responsible for the delay in the adoption of inclusive
political institutions, and this delay is associated with subsequent weak
institutions and persistently worse economic outcomes. The authors
provide evidence that exogenous variation in the climate to produce
sugar led to variation across countries within the Americas in the tim-
ing of the adoption of egalitarian political institutions (democracy with
universal adult suffrage) and social policies (education for universal
literacy). Similarly, Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) argue that early
experience with inclusive or egalitarian political institutions in the his-
tory of nations is the source of variation in subsequent paths of economic
development.
   However, although this body of work shows that early adoption of
egalitarian institutions and social policies is important, the mechanisms
behind why early adoption matters and has persistent effects is not clarified
or made explicit. Why are countries not able to change outcomes within
short time spans by instituting elections with universal adult suffrage and
spending on public education? The answers in this report are that first,
political behavioral norms are important in shaping the functioning of
formal institutions; and second, political norms can vary within the same
formal institutions, between healthy and unhealthy. Historical institutions
of inequality can contribute to unhealthy political behavioral norms such
as those that sustain clientelist forms of political competition where politi-
cal support is won on the basis of providing targeted private benefits rather
than broad public goods.5

                     Capacity building is not enough: Healthy political
                     engagement is needed to change incentives and norms
                     Even when they function well, elections are designed only to hold elected
                     officials accountable. But many of the functions of government are
                     delegated to appointed officials rather than to elected politicians. Both
                     elected and appointed officials exercise their powers through a myriad
                     of working-level institutions of government, ranging from ministries
                     and agencies all the way down to local public schools and clinics. Strong
                     institutions of internal accountability within government, such as supreme
                     audit institutions, and checks and balances, such as through independent
                     judiciaries, therefore are important mechanisms to complement account-
                     ability through elections.
                        The problem is how to build such institutions when they are weak to
                     begin with. A view that institutions and governance are central to devel-
                     opment has influenced policy efforts to focus on deliberately investing in
                     building institutions. One approach to better public sector institutions in
                     places that lack them is to build the bricks-and-mortar infrastructure and
                     provide human resources and training to staff, and equipment to bureau-
                     cracies and law and enforcement agencies. However, a wealth of experience
                     with efforts to strengthen institutions has shown that programs to replicate
                     successful rich country institutions in developing countries by providing
                     equipment and training to bureaucracies often fail (Andrews, Pritchett,
                     and Woolcock 2013; IDS 2010; Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews 2013).
                        When institutions are weak to begin with and political engagement is
                     unhealthy, attempts to build better institutions by investing in capacity
                     alone can run into problems of perverse incentives and behavioral norms
                     in public bureaucracies. Nonelected public officials perform in the shadow
                     of flawed elections that generate weak political incentives and perverse
                     behavioral norms. For example, powerful leaders at both national and local
                     levels might interfere with the recruitment and management of frontline
                     public service providers by ensuring that their cronies are appointed or
                     promoted to leadership positions in public facilities (Callen et al. 2014;
                     La Forgia et al. 2014). Such use of government jobs as political patronage
                     can dilute professional norms in the public sector. Although systematic
                     empirical evidence on how elected political leaders shape the environment
                     in which bureaucracies function is limited, the little that is available sug-
                     gests that bureaucracies in poor countries are subject to pernicious political
                     interference. Improving the management of public service providers within

sectors, be they doctors, teachers, agriculture extension workers, or social
safety net administrators, appears intimately linked to politics.
   A growing body of empirical work finds evidence that elected leaders
exert significant influence over public officials and frontline service provid-
ers (Brollo, Kaufmann, and La Ferrara 2015; Callen et al. 2014; Callen
and Long 2015; Iyer and Mani 2012). Technical policy advice about how
to improve the functioning of public bureaucracies may not be taken up
or implemented seriously because of weak political incentives. Examples
in the literature show how relatively obvious and easy-to-implement tech-
nocratic arrangements can be devised that work to control corruption and
improve performance. Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2014)
show how significant gains in performance can be achieved by using tech-
nology. The World Development Report 2016 (World Bank 2016) further
shows that the Internet and new technology afford ample opportunities to
improve governance should leaders have the incentives and willingness to
use them. Those incentives or “political will” are, in turn, shaped by the
characteristics of political engagement.
   Even when technological innovations are credibly adopted by higher-
level decision makers, political incentives and behavioral norms can under-
mine their implementation. Banerjee, Duflo, and Glennerster (2008) and
Callen et al. (2014) provide direct evidence that the use of technology
to improve governance is influenced by political connections and politi-
cal competition. Callen et al. (2014) find that the use of a smartphone
technology that doubled inspection rates of health clinics in Pakistan was
highly localized in competitive political constituencies where there are
greater political incentives to monitor public providers. Banerjee, Duflo,
and Glennerster (2008) provide evidence of the reversal of gains from
an effective monitoring technology—timestamp machines—to reduce
absenteeism among public health workers in India. The nurses sabotaged
the machines and pressured local health administrators to deliberately
undermine the incentive scheme. The authors suggest that the nurses were
successful in doing so because of the lack of political will among leaders
with power over the health system to enforce implementation.
   Dhaliwal and Hanna (2014) evaluate the impact of another techno-
logical solution—using biometric scanning devices—to monitor the atten-
dance of public sector health care workers in India, finding that it resulted
in a 15 percent increase in medical staff attendance. Health outcomes
improved, with a 16 percent increase in the delivery of infants by a doctor
and a 26 percent reduction in the likelihood of infants born weighing less

                                                                                        157

                     than 2,500 grams. However, the results also suggest that improvements
                     in one aspect of service delivery performance (reduction in absenteeism)
                     may have been replaced by other forms of corruption (for example, higher
                     delivery costs, diversion of patients to private practice, and reductions in
                     benefits to which patients are entitled).
                         At the same time, Dhaliwal and Hanna’s (2014) discussion is occupied
                     not so much with the success story of the technology but rather with the
                     unwillingness and low motivation at every step in the public sector to take
                     it up and implement it effectively. They report that:

                         The idea for the original reform did not stem from the research
                         team: the government identified the absence problem, conceived
                         the program, developed the software, and piloted the equipment
                         prior to the involvement of the researchers in the project … Despite
                         this “ownership,” the project was plagued with both delays and
                         inadequacies in implementation … The implementation chal-
                         lenges stemmed from both the top–i.e., the state government—and
                         the local bureaucrats and politicians who are responsible for further
                         monitoring the PHC [primary health center] staff. At the top, the
                         state government officials, the very office that conceived the proj-
                         ect, did not always follow through with implementation … lower
                         level bureaucrats may have little incentive to enforce the rules:
                         if they enforce them, the health officers would have to handle
                         complaints by PHC staff and they get no personal return in terms
                         of their careers. On the other hand, local elected politicians—in
                         India, the Grand Pradhan, or GP—may have better incentives
                         than bureaucrats to monitor PHC staff to be present: if service
                         provision is low, they could be voted out of office. Yet, … despite
                         the high rates of absenteeism, GPs were generally satisfied with the
                         doctor’s attendance: 77 percent were either satisfied or very satisfied
                         with their attendance. (Dhaliwal and Hanna 2014, 25–29).

                     A similar story comes from Kenya of impediments to implementing
                     evidence-based policies that would improve provider performance. The
                     research to inform policymakers about the impact of different policy
                     options to improve education is summarized on the website of the Abdul
                     Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. Standing out in this summary is a finding
                     that public investment in hiring contract teachers in Kenya, rather than
                     raising the salaries of regular civil service teachers, is highly cost-effective.

Contract teachers exert greater effort at a fraction of the cost of regular civil
service teachers. Yet efforts by the government of Kenya to implement poli-
cies based on the implications of this research were strikingly unsuccessful.
Bold et al. (2013) show that the contract teacher program could not be
effectively implemented through the public sector. The authors provide
anecdotal evidence consistent with the political power of the teachers’
unions in thwarting program implementation.
   Mungiu-Pippidi (2014) reports that the establishment of anticorrup-
tion agencies and several other formal policy measures for monitoring and
enforcement are not robustly correlated with the control of corruption.
Case studies of the experience with anticorruption agencies across coun-
tries point to the importance of political incentives in shaping the func-
tioning of such agencies. Doig, Watt, and Williams (2006) and Meagher
(2005) write that the success of some agencies, such as Singapore’s Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau founded in 1952, has provided models for
other countries to emulate. They write that these agencies were established
in contexts of rampant corruption that were threatening political stability
and investor confidence. In response, single agencies were established that
centralized information and facilitated coordination between institutions.
However, these authors continue, the majority of anticorruption agencies
(ACAs) established in other countries based on these models have been
far less successful. Meagher (2005, 79) writes, “The majority of ACAs,
which are most numerous in the developing world, probably serve no use-
ful role in combating corruption. Some may indeed be actively harmful.”
These authors contend that ACAs do not address larger forces underlying
systemic corruption in developing countries.
   Maor (2004) considers the politics of anticorruption mechanisms,
drawing on examples from the United States, the former Soviet Union,
Italy, and Australia. He considers cases in which leaders establish ACAs
and make other investments to reduce corruption, often in response to
pressure from media or public outcry, but subsequently undermine those
efforts when anticorruption investigations consider issues close to home,
such as the actions of political executives. Maor (2004) considers five cases
in which leaders have tried to thwart the credibility of anticorruption
mechanisms and investigators’ powers. Through comparative case study
analysis, he finds that the outcome of such struggles depends largely on
media accessibility and institutions. When the media have greater access
to the government and institutions are not centralized, investigations are
more difficult to derail.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        Kaufmann, Mehrez, and Gurgur (2002) argue that in environments in
                     which public institutions are captured to service the interests of economic
                     and political elites, the path to improving governance lies not through
                     traditional public sector reforms but rather through external institutions
                     of accountability to citizens. Using in-depth micro surveys of 1,250 public
                     officials working in 110 public institutions in Bolivia, the authors esti-
                     mate a model of the determinants of corruption in and service delivery by
                     government agencies. Their results show that internal indicators of public
                     sector management, such as wages of civil servants and bureaucratic rules,
                     are not significant, while measures of external accountability institutions,
                     such as citizen voice and transparency, are significantly correlated with
                     lower corruption and better quality of services provided.
                        An approach to fostering external accountability has been to build citi-
                     zen organization, such as providing grants to civil society and establishing
                     legal frameworks to allow citizen organization to flourish. However, laws
                     that are abided by and organizations that are effective are more likely to
                     emerge organically. The most systematic evidence in this regard comes
                     from efforts to build the capacity of communities to undertake develop-
                     ment projects. Mansuri and Rao (2013) argue that efforts to induce com-
                     munity participation run into large risks of failure because of inequality
                     and socioeconomic barriers to participation. Yet there are examples of
                     organic forms of participation that arise endogenously among communi-
                     ties, showing that citizens and communities can come together to address
                     local problems. But getting them to do so through external interventions,
                     when they are not ready, can fail.
                        One strand of thought on historical path dependency suggests strong
                     limitations on the efficacy of any deliberate policy efforts to change
                     institutions; critical junctures of institutional change involve a variety of
                     forces that are likely outside the control of policy makers.6 Some historical
                     accounts of how effective state capacity and institutional change comes
                     about is consistent with the role of healthy political engagement in creating
                     the conditions for that change. Besley and Persson (2009) find that histori-
                     cal incidence of parliamentary democracy, and of shocks (external wars)
                     that lead to demand for common-interest public goods, are stable predic-
                     tors of state capacity. The common theme in Acemoglu and Robinson
                     (2001, 2006b) and in Besley, Persson, and Reynal-Querol (2015) is that an
                     incumbent leader’s fear of losing power is critical for institutional change.
                        The research frontier is linking the development of effective public
                     sector organizations and sound professional norms in bureaucracies to

the “cleaning up” of politics.7 A challenge for the public sector is how to
strengthen providers’ professional behavioral norms by using mechanisms
other than incentives and accountability. When leaders are selected and
sanctioned on the basis of good performance, they are more likely to
have the incentives, capacity, and legitimacy to bring about institutional
reforms such as the professionalization of bureaucracies. Conversely,
when politics revolves around patronage and clientelism, providing jobs
in the public sector becomes a currency of political competition, with
pernicious consequences for professional behavioral norms among public
employees.


This chapter has shown that political engagement, both its healthy and
unhealthy forms, has profound consequences for governance, policy
selection, and economic development. Healthy political engagement can
be crucial for changing incentives and behaviors in the public sector and
effectively building state capacity. The big question this raises is how to
encourage healthy political engagement so that governments work better
to support economic development. One way may be through transparency.
The next chapter focuses on the evidence of transparency’s impact in nour-
ishing political engagement and working together with it to strengthen
institutions for governance.


Notes
     Casey (2015) is reviewed further in chapter 6. The paper shows that political
  1. 
     information on local politicians provided through the radio improves vot-
     ers’ knowledge. Candidate information increases citizen willingness to cross
     ethnic-party lines. Complementary evidence shows that more information
     induces parties to distribute campaign spending in a more equitable way
     across districts.
  2. These results need to be interpreted with caution because the diffusion
      rate of elections across villages is rapid, and some of the outcomes data
      are based on recall (which can involve measurement errors). There may
      also be an issue of external validity—or the extent to which the reported
      results are likely to be applicable outside the sample of villages used in this
      study. This point was raised in comments provided by John Giles to the
      authors of this report. The sample of villages on which data are available
      has been the focus of research for some time, which may impact the way
      in which respondents from these villages respond to surveys undertaken
      by researchers.

                       3. Directly elected municipal governments in the Philippines are responsible
                           for delivering what can be characterized as a pro-poor public service: health
                           programs for maternal and child well-being that are typically the only source
                           for such services available to poor households. Municipalities hire and man-
                           age nurses, midwives, and community or village health workers, the key
                           health personnel who are supposed to deliver basic maternal and child health
                           services to the poor.
                       4. In chapter 6, the discussion turns to why several hundred years of experi-
                           ence, as in this example from Italy, may not be needed for societies today to
                           improve political engagement. Changes can be far more rapid in this particu-
                           lar moment in time because of the confluence of current forces of political
                           engagement and transparency.
                       5. Brixi, Lust, and Woolcock (2015) provide a study of government failures
                           in the Middle East and North Africa region with a similar argument and
                           interpretation of available evidence. They discuss how historical experience
                           with colonial institutions and beliefs about the role of the state at the time of
                           independence in the region led to political clientelism, elite capture of state
                           resources, and citizen expectations that leaders would provide a broad range
                           of private and public benefits (such as subsidies, health, and education). The
                           coexistence of these three factors—that leaders organized to extract private
                           rents from the economy, maintaining loyalty and political support through
                           patronage, while providing subsidies and a broad range of public services to
                           citizens to win their acquiescence—became untenable as economic inefficien-
                           cies mounted and citizens became dissatisfied with the social compact.
                       6. B anerjee and Duf lo (2014) provide a view of this historical determin-
                           ism literature. Dell, Lane, and Querubin (2015) and Dell (2012) provide
                           direct evidence of path dependency in development. Acemoglu, Johnson,
                           and Robinson (2005) describe “critical junctures” and North et al. (2007)
                           describe “doorstep conditions” for institutional change.

Evidence on the Impact
of Transparency

Overview
This chapter reviews research on the impact of transparency, defined as
citizen access to publicly available information about the actions of those
in government and the consequences of these actions. It examines how citi-
zens and leaders respond to transparency. The first part reports substantial
evidence that political engagement responds to transparency within and
across a variety of institutional contexts. Citizens and leaders change their
actions in response to new information. Citizens are influenced by the
framing of issues and messages broadcast by mass media. However, the
details of transparency are important—the types of information, the cred-
ibility of sources, and the media of communication all matter.
   The following section examines research on transparency’s impact on
governance outcomes. This research has focused on the role of mass media
in particular and its mechanisms of impact on governance through politi-
cal engagement. Leaders respond to mass media because it amplifies the
role of political engagement to hold them accountable. Historical accounts
of institutional transition in developed countries such as the United States
and the United Kingdom suggest that the spread of independent mass
media can work together with political engagement to create the condi-
tions that lead to the establishment of effective public sector institutions.
   In contrast to the potentially transformative role of transparency when
working together with political engagement, the following section shows
that the impact of transparency initiatives outside the political realm is
not enough to improve governance. The impact of transparency initiatives
targeted at engaging citizens to take actions to improve service delivery
depends upon political incentives. The last section of this chapter examines

                     a role for transparency in improving behavioral norms in the public sector.
                     It highlights this as a particularly important area for future work.



                     Political engagement responds to transparency
                     The bulk of the available research on transparency’s impact shows that it
                     can play a powerful role through its effects on political engagement. A sub-
                     stantial strand of the literature provides evidence that political engagement
                     by voters responds to transparency. Transparency can increase voter turnout
                     or shift the distribution of vote shares in a variety of institutional contexts.
                     A smaller but growing strand of work uncovers the impact of information on
                     which policy issues voters consider; for example, whether citizens are more
                     likely to vote against corrupt candidates or on the basis of the performance
                     record of the incumbent, and are less likely to vote on the basis of ethnic
                     identity or the receipt of targeted benefits in direct exchange for their vote.
                         Independent media, such as radio, television, newspapers, and the
                     Internet, are important in bringing about changes in voting behavior. Yet
                     the type of information, its source, and its “fit” with the institutional context
                     are important. Examples have been found in which information had the
                     opposite effect of discouraging voter turnout or increasing vote buying.
                     The direction of impact depends upon the nature of the media market and
                     the extent to which it provides credible information or reflects political biases
                     and polarization. The same type of information can have different effects
                     depending on the credibility of the source that generated the information.
                     Furthermore, in contexts in which political engagement is unhealthy, there
                     is no clear evidence on whether the transparency’s impact is sufficient to get
                     leaders to respond with sustainable or long-term improvements in outcomes,
                     by using the powers of their office to strengthen institutions.
                         These differences in the available evidence on the impact of transpar-
                     ency on political engagement are linked to the design of specific interven-
                     tions. The pattern of evidence does not suggest that lack of impact or
                     detrimental impact of transparency is limited to weak institutional settings
                     or that successful impacts occur only in strong institutional settings.


                     Evidence of impact on voter behavior
                     A growing number of randomized controlled trials have been implemented
                     in developing countries to try to encourage poor voters to participate in

the democratic process. Most of these interventions are based on informa-
tion campaigns that make voters more knowledgeable about the electoral
system and aware of the importance of voting.
   Information interventions implemented in countries as diverse as India,
China, Mozambique, and Pakistan have found that more informed voters
are more likely to participate in elections (Aker et al. 2013; Banerjee et al.
2011; Giné and Mansuri 2011; Guan and Green 2006). However, some
studies show the opposite effect, where the availability of new information
and media can reduce voter turnout (Chong et al. 2015; Gentzkow 2006).
These contrasting results are echoed in other research in which the out-
come variable of interest is different (such as corruption or responsiveness
of leaders). The discussion below shows how all of the evidence is consis-
tent with the sensitivity of voting behavior to information, even though the
direction of impact depends upon a variety of conditions. Some of these
conditions may pertain to the formal institutional environment, which
is beyond the scope of this report. However, as discussed in the previous
two chapters, these conditions also pertain to characteristics of political
engagement that can vary within the same formal institutional and coun-
try context. Finally, some of the variation comes from the nature of the
information itself. For example, Gentzkow (2006) shows that the negative
effect of the penetration of television on voter turnout in the United States
is driven by the crowding-out of other media (such as newspapers) that
carry more information about public affairs and political leaders.
   Complementary evidence comes from studies that focus on information
that improves voters’ knowledge about the quality of politicians and their
actions. Ferraz and Finan (2008) use exogenous variation in the timing
of disclosure of information on corruption in Brazil and find that voters
change their choices when audit reports disclose information about corrupt
practices. Corrupt mayors are punished at the polls while mayors with no
irregularities are rewarded. These effects are stronger in municipalities in
which local radio is present to diffuse this information. Similar results are
found by Bobonis, Cámara Fuertes, and Schwabe (forthcoming) using
information disclosed in audit reports in Puerto Rico, and by Larreguy,
Marshall, and Snyder (2015), who use audit information from Mexico.
They find that voters punish the party of malfeasant mayors, but only in
precincts covered by local media stations.
   Although the availability of information can have significant effects
on political engagement, the impact might depend on the source and
the credibility of the information being provided. Alt, Lassen, Marshall

                                                                                          173

                     (forthcoming) examine the credibility of the source of information within
                     the same (strong) institutional context (Denmark). They focus on how
                     information may affect belief updating: the effect of the source of the mes-
                     sage depends upon the source’s objective and subjective credibility, while
                     the ideological content of the message may update beliefs by reinforcing
                     previously existing beliefs or persuading voters with different ideological
                     predispositions. Based on their survey experiment in Denmark, they find
                     that objective credibility of the information source matters: an unemploy-
                     ment projection from the Danish Central Bank, which is highly credible
                     among citizens, causes voters to update their beliefs more than does infor-
                     mation received from government or opposition political parties.
                        Another example of the importance of the credibility of the source
                     comes from contrasting results across different studies that examine how
                     voters react to information about corruption of incumbent politicians.
                     When information comes from a credible source (such as audits imple-
                     mented by an independent agency) and is distributed through existing
                     media, it generates significant changes in voting patterns. In contrast,
                     Chong et al. (2015) do not find significant effects when the informa-
                     tion is provided by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) through
                     a­door-to-door campaign in Mexico. An important difference between
                     this study and the work based on audit reports is the type of information
                     being provided. The authors report “spending according to rules ( gasto que
                     cumple con normas),” which is very different from the type of audit reports
                     used by Ferraz and Finan (2008) in Brazil; by Bobonis, Cámara Fuertes,
                     and Schwabe (forthcoming) in Puerto Rico; and by Larreguy, Marshall,
                     and Snyder (2015) in Mexico. In experiments such as Chong et al. (2015),
                     the information NGOs provided in flyers could have been interpreted in
                     an ambiguous way, given that it is not necessarily a measure of corruption.
                     These differences suggest that information and its credibility based on
                     technical quality, with a clear connection to the well-being of voters, is
                     more likely to have an impact.1
                        Positive information about the quality of politicians can also affect
                     political selection, as shown in the work of Kendall, Nannicini, and Trebbi
                     (2015). The authors implemented a field experiment on the provision of
                     information in an Italian city where the mayor was running for reelection.
                     However, instead of negative information, they provided information on
                     the fact that the mayor of Arezzo developed an urban development plan
                     that was highly ranked by the regional government and received extra
                     funding because of its quality. The extra funding was used to rebuild

monuments, roads, and parking lots in the city center. They show how
voters update their beliefs and change their voting patterns when provided
with this information on the competence, effort, or performance of leaders.
Much weaker effects were estimated when information was provided only
on ideological policy positions.
   Transparency interventions—in this case providing more information
on the quality of politicians—lead voters to change their behavior across
myriad contexts. In what follows, evidence from Sierra Leone, India,
Benin, Mali, Indonesia, and São Tomé and Principe is reviewed.
•	 In Sierra Leone, Bidwell, Casey, and Glennerster (2015) used political
   debates to provide information to voters. Large groups of voters were
   exposed to films of the debates via a mobile cinema that visited 112 of
   224 randomly selected polling centers in the five weeks before the elec-
   tion. The authors find strong positive impacts of watching the debates
   on voter knowledge and changes in votes cast, especially in favor of
   candidates who performed best during the debates.

•	 In the slums of Delhi in India, Banerjee et al. (2011) distributed news-
   papers containing report cards on the quality of legislators. On average,
   they find small increases in turnout and no change in incumbent vote
   share in treatment slums. However, they find larger effects on turnout
   and vote shares in localities where the incumbent’s performance was
   worse and where the challengers were better qualified. For the best-
   performing legislators, incumbent vote share increased by 6.9 percent
   with the information treatment. They also find a significant decline in
   vote buying through cash.

•	 In Benin, Fujiwara and Wantchekon (2013) implemented a field experi-
   ment in collaboration with leading candidates in the 2006 presidential
   election. In randomly selected villages, the candidates adopted a noncli-
   entelist campaign strategy, while pursuing the standard clientelist strate-
   gies in control villages. The treatment also included public deliberation;
   voters were invited to debate the platforms in town hall meetings. The
   combined treatment increased voters’ perception that the campaign
   informed voters about candidate qualifications, but had no effects on
   reported vote buying, voter turnout, and vote shares of candidates run-
   ning the town meetings. However, the treatment reduced the votes
   of the dominant candidate in the treatment villages. One important
   aspect of this study is that the authors cannot distinguish the effects of

                                                                                          175

                        information provided by candidates about their policy positions during
                        these town halls from the effects of public deliberation.

                     •	 In Mali, Gottlieb (2016) examined the impact of providing different
                        types of information. She implemented a randomized intervention in
                        which she provided civic education about budget size and mandated
                        responsibilities of government officials. A second treatment arm provided
                        additional information on the local government’s performance relative to
                        neighboring governments to improve voter ability to benchmark politi-
                        cian performance. She finds that the randomly assigned civics course
                        successfully increased voter expectations of local government perfor-
                        mance, as measured by survey questions about local government capacity
                        and responsibility to provide public goods. She also finds that people in
                        treated communes were more likely to challenge their local leadership
                        at community meetings. The effects were stronger when civic education
                        was combined with information on politicians’ relative performance.

                     •	 In Indonesia, Paler (2013) used a laboratory experiment to show that
                        citizens are more willing to take actions to monitor the performance
                        of local leaders when they have more information. The experiment is
                        designed to examine the role of information in comparison with the
                        role that taxation is supposed to play as a source of accountability. The
                        hypothesis is that when governments finance their spending through
                        taxation, they are more likely to be accountable to citizens because citi-
                        zens will have greater incentives to monitor performance. In contrast,
                        when government revenues are windfalls from fiscal transfers, donors,
                        or natural resources, citizens would have lower incentives to monitor.
                        The author finds that citizens are indeed more likely to monitor govern-
                        ments and take political action when revenues come from taxes rather
                        than windfalls. However, when provided with information on spending
                        performance, citizens care as much about monitoring governments when
                        revenues come from windfalls as from taxes.2

                     •	 In São Tomé and Principe, Vicente (2014) implemented a randomized
                        door-to-door campaign against vote buying during the presidential elec-
                        tion. The campaign was sponsored by the country’s National Electoral
                        Commission (instead of by an independent NGO) and had a strong
                        emphasis on voting according to one’s judgment about the quality of
                        the politicians and not according to whoever had bought one’s vote.
                        The campaign decreased the reported perception that voting decisions

                                                        EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



   were affected by the money offered by candidates, and increased the
   reported perception that voters cast their votes in good conscience. It
   also decreased turnout (consistent with the idea of turnout buying) and
   favored the incumbent politician, whose vote share increased by close to
   4 percentage points. The author interprets the results as implying that
   challengers rely more heavily on vote buying as a means of campaign-
   ing. This type of study is not designed to assess the overall impact on
   governance, but rather to examine whether vote-selling behavior is
   responsive to information and persuasion. Other work, discussed below,
   shows contrasting effects of transparency on vote buying by politicians.


Evidence of the role of different types of mass media
Another set of evidence comes from studies that examine the role of media
as a source of information to voters. This growing literature suggests that
the type of media and the source of the information disclosed matters
for voter behavior. This review of the literature draws upon surveys by
Strömberg (2015) and Prat and Strömberg (2011).
   The presence of news media that provide political information leads to
increases in voter turnout. Strömberg (2004) shows that the introduction
of radio across U.S. counties during the period 1920–40 increased politi-
cal participation. Similar results emerge from Gentzkow, Shapiro, and
Sinkinson (2011), who show that the entry of newspapers in U.S. cities
increases turnout in both congressional and presidential elections. Drago,
Nannicini, and Sobbrio (2014) show that newspapers increase turnout in
Italian municipal elections. Also, Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel (2009)
and Prat and Strömberg (2005) find that television increases voter turnout
in the United States and Sweden, respectively.
   These effects are expected if voters become more informed about
politics and if more-informed voters are more likely to participate in the
political process. Prat and Strömberg (2005) provide evidence that the
entry of commercial television in Sweden increased political knowledge.
Snyder and Strömberg (2010) use variation in the access to political
information through newspapers and find that media are a key provider
of political information to citizens. They find that voters in areas where
newspapers have greater coverage of politicians are better informed about
their representatives.
   There is evidence, however, that new media outlets can reduce politi-
cal knowledge and participation when political information competes

                                                                                           177

                     with entertainment programs or when competition in the media
                     market reduces the quantity and quality of news provided (Cagé 2014).
                     ­
                     Gentzkow (2006) shows that increases in television penetration in the
                     United States had a small negative effect on political participation,
                     consistent with Putnam’s (1995) hypothesis that media can also act as
                     a source of reduction in political information for citizens as a result of
                     its entertainment value. Similarly, Olken (2009) shows that access to
                     television in Indonesia is associated with reduced participation in social
                     groups, fewer organizations in the village, and lower levels of reported
                     trust in the community.
                        A growing number of studies show that the introduction of new media
                     outlets affects not only political participation, but also how citizens vote. A
                     series of papers use the rich data available from mostly developed countries
                     to show how coverage of political information in different types of media
                     can shift voters’ views on parties’ policy positions or ideology. DellaVigna
                     and Kaplan (2007) show that the entry of Fox News across U.S. cit-
                     ies increased the presidential vote share of Republicans. Using a similar
                     strategy, Enikolopov, Petrova, and Zhuravskaya (2011) find that citizens
                     who have access to the independent television station in Russia (NTV)
                     were more likely to vote for anti-Putin parties. Knight and Chiang (2011)
                     show that newspaper endorsements change voting intentions in the United
                     States, while Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2011) use variation in
                     entry and exit from newspapers in cities across the United States and find
                     effects on political participation, but do not find significant effects on vote
                     shares or incumbency advantage. Drago, Nannicini, and Sobbrio (2014)
                     use variation in entry and exit of newspapers in Italian cities and find that
                     incumbents are more likely to be reelected where there is greater entry by
                     newspapers. They interpret their results as suggesting that newspapers
                     increase the visibility of politicians in office and may make it easier for the
                     good-quality politicians to signal their quality.
                        The entry of the Internet in developing countries is likely to affect
                     the provision of information to voters and politicians and the citizens’
                     capacity for coordination, and therefore might have significant effects
                     on policy outcomes and governance. Although the Internet is a relatively
                     new phenomenon, an emerging literature is looking at its political effects.
                     The main question is whether information available through the Internet
                     increases or crowds out political knowledge and interest and whether
                     it helps individuals solve the collective action problem of coordinating
                     expectations and actions.

    The penetration of the Internet can reduce political participation if it
crowds out other media that carry political information. Falck, Gold, and
Heblich (2014) provide evidence from Germany showing that the emer-
gence of the Internet crowded out traditional media such as newspapers
and television, and reduced voters’ political information and voter turnout.
Campante, Durante, and Sobbrio (2013) find that broadband penetration
also decreased turnout in the Italian parliamentary elections, but the effect
was temporary. In the longer run, they find broadband access to be posi-
tively associated with political participation and facilitation of the emer-
gence of new political entrepreneurs. Miner (2015) looks at the effects of
Internet penetration in Malaysia and finds that the growth of the Internet
is associated with an increase in turnout and a reduction of support for the
dominant incumbent party. He suggests that the information available on
the Internet undermined the incumbent party’s ability to suppress negative
information about candidates.
    A different effect of the proliferation of the Internet, and especially
social media, is the possibility of coordination and peer effects in political
behavior. Moreover, as suggested by Halberstam and Knight (2015), social
media are different from other forms of communication because they allow
users to produce information, and access to information depends upon
self-chosen links. Bond et al. (2012) implemented a randomized controlled
trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook
users during the 2010 U.S. congressional elections and found that mes-
sages affected information-seeking and voting behavior. The messages
influenced both the users who received them and their friends, suggesting
that social media can be a powerful source of political influence.
    Although little evidence is available on how social media influence
electoral outcomes and governance in developing countries, it might be
expected to act as an important coordinating device for changes and an
alternative form of independent provision of information, as documented
by Enikopolov, Petrova, and Sonin (2016) in Russia. Evidence presented
by Grossman, Humphreys, and Sacramone-Lutz (2014) suggests that
new technologies can increase the communication between marginal-
ized citizens and politicians. Of course, media can also act as a negative
coordinating device when it allows coordination for such actions as the
Rwandan genocide (Yanagizawa-Drott 2014) or the rise of the Nazi party
(Adena et al. 2015).
    Casey (2015) and Keefer and Khemani (2014a, 2014b, 2015) examine
the impact of a type of media that is particularly salient for poor citizens

                     and in one of the poorest regions of the world: community radio in Africa.
                     Casey (2015) examines whether information available through radio helps
                     relax ethnic and partisan loyalties in Sierra Leone. She shows that political
                     information provided through radio on local politicians improves voters’
                     knowledge. She finds that candidate information increases citizen willing-
                     ness to cross ethnic-party lines. Complementary evidence shows that more
                     information induces parties to distribute campaign spending in a more
                     equitable way across districts. Although she interprets this as evidence of
                     more equitable distribution of public goods spending, it could also be that
                     parties respond to the presence of more-informed voters with targeted vote
                     buying together with campaign spending. Unfortunately, she does not
                     have data to test this.
                        In related work in Sierra Leone, Bidwell, Casey, and Glennerster (2015)
                     document that politicians who participated in debates, videotapes of which
                     were shown to a random selection of localities, increased their campaign-
                     ing effort, as measured by gift giving, the monetary value of gifts, and the
                     number of in-person visits. They find little evidence for treatment effects
                     on the activity level of elected members during sittings of Parliament,
                     but they find that using debates to increase the information voters have
                     affects politicians’ engagement with their constituencies, as measured by
                     public meetings and higher spending on development projects. Because
                     infrastructure spending can be captured by local elites and can be a source
                     of corruption,3 more data on welfare measures would be needed to under-
                     stand whether information obtained through debates actually improves
                     governance.
                        Keefer and Khemani (2014a, 2014b) use a natural experiment in radio
                     markets in Benin to examine the impact of broadcasts of public inter-
                     est programming aimed at increasing household demand for health and
                     education services. They find evidence suggesting that although such
                     programming indeed affected household attitudes toward health and edu-
                     cation, the changes were not sufficient to change politicians’ incentives to
                     respond by providing greater services. Households living in villages with
                     access to signals from a larger number of community radio stations are
                     more exposed to public-interest programming and are more likely to invest
                     their private resources in health and the education of their children, but
                     they are not likely to receive more or better public services.
                        At the same time, Keefer and Khemani (2015) uncover some media
                     effects in shifting preferences or beliefs about the appropriate roles of
                     public policies that could be important for the transition to better-quality

                                                       EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



political engagement, even if no impact on public service delivery out-
comes is discerned in the short term. The authors use survey vignettes to
impose an explicit trade-off between political promises of jobs for a few
versus health or education for all. They achieve this through the device
of a budget constraint, emphasizing to respondents that politicians who
allocate resources to government jobs for some members of the commu-
nity have fewer resources available to finance inputs into broadly delivered
health or education services for all of the community. Respondents then
choose whether to support the candidate who would allocate resources to
jobs for a few rather than to greater inputs for health and education for all.
Consistent with Wantchekon’s (2003) pioneering work in Benin, responses
to these surveys reflect widespread citizen support for clientelist candidates
who offer jobs. Yet, respondents living in villages with greater access to
community radio are significantly less likely to support these candidates
who offer jobs at the expense of broad public services.
   Additional results in Keefer and Khemani (2015) highlight the impor-
tance of programming content and issue framing on mass media. Despite
reductions in support for clientelist candidates who offer jobs at the
expense of health and education, radio access does not reduce support
for candidates who offer gifts at the time of elections, a practice that is
regarded as indicative of vote buying. However, from the vignette designed
to measure attitudes toward gift-giving candidates, as in actual practice,
citizens have no information to infer whether gift-giving candidates have
any impact on the provision of health and education. In fact, greater
information conveyed through radio about established public programs in
health and education might lead citizens to believe that gift-giving candi-
dates have little influence, one way or another, on those programs. Keefer
and Khemani (2015) show how this pattern of results is consistent with a
particular mechanism for radio’s impact: it increases citizens’ demand for
public health and education services, thereby reducing their support for
candidates who make clientelist offers at the expense of public health and
education spending.


Evidence of impact on politicians’ response to transparency
Politicians can strategically respond to the disclosure of information and
expected changes in voting behavior by increasing their campaigning
efforts, increasing vote buying, using coercion, or affecting other types of
information to counteract the information about their quality. Although

                                                                                          181
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     less evidence on this mechanism is available, Humphreys and Weinstein
                     (2012) suggest that it was at play in Uganda, where they implemented a
                     large field experiment to evaluate the impact of providing information
                     to voters based on a detailed scorecard on the performance of members
                     of Parliament. They find that voters are sensitive to the information pro-
                     vided in the scorecard and update their beliefs. However, the information
                     ultimately had no impact on politicians’ vote shares. The results suggest
                     that politicians can more easily obfuscate information and deflect scrutiny
                     away from themselves when the information does not clearly specify the
                     consequences of their actions for the services voters care about.
                        Gottlieb (2016) finds that leaders appear to be less transparent when
                     voters are part of an information treatment about local government per-
                     formance. Casey (2015) shows that political information provided through
                     radio induces parties to distribute campaign spending in a more equitable
                     way across districts. Similar effects are found by Bidwell, Casey, and
                     Glennerster (2015), as discussed above, who document that politicians
                     whose debates were videotaped and shown in communities increased their
                     campaign efforts, as measured by gift giving, the monetary value of gifts,
                     and the number of in-person visits.
                        Evidence that politicians respond to information disclosure through
                     vote buying is provided by Cruz, Keefer, and Labonne (2015). They imple-
                     mented a field experiment in which they provided information to voters
                     in the Philippines about the existence and importance of a large infra-
                     structure public spending program one week before a municipal election.
                     The authors show that the intervention led to changes in voter knowledge
                     about the program and about incumbent politicians, and that incumbent
                     politicians responded by increasing resources targeted at voters through
                     vote buying. But Cruz, Keefer, and Labonne (2015) find no significant
                     effects on turnout or voting patterns. Because the information interven-
                     tions undertaken by Cruz, Keefer, and Labonne (2015) were restricted to
                     just before elections, the authors cannot show how voters and politicians
                     would react if information campaigns against vote buying and information
                     on availability of resources to politicians was disseminated in the begin-
                     ning of their electoral term and repeated throughout the term. Indeed, the
                     authors argue that their results could be different if the intervention were
                     implemented earlier in the electoral cycle, when incumbents have greater
                     opportunity to react by increasing the provision of public goods.
                        These results on vote buying in the Philippines are consistent with
                     Khemani (2015), who argues that politicians tradeoff vote buying against

                                                       EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



the provision of broad public services in the Philippines and elsewhere.
An increase in competitive pressure that was induced by the information
campaigns studied by Cruz, Keefer, and Labonne (2015) in a clientelist
setting led to politicians increasing vote buying, especially when they
could not respond by improving the quality of public services. The results
of increases in vote buying by politicians in response to transparency in
the Philippines are also consistent with the results from Benin of the (lack
of) radio’s effects on citizen support for gift-giving candidates (Keefer and
Khemani 2015). In the absence of information about the effects of electing
vote-buying candidates on service delivery, transparency about other areas
can lead to greater vote buying by politicians to woo voters.
   A final piece of evidence suggesting that political leaders might respond
to the disclosure of information comes from Malesky, Schuler, and Tran
(2012). They examine the impact of a randomized broadcast of informa-
tion through an online newspaper in Vietnam, which is an environment in
which a centralized political party controls the nomination of candidates
who are exposed to greater transparency. The results suggest that the trans-
parency intervention induced significant changes in the central political
party’s decisions to nominate and allocate candidates across districts.4


Summarizing lessons by making connections between the literature
In sum, the existing evidence on transparency’s impact on political engage-
ment suggests that information from trustworthy sources (for example,
independent agencies, backed by credible technical capacity) can increase
political participation and allow voters to punish badly performing politi-
cians at the polls. However, the extent to which incumbent politicians and
party elites can undo the positive effects of information on voters is not
clear. In addition, more research is necessary to develop an understanding
of both the long-term effects of information provision as well as the general
equilibrium effects taking into account public officials’, politicians’, and
parties’ responses.
   The evidence of impact on incumbent vote shares suggests that if the
interventions primarily strengthen the hands of incumbent politicians (by
reducing the efficacy of vote-buying tactics used by political challengers),
they may be further protected from losing office and able to continue rent-
extraction policies. On the other hand, if the interventions have a strong
anti-incumbent bias, the incentives of incumbents to try to remain in office
by improving performance may be reduced.

                        Furthermore, there is an important distinction between information
                     about performance versus information about specific policy actions, as
                     emphasized in the theory covered in chapter 4, and which also emerges
                     in the empirical evidence. The evidence suggests that information on
                     “valence issues,” which most voters find desirable, such as the competence
                     and effort of politicians and their performance in service delivery, has
                     greater impact than information about ideological policy positions that
                     divide voters (Kendall, Nannicini, and Trebbi 2015). Studies of interven-
                     tions that provide information about politicians’ specific actions, such as
                     in legislative debate, also find little impact, and suggest that politicians
                     can obfuscate information to prevent voters from using it to assess their
                     performance (Humphreys and Weinstein 2012).


                     Transparency’s impact on governance outcomes
                     occurs through political engagement
                     Transparency affects governance outcomes through political engagement,
                     and ultimate impact on governance depends upon the characteristics of
                     political engagement. A growing number of studies examine whether gov-
                     ernments respond to voters who have access to more information. These
                     studies explain the impact of transparency on government actions as result-
                     ing from changes in voting behavior that then change the political incen-
                     tives of government leaders to respond to voters by improving governance.


                     Media’s impact on government performance occurs through
                     media’s impact on political engagement
                     A body of research on the impact of media on public spending and gov-
                     ernment performance shows how media’s impact occurs through changes
                     in political engagement. Strömberg (2004) measures the effects on public
                     spending of the introduction of radio across U.S. counties during the
                     period 1920–40. He finds that radio increased federal spending, such as
                     social assistance funds in the New Deal programs, particularly in rural
                     counties. He shows that increases in voter turnout in counties with greater
                     radio ownership is the mechanism behind this impact of radio on public
                     spending.
                        Lim, Snyder, and Strömberg (2015) study the effect of newspaper
                     coverage of state trial court judges in the United States, and find that it

184
                                                         EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



significantly increases average sentence length awarded by those judges.
It is specifically trial judges who are elected who are more likely than
appointed judges to increase sentence length when there is greater news-
paper coverage.
    Snyder and Strömberg (2010) exploit mismatches between the geogra-
phy of congressional districts and the geography of media markets in the
United States to trace the entire process by which more or less media cover-
age leads to more or less responsiveness to reelection concerns. The theory
is that in places where the media market and the congressional district
overlap to a greater extent, voters will be more informed about politicians
and politicians will respond accordingly. The authors show that more con-
gruence leads to more coverage of the incumbent. This increase is conse-
quential: more congruence is associated with greater knowledge about the
incumbent congress members. However, more congruence does not lead
to more knowledge about senators, suggesting that congruence is not just
serving as a proxy for political knowledge in general. Congruence also
leads citizens to be more likely to turn out to vote. Turning to incumbent
behavior, the authors find that incumbents in more congruent districts are
more active in committee hearings and vote on roll calls in a less partisan
way. Finally, congruence feeds through to policy: federal spending in a
district is greater when there is more congruence. These results constitute
a powerful case that media’s effects in making governments accountable
operate through electoral institutions.
    Campante and Do (2014) provide further evidence from the United
States for how the interaction between media markets and political mar-
kets influences government performance. First, they provide the reduced-
form result that states in the United States whose capital cities are more
isolated, as defined relative to the spatial distribution of the state’s popula-
tion, have greater levels of corruption. They then provide direct evidence
of the mechanism underlying the association between isolation and cor-
ruption: newspapers cover state politics more when readers are closer to
the capital. Voters who live far from the capital are less knowledgeable
and interested in state politics, and they turn out less in state elections
(but not in presidential elections). The authors report additional support-
ing results that isolated capitals are associated with more money in state-
level campaigns and worse public goods provision. This evidence shows
how even in a context with strong internal checks and balances, external
accountability through the interaction of media and elections is important
for governance.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        Some results in Nannicini et al. (2013), discussed in chapter 5 on the
                     role of historical institutions within Italy in shaping “civic voting,” or
                     healthy political engagement to punish corrupt leaders, can be interpreted
                     as supporting the notion that transparency can help bring about changes
                     in political engagement in the short run (without waiting for history to
                     run its course). The authors find that newspaper circulation is significantly
                     correlated with lower corruption. When newspaper circulation is included
                     in the analysis, the estimated impact of historical institutions shrinks and
                     loses statistical significance. That is, the historically rooted differences in
                     institutions within Italy are not significant in explaining “civic” voting
                     behavior to punish transgressions once newspaper circulation is taken into
                     account. When using measures of political engagement (average turnout
                     in national elections, European elections, and referenda during the 1990s)
                     instead of historical social capital, the negative correlation between cor-
                     ruption and the political engagement measures of social capital is strongly
                     robust to the inclusion of newspapers’ diffusion as an explanatory variable.5
                     That is, political engagement and transparency together explain civic vot-
                     ing to punish transgressions by political leaders and thereby strengthen
                     incentives for lower corruption, even in an environment in which there are
                     historical differences in social norms.


                     The role of transparency in improving governance in developing countries
                     Because most of the evidence on the interaction between media and
                     political markets comes from rich countries with well-functioning institu-
                     tions, whether politicians in developing countries respond the same way
                     to media-informed citizens is unclear. One of the first studies to examine
                     this proposition was Besley and Burgess (2002) in India. They study how
                     governments respond to natural disasters such as droughts and floods with
                     relief to local populations and whether these responses vary according to
                     the presence of local media (that is, newspapers). They find that higher
                     newspaper circulation is associated with greater government responsive-
                     ness to declines in food production and flood damage. They argue that
                     this association is driven by greater political engagement of more informed
                     citizens.
                        The work by Ferraz and Finan (2011) evaluating the role of electoral
                     accountability in reducing corruption in Brazil also extends to examining
                     the complementary role of mass media. They find that the presence of
                     local radio enhances the incentives of mayors who face reelection to reduce

corruption compared with the incentives of mayors who face term limits.
They also find a smaller difference in corruption between term-limited
and other mayors in municipalities that have local radio stations, which
they interpret as evidence that even term-limited mayors might suffer other
types of punishment and therefore have incentives to reduce corruption in
the presence of the media.
   Bobonis, Cámara Fuertes, and Schwabe (forthcoming) show that the
impact of the public disclosure of audit reports on municipal corruption
in Puerto Rico is concentrated in municipalities that experience greater
political competition. Furthermore, they provide evidence that transpar-
ency’s effects are short-lived and occur only when audit disclosure happens
close to an election. They also provide suggestive evidence that voters use
the information to select more competent leaders who may perform better
in office. Their study makes a case for timely, regular, and sustained long-
term commitments to audit disclosure to improve governance.
   A case study from Peru shows that media can play a powerful role in
holding leaders accountable. Using data from bribery records maintained
by Vladimiro Montesinos, the security chief in Peru under President
Fujimori, McMillan and Zoido (2004) show how political support and
acquiescence were purchased from media owners as well as from opposi-
tion politicians and judges. The importance of media is reflected in the
fact that the bribe price of media owners was an order of magnitude greater
than what was paid to politicians and judges. On the one hand, this case
shows how politicians can manipulate and capture accountability institu-
tions. On the other, the case also highlights the special properties media
markets have that would improve accountability, given that plurality
(dispersed ownership) can be an effective defense against capture. It takes
just one media outlet to make information public. McMillan and Zoido
(2004) discuss how Montesinos was unable to purchase the support of one
television channel, which remained resolute and continued to criticize the
political regime in Peru. It was this channel that ultimately contributed to
the demise of the regime by broadcasting taped evidence of Montesinos’s
corrupt practices. Prat and Strömberg (2011) argue that commercial media
can be a strong force for achieving such plurality and dispersion because
of the commercial motive to win an audience and maintain a reputation
for credibility.
   In places where political engagement is flawed, even when some voters
are sensitive to transparency, the net impact on governance depends upon
how selected politicians behave during their tenure in office. Politicians’

                                                                                         187

                     behavior, in turn, depends upon the larger institutional context and what
                     might informally be referred to as the “size” of the impact on political
                     engagement—whether sufficient voters have changed their behavior to
                     make it politically unprofitable for leaders to continue with corruption
                     or clientelism. In work in Sierra Leone, although Bidwell, Casey, and
                     Glennerster (2015) and Casey (2015) show that information available
                     through radio helps relax ethnic and partisan loyalties, neither study
                     clearly shows whether information helped improve the performance of
                     public spending and public service delivery versus inducing politicians to
                     deliver more clientelist transfers. In Benin, Keefer and Khemani (2014a,
                     2014b) find that radio did not lead to greater public accountability and
                     argue that it did not because it did not have a sufficient impact on political
                     engagement. Schools located in villages with greater radio access enjoyed
                     no greater government inputs (such as teachers or books), nor more respon-
                     sive service providers (lower teacher absenteeism), nor more active parent-
                     teacher associations. Households in villages with better community radio
                     access were also less likely to receive free bed nets from the government.
                        In sum, although the previous section finds consistent evidence across
                     a large literature and in a variety of institutional contexts that political
                     engagement is sensitive to transparency, the research on the ultimate
                     impact on governance is more limited. Little existing empirical research
                     in developing countries is designed to address the question of how trans-
                     parency shapes governance by leaders during their tenure in office. The
                     available evidence comes from the United States and a few countries in
                     Latin America, taking advantage of rich time series data on media and
                     political markets as well as on governance outcomes. The available empiri-
                     cal work in poorer countries, such as in Africa and South Asia, has so far
                     been designed to focus on short-term changes in voters’ and politicians’
                     behavior at the time of elections. This situation points to a fertile agenda
                     for future work to examine how transparency, especially through media
                     markets that intersect with political markets, can bring about governance
                     transitions in developing countries.


                     Media’s effects on political polarization
                     Additional evidence from the United States on how citizens change their
                     beliefs and political behavioral norms that constrain policies from being
                     pursued on the basis of technical merit highlights the interaction between
                     the forces of transparency and political engagement. Examples of such

problems were provided in chapter 1, including popular demand for
energy subsidies without due regard to the cost of these subsidies. Another
example is ideological polarization that leads to policy gridlock. Glaeser
and Sunstein (2013) show that in the presence of preexisting beliefs that
polarize citizens, transparency alone is not only unlikely to shift beliefs but
might in fact cause previous beliefs to become even more entrenched. The
same information can activate completely different memories of personal
experiences and associated convictions, thus producing polarized responses
to that information.
   Glaeser and Sunstein (2013) further show that leaders can play a role
in credible communication that can persuade citizens to shift their beliefs.
They provide the following example from the United States in this regard:

    When liberals and conservatives are asked for their private views
    about a generous welfare policy and a more stringent one, they
    react in the predictable ways, with liberals favoring the former
    and conservatives the latter. But things change dramatically when
    they are informed of the distribution of views within the House
    of Representatives. More specifically, conservatives end up disap-
    proving of the more stringent policy, and favor the generous one,
    when they are told that 90 percent of House Republicans favor the
    generous policy. Liberals show the same willingness to abandon
    their private opinions, and thus end up favoring the stringent
    policy, when told that this is the position of 90 percent of House
    Democrats. Notably, the effect of learning about party views is as
    strong among those who are knowledgeable about welfare policy
    as it is among people who were not. Also notably, both conserva-
    tives and liberals believe that their judgments are driven largely
    by the merits, and not by what they learn about the views of their
    preferred party—but in that belief, they are wrong. (Glaeser and
    Sunstein 2013, 23)

However, whether leaders have incentives to support policies on technical
merit, and the credibility to signal that they are doing so to their constitu-
ents (as in the example above), rather than to reflect polarization among
the electorate, links back to the role of transparency in shaping political
engagement. The congruence between media markets and political markets
is significant in determining the degree of polarized voting in the American
legislature (Campante and Hojman 2013; Snyder and Strömberg 2010).

                                                                                           189
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        Campante and Hojman (2013) show how the intersection of media
                     and political markets influences another source of political impediments
                     to good public policies—ideological polarization among politicians and
                     citizens. They provide robust evidence that the introduction of broadcast
                     television decreased the ideological polarization of the U.S. Congress.
                     Information provided by television acted as an important force for bring-
                     ing members of Congress toward the political center. They also find similar
                     effects for the expansion of radio in the 1930s. Their framework can be
                     extended to suggest how different types of media play a role in the steady
                     increase in polarization in the United States since the 1970s. This increase
                     in polarization has coincided with significant structural changes in the
                     American media environment—the rise of talk radio, the expansion of
                     cable television, and the growth of the Internet, all of which are associ-
                     ated with content differentiation and market segmentation that may have
                     contributed to increased polarization.
                        Gentzkow and Shapiro (2011) use data on the ideological composition
                     of news website visitors (Democrat or Republican) to compare ideologi-
                     cal segregation online and offline. They examine whether new sources of
                     information (that is, the Internet) expose individuals to a more diverse set
                     of news or cause consumers to self-segregate in consuming news that is
                     closer to their initial beliefs. The authors measure segregation in online
                     news compared with other forms of more traditional news and ­face-to-face
                     interactions. They find that ideological segregation on the Internet is
                     higher than in most offline media, but significantly lower than segregation
                     in face-to-face interactions. They find no evidence that users of or audi-
                     ences on the Internet are becoming more segregated over time.
                        This body of evidence from U.S. experience has implications for how to
                     generate ideas about harnessing transparency to address similar problems
                     of entrenched ideological beliefs among citizens in developing countries,
                     such as the government’s role in controlling prices by subsidizing essential
                     commodities. The insights from the United States can explain developing
                     countries’ experience with subsidy reforms—informing citizens about
                     the cost of subsidies is not sufficient to solve the problem (Clements et al.
                     2013). Leaders who emerge from healthy political processes, with popular
                     mandates for public service delivery, may be key to shifting general beliefs
                     and norms in the public sector among public officials, frontline service pro-
                                                                                        ­ hapter 4.

The role of media in controlling corruption
A number of studies report that the presence of competitive media mar-
kets is significantly associated with greater control of corruption across
countries. Besley and Prat (2006), using data from 90 countries in 1999,
find that a high degree of state ownership of newspapers (market share of
more than 30 percent) is associated with greater corruption and political
longevity. Adsera, Boix, and Payne (2003) and Brunetti and Weder (2003)
provide similar cross-country evidence that the presence of independent
media is associated with better indicators of governance.
   In contrast to the robust correlation with media markets, results on the
correlation between public disclosure policies and governance outcomes
are both fewer and more ambiguous. Escaleras, Lin, and Register (2009)
examine whether recently implemented freedom of information (FOI)
laws are correlated with changes in public sector corruption. They analyze
data from 128 countries between 1984 and 2003, and use propensity score
matching methods to address the problem of endogenous selection of FOI
laws. Considering all 128 countries, they find no significant effect of FOI
on reducing public sector corruption. However, in subdividing the sample
between developed and developing countries, the authors find that the
existence of FOI acts is positively and significantly related to public sec-
tor corruption in developing countries, with no correlation in developed
countries. The surprising result is that FOI acts are associated with greater
levels of public sector corruption in developing countries. The authors
cannot rule out that part of this correlation might arise from greater revela-
tion of instances of corruption, or greater measured corruption after the
enactment of FOI. That is, the study is not able to discern whether actual
corruption or incentives for corruption changed as a result of the FOI act.
   Mungiu-Pippidi (2014) reports press freedom as being among the robust
correlates of the control of corruption. In an equilibrium cross-sectional
model explaining the control of corruption for the period 1996–2011 for
a sample of 148 countries, variables that are positively correlated with
the control of corruption are an independent judiciary system, controls
on executive power, robust civil society, and press freedom. In separate
analysis, she also finds that legislation of FOI acts (FOIAs) is positively

                                                                                          191

                     correlated with the control of corruption. However, there are fewer tests
                     of the robustness of the correlation between corruption and FOIA com-
                     pared with what is obtained within her study and from the larger literature
                     reviewed above on the role of independent media.


                     Mass media can work together with political engagement to strengthen
                     institutions: Lessons from history
                     Thus far this chapter has reviewed the accumulating empirical evidence
                     that transparency influences political engagement, and joins previous
                     chapters showing that political engagement, in turn, has profound conse-
                     quences for governance. Yet the available empirical tests do not extend to
                     rigorously examining whether these forces together bring about changes in
                     the myriad institutions of government through which services are delivered
                     and internal accountability is maintained. The literature on institutional
                     change is either theoretical or descriptive, using historical accounts to bol-
                     ster theoretical explanations. It is also limited. Most writers acknowledge
                     that little is known about how societies that begin with weak institutions
                     move toward strengthening them. This section reviews arguments avail-
                     able in this literature that transparency can play a role in institutional
                     transition, working together with broad-based political engagement.
                        Accounts of historical transitions from weak to stronger institutions
                     in the public sector in the United States and United Kingdom suggest
                     that independent mass media played a role in that transition by work-
                     ing together with political engagement (Camp, Dixit, and Stokes 2014;
                     Glaeser and Goldin 2006; Lizzeri and Persico 2004). Political institutions
                     in both the United States and in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth
                     century have been described as exhibiting instances of vote buying similar
                     to those in currently poor countries. Bensel (2004) writes that for many
                     men in the mid-nineteenth century in the United States, “the act of voting
                     was a social transaction in which they handed in a party ticket in return
                     for a shot of whiskey, a pair of boots, or a small amount of money” (Bensel
                     2004, ix). In the United Kingdom, Seymour (1970 [1915], 184) writes
                     that party agents carried ledgers with “a space for special circumstances
                     which might give an opportunity for political blackmail, such as debts,
                     mortgages, need of money in trade, commercial relations, and even the
                     most private domestic matters.”
                        Camp, Dixit, and Stokes (2014) document historical accounts
                     of how the efficacy of vote buying through agents declined in the

United Kingdom and thereby precipitated legislation such as the 1883
Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, which was upheld and enforced with
bipartisan political support. Cox (1987) and Phillips and Wetherell (1995)
argue that the expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1832
in the United Kingdom led to dramatic changes in voting patterns. Elite
support for extending the franchise, in turn, is explained in this litera-
ture by the rise in demand for broad public health goods in British cities
around the industrial revolution (Lizzeri and Persico 2004). The expand-
ing electorate began to have access to cheaper newspapers, which enabled
politicians to directly reach voters with their messages rather than having
to rely on agents (Camp, Dixit, and Stokes 2014). Leaders of both the
Liberal and Conservative parties have been quoted as becoming aware of
the reduced effectiveness of vote buying because “the new mass electorate,
through increased education and a cheap press, would become politically
free and independent in a sense that their predecessors would not have
thought possible” (O’Leary 1962, 231).
   Accounts of the Progressive Era in the United States are even more
explicit about the role of newspapers and mass media along with the
demise of machine politics in bringing about institutional change.
Glaeser and Goldin (2006) review this literature and suggest that voter
dissatisfaction with machine politics and the rise of independent media
contributed to the conditions for institutional reform that created profes-
sional bureaucracies. Rauch (1995) describes the reforms in this era that
resulted in the professionalization of the bureaucracy in American cities
and the ensuing reduction in the political power to intervene in city
management.


Transparency initiatives targeted only at improving
local service delivery are not enough
A variety of transparency policy initiatives have focused on citizen engage-
ment outside the political realm to solve service delivery problems. One
prominent initiative involves the generation of information as a tool for
mobilizing citizens to monitor and demand accountability from frontline
public service providers. These types of “citizen report card” initiatives
emphasize the “social” accountability of public providers, without relying
on changes in the political incentives of leaders in government, who ulti-
mately are responsible for managing these providers.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     Social accountability
                     Social accountability initiatives are more likely to be successful when
                     they influence political incentives. Evidence shows that low motiva-
                     tion and effort by public providers can be linked to political incentives
                     that reward leaders for providing jobs in the public sector as political
                     patronage or in exchange for bribes rather than for holding providers
                     accountable for service delivery.6 In contexts in which political incen-
                     tives encourage patronage and clientelism, citizen report cards may have
                     no effect on public service delivery. Among the mixed evidence of the
                     impact of citizen report cards, those studies that find no effect are more
                     likely to be situated in unhealthy political contexts.7 Even among suc-
                     cessful cases, little evidence indicates that transparency alone spurred
                     communities to organize to solve local public goods problems. Instead,
                     committees instituted for citizen engagement in a community are fre-
                     quently defunct and require intensive mobilization efforts by civil society
                     to take any action.
                         A study by Björkman and Svensson (2009) finds that a social account-
                     ability intervention led to a significant improvement in the performance of
                     health workers and a reduction in child mortality. The intervention con-
                     sisted of mobilizing community-based monitoring, whereby citizens and
                     local health workers met to discuss the quality of health and put together
                     a plan to monitor and improve the quality of services at local health facili-
                     ties. The authors’ preferred explanation of the mechanisms of impact is
                     that citizens were able to engage in local collective action to hold providers
                     accountable for what they were supposed to do, as well as to generate new
                     resources to collaboratively solve local delivery problems. Disentangling
                     these two very different mechanisms through which local collective action
                     could work is important to gaining an understanding of how to make
                     governments perform better for citizens. Although improving service
                     delivery outcomes through greater citizen contributions is valuable in its
                     own right, it can nevertheless leave intact governance impediments that
                     prevent public officials from performing better with existing resources.
                     This distinction is particularly important in the case of the poorest and
                     most vulnerable segments of society for whom citizen contributions can
                     be an undue burden and who rely on state-provided services. If the poor
                     need to spend their resources—their money or their voluntary labor—to
                     maintain public services, this may be at odds with the goals of other public
                     programs for poverty eradication.

   Furthermore, the results are also consistent with the political engage-
ment mechanism. Provider behavior may have improved because directly
elected local leaders managed them better once information about health
service delivery made communities demand better performance. The
Health Users Management Committee (HUMC) system in Uganda was
described as dysfunctional to begin with at the time this work was under-
taken. After the intervention, more than one-third of the HUMCs were
dissolved in the communities receiving the intervention, and new mem-
bers were elected, with no such turnover in the comparator communities
that did not receive the intervention. This suggests that the information
and mobilization around health services might have affected how people
voted and how locally elected leaders exerted pressure on local providers
to improve the quality of health provision.
   In more recent work, Björkman, De Walque, and Svensson (2014) try
to disentangle the effects of information provision from the effects of
collective mobilization through community participation in meetings.
They designed an intervention that focused on mobilization alone. Their
original intervention (Björkman and Svensson 2009) included community
meetings and a report card on the community’s health clinic’s performance
compared with that of other communities and benchmarked against the
national standard for primary health care provision. The new interven-
tion also provided information through a report card on the community’s
health clinic, but did not include information relative to other health facili-
ties. The authors conclude that without information on relative perfor-
mance, participation in community meetings had little impact on health
workers’ performance or on health outcomes. Their interpretation of the
results is that relative performance information enables users to distinguish
between health workers’ effort and factors outside health workers’ control.
   However, Björkman, De Walque, and Svensson (2014) are not able
to test whether information alone could have generated the results in
the absence of the mobilization efforts. Results from very similar social
accountability interventions in other work suggest that information is
unlikely to make a difference in the absence of mobilization. Banerjee
et al. (2010) evaluate a similar initiative in the education sector in India
that was aimed at improving the functioning of citizen participation in
village education committees (VECs). Just like the HUMCs in Uganda,
the VECs in India were found to be inactive at baseline. Fewer than 8 per-
cent of community respondents were aware of the existence of the VEC.
Furthermore, among those community respondents who local officials

                                                                                           195

                     indicated were VEC members, as many as 22 percent were not aware of
                     the VEC or their own role in it.
                        In the face of such widespread ignorance of the VEC, a civil society
                     organization designed an initiative to raise awareness about the VEC’s
                     intended role that was expected to spark local action. However, the results
                     show that information did not activate the defunct VECs. But when com-
                     munity members were given, in addition to information, the opportunity
                     to be trained in a teaching tool that gave them the ability to directly
                     improve educational outcomes, it was taken up by community volunteers
                     and resulted in a large impact on learning. The mechanism, however,
                     completely bypassed the public school system. Private reading classes were
                     led by community volunteers who received no support from the elected
                     village head or the public school teachers.


                     Transparency’s impact on private actions, bypassing the public sector
                     Some of the cases show that transparency can affect private actions that
                     bypass governance problems in the public sector. Outcomes, such as in
                     health and education, can improve because transparency plays a role in
                     changing private household behaviors and the functioning of private mar-
                     kets that are independent of or bypass governance problems in the public
                     sector. However, bypassing these problems means that they are then left
                     intact as impediments to fulfilling the role of the public sector in promot-
                     ing those outcomes. For example, Banerjee et al.’s (2010) study of the inter-
                     vention in India that targeted transparency at community mobilization
                     finds improved education outcomes among children because community
                     volunteers held remedial classes outside the public school system. However,
                     transparency had no impact on the performance of school teachers on
                     the public payroll who are frequently absent and do not teach even when
                     present in school (Banerjee et al. 2010).8 It, therefore, did not address the
                     governance problem of teacher absence, which has been estimated to cost
                     about $1.5 billion per year (Muralidharan et al. 2014). Therefore, even
                     though outcomes can improve if transparency is used outside the political
                     realm, those improvements depend on citizens taking on the burden of
                     providing public goods themselves, such as by contributing their labor and
                     material resources, rather than on holding government officials account-
                     able for what they are paid from public resources.
                        An older strand of literature (among others, Stigler 1961; Stiglitz and
                     Weiss 1981) examines transparency’s role in solving problems of asymmetric

                                                       EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



information in economic and financial markets. The East Asian financial
crisis of the 1990s, for example, was later partially explained by the lack
of transparent accounting standards and financial reporting (Kaufmann
and Bellver 2005).9 Analysis of the role of information in improving the
functioning of markets has been extended beyond the financial sector to
that of education. Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja (2015) provide evidence that
information about local education markets led to improvements in the
functioning of those markets and to better education outcomes.
   However, as discussed at the outset of this report, bypassing problems
in the public sector means, logically, that they are then left intact as
impediments to development goals. Keefer and Khemani (2014a, 2015a)
provide evidence and review the literature showing that information can
improve private household behaviors that contribute to health and educa-
tion outcomes, but with no impact on public sector governance or public
accountability.
   Other evidence is consistent with information’s effects on private
actions and contrasts with the lack of effect on organized group action.
Lieberman, Posner, and Tsai (2014) evaluate an intervention in Kenya that
provided parents with information about children’s performance in schools
and guidelines for actions parents could take to improve school quality.
They find that the informational intervention did not improve parents’
participation in education groups or meetings, or the number of actions
taken by officials to improve schooling. However, they do report large
point estimates, although not statistically significant, for the information’s
impact on parent efforts at home to improve their children’s learning.


Using transparency to improve “last-mile” service delivery problems
Information revealed to citizens by higher-tier government authorities
can potentially elicit their help in holding frontline officials accountable
for service delivery at the last mile. Reinikka and Svensson (2005, 2011)
undertook a pioneering study of such an intervention by the Ministry of
Education in Uganda to publicize information about grants that were
supposed to flow to schools. Before this campaign was undertaken by
the ministry, the researchers gathered data that revealed that more than
90 percent of the funds were not reaching the schools. After the ministry’s
information campaign, the researchers found that schools located closer
to newspaper outlets received more government funds from the capitation
grants. Although the authors provide evidence that information reduced

                                                                                          197
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     corruption, the campaign had many components, and it is difficult to
                     determine what caused the reduction in leakages. The authors’ preferred
                     interpretation is that information published in the newspaper empowered
                     the school community to bargain with local officials to provide the school’s
                     entitlement. However, several other interpretations are possible, including
                     that the information campaign served as a signal from higher-tier minis-
                     tries to lower-level officials that they were being monitored and would be
                     held accountable for leakages.10
                        The results of the interventions documented in Banerjee et al. (2010)
                     contrast with those of another information intervention undertaken by
                     Pandey et al. (2009) in similar villages in the same part of northern India.
                     Pandey et al. (2009) find that information campaigns resulted in reduced
                     absenteeism among village public school teachers, but with modest effects
                     on improvements in learning. A key difference between the information
                     interventions across these two studies was the mode of communication.
                     Banerjee et al. (2010) relied on participatory activities undertaken by civil
                     society with the aim of promoting local collective action. In contrast, the
                     central plank of the information intervention in Pandey et al. (2009) was
                     a sophisticated video that was played at village gatherings, produced by
                     the researchers and carrying the endorsement of the state Department
                     of Education rather than being owned and implemented by civil society.
                     This Department of Education imprimatur suggests that one reason for
                     the difference in results may be the signal from higher-tier authorities that
                     they are monitoring local providers and will back up citizen complaints.
                     This interpretation resonates with the Uganda example discussed above
                     and another result from Indonesia, discussed below.
                        Banerjee et al. (2015) provide evidence from a context in which
                     transparency is used by credible political leaders to encourage citizen
                     engagement to hold local officials accountable. They examine the impact
                     of letters mailed to citizens in Indonesia from the central government
                     informing them about the rules and functioning of a subsidized rice
                     program implemented by local governments. They find that the infor-
                     mation increased the subsidy received by eligible households. Fewer
                     ineligible households received subsidized rice in treatment villages, but
                     those that continued to purchase subsidized rice received more in quan-
                     tity. The fact that the eligible households received more, while ineligible
                     households in total received no less, implies that the information reduced
                     leakage, increasing the total amount of rice distributed in the villages by
                     17 percent.

                                                       EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



   Banerjee et al. (2015) provide further evidence on the mechanisms of
impact that show how political engagement by citizens, in the form of pro-
tests and pressure upon locally elected officials, played a role in improving
governance in this rice subsidy program. In one set of villages, information
was provided in a more “public” way, through public announcements and
posters in addition to the mailing of private letters that could lower the
costs of coordinated citizen action. Citizens were more likely to organize
protests in these villages to hold the village head accountable. Although the
authors do not focus on political accountability mechanisms, furthering
instead a story of bargaining that can occur between election cycles, politi-
cal engagement is at the center of their theoretical model. For example,
they state, “Complaints have a political cost: the higher the number of
complaints, the more likely the leader will be replaced” (Banerjee et al.
2015, 12). Both their theory and their empirical results are consistent with
village heads improving governance because of the disciplining feature of
local electoral institutions. Whether similar results would be obtained had
the central government provided information about a program adminis-
tered by nonelected officials remains an open question in this study.
   Other work examines the role of information in enabling citizens to
hold appointed public officials, not elected leaders, accountable. Peisakhin
(2012) and Peisakhin and Pinto (2010) examine the impact of informa-
tion on the performance of appointed public officials in the context of
the FOIA in India. They find that citizens can use the act to spur local
public officials to process their applications for benefits under government
programs, reducing the number of days it takes to receive their benefits.
Submission of an information request under the act is a close substitute for
paying a bribe to the official to speed up the receipt of benefits. As mod-
eled in Banerjee et al. (2015) and framed in chapter 4, the impact mecha-
nisms in this channel depend on the functioning of political engagement,
because public officials risk complaints and punishment from higher-level
leaders should they fail to respond. That is, transparency can effectively
engage citizens to improve governance within public bureaucracies when
leaders’ political incentives are aligned appropriately.
   The examples above suggest that a key condition for successful local
action is the signal by higher-tier government departments that local citi-
zen action would be taken seriously and used by leaders with power over
formal mechanisms within government to hold local officials accountable.
This supposition is consistent with the conceptual framework in ­    chapter 4
on how citizen engagement initiatives to improve the performance of local

                                                                                          199

                     officials will succeed to the extent that higher-tier officials have the
                     incentives to use that local engagement to improve accountability. The
                     incentives of higher-tier officials, in turn, depend upon the larger principal-
                     ­
                     agent problem (see chapter 4) in which citizens hold government leaders
                     accountable. That is, the success of citizen engagement initiatives to
                     improve last-mile service delivery problems depends on whether higher-
                     level leaders’ political incentives are aligned with those initiatives.
                        Research on the impact of transparency initiatives that aim to engage
                     citizens in solving last-mile service delivery problems further show that
                     transparency is more likely to be effective when it targets citizen engage-
                     ment methods that do not depend upon organized, group-based collective
                     action.
                        Comparing the above results from Banerjee et al. (2015) in Indonesia
                     and Peisakhin (2012) in India with another study from India of a public
                     program that provides more broadly distributed benefits sheds light on
                     what citizens are likely to do when they have more information. Ravallion
                     et al. (2015) provided information to households in Bihar about proce-
                     dural rules and citizen entitlements under India’s flagship anti-poverty
                     program, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
                     Act (MGNREGA), which is administered by elected village governments.
                     The use of information to improve program delivery is similar in essence
                     to the Indonesia situation in which elected village governments distribute
                     subsidized rice and citizens are provided information about the program
                     rules. The contexts differ in the nature of the public program being
                     ­
                     studied—citizens would have to organize collectively to demand a public
                     works program for employment under the MGNREGA program in India,
                     rather than simply pressure local leaders at an individual level to give them
                     the rice to which they are entitled as in Indonesia. Similarly, in the study on
                     the facilitating environment provided by the FOIA (Peisakhin 2012), citi-
                     zens were able to use information to individually demand private benefits.
                        In contrast to the results in Banerjee et al. (2015) and in Peisakhin
                     (2012), Ravallion et al. (2015) find that although the information inter-
                     vention improved knowledge of entitlements, it did not affect actual out-
                     comes in the program governance. There was no effect on work programs
                     executed, wage rates, or days worked. They conclude that although house-
                     holds learned their rights, they did not use the information to demand
                     greater performance.
                        Results in another study in Indonesia are also consistent with citizens
                     more easily using information to take individual-level action rather than

organized group action. Olken (2007) reports differential impacts of a
community mobilization and information campaign on leakage in wages
versus in materials expenses in the implementation of local construction
projects. This pattern is consistent with informed community members
being able to individually bargain for the right wages to be paid to them,
but not to organize collective action to reduce corruption in other places,
where the costs are diffused throughout the community.
    This pattern is consistent with a large literature on collective action by
groups (pioneered by Olson [1965]) and bears resemblance to the Lowi-
Wilson Matrix, which provides an understanding of the conditions under
which groups organize (Lowi 1972; Wilson 1973). In that literature, infor-
mation does not play a significant role in explaining whether citizens are
organized in groups. Incentives to organize are linked to concentrated ben-
efits and dispersed costs of policies, with small groups being more likely to
sustain collective action for concentrated group benefits. An exception may
be cases of larger political organization when citizens take to the streets
to overthrow an oppressive and corrupt regime. Anecdotal evidence and
ongoing research suggest that such large-group action can be facilitated by
new information and communications technologies (Acemoglu, Hassan,
and Tahoun 2014; Manacorda and Tesei 2016).
    The importance of local political engagement comes to the fore when
contrasting the results of Banerjee et al. (2010) and Lieberman, Posner, and
Tsai (2014) on the lack of transparency’s impact on local public schools
with those found by Pradhan et al. (2014) in the context of a more politi-
cally relevant intervention to improve schools in Indonesia. Pradhan et al.
(2014) implement a randomized evaluation of alternative approaches to
strengthening school committees in public schools in Indonesia. They
find that interventions that increase the engagement of members of the
village council, who are elected by citizens, had the highest impact in
improving school outcomes. They attribute the effects to the mechanisms
of increased electoral accountability of politicians on the basis of education
improvements. Their results support the idea that political engagement
and political accountability are important factors in inducing change in
the quality of public services. Moreover, the Indonesia school interventions
also changed the institutional rules through which representatives of edu-
cation committees were chosen so that new representatives were brought
into power. This result is similar to the evidence in Uganda of turnover
in the elected members of the HUMCs, and again highlights the critical
role of selection and sanctioning of leaders (that is, political engagement).

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT




                     Transparency and behavioral norms in the public sector
                     The research discussed so far has focused on how transparency can encour-
                     age political engagement to reduce corruption, and enable public providers
                     to be held to account. Another channel through which transparency might
                     improve public sector performance is by strengthening professional behav-
                     ioral norms among public officials and service providers. This channel may
                     be especially important for sectors such as health and education, in which
                     professional expertise and pride in work can have a role. Excessive reliance
                     on the incentive mechanism of accountability to citizens via monitoring
                     and feedback runs the risk of spreading canards and can weaken the role
                     of professional norms. For example, powerful parents who are local elites
                     might demand preferential treatment for their own children and make it
                     difficult for teachers to effectively serve all the children in their classroom
                     by adhering to the norms of the professional training they have received.
                     Instead, powerful parents might extract favorable treatment for their
                     own children by unduly influencing teachers to deviate from professional
                     behavior. The available research on the use of transparency to spur social
                     accountability pays little attention to these issues.
                        A growing body of research examines the role of intrinsic behavioral
                     norms in shaping the performance of public service providers.11 Although
                     analysis of sector-specific human resource behavior and management is
                     outside the scope of this report, the general insight provided through the
                     research covered in chapters 4 and 5 is that political engagement and the
                     leaders selected through it shape behavioral norms in the public sector.
                     Transparency can play a role by improving the basis upon which leaders
                     are selected and sanctioned. Box 6.1 provides an example from Brazil of
                     how transparency was combined with political engagement to improve the
                     management and professional behavior of public health workers.
                        Transparency might also contribute to increasing competition among
                     public officials and increasing peer pressure to improve performance.
                     Experiential evidence from the success of initiatives such as the Doing
                     Business project demonstrates that publicizing performance indicators
                     can bring about governance reforms by spurring competition among
                     countries to attract private investment. However, there is as yet no theo-
                     retical or empirical research available on the impact of such a channel of
                     transparency.
                        Finally, transparency could play a direct role in shifting political beliefs
                     and behavioral norms in society. It could potentially address the problem

    Box 6.1  How the “Big I” institutions of transparency and elections matter for the
    functioning of the “small i” institutions of public sector management
    A case study from the state of Ceara, one of the poor-     hand-in-hand with a strategic transparency initia-
    est states in Brazil, shows how reform leaders used        tive to address the political problem head on, and
    local media (radio) and forces of municipal political      in the process shift the culture of performance
    competition to complement reforms in the recruit-          in the state’s health sector. The governor’s office

of a “culture of corruption” that was discussed in chapter 1 that stems from
rational beliefs about how others are behaving. For example, one prominent
initiative pioneered by civil society actors in India (that has spread beyond
to other countries) is directed toward inducing changes in the culture
of bribery through an information and communication campaign. The
organization Janaagraha in India has developed and supports a website,
www.ipaidabribe.com, that invites citizens to submit reports of bribes paid,
bribes requested but not paid, and encounters with honest officers who did
their job without asking for a bribe. While much of the discussion around
this initiative focuses on how it might reveal information about the extent
of bribery and the market price of bribes for different public services,12

                                                                                                                 203
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     another way in which it may work is by signaling a shift in public demands
                     for receiving high-quality and corruption-free public services.
                        Dixit (2015) describes a similar initiative undertaken by another civil
                     society group in India—the “Zero Rupee Note” campaign of the Fifth
                     Pillar group. This group distributed specially printed zero-rupee notes
                     to citizens to exhort them to use these as symbolic payments to bribe-
                     demanding public officials. The thinking behind such campaigns is that
                     they can help persuade people to shift their actions and refrain from sup-
                     plying bribes. The publicizing of these initiatives might work as forces for
                     coordinating changes in individual actions, thereby creating the collective
                     action needed to root out corruption.
                        However, these examples are not yet backed by hard research on how
                     transparency in the form of persuasion campaigns might change behavioral
                     norms in the public sector. The little research that can be found highlights
                     the role of mass media as a force for persuasion and as an institution that can
                     address coordination problems among citizens going beyond information
                     alone. Some evidence from developing countries indicates that mass media
                     plays a significant role in shifting social norms, particularly those related to
                     the role of women. La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea (2012) show that access
                     to the TV Globo network in Brazil, which carried soap operas with inde-
                     pendent female characters with few, or even no, children, reduced fertility
                     in the population. Viewing the soap operas had an effect equal to 1.6 years
                     of additional education. In India, access to similar soap operas carried on
                     cable television reduced fertility and son preference and increased women’s
                     autonomy (Jensen and Oster 2009). The World Development Report 2015:
                     Mind, Society, and Behavior (World Bank 2015) reviews the literature on
                     how programs on mass media that are both entertaining and ­educational—
                     infotainment—can be designed to shift social and gender norms.
                        This finding suggests that the role of infotainment might extend
                     to influencing political beliefs and strengthening political behavioral
                     norms—what policies to demand, what issues to consider when evaluat-
                     ing leaders, and whether to become a contender for leadership. However,
                     there is relatively little evidence available on this role for transparency.13
                     Problems of political beliefs are likely to be harder to address with transpar-
                     ency than cases of information asymmetries that might be solved through
                     the provision of new information. The role of persuasion through differ-
                     ent means of communication—including through credible leaders who
                     emerge from processes of political engagement—is likely to be key.

                                                            EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY



The research reviewed in this chapter suggests that citizens even in the
poorest countries are ready to use transparency to hold leaders accountable.
Transparency’s impact in one area—on voting behavior—is significant
across all regions and in a variety of institutional contexts. Whether this
responsiveness of voting behavior to transparency will bring about sus-
tained changes in the institutions of governance in poor countries, where
these institutions are weak to begin with, is more of an open question.
Evidence from the historical experience of rich and middle-income coun-
tries shows that transparency works hand-in-hand with political engage-
ment to gradually build better institutions to serve the goals of economic
development.
   Conditions in several countries that are home to the vast majority
of the poor resemble the conditions described in historical accounts
of institutional transition. However, there are several risks to worry
about, such as perverse responses of leaders to obfuscate information
and repress attempts to hold them accountable. The next and final
chapter draws lessons for various policy actors for ways in which to
manage the risks and channel these forces toward the goals of sus-
tained and equitable economic development. Policy actors can harness
transparency to nourish the growing forces of political engagement and
thereby complement other capacity-building efforts to establish effec-
tive public sector institutions. Research on the attributes of transpar-
ency that work to bring about positive change suggests a comparative
advantage of external actors—the technical capacity for generating
new data and credible information through politically independent
expert analysis.



Notes
  1. Another possible reason behind the different results in Chong et al. (2015)
      in Mexico and the results from Brazil and Puerto Rico may be the different
      institutional context in Mexico wherein individual mayors are not allowed
      to stand for reelection. Political parties field a new candidate after a mayor
      completes a term. However, the similarity of other results from Mexico
      (Larreguy, Marshall, and Snyder 2015) to the evidence from other countries
      casts doubt on the role of differences in formal electoral rules as explaining
      the different results in Chong et al. (2015).

      of a subsidized rice program in Indonesia (discussed in more detail later in
      this chapter) is one of the few pieces of evidence on how information can trig-
      ger political engagement (in the form of public protests) between elections.

                           13 percent of clinics in uncompetitive constituencies. Doctors who know
                           their local parliamentarian personally are present at an average of 0.727 of
                           three unannounced visits, while doctors without this connection are present
                           at 1.309 of the three visits. About 40 percent of inspectors and health admin-

                           are politically connected and a powerful force in mobilizing political support
                           (Beteille 2009; Chhibber and Nooruddin 2004; Kingdon and Muzammil
                           2001). Beteille (2009) further finds that politically connected teachers are

                           in education is a continuing problem. That is, the problem of leakage appears
                           to be recurring or persistent, despite efforts toward greater budget transparency.

Implications for Policy Actors


Overview
This report confronts the problem that leaders with the power to pursue
policies that are good for economic development are often constrained
from doing so because of politics. Treating such perverse political incen-
tives as fixed constraints that have to be navigated rather than relaxed
often leads to second-best solutions that do little to solve the fundamental
problems of development. This chapter recommends a shift in approach
toward tackling political constraints head-on, using transparency and
citizen engagement to try to change political incentives so that these are
aligned with development objectives.
    The bulk of development work occurs in imperfect governance environ-
ments where things need to get done and get done quickly. The majority of
practitioners may have little patience with political economy analysis, finding
it a luxury or a distraction.1 When politics impedes development, the easy
response is to treat it as a largely insurmountable constraint. Perhaps more
important than providing ideas for specific policy action, the report aims to
shift how development practitioners think about politics. Practitioners may
then be able to make greater contributions to incremental change by more
effectively using the levers available to them to overcome political impedi-
ments to good policy. This approach includes not just getting governments
to adopt good policies, but designing implementation arrangements that are
more likely to succeed because they are based on a better understanding of
political incentives and behavioral norms in the public sector.
    The World Development Report 2004, Making Services Work for Poor
People (WDR 2004) was one of the first major World Bank reports to
include an analysis of political incentives. It spawned policy innovations

                                                                                  213
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     and a rich research agenda on accountability and governance, going
                     beyond capacity building alone. Yet the bulk of the operational work on
                     governance that followed chose to bypass the so-called “long route” of
                     accountability, which goes through political institutions, in favor of a so-
                     called “short-route” by which citizens might directly solve local problems
                     of service delivery (figure 7.1). That is, at the same time as making the
                     discussion of political incentives and accountability more prominent, the
                     WDR 2004 appears to have inadvertently contributed to popularizing
                     the idea that politics can be bypassed when it is a problem.2 The idea of
                     the short route continues to be popular as one of social accountability—
                     whereby citizens can solve delivery problems in the public sector through
                     local collective action to influence frontline providers directly—in contrast
                     to political accountability—whereby citizens demand accountability from
                     political leaders and public officials who lead government agencies.

    The evidence in this report shows that effective citizen participation
in the short route depends upon citizens’ political incentives to act and
providers’ incentives to respond. Previous reports have shown that for
community participation to be effective, institutions must be specifically
designed to facilitate it, by giving communities “teeth” to hold providers
accountable (Grandvoinnet, Aslam, and Raha 2015; Mansuri and Rao
2013). Whether leaders select institutional arrangements that give com-
munities this power depends upon their political incentives.
    This report is about the fundamental importance of the “voice” or
“politics” leg of the WDR 2004 triangle of accountability relations.
Figure 7.1 depicts how this report builds on the WDR 2004. This report
uses the advances in research since then to show how political engage-
ment shapes each of the following three principal-agent relationships of
government: (i) between citizens as the principals of political leaders;
(ii) between political leaders as the principals of public officials who
lead government agencies; and (iii) between public officials who man-
age frontline public providers. Non-political citizen engagement—to
monitor frontline providers and public officials and provide feedback on
their performance—can be used by leaders to enlist the help of citizens
to address their principal-agent problems within government agencies.3
Unhealthy political engagement can “invert” these relationships leading
to perverse accountability, such as when political leaders buy votes and
hold citizens accountable for providing political support in exchange for
targeted benefits.4
    Citizens’ political engagement shapes the incentives and characteristics
of leaders who, in turn, determine the “compact” with public officials and
providers and whether to provide citizens with any effective institutional
arrangements for “client power” to exert direct pressure on providers. How
citizens behave in the political realm is intertwined with the beliefs and
behavioral norms that shape the functioning of the compact and client
power in the public sector. For example, if political norms allow vote buy-
ing and patronage to flourish in elections, those same norms can impede
effective organization outside of elections to hold teachers accountable in
public schools. Leaders who can get away with poor service delivery during
their term in office by purchasing votes at election time also tend to provide
jobs to teachers as political patronage and not hold them accountable for
teaching. This insight into the inseparable links between political behav-
ior at election time and behavior in the public sector in between elections
has implications for the design of governance arrangements for managing

                                                                                               215
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     a range of nonelected public sector officials—teachers, doctors, adminis-
                     trators, and so on—who perform in the shadow of flawed elections that
                     generate weak political incentives and perverse behavioral norms.
                         It is also important to acknowledge examples of committed providers
                     and galvanized communities that maintain high-quality public schools
                     and health centers even within contexts of weak institutions and rent-
                     seeking political leaders. The study by Brixi, Lust, and Woolcock (2015)
                     is replete with shining examples of successful local delivery in a region of
                     the world where political engagement by citizens is restricted and where
                     elite capture of state institutions has been blamed for poor economic per-
                     formance and mismanagement by public bureaucracies.
                         The diversity of successful experiences within and between countries
                     tempts practitioners to find ways to bypass politics rather than improve it.
                     At the macro level, this translates into a search for benevolent elite institu-
                     tions such as technocratic bureaucracies that are insulated from political
                     pressures. At the micro level, it translates into a search for local collective
                     action between citizens and public providers, working together to improve
                     outcomes in their communities. This approach runs into the problem of
                     replicating successful experiences in places where local collective action
                     and benevolent elites have not emerged naturally. Even successful commu-
                     nities can grapple with problems of sustaining their success in the face of
                     poverty, lack of resources, and demoralization if the systems around them
                     continue to be weak and captured. Furthermore, relying on communities
                     to help themselves can let the corrupt leaders of government get away with
                     capturing and wasting larger public resources, providing little to the com-
                     munities who need services the most.
                         Efforts toward enhancing social accountability and citizen participa-
                     tion that provide powers to citizens to manage public funds (such as in
                     community-driven development projects) may also have an impact on the
                     principal-agent relationships in the larger public systems by shaping how
                     citizens view the state and how they act toward powerful leaders. However,
                     research reports few indications that public sector governance is changed
                     by programs designed to induce participation in communities, even when
                     participation improves service delivery and development outcomes (Casey
                     et al. 2012; Mansuri and Rao 2013). Yet this may be an area in which
                     evidence gathering is methodologically constrained. Qualitative studies
                     suggest that participatory programs might contribute to strengthening
                     citizen capacity for collective action for the public good (Ananthpur et al.
                     2014; Grandvoinnet et al. 2014).

    The evidence uncovered in this report points to existing forms of
political engagement by citizens that can be supported with transpar-
ency instruments, particularly mass media. The recommendations in this
report are therefore complementary to efforts that seek to promote social
accountability. The two approaches—social accountability and political
accountability—share the goal of promoting norms of cooperative behav-
ior in society to solve collective action problems for the greater public good.
    Political engagement is a blunt accountability instrument. Various other
institutions of checks and balances and internal accountability within
government are needed to hold public officials accountable in between
elections and across multiple dimensions of performance. The conundrum
is how to foster such institutions in environments in which leaders are able
to gain and remain in power by keeping institutions weak. Research sug-
gests that transparency can work together with political engagement to
improve political incentives and behavioral norms such that citizens and
leaders gradually build those larger institutions that are crucial for good
governance.
    The typology of political incentives and behavior presented in the
Overview is useful here to distill messages from the research (table 7.1).
The typology can be used to craft a variety of policy options using available
entry points and situational analyses in specific country and institutional
contexts. When facing government failures and seeking to solve them, the
types of questions that policy actors might ask are summarized in the top
panel of table 7.1. The main answers to these questions—of what to do
when politics impedes development—that the report offers as options for
policy actors to consider are in the bottom panel of table 7.1. These policy
options all involve strengthening transparency and citizen engagement to
solve government failures.
    The next section distills lessons for policies to strengthen transparency.
These lessons take existing political institutions as given, and involve lever-
aging the instruments of transparency to improve the quality of political
engagement. The following section distills lessons for policies to strengthen
citizen engagement. It shows how citizen engagement policies can be
designed to be more effective when they explicitly take citizens’ and lead-
ers’ political behavior into account. In pursuing the engagement of citizens
to hold local officials accountable, higher-tier policy makers may consider
local elections to be the mechanism through which citizens are empowered
to do so. Without such power of selecting and sanctioning local leaders,
citizens are unlikely to have the capacity to exact accountability.

                                     feasible for a range of diverse policy actors—reform leaders within gov-

are most needed to address political impediments to development. For
example, research findings emphasize the importance of relevance, cred-
ibility, and impartiality of information about the performance of leaders
and their policy actions. External agents might offer these attributes when
they have technical capacity to generate meaningful information from
large data and when they are regarded as politically independent and
non-partisan.



Policies to strengthen transparency
The research in this report suggests that transparency has far-reaching
impacts on institutions and implementation of policies across sectors.
Transparency can help to build effective homegrown institutions that are
capable of pursuing technically sound policies, through its interaction
with forces of political engagement. Transparency can enable coordination
among citizens in actions that they are already taking (voting, competing in
elections, engaging politically) in ways that improve the selection of leaders
and strengthen behavioral norms in the public sector. Mass media’s role as
a force for persuasion and as a coordinating device for solving collective
action problems is likely to be important beyond information content alone.
    Desirable attributes of transparency policies are described below, per-
taining to the nature of data, evidence, and the characteristics of media
markets that can be supported, and to the tailoring of this information
and its communication to existing institutions of political engagement.
Although the research conclusively shows that political engagement is
responsive to transparency, it also shows that final impact on governance
and development outcomes vary greatly within any institutional context
and depend on the specific details of transparency. Powerful leaders and
elites can also undo positive effects of transparency on citizens’ political
action. This suggests that experimentation and iterative adaptation are
needed to exploit the potential of transparency (Andrews, Pritchett, and
Woolcock 2013).


Information about leaders’ performance and the consequences
of their actions
Transparency is most effective when it supports the generation of specific,
reliable, and impartial evidence on the performance of leaders tasked

                                                                                               219

                     with the delivery of public policies. The information provided through
                     transparency must be specific about both policy actions and the resulting
                     outcomes so that citizens can use this information to select and sanction
                     leaders. For example, information only on budget allocations is of limited
                     use without information on how these allocations were spent, what that
                     spending accomplished, and what that means about the performance of
                     leaders. In the absence of information about performance that is clearly
                     attributable to leaders, there is more scope for leaders to deflect scrutiny
                     away from themselves and blame other factors outside their control for
                     poor outcomes.
                        Research on how voters and leaders respond to the availability of specific
                     information about performance rather than to information about policy
                     actions alone supports this recommendation.5 For example, regularized
                     disclosure of audit reports on the financial management performance of
                     elected governments has been shown to improve both voting behavior and
                     leaders’ responsiveness, resulting in the removal of corrupt leaders from
                     office and a reduction in corruption among incumbents (Bobonis, Cámara
                     Fuertes, and Schwabe forthcoming; Ferraz and Finan 2008).
                        Information on budget allocations without corresponding informa-
                     tion on spending performance in providing public goods also runs the
                     risk of fueling political incentives to pander to inefficient demands from
                     citizens without considering the trade-offs between different allocations.
                     Performance information about public goods is more likely to feed con-
                     structive public debate about how to allocate scarce resources. The data
                     revolution (WDR 2016, 244) can be leveraged to provide more specific
                     information about performance. Different government ministries and
                     practices related to service delivery, such as health, education, agriculture,
                     infrastructure, business regulation, and so on, can contribute to such perfor-
                     mance measurement. Data from across sectors can be combined to assess the
                     performance of leaders and of public policies in making appropriate inter-
                     sectoral trade-offs in allocating scarce resources for public interest goals.
                        The research evidence also supports the importance of the credibility of
                     the sources of data about and analysis of government performance.6 This
                     need for credibility has implications for creating statistical agencies that
                     are independent of political control and for leveraging data from any exist-
                     ing government agencies that have a reputation for independence, such as
                     central banks and audit departments. Apart from any existing, credibly
                     independent institutions within countries, there is also a particular role
                     for external development partners and civil society organizations that are

                     public goods against allegations of ideological and partisan bias. Investments
                     in understanding how current public policies and spending programs are
                     performing can bring down to earth the grand debates between the left and

                     public sector may be uniquely positioned to address. Generating information
                     that can attribute performance to leaders is needed to help citizens select and

                     est programming that provides impartial information to cultivate citizens’
                     political engagement. Even when media are independent from state control
                     and markets are competitive, citizens can choose to access primarily enter-
                     taining programs that do not sufficiently inform them about public interest
                     issues. Sponsorship of appealing programs, or “infotainment,” to commu-

                     has the potential to persuade citizens to shift political beliefs in ways that
                     strengthen demand for good leaders and good policies. This recommenda-
                     tion is supported by a body of research on characteristics of political engage-
                     ment and the role of media that is discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6.
                        By influencing political engagement, media markets have been shown
                     to matter significantly for governance.8 Market forces and the diffusion
                     of technology are resulting in the proliferation of different media outlets,

                     contributing to plurality and independence of media. The strengthening
                     of these markets, including by increasing the access of media outlets and

instrument. Media markets can be assessed on the basis of whether they
provide sufficient coverage of public interest programming and effective
access by citizens to such programming. This means targeting policies to
the type of media and the type of programming to which citizens actually
pay attention.
   Following are some key issues to contend with:

•	 Access: Access to media by all citizens in all regions is often a major chal-
   lenge. Access can be an infrastructure challenge, for instance, where
   technology-dependent media cannot reach remote regions. It can also
   be a question of media content and pluralism, where the interests, needs,
   and specific issues of certain sections of a national community are not
   served by the media. This last issue is often one of the justifications for
   community broadcasting in remote rural areas. Leading global technol-
   ogy companies are experimenting with ways of providing Internet access
   in remote regions. Wu (2010) shows how information technologies
   have historically had a democratizing effect—by being cheap and easily
   accessible—but have usually ended up being dominated by monopolies.
   ­

•	 Media ownership and pluralism: The question of who owns the media is
   a challenging one everywhere because of the strong link between media
   and power. If the government or a few firms control the preponderance
   of the media, the possibility of transparency to nourish political engage-
   ment becomes severely curtailed. One major issue is market censorship
   or the pressures on media independence emanating from powerful forces
   in society. These pressures take many forms, including bribery; the use
   of advertising to control media content; unreasonably harsh defamation
   and sedition laws; harassment, even murder, of journalists; and the gen-
   eral absence of the rule of law.

•	 Broadcast regulation under digital convergence designed to create an
   informed citizenry: Most countries have agreed to switch from analog
   to digital TV in 2015, while others will wait a few years more. The
   switch should, under many circumstances, lead to greater pluralism on
   the airwaves because digital technology makes more channels possible.
   However, the switch can also be used as an opportunity for governments
   to dominate the airwaves.
      The trend toward technological convergence leads to regulatory pow-
   ers being combined over both telecommunications and broadcasting.
   These regulators often have the difficult challenge of attempting to make

                                                                                                223

                        sure that the emerging system contains enough news and current affairs
                        programming to meet the citizenship needs of consumers of media
                        fare. In addition, these regulators themselves need to be protected from
                        regulatory capture.

                     •	 Public service and public interest content in the media: Plural and inde-
                        pendent media systems do not automatically generate good public
                        interest or public service content. The media do not always prioritize
                        the provision of information needed to educate citizens on the great
                        issues of the day or encourage debate and discussion and the emergence
                        of informed public opinion. The preponderance of donor interventions
                        in media markets focus on this challenge. Policy responses include the
                        promotion of public service broadcasting on the BBC model; training
                        of journalists on specific issues, including mastery of data; the fund-
                        ing of popular entertainment-education programs around the world;
                        and so on.
                     Untargeted, general availability of greater information in the public
                     domain, without support to media markets to communicate that informa-
                     tion, is unlikely to get information to citizens in a form that enhances their
                     capacity to hold leaders accountable for delivery of public goods.9 Citizens
                     can ignore information, especially in environments in which there is a lot
                     of it, without persuasive and appealing media programming that brings
                     it to their attention. Even when media are independent and competitive,
                     citizens might choose to access only entertaining programming that does
                     not inform them about public interest issues.
                         Media markets can be supported not only to ensure plurality and
                     independence from state capture, but also to increase citizens’ access
                     to public interest information that competitive markets might not
                     deliver without such support (Keefer and Khemani 2014; Prat and
                     Strömberg 2011; Strömberg 2015). Sponsorship of appealing programs,
                     or infotainment, that persuade citizens to shift their beliefs about
                     public policies on the basis of technical evidence can potentially serve
                     as a complement to competitive media markets. The design of such
                     programming and its targeting through outlets that citizens access
                     and find persuasive, requires investments in rigorous impact evalu-
                     ation similar to that undertaken for other policy interventions. The
                     research reviewed in this report shows that communication of scien-
                     tific evidence to shift the beliefs of citizens also requires investment in
                     scientific investigation.

   The credibility of the sponsors of public interest programming is criti-
cal for such policy interventions to have the intended impact. Technical
government agencies—such as audit departments or research depart-
ments within sector ministries—can be the source for such programming
when they can back up the messages with rigorous data and analysis.
International research organizations and development partners often work
with government ministries to sponsor such programs. For example, the
international Roll Back Malaria program sponsors community radio sta-
tions’ broadcasts of information in Africa about the value of public health
policies. There is evidence that such programming affects citizens’ politi-
cal attitudes, shifting them away from patronage politics toward increased
demands for health and education services (Keefer and Khemani 2014).


Relevance and timeliness of information to the political process
Policies can encourage the provision of information and the access to
media to be more relevant and timely to the political process. A key
dimension of relevance is jurisdictional: information on the performance
of public policies needs to be targeted to the jurisdictions in which citizens
select leaders. Information on public goods provision at the local level is
more relevant to voters’ decisions in local elections than is information at
the national level. Chapter 2 has reported trends of increasing political
engagement across and within countries through the spread of electoral
institutions at multiple levels of government. It also reports evidence con-
sistent with voting being regarded by citizens as a relatively low-cost action
to influence governance. Chapter 6 reports evidence that the act of voting,
compared with other forms of citizen engagement, is particularly sensitive
to information. These findings suggest that the data and media policies
described above can be tailored to the multiple levels of government where
citizens engage through elections. Performance assessments of both cur-
rent incumbents and challengers in these multiple jurisdictions can enable
citizens to take more informed actions in selecting leaders.
    Regular compilation and generation of such information, spanning
times when different political parties or leaders are in office, is not only
a nonpartisan approach but can also avoid a potential incumbency bias
in transparency policies. Such information could enable citizens to assess
the relative potential of political contenders, not just incumbents, to
prevent an incumbency bias. If information only enables assessment of
the incumbent, citizens could use it to punish incumbents despite their

                                                                                               225

                     best efforts under overly optimistic expectations of better performance
                     from alternative candidates. This effect could reduce the incentives of all
                     incoming leaders to exert greater effort—“why bother if people are not
                     going to reward you for trying?” Another way of providing information
                     about contenders, especially those who may not have previously held office,
                     is through economic analysis of their proposed policy promises. Such an
                     intervention was evaluated (Fujiwara and Wantchekon 2013) and found
                     to reduce unhealthy forms of clientelist politics. Economic analysis of
                     the performance of public policies at the level of disaggregated political
                     jurisdictions can enable citizens to select leaders on the basis of technical
                     evidence on performance. Such economic analysis is already being under-
                     taken by multilateral development agencies. The recommendation here is
                     to shape that analysis to the level of existing geographic and administrative
                     units at which citizens are politically engaged.
                         Data and media policies can be combined to lower barriers to entry
                     for contenders to compete on platforms of improving public policies and
                     government performance. For example, policies that allow contenders
                     access to mass media to debate the merits of public policies can improve
                     the quality of political engagement (Fujiwara and Wantchekon 2013).
                     Regulation that allows local media, such as radio or cellphone-based
                     services, to thrive can enable communication between leaders and
                     citizens and among citizens about public policy performance in spe-
                     cific jurisdictions. This intersection of media and political markets has
                     been shown to be significant in explaining better governance outcomes
                     (Campante and Do 2014; Campante and Hojman 2013; Snyder and
                     Strömberg 2010).
                         Timeliness matters as well: the availability of performance assessments
                     of incumbents and challengers is most relevant at the time of elections.
                     Research has shown that information is more likely to have an impact
                     when there is competition from political opponents and when the informa-
                     tion is available at election time.10
                         The potential impact of more information at the time of elections
                     extends beyond election season by shaping what leaders choose to do dur-
                     ing their terms in office and the legitimacy of leaders to manage complex
                     public bureaucracies. Legitimacy of leaders is at the frontier of theoretical
                     developments that attempt to provide an understanding of how to improve
                     the performance of public bureaucracies. Leaders that emerge from healthy
                     political competition on the basis of good public performance could have
                     greater legitimacy to effectively manage public bureaucracies.

   This approach to the importance of leaders is different from having the
“right people” as leaders, such as those who are regarded as reform cham-
pions and who have the personal will or personal commitment to reforms.
Reform champions can lose public office if they try to implement reforms
without political support for doing so. Furthermore, the “wrong people,”
such as those with lower personal integrity, can try to masquerade as the
“right people” by pandering to citizens’ ideological beliefs or by opportu-
nistically exploiting divisions among citizens, without building common
ground for public goods. Strengthening incentives for both the “right” and
the “wrong” people is key by persuading citizens to be attentive to lead-
ers’ performance in delivering public goods. At the same time, research
suggests that improving the selection of better-quality leaders has conse-
quences for economic development. That is, transparency is most likely to
solve government failures when it improves both incentives and the selec-
tion of high-quality leaders. The attributes of transparency discussed here
are geared toward accomplishing these goals.
   Once again, credibility of information sources about incumbents and
challengers is important. Government agencies, even those that are sup-
posed to be independent of political control, are likely to be subject to
conflicts of interest in providing objective assessments of the performance
of political opponents. Other external policy actors, such as civil society
organizations, the media, and international development partners, are
also likely to be constrained by perceptions of their ideological biases.
Agencies can be more effective in implementing the transparency policy
strategies recommended here if they establish greater credibility for being
nonpartisan, nonideological, and politically independent, by investing in
the technical quality of the information they produce.

parency policies to enable political markets to function better, box 7.2

Sensitivity to existing political institutions
What is different about the recommendation here is the importance of
communicating to citizens and in ways that effectively shift citizens’ beliefs
about public policies on the basis of technical evidence. The traditional
policy approach has treated leaders as the only primary audience of expert
analysis, and has treated communication to citizens as a matter not requir-
ing scientific investigation. Communicating information to influence

beliefs and political behavioral norms requires an understanding of the
institutions within and through which citizens form these beliefs. This
report has offered a better understanding of how political engagement, and
the leaders selected through it, shapes beliefs and behavior in the public
sector. Transparency can be targeted at these political institutions to try
to improve beliefs and behavior toward solving shared problems of public
goods for economic development.
   Applying these policy lessons for transparency depends on the charac-
teristics of existing government jurisdictions: which tasks are assigned to
which leaders, and who are the citizens who select and sanction them. If
government jurisdictions have clearly assigned responsibilities for public
goods, then it is easier to generate performance data that can be attributed
to the leaders of those jurisdictions and to communicate that information
to enable citizens to hold those leaders accountable for public goods. Most
places will have a complex set of political and bureaucratic institutions
that share responsibilities for the provision of public goods. Higher-
order transparency, such as civic education about the roles of different
government jurisdictions and officials, can play a role in strengthening
governance.
   However, when citizens are not empowered to select and sanction
leaders of government jurisdictions, then citizens are unlikely to have the
capacity to use information to exact accountability. In environments that
restrict or repress political engagement, both the scope for implementing
these recommendations and expectations of impact will be more limited.



Policies to strengthen citizen engagement
The evidence in the report of how politics shapes the incentives and norms
of public providers and of citizens can be used by policy actors when
approaching governance reforms to engage citizens to improve outcomes.


Policies to strengthen non-political forms of citizen engagement
Policies have sought to engage citizens to solve local service delivery prob-
lems in non-political ways, such as by providing beneficiary feedback,
monitoring local officials, directly managing public funds, and contrib-
uting to the maintenance of local public goods. These policies can be
designed to be more effective based on a better understanding of citizens’

                     and leaders’ political behavior. Their success depends on the political char-
                     acteristics of the environment in which services are delivered.
                         When higher-tier policy makers with oversight powers over local public
                     officials seek to hold these officials more accountable by enlisting the help
                     of citizens in monitoring them, they would need to design policy initiatives
                     to assure citizens that their feedback would be taken seriously and that
                     citizens would be protected from retaliation. For example, if beneficiary
                     feedback is solicited through local elites who are the ones capturing pub-
                     lic resources, then citizens are unlikely to respond by providing reliable
                     feedback to reduce local capture. Olken (2007) shows the impact of such
                     attention to design, finding that anonymous comment forms distributed
                     independently of village government leaders in Indonesia made a signifi-
                     cant difference. Another example from Indonesia shows that when ben-
                     eficiaries are informed with the purpose of strengthening their bargaining
                     power vis-à-vis local elites, such as when they are provided with official
                     letters from higher-tier authorities about their entitlement to subsidized
                     rice, then they are more likely to demand their entitlements and complain
                     about poor performance (Banerjee et al. 2015).
                         The research on these examples from Indonesia further shows that the
                     success of policy initiatives depends on the incentives of higher-level leaders
                     to get the design right and send credible signals that complaints about local
                     officials will be taken seriously (Banerjee et al. 2015). This insight is con-
                     sistent with the conclusions of Mansuri and Rao (2013) in their review of
                     programs for local citizen engagement: success depends on effective design
                     and local institutions of accountability that are established by higher-tier
                     leaders. In the absence of healthy political engagement, both higher-tier
                     and local leaders are unlikely to have the incentives or the credibility to
                     engage citizens effectively to solve delivery problems. Non-political citizen
                     engagement to solve last-mile delivery problems is embedded within politi-
                     cal engagement, which shapes the incentives of leaders.
                         The effectiveness of other forms of non-political citizen engagement,
                     such as getting citizens to contribute their time, labor, effort, and money
                     to produce local public goods, also depends on political incentives and
                     behavior. Prior reports have documented the risk of elite capture of public
                     resources that are devolved to the local level (Mansuri and Rao 2013).
                     Recent research suggests that in addition to the risk of capturing the ben-
                     efits of resources coming from higher levels, elites may also capture local
                     civil society (Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson 2014; Anderson, Francois,
                     and Kotwal 2015). This situation can result in citizens providing public

services for themselves while the leaders do little to fulfill their responsibili-
ties and yet maintain their grip on power.
   The design issues are likely to be technically detailed and to vary
depending upon the type of service that is being delivered. For example,
the type of citizen engagement that is likely to reduce corruption in local
roads construction or distribution of private entitlements may be very
different from what is needed in sectors like health and education. While
sector-specific technical design issues are outside the scope of the report,
the insights above may help to strengthen citizen engagement policies.


Policies to strengthen local political engagement within countries
of different national political systems
Growing devolution of public resources in developing countries for local
implementation of public programs has to deal with the lack of capacity
for monitoring and enforcement at both local and national levels (Mansuri
and Rao 2013). The exigencies of development have led to disbursement of
public spending across millions of villages where poor people live but where
there are few formal enforcement institutions. In one such environment
in Indonesia, Sacks, Ensminger, and Clark (2014) document high rates of
corruption among local officials. Widespread beliefs of and actual experi-
ence with corruption can contribute to a culture of poor performance in
the public sector, stemming not from values or norms but rather from
rational beliefs about how others are behaving and about the probability
of detection and punishment in environments with scarce resources to
combat corruption.
   Innovative technologies for monitoring and managing funds, so that
opportunities for graft are reduced and corruption is easier to detect,
are being explored to address this problem (for example, Muralidharan,
Niehaus, and Sukhtankar 2014; Sacks, Ensminger, and Clark 2014; World
Bank 2016). Locally targeted transparency for healthy political engage-
ment at the local level can complement innovative technological solutions
and may together contribute to shifting the political beliefs that support a
culture of poor performance in the public sector. Pursuit of this direction
requires collaboration between policy actors and researchers to identify
what specifically works, or does not work, in different contexts.
   Higher-tier leaders who are pursuing citizen engagement to hold local
officials accountable may find themselves in a position of considering local
elections as the mechanism through which citizens are empowered to do

                                                                                                   231
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     so. The research findings of the impact of local political engagement on
                     local accountability and the responsiveness of political engagement to
                     transparency, suggest that policy makers across different national politi-
                     cal systems can craft policies for local political engagement suited to their
                     contexts and make it healthy through transparency. Research shows how
                     local audit disclosure interacts with local electoral competition to reduce
                     corruption (Bobonis et al. Forthcoming; Ferraz and Finan 2011).
                        A number of social accountability initiatives that seek to work outside
                     the political realm rely on catalyzing group action by citizens. They use
                     transparency campaigns to trigger action by citizen committees charged
                     with monitoring public schools, health clinics, or other public spending
                     programs. However, there is little evidence that transparency alone encour-
                     ages group action through such committees. Survey evidence that these
                     committees are typically inactive suggests that organized group action of
                     this type can be costly for citizens (reviewed in chapter 6). Theory sug-
                     gests that this is because groups rarely organize to pursue broadly shared
                     public goods. In contrast, individual actions of political engagement, such
                     as voting, respond to transparency. More amorphous group-based politi-
                     cal engagement, such as protests, are also facilitated by transparency and
                     social media in particular. In local political markets, higher-tier authorities
                     can use transparency to enable citizens to hold local leaders accountable
                     by coordinating their individual actions as people who vote on the basis
                     of performance.



                     Who will take up these recommendations?
                     This report confronts a fundamental challenge: the political incentives of
                     those who have the power to implement technically sound policies may
                     not be aligned with development objectives. An integral part of the policy
                     recommendations of this report is highlighting how the relative compara-
                     tive advantages, incentives, and goals of different policy actors matter in
                     implementing these recommendations.

concomitantly weak incentives, leaders might nevertheless find it in their
self-interest to use the lessons of this report. They might feel the need to
respond to growing forces of citizen political engagement and disaffection
with government performance, or to find ways to constructively channel
these forces. Using transparency and political engagement along the lines
recommended in this report can help governments build legitimacy in the
eyes of citizens. In contrast, policy efforts that focus exclusively on direct
citizen engagement to bypass governance problems, so that citizens step
in to help themselves where the government fails, can leave these problems
intact.
   Furthermore, governments are not monolithic entities but exhibit sub-
stantial differences among leaders across multiple agencies and jurisdic-
tions. Reform leaders within government who are struggling to overcome
political constraints may be able to use instruments of transparency that
are at their disposal and that are more tractable compared with other types
of policies. Other policies may be outside their control—depending on
the actions of more powerful colleagues—or encumbered by prevailing
political beliefs among citizens. Transparency may be more easily pursued
by these reform leaders than policy reforms that could cause them to lose
office should they try to implement them. For example, it may be too
politically costly to reform electricity subsidies, but leaders may neverthe-
less facilitate and support the types of transparency measures outlined here
on the costs and benefits of these policies and target the information to the
jurisdictions where political engagement occurs. This process can improve
the selection of local leaders who build support for reforms, by making the
case for reforms to citizens rather than to fan protests and exploit the issue
for political gain.
   Technical institutions within countries often function as islands of
good governance in environments in which the executive and legislative
branches of government might be plagued by perverse political incentives.
For example, supreme audit institutions and supreme courts are promi-
nent in many examples for curbing political transgressions and enabling
citizens and civil society to demand accountability. The historical trajec-
tory of when and how developing countries were born as nation-states
may explain the simultaneous emergence of political incentives that were
inimical to the adoption of good public policies in some countries (because
the conditions were ripe for clientelist politics)11 but nevertheless allowed
certain technical institutions to flourish, build a reputation over time, and
attract technically competent and public-spirited leaders to serve on them.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     The research covered in this report suggests that such technically reputed
                     institutions, where they exist, can be systematically leveraged to improve
                     political incentives and political behaviors by bringing credible informa-
                     tion to the forefront.
                        The existence of multiple layers of government within a country can
                     provide an opportunity to implement some recommendations of the
                     report. Even if there is no space for political engagement by citizens at
                     the national level and if policy makers are wary of greater transparency
                     at that level, they may want to enlist the help of citizens to promote local
                     accountability to improve service delivery. Local institutions of political
                     engagement, supported by local-level information and communication,
                     can enable citizens to hold local leaders accountable. Furthermore, one way
                     for national leaders to constructively channel demands from citizens for
                     political engagement may be by applying the lessons of this report at the
                     local level. These two objectives have significant complementarities. The
                     available research highlights the importance of local electoral institutions
                     in enabling local communities to hold officials accountable, with corre-
                     spondingly little evidence that transparency can galvanize other forms of
                     local participation to improve accountability.12


                     Civil society organizations
                     Civil society organizations might be hesitant to address the political
                     impediments to achieving development goals because doing so might
                     affect their ability to function in a country and receive support from
                     external funders. The bulk of their effort therefore may go toward social
                     accountability and citizen participation efforts so that citizens can directly
                     solve local problems. However, if these efforts bypass the problems of
                     malfeasance and mismanagement in government, the public sector would
                     continue to fail in using its powers and resources to achieve the goals of
                     development.
                        Although international donors and development partners have been
                     providing significant financial support to growing numbers of civil soci-
                     ety organizations, there is little evidence on and understanding of the
                     impact of these organizations in contexts in which elections are marred by
                     unhealthy practices such as vote buying, allowing power to be sustained
                     without delivering public goods. Although bypassing elections and provid-
                     ing funding to civil society organizations may be a convenient and feasible
                     way for international organizations to support citizens’ roles in improving

234
                                                                      IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY ACTORS



governance, there is little understanding and evidence on how citizens
can play these roles in the shadow of flawed electoral institutions without
altering or interacting with those institutions.
    Whether civil society action has an impact depends upon the institu-
tional environment. It is more likely to work in places with strong internal
checks and balances and the rule of law, but less likely to work in weak
institutional contexts in which the law can be bent at the will of power-
ful leaders. In places with strong institutions and the rule of law, internal
checks and balances within government are of primary importance in
checking malfeasance. Civil society organizations may use transparency
regimes to serve as watchdogs to complement formal government institu-
tions, and sniff out the stray transgressions that formal institutions might
miss. Civil society organizations would be effective in this role because
once they bring the transgressions to light, the formal checks and balances
and laws would kick in. Political engagement in such cases would support
the functioning of internal checks and balances by making corruption
prohibitively costly—leaders would face a high likelihood of losing office
if they tried to interfere and protect the perpetrators.
    However, in institutional contexts such as those in large parts of the
world where a majority of poor people live, leaders of and agents within
government bureaucracies might not fear public pressure, even when it is
applied. The political processes, such as elections, that get them to their
positions of power are tolerant of corruption, revolving as they do around
the use of vote buying, violence, and ethnic favoritism.
    If the political incentives that support corruption are unchanged, even a
successful example of diminished corruption might mask the displacement
of corruption to another time and place, when it is out of the limelight.
Relying on civil society organizations to prevent such displacement and
shine a light everywhere, across vast numbers of complex bureaucratic trans-
actions, is asking for them to take on the burden of internal checks and bal-
ances that should emanate from within government. This process comes full
circle to beg the question of how civil society organizations will provide these
institutions and overcome the problems that plague the formal institutions
in the first place, without some form of political engagement. Civil society
may need to rely on healthy political engagement that would give leaders the
incentives to fear and respond to public protests against corruption.
    Because of the lack of research evidence on how civil society organi-
zations form, and with what incentives,13 the report is not able to make
any specific policy recommendations in the area of generalized support

                                                                                                 235
MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                     to civil society organizations. Instead, it highlights specific activities that
                     civil society organizations could undertake to improve governance, such
                     as generating the data or providing the persuasive media programming
                     that nurtures political engagement by individual citizens. As noted in the
                     recommendations above, to be effective, these organizations would need
                     to build credibility on the basis of political and ideological independence,
                     relying on technical capacity to use data-based evidence.


                     International development partners
                     External agents, such as international development partners, can play an
                     important role in overcoming political impediments to development when
                     their incentives are aligned with development goals. Yet external agents are
                     constrained by their limited powers to bring about change from the outside.
                     International development partners, such as bilateral agencies that directly
                     engage in supporting political institutions, sometimes seek to advocate for
                     democracy and for elections as its key institution. The report shows that
                     elections alone will not solve governance problems—platforms of competi-
                     tion, whether on the basis of public good programs or not, or the charac-
                     teristics of political engagement, matter. Although this is not likely to be
                     news, the report serves these organizations by bringing current research to
                     bear upon their endeavors and highlighting the design issues that surround
                     the use of transparency to improve political engagement to serve the goals
                     of economic development. For partners such as the World Bank that are
                     prohibited from engaging in political affairs, the research covered in this
                     report provides evidence that can support non-partisan and non-ideological
                     transparency initiatives to improve economic outcomes (box 7.3).
                        The recommendations of the report are particularly relevant to opera-
                     tions and technical policy dialogue on decentralization to locally elected
                     governments and community-based groups. Sovereign national govern-
                     ments invite international experts, including those at the World Bank,
                     to give technical policy advice on the design of these subnational, local
                     institutions of governance. Research on citizens’ political behavior, as vot-
                     ers and contenders for leadership positions at local levels, has implications
                     for this advice. Targeting information to improve local political behavior
                     in elections can strengthen local institutions so that they can effectively
                     deliver public policies for development.
                        Some of the findings of the report may be particularly applicable at
                     the local level in contexts in which the legitimacy of national political

                                       leaders may be eroded or unsustainable. For example, public financial
                                       management reforms advocated by national reform leaders may not be
                                       implemented in practice by local leaders. Complementing such reforms

                                       institutions may make it more likely that local leaders have the incentives
                                       and motivation to comply with the reforms.

                                       ally lives in an information-rich environment that needs to be understood.

delivery, which national leaders across the spectrum may want to improve,
but they are also at the “first mile” at which citizens determine the platforms
on which leaders are selected and sanctioned. These platforms, whether
they are the healthy ones of good public performance or the unhealthy
ones of vote buying and ethnic favoritism, for example, not only determine
the incentives and quality of selected local leaders but can also shape the
behavioral norms in the public sector as a whole. This first mile can matter
for building legitimacy and capacity of state institutions in fragile contexts.
It can matter for building capable and accountable local governments in
rapidly urbanizing environments that plan well for urban development and
mobilize the domestic resources needed for sustainable development. The
local level can matter for improving political attitudes and behavior of citi-
zens in rich country contexts as well, where the national stage appears to be
hopelessly mired by political polarization among citizens. Targeting trans-
parency to improve the functioning of local institutions of political engage-
ment along the lines recommended in this report can therefore address some
of the growing areas of economic concern throughout the world.


Technocratic reforms alone are not enough
Building effective state capacity for development requires changes in politi-
cal behavior—investments in formal capacity and innovative technologies
are not enough. Transparency can be targeted to bring about the needed
changes in political behavior. International development partners’ data
and analytical capacity yields rich information about the performance of
public policies and of governments. This data and evidence can be shaped
to be more timely and relevant to the processes through which citizens
hold leaders accountable.
   For example, country diagnostics could invest more in generating
data and evidence at disaggregated levels on what different government
jurisdictions deliver in implementing public policies. This process entails
an expansion of the analysis that focuses on using household surveys to
describe characteristics of poverty as the main “diagnostic” to inform
country strategies. It involves investing in more data to examine the
performance of existing public policies and public spending programs at
disaggregated jurisdictions within a country. That is, country diagnostic
products could not only analyze countries’ poverty profiles and describe
the characteristics of the poor and of drivers of growth, but could also
invest similarly in hard data and empirical evidence to assess what the

                     government has been doing, with international support, through the policy
                     levers and spending programs at its disposal, and shape that data to the
                     level of existing geographic and administrative units at which citizens are
                     politically engaged.
                         If governance problems are identified, the diagnostic would serve the
                     purpose of providing a better understanding of these problems by extend-
                     ing to examine existing institutions of political engagement in the country
                     and assessing the media environment. The diagnostic would answer the
                     following questions: Given existing institutions or jurisdictions of political
                     engagement in the country, what information on public goods perfor-
                     mance of those jurisdictions is available? What new data are needed? What
                     is the state of media markets—what forms of communication do citizens
                     use for public debate?
                         This recommendation follows from the research evidence provided
                     in the report that moving out of a situation of systemic and persistent
                     governance problems is likely to require the disciplining effects of politi-
                     cal engagement and the use of transparency policies to make engagement
                     healthy. This approach would be a departure from practices that might
                     have focused exclusively on high-level policy dialogue to persuade leaders
                     to adopt changes, with no role for political engagement by citizens.
                         Analysis of media markets can go beyond supporting a particular donor
                     project. Once the sector analysis is complete, different partners can pick up
                     aspects of the work that their circumstances make them particularly suited to
                     address. Bilateral donors are freer to engage more directly with these issues.
                     Multilateral donors can support research and provide technical evidence on
                     the consequences of different characteristics of media markets for economic
                     development. In any event, the heavy lifting in securing media sector reform
                     in any particular context is the work of coalitions of local ­players: the exist-
                     ing media, civil society organizations, reformers in government and the
                     legislature, and so on. The task of international actors is to support and
                     empower those whose country it is. Despite the oft-repeated objection that
                     intervening in the media sector is too political, the “Guidance Note on
                     Bank Multi-Stakeholder Engagement” (World Bank 2009) has provided
                     clear guidance on how the Bank can work in the media sector and still keep
                     within its non-political mandate under the Articles. In addition to the gen-
                     eral considerations relating to political interference outlined above, it states,

                         In this context, good practice in dealing with media can be bro-
                         ken into two stages. The first involves diagnostic work to assess

    country conditions and, in particular, to determine whether in
    light of the country context and country relationship it would
    be productive to engage in supporting development of the media
    sector. This assessment in turn will have a bearing on the second
    stage, which involves managing potential political and reputa-
    tional risks of media work and promoting good practice in media
    development, through specific types of activities the Bank may
    choose to support or undertake in a given country context. (World
    Bank 2009, 12)

The report suggests that policies to support independent and plural
mass media can be a central plank of work in transparency. In contrast
to a focus on media strengthening, exclusive support to generalized
transparency policies, such as enacting freedom of information (FOI) or
disclosure laws, although useful and probably necessary, may be insuf-
ficient and lacking the potential of other steps policy actors could take.
General transparency legislation can have intrinsic value as a practice
of good governance, as well as being necessary for creating an enabling
environment for accountability. However, it is unlikely to be sufficient
to solve governance problems. The evidence covered in this report on
how political incentives matter for governance suggests that in places
with weak institutions and perverse political incentives, general policies
toward legislating transparency are subject to the same governance prob-
lems they seek to fix. Leaders within the political institutions that sustain
governance problems might not want to improve governance so that they
can preserve their political rents. Transparency for transparency’s sake
can help them implement cosmetic changes that have no real impact on
governance, but still win them accolades.
    Evidence on the role of mass media indirectly suggests that incremental
changes toward an independent and plural media environment, includ-
ing through technological and market forces that are difficult for policy
makers to control, might have a larger impact on governance than FOI
legislation alone. For example, research has shown that some authoritarian
regimes allow greater media freedoms as a way to monitor and manage
local public officials (Egorov, Guriev, and Sonin 2009). Authoritarian
leaders may have incentives to adopt those transparency policies (indepen-
dent media) that generate new and credible information that the leaders
lack—on the local performance of their public officials—rather than to
disclose the information that they already possess.

MAKING POLITICS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT



                        Technical governance work, such as public sector and financial manage-
                     ment reforms, could be complemented by transparency targeted at improv-
                     ing political incentives, rather than bypassing or ignoring politics. For
                     example, some research suggests that instituting anticorruption agencies
                     and building capacity may not make a dent in corruption in the absence
                     of political incentives to use these agencies and the built capacity to reduce
                     corruption. These agencies can even be deliberately designed to be ineffec-
                     tive, or can face political resistance when trying to fulfill their mandate.
                     Although evidence to test this hypothesis, or indeed the effectiveness of
                     such anticorruption policies, is unavailable, the evidence across countries
                     that does exist finds little correlation between the existence of anticorrup-
                     tion agencies and the control of corruption. Some case studies suggest that
                     anticorruption agencies do not address systemic corruption and, in badly
                     governed contexts, can be ineffective and in some cases harmful.
                        Since 2000, donor support for public financial management increased
                     more than aid for any other subsector. This greater focus on public finan-
                     cial management, particularly support to supreme audit institutions, has
                     led to stronger public financial management results. The World Bank
                     Independent Evaluation Group’s report on public sector reform states that
                     about two-thirds of all countries that borrowed for financial management
                     showed improvement, and it was the most consistent area of improvement
                     in the case studies (World Bank 2008). This finding should not be taken
                     at face value, however, given that the Independent Evaluation Group’s
                     report on the Bank’s Governance and Anticorruption Strategy (World
                     Bank 2011) states that although standardization of assessments and opera-
                     tional support for public financial management systems improved, the
                     implications for frontline service delivery are unclear. Does strengthen-
                     ing public financial management systems, or the building of institutional
                     capacity, lead to improved results in contexts in which political incentives
                     are weak? The examples presented in this report suggest that institutional
                     capacity building on its own, without complementary investments in
                     strengthening incentives and behavioral norms, can be undermined by
                     politics.


                     This report provides evidence that policy actors can use their instru-
                     ments to align political incentives with development objectives. One such
                     instrument is transparency, which can be targeted to improve political
                     engagement. Another is citizen engagement through which leaders can

hold a number of lower level public officials in government agencies more
accountable. An overarching recommendation is that practitioners shift
their approach from seeking to bypass politics, or lowering expectations
when it is a problem, to confronting it and incorporating it into the tech-
nical solutions to development problems. This does not mean prioritizing
attention to political incentives or “waiting” until political problems are
solved. Instead, the suggested approach opens up avenues for development
practitioners to do what they do a little bit differently to take advantage of
the growing forces of political engagement and transparency.
   The scope of the report does not allow for a detailed examination of
how technical governance arrangements should be designed within specific
sectors or agencies. It focuses on examining governance as a cross-cutting
issue. Many of its implications are therefore pertinent to those who are
engaged in cross-cutting governance work rather than in specific sec-
tors. We invite development practitioners within sectors, in addition to
in governance, to test whether the paradigm offered by the report yields
new ideas for how to do their work differently. This includes not just get-
ting governments to adopt good policies, but designing implementation
arrangements that are more likely to succeed because they are based on
a better understanding of political incentives and behavioral norms in
the public sector. Our hope is that such future work, combining political
economy with sector-specific technical expertise, will yield better ideas to
make politics work for rather than against development, such that public
sector institutions around the world will be capable of tackling global
problems of public goods.



Notes
     After studying actual practice within the United Kingdom’s Department for
  1. 
     International Development and the World Bank, Yanguas and Hume (2015)
     come to the following conclusion: “An emerging community of aid practitio-
     ners and scholars is promoting the use of political or political-economy analy-
     sis (PEA) as a new tool for improving aid effectiveness. Its institutionalization
     into actual aid practice, however, is likely to encounter entrenched organiza-
     tional procedures, incentives and sub-cultures.” Carothers and de Gramont
     (2013) describe the situation thus: “Major donors have made significant prog-
     ress in adopting politically smart methods. The growing use of tools such as
     political analysis has helped aid practitioners navigate complex local realities.
     Yet these methods struggle against inflexible aid delivery mechanisms and
     entrenched technocratic preferences within aid organizations.”

                       2. One of the authors of the WDR 2004 subsequently clarified his thinking
                           that the short route pertains to market-based transactions and the long route
                           applies every time there is a government intervention to solve a market failure
                           (Devarajan 2014; Devarajan, Khemani, and Walton 2014).
                       3. The conceptual framework in chapter 4 discusses these three principal-agent
                           relationships, and how political engagement influences all of them.
                       4. Stokes (2005) has examined such perverse accountability.
                       5. Chapter 4 provides support from the theory on the channels of transpar-
                           ency’s impact and risks of unintended consequences when information on the
                           consequences of policy actions is not available. Chapter 6 on the empirical
                           evidence of transparency’s impact also shows that performance information is
                           crucial. For example, Kendall, Nannicini, and Trebbi (2015) provide detailed
                           evidence about how voters update their beliefs in response to greater avail-
                           ability of information. They find that information on “valence issues,” which
                           most voters find desirable, such as the competence and effort of politicians
                           and their performance in service delivery, has greater impact than informa-
                           tion about ideological policy positions that divide voters. In contrast, studies
                           of interventions that provide information about politicians’ specific actions,
                           such as in legislative debate, find little impact and suggest the leaders can
                           obfuscate the information (Humphreys and Weinstein 2012).
                       6. Alt, Lassen, and Marshall (2014) find that the effects of information vary
                           with the source of information within the same strong institutional context
                           (Denmark): an unemployment projection from the Danish Central Bank,
                           which is highly credible among citizens, caused voters to update their beliefs
                           more than did information received from government or opposition political
                           parties. Results from Brazil, Mexico, and Puerto Rico on how official audit
                           disclosure contributes to reducing corruption contrasts with an information
                           experiment in Mexico in which corruption information was provided by a
                           nongovernmental organization (reviews in chapter 6).
                       7. Several recommendations here are consistent with previous work in the World
                           Development Report 2002: Building Institutions for Markets (WDR 2002).
                           The strengthening of mass media for economic development was high-
                           lighted in the WDR 2002 in a chapter devoted to the topic. A companion
                           volume expanded the analysis of the role of media (World Bank 2002). This
                           report builds on the previous work by reviewing new research since 2002 in
                           chapter 6 and the implication for policy of the interaction between media
                           ­
                           and political markets uncovered in recent research.
                       8. Chapter 6 discusses how media markets matter not just for accountability
                           and corruption, but also for ideological polarization and shaping citizens’
                           political beliefs.
                       9. Several papers show that in the absence of concerted information campaigns,
                           citizens can be unaware of information they could use or of the institutions
                           through which they might exact accountability. For example, Banerjee et al.
                           (2010) find at baseline that citizens were unaware of the existence of a vil-
                           lage education committee that could provide powers to citizens, even when
                           they are supposed to be members of it. Humphreys and Weinstein’s (2012)
                           and Malesky, Schuler, and Tran’s (2012) research designs are predicated on
                           problems of information flows from the national to local levels.

10. For example, Ferraz and Finan (2008) in Brazil; Bobonis, Cámara Fuertes,
     and Schwabe (forthcoming) in Puerto Rico; and Larreguy, Marshall, and
     Snyder (2014) in Mexico, where the disclosure of audit information has a
     bearing, particularly when it happens close to elections.
11. Chapter 5 links different strands of literature on the persistence of historical
     institutions to make such an argument.
12. Various meta-evaluations of social accountability and the Bank’s reports on
     this topic (Grandvoinnet, Aslam, and Raha 2015; Mansuri and Rao, 2013),
     have concluded that simply setting up local institutions for collective action
     by citizens outside of elections (such as village-level education and health
     committees) does not guarantee that citizens will, in fact, take actions
     through these institutions. The evidence shows that transparency plays
     little role in activating these committees when they are in reality defunct
     (Banerjee et al. 2010). Keefer and Khemani (2015) provide another example
     from Benin where greater information among citizens about the value of
     antimalaria bednets that were supposed to be distributed free of charge by
     the government, enabled local health workers to charge a price for these nets.
     Although the welfare consequences of this are uncertain and depend upon
     the incentives of health workers to use the fees charged to improve health
     services, the result shows that transparency can have the opposite effect,
     resulting in “leakage” from free to paid bednets. If the goal of national policy
     makers is to have local officials adhere to nationally set policy guidelines,
     then this study shows that transparency alone will not guarantee it and could,
     in some contexts, have the opposite effect.
13. Although there is plenty of case study evidence on civil society organizations,
     and even some cross-country correlations that use data on numbers of orga-
     nizations, the evidence on the causal effect of civil society organizations is
     not of comparable quality to that available on political engagement through

            Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental foot-
print. In support of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge
Division leverages electronic publishing options and print-on-demand
technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together,
these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances
decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, green-
house gas emissions, and waste.
    The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended
standards for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority
of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified
paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content. The
recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using
totally chlorine free (TCF), processed chlorine free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine free (EECF) processes.
    More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be

POLICY RESEARCH REPORT



S   ynthesizing the best available research, Making Politics Work for Development offers innovative ideas for
    making political markets function better so that governments have the political will to adopt technically sound
policies and the legitimacy to implement those policies through effective public sector institutions.
For more information, see www.worldbank.org/en/research/publication/making-politics-work-for-development.


“The World Bank has long drawn a line in the sand: no politics. But what if politics is key to economic
 development? The body of careful research documenting the pernicious effects of corruption, repression,
 coercion, exclusion, and fear on economic development has now become enormous. This bold new report is a
 ﬁrst step to erase the Bank’s line in the sand and understand not only the roles of citizen engagement,
 transparency, civil rights, free speech, and inclusive politics, but also how the Bank can harness them. Bravo!”
 — DARON ACEMOGLU, Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics,
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology; coauthor of Why Nations Fail

“This valuable report deals with some of the central challenges faced in making government work better. It pulls
 together a range of evidence and provides an authoritative overview of what we have learned.”
 — TIMOTHY BESLEY, Professor of Economics and Political Science and
   W. Arthur Lewis Professor of Development Economics, London School of Economics

“This brilliant report offers a clear-headed and insightful analysis of the problem of politics which impedes
 governments from playing an appropriate role in the delivery of social services such as health and education. It
 does so by bringing together the vanguard of economics research on the functioning of political markets, and
 showing how this research both explains perverse behaviors and describes a path to improve outcomes using
 the current forces of citizen participation in politics. Non-political technocrats interested in improving the
 delivery of social services would do well to heed the lessons in this report so that any steps that they take do not
 lead them down political blind alleys or precipitous cliffs.”
 — NACHIKET MOR, India Country Director, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation;
   Board Member, Reserve Bank of India

“The wealth of nations depends ultimately on the quality of their governments, and economic development in
 poor countries is regularly limited by political constraints. This book offers the best current summary of research
 on how these critical constraints can be relaxed, by policies and reforms that improve the transparency and
 accountability of government. It should be read by students and policy makers and anyone who is concerned
 about improving global economic development.”
 — ROGER MYERSON, Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor,
   University of Chicago; 2007 Nobel Laureate in Economics

“This book not only provides an authoritative statement of what we know about how to align political incentives
 with the interests of society, but it does so with an eye to making change happen even in the face of political
 opposition. The World Bank will never be the same again.”
