The Ethiopia Urbanization Review is part of a series of analytical studies under a global
product, called the Urbanization Review, developed by the Urban, Rural & Social
Development Global Practice at the World Bank.

The objective of this analytical program is to provide diagnostic tools to inform policy dialog
and investment priorities on urbanization. It is based on the framework for urban policy
developed in the World Development Report 2009—Reshaping Economic Geography and the
World Bank’s new Urban and Local Government Strategy, “System of Cities: Harnessing
Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Reduction.” To test the relevance and flexibility of the
core diagnostic tools, prototype pilots have been initiated in several countries, including
China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Turkey, and Vietnam.

The Urbanization Reviews all share similar objectives, tailored to the specific conditions of
each country. The primary purpose of this report is to present and analyze key trends across a
range of issues in the urban sector, such as the pace and form of urbanization, opportunities
for and key constraints against more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban
areas, and priority government policy options. This report should not be interpreted as a
strategic plan, implementation plan, or feasibility study. Further details such as sector-
specific targets, cost estimates, and investment requirements fall outside the scope of
Urbanization Reviews. Going forward, however, it would be possible to investigate more
opportunities for engagement and collaboration between the Government of Ethiopia and the
World Bank on the topic of urbanization, subject to available resources and management
approval.

The Ethiopia Urbanization Review is a product of close collaboration between the World
Bank and the Government of Ethiopia. A technical consultation workshop on the preliminary
study draft was held in Addis Ababa in June 2014, followed by two video conferences with
the technical team from the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction, led
by the Minister, Mekuria Haile. The final draft was presented to the Government at two
workshops held in Addis Ababa, first in January, 2015 and second in March 2015, in the
presence of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, Minister of Urban
Development, Housing and Construction, Mekuria Haile, members of the Ethiopian Cabinet,
other government agencies at the federal, regional and local levels, and Bereket Semeon,
Research and Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister and Abay Tsehaye, Research and Policy
Center Head and Advisor to the Prime Minister.

This report serves the critical and timely purpose of focusing attention on the challenges and
opportunities of urbanization in Ethiopia. The study team hopes that the policy analysis and
recommendations will be of particular service to the Government in leveraging the country’s
demographic dividend to promote economic growth, create jobs, and connect Ethiopians to
prosperity.

                                        Executive Summary

1.1         Urbanization needs proactive management if it is to work for
            people and the economy
The urban population in Ethiopia is increasing rapidly. Estimated at only 17.3 percent in
2012, Ethiopia’s urban population share is one of the lowest in the world, well below the
Sub-Saharan Africa average of 37 percent.1 But this is set to change dramatically. According
to official figures from the Ethiopian Central Statistics Agency, the urban population is
projected to nearly triple from 15.2 million in 2012 to 42.3 million in 2037, growing at
3.8 percent a year. Analysis for this report indicates that the rate of urbanization will be even
faster, at about 5.4 percent a year. That would mean a tripling of the urban population even
earlier—by 2034, with 30 percent of the country’s people in urban areas by 2028.

If managed proactively, urban population growth presents a huge opportunity to shift
the structure and location of economic activity from rural agriculture to the larger and
more diversified urban industrial and service sectors. In parallel with rapid urbanization,
Ethiopia is going through a demographic transition. The labor force has doubled in the past
20 years and is projected to rise to 82 million by 2030, from 33 million in 2005. Creating job
opportunities in urban areas will be essential if Ethiopia is to exploit its demographic
dividend. Cities already play an important role in the economy, contributing to 38 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) though employing only 15 percent of the total workforce, due
primarily to the high productivity associated with sectors located mostly in urban areas. The
Ethiopian Government’s vision is to reach middle-income status with an estimated gross
national income per capita of US$1,560 by 2025.2 If well managed, urbanization could be an
important catalyst to promote economic growth, create jobs, and connect Ethiopians to
prosperity.

If not managed proactively, rapid urban population growth may pose a demographic
challenge as cities struggle to provide jobs, infrastructure and services, and housing.
Infrastructure and service delivery are already undermined in many cities by growing urban
extents and by stretched municipal budgets, while formal labor markets are failing to keep up
with demand for jobs. Ethiopian cities run the risk of becoming less attractive places for
people and economic activity. Moreover, constraints on rural–urban migration—including the
loss of land rights for those who leave rural areas—reduce incentives to move to cities, which
in the long run could slow agglomeration, reducing productivity and economic growth.

The central challenge for the Ethiopian Government is to make sure that cities are
attractive places in which to work and live, while fostering “smart urbanization .” Smart
urbanization means putting in place the right policies, institutions, and investments now,
when incomes and urbanization levels are fairly low. City systems have to be well-equipped

Saharan average is from the World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI). “Urban population” refers to people living
in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices.

to provide for growing populations, so that new residents can propel higher productivity and
faster national growth.

Making urbanization a national priority will accelerate Ethiopia’s progress towards
reaching middle-income status. Ethiopia already benefits from high economic growth.
Compared with other countries at similar levels of urbanization, however, Ethiopia has the
lowest gross national income. Moreover, growth has been driven mainly by public investment
and private consumption on the demand side, and by services and agriculture on the supply
side, rather than sectors like manufacturing and industry that are associated with higher levels
of productivity and employment, as well as structural transformation. Agriculture, while
showing decline, remains a very large sector in the economy, while the shares of
manufacturing and services employment, in relation to the urbanization rate, have been
stagnant or declining. Of more concern is that urban industrial activity is primarily in micro
and small firms, whereas in Ethiopia, sustained job growth takes place mostly in the medium
and large firms. Jobs in the first group are unlikely to move into the second, given the current
constraints to doing business, thus failing to contribute to net job creation. For Ethiopia to
reach middle income status, an economically productive urban transformation will be
necessary, but even that on its own will be insufficient.

Ethiopia has to get its urbanization “right,” because decisions today will have far -
reaching implications for its cities of tomorrow. Given that national and local resources are
limited for urban development, the opportunity cost of each dollar spent is high.
Policymakers must weigh the long-term costs and benefits when making decisions, as the
policies, institutions, and investments put in place now will influence urban systems for years
to come. Coordination between land use and infrastructure investment is especially key
because these systems have long lifespans and shape economic and social geography in a
fundamental and path-dependent way. All this speaks to the need for data-driven policy so
government plans address the reality on the ground and avoid getting locked-in to growth
trajectories that are environmentally, socially, or financially unsustainable. The Government
has already taken steps to make evidence-based, informed decisions for well-managed urban
growth, and this report aims to contribute to those efforts.


1.2      Three Big Gaps: Jobs, Infrastructure and Services, and Housing

Urbanization is failing to meet the demands of growing numbers of urban residents in three
areas: access to jobs, infrastructure and services, and housing.

Formal job creation is not keeping pace with migration. Cities in Ethiopia offer migrants
greater employment opportunities than rural economies. But most jobs in the city are in the
informal or household sector, so waged job opportunities in urban centers are not
commensurate with migration. Of all urban households, 15 percent report having an
unemployed adult; in Addis Ababa this rises to 23.5 percent. Global evidence suggests that
wage employment, rather than self-employment, leads to the emergence of a middle class in
developing countries. In Ethiopia, wage employment is primarily formal, its rate increasing
with city size. This is encouraging, but the growth of formal jobs continues to lag behind,
evidenced by the high rates of self-employment and informal employment in cities. Moreover,
even when small- to mid-size firms are moving to cities, they lack a corresponding increase
in jobs. To exploit the country’s demographic dividend, cities need to have the right

environment for industry, firms, and entrepreneurs to become competitive, grow, and sustain
faster job growth.

Cities are struggling to provide adequate infrastructure and services. Despite progress
over the last two decades in infrastructure and services across all urban sectors, there is still
much to do, even at today’s level of urbanization. Coverage for sanitation services is low,
even by Sub-Saharan Africa standards, with a municipal sewerage system only in Addis
Ababa, serving only 10 percent of the city’s population. As in many towns and cities in the
developing world, Ethiopian cities struggle to manage solid waste, which is often dumped
into open areas, endangering public health. Road density is below the African average,
although higher                     in urban areas than the national average. The infrastructure
challenge is more pronounced in the water sector. Population growth in cites will require
many-fold increase in access to meet projected demand over the next two decades, and be
funded almost entirely by municipal own-source revenues. This is a problem because
infrastructure and services are essential to building a strong business environment in cities, as
well as making them attractive places to live and work. As is the case with employment
opportunities, the challenge of providing infrastructure and services is not just to meet current
levels of demand, but also that of the rapidly expanding urban populations that are set to
triple over the next two decades.

Poor quality and often overcrowded living conditions are the major housing challenges
experienced by urban households. In general, housing quality in Ethiopia is lower than in
neighboring countries. An estimated 70–80 percent of the urban population lives in what
might be considered slums, according to a commonly accepted international definition,
because the units lack durability, adequate space, access to safe water and sanitation, or
security of tenure.3 This is one of the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, and higher than in
most Arab countries.4 Around 80 percent of dwellings in urban areas are made from wood
and mud (also known as chika-bet construction), while two-thirds of all urban housing units
have only earthen floors, another indication of very low-quality housing.5 The main drivers of
the urban housing shortage are low incomes, insufficient supply of serviced land, and
unrealistically high and costly standards.


1.3          Urban Institutions for a Middle-income Ethiopia: Land,
             Governance, and Finance

Underlying the three big gaps are deficiencies in at least three urban institutions: land
management, governance, and municipal finance.

Land management practices, intended to maximize social welfare, indirectly and
unintentionally contribute to the problems that cities face in providing sufficient
serviced land for people, firms, and public uses and services. Unsatisfied demand is well
illustrated by land auctions in cities, where the number of bidders at land auctions has been

12 to 24 times higher than the number of plots for residential land and 3 to 7 times higher
than available plots for commercial land. In 2011, more than one-quarter of companies in
Ethiopia reported that access to land represents a major or severe constraint to doing
business. And Ethiopian cities like Addis Ababa lag on measures — such as land allocated to
streets and intersection density — that are essential for mobility, productivity, quality of life,
and social inclusion. At the same time, prevailing practices of land management lack
incentives for high utilization of existing formal land supply and result in low-density,
spatially fragmented development and limited mixed-use development. This type of urban
expansion is much more expensive and proves difficult for urban local governments to
provide services and foster economic growth.

The government acts as the sole supplier of urban land for formal development. This is
not a trivial task, especially given the multiple systems of property rights, combined with a
complex system of land-leasing. The government also faces an enormous financial burden in
extending required basic services to those plots. Inability to satisfy demand for affordable
land through formal channels, constrained by municipal governments’ capacity and limited
financial resources, drives informal development, 6 especially in peri-urban areas far from
jobs. Regulations on minimum lot sizes, coupled with limits on land plot coverage and
building heights, discourage high-density development that could accommodate all income
groups in closer proximity to jobs and services.

Local governments below the regional level, despite their importance, have limited
capacity and autonomy. Decentralization has increased the role of local governments, which
are tasked with the provision of “state services,” such as education, health, justice, and
security—and “municipal services,” such as roads, drainage, sanitation, and solid waste
collection and disposal. But they often lack the capacity and the authority to fulfill their
responsibilities. Important powers are mostly retained at the regional level, particularly in
municipal finance, land management, personnel management, and city operating practices—
all making it harder for cities to carry out their mandates. More generally, many cities simply
lack the human and financial resources to govern and deliver services.

Municipal finances are inadequate to fund urban development. Intergovernmental
transfers and own-source revenues cover local expenditures but are insufficient to fully fund
urban services and infrastructure. State functions are financed through regional transfers,
often barely enough to cover recurrent needs. Municipal functions—including water,
sanitation, local roads, and solid waste management—are expected to be funded from own
local revenues, both for recurrent and capital spending. But revenues rarely meet demand for
services. While municipal revenue growth has been robust in nominal terms, in real terms it
has grown slower than inflation, GDP growth, and overall public revenue growth. Moreover,
many cities lack control over rate-setting, while larger cities rely heavily on unsustainable
land-lease revenues. Combined with the limited authority and capacity of local governments,
these financial constraints make it much harder for cities to finance the necessary
infrastructure and services to provide for rapidly growing urban populations.


6Informal development in Ethiopia includes three components known internationally, which are not mutually exclusive and
often can be found combined: (i) construction on plots for which no legal land rights exist; (ii) construction on legally held
plots, but outside planned territories, and (iii) construction that is not in compliance with land use requirements and/or
construction standards.

1.4       The Path to Prosperity: Where to go from here?

Urbanization in Ethiopia needs to be better managed so it can respond appropriately to
growth. To promote better and better-managed urbanization and meet the growing demand
for jobs, infrastructure, services, and housing, a robust institutional framework is necessary to
support efficient and sustainable land management, urban governance, and municipal finance.
Policies and investments that fail to address these underlying institutional issues are unlikely
to achieve long-lasting results. In addition, targeted sector interventions should make sure
that urbanization contributes to economic growth and that cities are attractive places in which
to live and work. The roles for national, regional, and urban local governments will also need
to evolve as they transition from urban planning, management, and implementation to
enabling and coordinating action by a growing number of stakeholders, both public and
private.

First, while maintaining the public ownership of land, reform the system of land
management to ease administrative and fiscal burdens, free land for development, and
promote efficient urban forms. There is much scope for land administration system reform
while still maintaining ownership of land by all Ethiopians, as enshrined in the Ethiopian
Constitution. To start, regulations for land use planning and development can be made more
efficient irrespective of the land ownership regime. This would reduce the cost of land and
housing to the benefit of all households, including lower-income groups. Lessons from
Singapore and Turkey suggest that the government could gradually reposition itself as an
enabler and regulator of the private sector, rather than a direct and leading provider of
infrastructure and housing. This would ease the administrative burden—and associated
costs—while addressing the backlog in affordable housing. The regulatory and administrative
shift could be accompanied by better utilization of urban land values, allowing the
government to claim its fair share and use it for the public benefit, such as funding
infrastructure. Further, creating a comprehensive inventory and audit system of land in urban
areas would help identify excess land that could be reclassified and released for development,
particularly in prime locations. For instance, the city of Hawassa’s experience with such land
reallocations could be leveraged in other cities. Coordinating infrastructure investment and
land use planning, allowing for higher density and thus a more efficient urban form could
reduce the cost of service delivery, with further potential to finance infrastructure investments
through the increased revenues from market-based land allocations.

Second, strengthen local government capacity and autonomy. In deepening the
decentralization process, Ethiopia would benefit from strengthening the overall capacity of
local governments and the legislative functions of city councils for greater fiscal autonomy
and better service delivery. Since all municipal services must legally be financed through a
city’s own-source revenues, urban local governments must be able to raise enough revenues
and manage them efficiently, including setting rates. Federal and regional government tiers,
in addition to the existing focus on mobilization of state revenues, urgently need to focus
their support on municipal finance mobilization at the local government level.

Third, reform national and regional institutions to increase investment in urban
development and address the wide investment gaps. This would include building the
evidence base for policy discussion through regular review of intergovernmental finance,
improving the transparency and rigor of accounting and budgeting, and providing incentives
for local revenue collection by giving local governments greater control over state revenues

in excess of budget thresholds. With a robust urban institutional framework in place, targeted
sector interventions can address specific issues and close the gaps in jobs, infrastructure and
services, and housing.

Beyond these moves, creating a competitive business environment nationally is crucial
for economic growth and job creation. Private sector dynamism in Ethiopian cities is low
and variable. Not enough companies survive and thrive, while many city economies are
dominated by small and informal enterprises. Cities must identify and invest in the factors
that allow firms to expand and create new jobs, and that encourage firms to graduate, through
for instance, better regulated local business taxes and access to infrastructure. Ethiopia should
identify and invest in growing the “missing middle” of companies and jobs across urban areas
– in other words, mid-sized firms that have the ability to sustain large increases in
employment. In the short run, this will require increasing urban local governmental capacity
to properly design and implement incentives for firms, especially non-fiscal ones. For
instance, tax and licensing fees affecting firm start-ups and growth could increase city
competitiveness if local authorities had greater institutional capacity. In the medium run,
cities need better access to the main determinants of private sector growth —power, transport,
and finance to connect markets and consumers. In the long run, cities need smarter
regulations for land markets to promote efficient allocation of land and resources.

Addressing the underlying issues in municipal finance and land management will
provide more revenues for infrastructure investment, but there are other options for
targeted interventions to close the infrastructure gap. First, increase the cost recovery in
large infrastructure projects through subsidies and user fees. Second, reduce operating
inefficiencies through governmental capacity building. Third, improve sector planning and
utility reform by defining a clear financing strategy and delineating responsibilities among
different government agencies. Fourth, improve capital budget execution in the infrastructure
sector, which is estimated to result in losses of around US$63 million a year.7

The transformation from a predominantly rural to an urban society is not automatic.
Nor should the potential benefits—for individuals and the economy—be taken for granted.
To contribute fully to economic growth and transformation, urbanization will have to be
managed smartly. This requires building the underlying institutional foundations and
targeting interventions to provide jobs, infrastructure, and services. Under the strong vision of
the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction, Ethiopia has already made
much progress, and there are clear signs that the Government is willing to shape urban
development. The evidence in this report aims to support the Government in this important
task.

1.       The Demographic Dividend: Cities and Economic
         Growth

1.1         Introduction
1.      Ethiopia has one of the fastest growing urban populations in the world, with the
number of people living in cities expected to nearly triple in the next two decades. This
demographic dividend presents a real opportunity to change the structure and location of
economic activity from rural agriculture to more diversified and much larger urban industrial
and service sectors. For urbanization to contribute fully to economic growth and
transformation, it will have to be managed well. Ethiopia already benefits from high rates of
economic growth, but among most other countries at similar levels of urbanization, it has the
lowest gross national income (GNI). Moreover, growth has been driven mainly by public
investment and agriculture, and rapid urbanization has not been accompanied by structural
transformation of the economy.


1.2         The Demographic Dividend

2.      With an official population of 86.6 million, 8 Ethiopia ranks as the 14th most
populous country in the world. Yet, it is not highly urbanized. According to figures from
Ethiopia’s Central Statistical Agency (CSA), in 2012 the urban population was estimated at
17.4 percent, up from 16 percent in 2007.9 In comparison, urbanization globally, in middle-
income countries, and in Sub-Saharan African countries averages 52, 50, and 37 percent,
respectively.10 Similarly, as indicated in Figure 1, Ethiopia’s urbanization rate is among the
lowest in the cohort of similar income counties (in terms of GDP per capita, constant 2005
US$). Rural-to-urban migration is also low compared to other developing countries (see Box
1).

Box 1: Constraints on rural-urban migration in Ethiopia

 In general, rural-urban migration has been shown to be associated with economic development
 and reduced poverty for migrants. Urban areas offer migrants from rural areas better
 infrastructure, increased access to services and more job opportunities. Migration, as one factor of
 urbanization, also contributes to the positive returns from agglomerations, scale economies, and
 improved labor productivity in cities.

 In Ethiopia, pull factors may be a strong driver of migration. For example, migration to urban
 areas is positively correlated with labor market conditions at the destination. Cities with a high
 proportion of residents who migrated in the past year also have higher rates of employment in the
 labor force as a whole. Rural-urban migrants are more likely to be employed, and less likely to be
 self-employed, than non-migrants. Migrants in Ethiopia also tend to be more educated and to
 come from wealthier families, when compared to non-migrants. Finally, migration is associated
 with lower poverty rates. Among the 95 largest cities in Ethiopia, there is a strong negative
 relationship between the proportion of medium- and long-term migrants and the head count
 poverty rate. Data also shows large increases in consumption among migrants, compared to non-
 migrants of the same (origin) village.

 Despite these pull factors, rural-to-urban migration in Ethiopia remains low compared to other
 developing countries. Only about one in ten rural residents migrate, compared to one in five rural
 workers in China. When considering the whole population, migrants comprise 13.7 percent and
 16.2 percent of the male and female populations of Ethiopia, respectively. By comparison, this
 figure is 30 percent in India, 22 percent in Vietnam (1992), and 25 percent in Uganda among
 those aged 25-49 years old (2001). Furthermore, only a small proportion of migrants in Ethiopia
 move from rural to urban areas. Rather, half of all migrants move from one rural area to another,
 according to the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey.

 Restrictions on land rights may be one explanation for low migration rates from rural to urban
 areas. For example, land rights in rural areas are permitted to be transferred to family members,
 but transfers outside the family are rare. Certain regulations also result in the loss of land rights
 for those who leave rural areas. Finally, new migrants to urban areas must wait six months to
 register their new address, which limits access to basic services. These types of policies may act
 as a hindrance to rural-urban migration. Faced with insecure land tenure rights, households in
 rural areas of Ethiopia choose to remain in place and maintain the use right of their land allotment
 by continuing to farm. This is similar to China, where comparable restrictions on sales of land
 rights have acted as barriers to migration.

 Such disincentives for rural–urban migration, which sometimes outweigh the pull factors of urban
 areas, could hinder economic development in both rural and urban areas. Constrained rural-urban
 migration can undermine productivity in the industrial sector by holding back agglomeration and
 scale economies in cities, and limit labor productivity in agriculture by inhibiting the incentive to
 invest.

3.     However, urbanization is rapidly increasing. Ethiopia’s urban population has more
than doubled in the past 20 years, from 7.3 million in 1994 to an estimated 16.7 million in
2014.11 The rates of population growth between the census periods of 1984–94 and 1994–
2007 were 4.4 and 3.8 percent, respectively. Over the past 30 years, Ethiopia’s annual urban
population growth rate has been higher than the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (which itself
is among the fastest urbanizing regions in the world).12 The country’s labor force doubled
over the past two decades, and the country still has a very large youth bulge entering the labor
market in the next 20 years (Figure 2). Many of these young people will be moving to cities
for work. While Addis Ababa remains the largest urban area, other cities and towns have also
grown rapidly.

4.      According to CSA projections, the urban population is set to nearly triple
between 2012 and 2037, to more than 42 million people. The CSA figures are based on the
Urban–Rural Growth Differential method, which measures the net impact of various drivers
of population growth. In reality, however, urbanization in Ethiopia may be even higher as a
result of several factors not adequately captured in CSA projections. These include:

    i. Migration to new towns and urban centers around planned megaprojects, such as
       sugar plantations and irrigation projects and other intraregional rural-to-urban
       migration, which may not be adequately accounted for in the Urban–Rural Growth
       Differential method;

    ii. Statistical growth of the population due to:

               o Reclassification of rural villages as urban centers, based on criteria established
                 by regional Bureaus of Urban Development and Construction. Rural villages
                 are upgraded to towns when they meet the following requirements: over half
                 of the population are engaged in non-farming activities such as petty trading,
                 service provision and the like; most of the residents in the area are benefiting
                 from urban-based facilities like electricity, piped-water supply, telephones,
                 schools, and health services; total population living in that particular location
                 is 2,000 and above; and the area is believed to have potential for economic
                 growth and attraction of migrants to engage in nonfarm activities.

               o Formal expansion of existing urban boundaries to incorporate nearby
                 settlements, as a result of heavy demand for land for residential areas and
                 establishment of manufacturing industries. The territorial expansion of large
                 and medium towns from year to year is not negligible in Ethiopia.

5.     Based on the authors’ own calculations of migration, natural population increase
and statistical growth since 2007, Ethiopia’s urbanization rate is expected to be higher

                                                          4

than the official CSA figures. From these estimates, Ethiopia is expected to be 30
percent urban by 2028, while its urban population will exceed 42 million by 2032. 13
Over this period, the annual increase in the urban population will range from 800,000 to 1.9
million (although as the total urban population grows, the percent change for each year will
decline from 5.9 percent to 4.5 percent). This analysis is based on the best available data from
the CSA as well as other governmental sources. For more information on the projections and
underlying assumptions, please refer to Annex 3: Detailed Methodology for Alternative
Urbanization Projections.

          i. Prior to 2018, natural increase is expected to be the largest contributor to urban
             population growth, contributing between 266,000 and 429,000 urban residents
             each year, approximately 40 percent of total annual urban population growth;

          ii. Migration to existing urban centers and statistical reclassification of rural villages
              will also be significant, making up 33 percent and 24 percent of the total urban
              population growth in 2012, respectively. However, rural-to-urban migration is
              expected to outpace natural increase after 2018. Through 2032, rural-to-urban
              migration will contribute between 386,000 and 890,000 urban residents each year,
              and will account for 41 to 47 percent of the total annual urban population growth.
              Migration to new megaprojects—particularly irrigation projects—will also
              become more significant. On average, these projects are expected to result in
              163,000 additional urban residents each year, and their share of the total annual
              urban population growth will range from 22 percent (2015) to 16 percent (2032).

          iii. Finally, formal expansion of existing urban areas will consistently account for 2 to
               4 percent of the total urban population growth each year, from 22,000 in 2012 to
               67,000 in 2032.


1.3          Exploiting the Demographic Dividend

6.      Urban population growth presents a key opportunity to change the structure and
location of economic activity from a basis in rural agriculture to more diversified and
larger urban industrial and service sectors. In parallel with rapid urbanization, Ethiopia is
going through a demographic transition. The labor force—up from 4.7 million in 1984 to
26.5 million in 1994 and to 33 million in 2005—is projected to rise to 82 million by 2030.
Ethiopian cities now employ 15 percent of the labor force and contribute 38 percent to gross
domestic product (GDP)14. If well managed, urbanization could be one of the most important
catalysts to promote economic growth, create jobs, and connect Ethiopians to prosperity.




13 See Annex 3 for more detail on why the urbanization rate may be higher than CSA’s estimate of 3.77 percent. Although
this figure is the result of a more detailed analysis of urbanization, it should still be treated as an estimate. Barney Cohen
(2003) has shown that urbanization projections for all regions of the world are subject to “considerable uncertainty,”
especially at the country or city level.

income country by 2025”, World Bank, Ethiopia Economic Update II (2013).

7.      Ethiopia is experiencing a demographic transition, with the total labor force
more than doubling over the past two decades.15 According to data from the 2011 Urban
Bi-annual Employment Unemployment Surveys (UBEUS), national unemployment for the
urban population aged 10 years and above stood at 18 percent (11.4 percent male,
25.3 percent female). 16 The population of Ethiopia also remains predominantly rural (81
percent in 2014) and young (65 percent below the age of 25). The creation of productive
employment opportunities for the youth bulge will be key to securing a demographic
dividend. The industrial sector has much potential to create the many jobs that will be
required in the coming years. But descriptive statistics suggest that many cities attract capital-
intensive firms, and that there is scope to increase the contribution of labor-intensive
manufacturing. Growing urbanization has the potential to help Ethiopia employ the millions
of newcomers into the labor market. The challenge should be understood from the angle of
agents of demand (firms that create and sustain employment) and agents of supply (workers).
An understanding of how firms create and grow employment in cities will be important to
identify the right policies for absorbing the increase in the country’s labor force.

8.      Cities have an increasingly important role in the economy. Analysis undertaken
for this study indicates that cities account for over 38 percent of the country’s GDP, while
they employ—formally and informally—15 percent of the national workforce. 17 An
important reason why cities contribute to economic growth above their employment share is
the high productivity associated with predominantly urban sectors, such as services, which
contribute strongly to national value-added growth. Between 2005 and 2011, manufacturing
and industry together accounted, on average, for 12 percent of the growth in gross value
added (GVA), while services accounted for 58 percent. Employment across these three
sectors, which together made up 70 percent of value-added growth over that period, is heavily
concentrated in cities. During the same period, predominantly urban activities such as
financial and real estate services, transport and logistics, and wholesale/retail have grown
both in value added and employment. In fact, the service sector added over 200,000 new jobs
a year in urban areas, bringing the contribution of cities to over 71 percent to overall growth
in the sector. 18 Of the nearly 2.8 million new jobs created in Ethiopia between 2005 and
2011, 60 percent were in urban and 40 percent in rural areas.19 This shows the increasing
importance of urban areas for job creation in the sectors generally associated with structural
transformation.

9.      Evidence from around the world suggests that the level of urbanization rises with
the level of development. Seminal research by Williamson (1965) and Kuznets (1955)
shows that industrialization during early stages of development leads to greater inequality in
regional per capita incomes as a result of the shift of labor force from low-productivity
agriculture to sectors of higher productivity. However, as countries develop, this shift slows

15 WDI suggest that the age dependency ratio in Ethiopia increased slowly between 1960 and 1995, and then began to fall
rapidly to its 1960 level (i.e. 85 percent). This suggests that not only is the labor force increasing in absolute terms, but that

18 We use a factor decomposition analysis to estimate the contribution of labor and capital across sectors in urban and rural

areas. For methodology and details of this computation, see the background paper Contribution of Cities to National GDP in
Ethiopia by Onur Ozlu and Ana I. Aguilera de Llano. Please note that employment figures include both formal and informal
employment.

and follows a decreasing trend in the latter stages of development, as labor and capital
movements equalize returns across sectors. International evidence shows that urbanization
increases with development, although the relationship is not always linear (Figure 3).
Urbanization rises rapidly during the transformation of countries from agrarian to industrial
economies, which usually also coincides with development from low- to middle-income
status. The figure also shows that urbanization is associated with faster rates of growth when
countries are poorer and less urbanized, but that diminishing marginal returns set in at higher
incomes. For instance, Bruhlart and Sbergami (2009) find that agglomeration seems to boost
GDP growth up to US$10,000 per capita, and that the opportunity cost of low levels of
agglomeration20 are the highest in poorer countries. This suggests that policies that restrict the
growth of urban agglomerations could have deleterious effects for GDP growth in Ethiopia.




20Results are based on cross-country regressions for 105 countries over 1960–2000. The authors equate agglomeration with
urbanization, defined by three variables: a country’s population share living in cities whose population exceeds 750,000 in
2000; a country’s population share living in areas described as cities by national statistical agencies; and the share of urb an
population that lives in the largest city.

10.     As in other countries, urbanization in Ethiopia is a significant predictor of
economic growth. As Ethiopia urbanizes, it is no surprise that this has been associated with
increasing rates of economic growth, with this relationship becoming stronger after 2007-
2008. Figure 4 depicts the relationship between economic growth and urbanization in
Ethiopia over three development periods: (i) the eighties (1981-1992) characterized by yearly
erratic low growth at an annual average rate of 0.24 percent for the decade; (ii) the nineties
(1992-2003) with a steady average annual rate of 4.6 percent ; and (iii) contemporary growth
(2003-2013) characterized by fast growth rates averaging 10.4 percent per year with
urbanization and economic growth accelerating after 2007-200821. However, while the recent
growth is impressive, GNI in Ethiopia is the lowest among countries with similar levels of
urbanization. Ethiopia is 18 percent urbanized, with US$470 GNI per capita, Atlas method.
Countries with similar levels of urbanization (18–20 percent) include Nepal, South Sudan,
and Sri Lanka with 18 percent urbanization and US$730; US$1,120; US$3,170 GNI per
capita, respectively; and Cambodia at 20 percent urbanization with US$950 GNI per capita22,

21 Urban population growth increases from 4.1% in 2007 to 5.1% in 2008, suggesting a change in the slope of urbanization
as depicted in Figure 4. The change in slope is shown by the dotted line that joins the GDP line at around 2007. Note that
GDP growth also accelerates after 2008.

23 Rates of GNI growth were regressed on rates of urbanization across 214 countries, spanning 52 years (1960–2012),

controlling for country and year fixed effects. It was found that on average a 1 percent increase in the rate of urbanization is
associated with a 0.134 percent increase in GDP. For Ethiopia, the regression results suggest a negative and statistically
significant association between urbanization and GDP growth.

11.     Rates of growth enjoyed by Ethiopia over the past few years have been
associated with an increase in value-addition in services, but scant structural changes in
the labor force and little industrialization.24 The country’s recent economic growth has
been impressive in absolute terms, averaging 10 percent per annum. In line with this growth,
real GVA increased from 184 billion birr in 1999 to 571 billion birr in 2013 – a 211 percent
increase in 14 years (in constant prices, Table 1). The recent economic growth is based
mostly on agricultural production and services on the supply side, and private consumption
and public investment — Ethiopia’s public investment rate is the third highest in the world25
— on the demand side, rather than on strong structural change in the economy. In addition to
this, mining has also grown rapidly at an average annual rate of 11.8 percent for 1999-2013,
although from a low base.

12.     Agriculture remains a very large sector and the services sector is beginning to
play an increasing role in the Ethiopian economy. While there is a steady decline in the
growth rate of the agricultural sector, it remains very large in terms of total output,
accounting for about 45 percent of GVA (Table 2). The service sector has expanded
considerably (especially commerce and real estate activities); trade and other services each
represent about 40 percent of GVA, with their relative shares nearly doubling since 1991. Yet
industry’s share of the GVA remains one of the lowest in Africa. As shown in Figure 5,
labor-intensive activities such as services are beginning to play an increasingly important role
in the economy as the country urbanizes and benefits from a pooled labor market. At the
same time, the decline in agriculture continued during 2006-2011, its share of total value
added contracted by 8 percent despite continuing to grow in real terms at the same rate.
Importantly, manufacturing, a sector typically associated with structural transformation and
productivity gains, is not only very small, at 4.3 percent of GVA in 2013 (especially
compared with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) but has also recorded very little
increase since 1991 (when it accounted for 3 percent of GVA). While manufacturing
continued to grow at 10 percent, its share of total value added barely moved. The fact that
smaller sectors like mining, manufacturing and construction continue to grow but their shares
are almost unchanged is most likely related to the larger effect that services and trade have on

the overall value added. A key factor in Ethiopia’s structural change is that the considerable
GVA growth has been mainly driven by within-sector labor productivity, although structural
change – i.e. the reallocation of labor from lower-to higher-productivity sectors – is playing
an increasingly important role. There is also growing evidence of a demographic dividend.
However, more than three-quarters of workers – nearly 40 million – continue to rely on the
agricultural sector to earn a living. When compared with other Sub-Saharan African
countries, Ethiopia has the highest share of agriculture in GDP and the lowest shares of
industry and manufacturing, suggesting that stronger efforts will be required to accelerate the
pace of structural transformation and achieve sustainable economic development (Martins,
2015).

13.     While the recent performance of the Ethiopian economy has been remarkable,
with strong, broad-based economic growth and considerable poverty reduction, it has
been driven primarily by public investment and private consumption on the demand
side, and by services and agriculture on the supply side. Sustaining this economic
performance is likely to become increasingly difficult due to the challenge of maintaining
high levels of public investments, and will only be achieved by accelerating the pace of
structural transformation. The average urbanization rate of 3.7 percent a year between1996
and 2011 and the rate of shift out of agriculture (a key indicator of structural transformation)
during the same period are similar.26, 27 This indicates that the shift in people from rural to
urban areas has been almost the same as the shift in people from agriculture to non-
agriculture. While more research is needed to better understand the link between urbanization
and the shift out of agriculture to more productive activities, Dorosh and Thurlow (2011)28
find that “…accelerated urbanization would strengthen economic growth, improve rural
welfare, and reduce the rural–urban divide”. Additionally, bivariate analysis done for this
study suggests a strong negative correlation 29 between agricultural activity and higher
urbanization (pair-wise correlation of -0.8507), while preliminary analysis shows a positive




26 Martins (2014) show that agriculture’s share of total employment decreased 3 percentage points between 1996 and 2011,
with the sector contributing 81.0 percent of overall jobs in 1996 and 78.0 percent of total in 2011.
27 The average annual urban population growth rate is 3.77 percent according to CSA estimates and 4.4 percent based on

WDI (2014) data. Regardless of the magnitude of this rate, the shift out of agriculture is similar.

29 The econometric exercise carries out a careful study of how different variables are associated with one another, but does

not posit causality at this stage. Such an exercise would require controlling for endogenity (i.e. owing to simultaneity and
omitted variables bias), requiring a much more sophisticated level of analysis.

correlation between industrial activities and services on the one hand and urbanization on the
other (correlation coefficients of 0.6782 and 0.8879, respectively)30.

14.     Changes in the composition of employment have not fully mirrored the shift in
the composition of the GVA, and have lagged behind. The share of agriculture in GVA
declined by 20 percentage points between 1996 and 2013 (from 62% to 42%), while the share
of services went up from 30 percent to 45 percent (see Table 2). For the same period, the
share of agriculture in total employment decreased by only 4 percentage points (from 81% to
77%), i.e. agricultural employment remains very high. Total employment increased by
12.2 million between 1996 and 2013, with agriculture absorbing 72 percent of this increase,
followed by trade (8%), manufacturing (8%), other services (7.4%) and construction (3%). It
is notable that trade and other services accounted for 3.0 and 2.8 million jobs in 2013,
respectively, nearly doubling their 1996 values. Jointly, these two sectors account for almost
15 percent of total employment. The pace of employment growth has slowed in recent
years,31 and growth in manufacturing employment went down from 5.5 percent per annum
between 1999 and 2005 to 2.6 percent per annum between 2005 and 2013 (Table 3). Given
the different data sources, however, 32 the results must be interpreted with utmost caution.
Bearing this in mind, as most manufacturing employment is concentrated in urban areas in
Ethiopia (Table 4), the country seems to be deindustrializing faster at lower rates of
development.33

30 Sector shares (as percentage of national annual GVA) are based on the World Bank’s Ethiopia Country Office calculations
for 1981–2012. Urbanization levels (share of urban population as a percentage of the total) are publicly available (WDI) for
the same period, on an annual basis. Correlation coefficients are statistically significant for a 5% confidence interval.
31 Supported by evidence that the employment rate—i.e. the employment-to-population ratio—fell between 2005 and 2013.

This can be partly explained by a large number of youth staying longer in education. See also Broussara and Tekleselassie
(2012) who provide evidence on youth employment in Ethiopia. By delaying entry into the labor market, this increase in the
student population (counted under the economically inactive) has an impact on several employment indicators.
32 Data from two labor force surveys (LFS) and two household income consumption and expenditure surveys (HICES) are

used: LFS 1999 and LFS 2005, and HICES 1995/96 and HICES 2010/11. HICES 1999/2000 and HICES 2004/05 are not
included because LFS cover similar periods and provide more comprehensive information on employment issues, and
because HICES 1999/2000 does not provide data on the employment sector, which is a crucial variable for the analysis on
structural transformation. Also, the 2007 Census does not provide data on the employment sector, while the 1984 Census
includes data for Eritrea. The 1994 Census is close to the first HICES and is not included to minimize the use of multiple
data sources. The use of the HICES 2010/11 survey is especially important as it allows the study of recent sector
employment dynamics, and thus structural change.

15.     Economic activity is growing faster in cities surrounding the capital region, but
less rapidly in Addis Ababa. By using nightlights as a rough measure of economic
activity,34 Figure 6 depicts changes in GDP per capita between 1994 and 2012 for more than
20 Ethiopian cities. Despite its primacy, Addis Ababa has experienced a relatively low
growth in economic activity compared with other cities in the country35. Given the caveats of
nightlights data as a proxy for GDP,36 we interpret some of these findings with great caution,
and try and supplement them with data on employment and other measures of activity. There
is evidence of a decline in GDP per capita in the capital between 2007 and 2012.37 Yet cities
close to Addis Ababa, including Sebeta, Bishoftu (Debre Zeyit), and Mojo, have experienced
very large increases in economic growth. In contrast, economic activity in other cities in the
north of the country seems to be declining, even over 1994–2012.




34 See Annex 2, GDP and Nightlights Data, for more details.
35 It is important to note that the electricity sector has been growing at a rapid pace in Ethiopia. In the five years leading up
to 2011, more than 41 percent of towns and villages were connected to the grid, and the number of electricity consumers
grew from 800,000 in 2006 to more than 2 million in 2011. Given that Addis has always been fairly well served with
electricity, some of the increase in the activity in areas surrounding Addis might possibly be attributable to their increased
access to electricity.
36 Nightlights data are based on satellite images taken at night, and are more likely to represent economic activity that uses

electricity, and can be biased upwards or downwards accordingly, although the direction or range of the bias is unclear in
this case.
37 The overall size of the economy in Addis Ababa is growing. Declining GDP per capita suggests that population growth

has outpaced GDP growth.

16.     In summary, Ethiopia will need to do more if it is to reap the full benefits of
rapid urbanization. Our analysis indicates that Ethiopia could be 30 percent urban by as
early as 2028, with a tripling of urban population to 42 million by 2032. Over the same
period, the labor force is expected to increase to 82 million. Creating job opportunities in
urban areas will be essential if Ethiopia is to exploit its demographic dividend. Cities already
play an important role in the economy, contributing to 38 percent of GDP though employing
only 15 percent of the total workforce. This is primarily due to the high productivity
associated with urban sectors like services. Cities have also accommodated 60 percent of all
new jobs created in Ethiopia between 2005 and 2011 despite a much smaller share of the
population. However, while at over 10 percent, recent economic growth at the aggregate level
has been impressive, per capita growth has lagged and GNI in Ethiopia is the lowest among
countries with similar levels of urbanization, suggesting that urbanization has not been
associated with commensurate increases in economic prosperity. Moreover, more than any
other Sub-Saharan African country, growth in Ethiopia has been based primarily on
agricultural production and public investment rather than sectors like manufacturing and
industry that lead to structural transformation and tend to be associated with higher levels of
productivity and employment. As we shall see in the following chapter, if cities fail to
capitalize on the opportunities presented by the demographic dividend, rapid population
growth could become a demographic problem, as urban areas would fail to provide adequate
employment, infrastructure and services, and housing to expanding urban populations.

2.       The Demographic Challenge: Jobs, Infrastructure
         and Services, and Housing

2.1         Introduction

17.     If not well managed, rapid urban growth could present less of a demographic
dividend and more of a demographic problem as cities struggle to provide jobs,
infrastructure and services, and housing to more people. The central challenge for the
Ethiopian Government is making sure that cities are attractive places to work and live, while
fostering urbanization. Infrastructure and service delivery already are undermined by the
growing urban extent and by stretched municipal budgets, while formal labor markets are
failing to keep up with the demand for jobs. As a result, Ethiopian cities run the risk of
becoming less attractive places for people and economic activity.


2.2         The Employment Gap

18.    Job creation is an essential part of creating socially sustainable cities.
Manufacturing growth was a driver of poverty reduction in urban areas from 2000 to 2011.39
In Ethiopia, poverty rates are lower in cities that have a higher share of the population in
wage employment than self-employment (Figure 7). Fresh entrants to the labor market were
more likely to be employed in 2012 than graduates in 2003. 40 However, unemployment rates
among recent graduates are very high, particularly in large urban centers.

Figure 7: Towns and cities with higher rates of wage (formal) employment are less poor

39 This is because manufacturing employment is associated with lower levels of poverty, and because waged employment
(often in the manufacturing sector) is associated with lower levels of poverty.

     Section 2: The Demographic Challenge: Jobs, Infrastructure and Services, and Housing




19.     Unemployment in Ethiopia is an urban phenomenon, particularly in Addis
Ababa. In rural areas, fewer than five percent of all households have an unemployed adult.
However, in urban areas, 15 percent of all households report an adult member—male or
female—as unemployed. Unemployment increases in large cities as the size of formal labor
markets increase. In particular, there are high unemployment rates in Addis Ababa;
23.5 percent of households report an unemployed adult, versus 11 percent of households in
other urban areas.

20.     Urbanization in Ethiopia can help bring about structural transformation if it is
accompanied by sustained increases in nonfarm employment. High unemployment rates
in urban areas are worrisome, especially given the rapidly changing demographic profile of
the population. The rest of this section studies the employment profile across cities, slicing
the aggregate numbers by the types and sources of job creation. To understand the
distribution of employment across cities, two separate sources of data were used. The
distribution of total employment (i.e. formal and informal (waged and self-employed), and
across sectors) was analyzed using the UBEUS. In addition, the distribution of formal
industrial employment was analyzed using data from the Large and Medium Scale
Manufacturing and Electrical Industries Survey (LMMIS).41

21.     Employment growth is faster in cities other than Addis Ababa. Industrial
concentration and growth take place more in the cities, although increasingly less so in Addis
Ababa than in secondary cities. The federal government has taken several policy measures to
support industrialization across the country,42 and urban regions remain centers of economic
activity and employment. Much more industrial activity, as measured by the LMMIS data, is
concentrated in Addis Ababa. Over time, however, a number of cities have managed to
expand their manufacturing base, notably Adwa, Sebeta, Bishoftu, Adama, Hawassa, and
Mekele. Indeed, data from the UBEUS and LMMIS suggest that the primacy of Addis Ababa
is declining for employment (Figure 8). Nevertheless, the absolute size of its economy is still
growing, which indicates that it remains an attractive location for firms.

22.     Informal43 employment in secondary cities is also more widespread than in Addis
Ababa. Although secondary cities are growing faster than the capital, they also tend to have a
larger informal sector than Addis Ababa (Figure 9). These trends vary considerably across
sectors. Industry and services in urban areas generally increased their share in formal
employment between 2006 and 2012.




41 The LMMIS data do not include services enterprises, informal enterprises, or enterprises with fewer than 10 employees.
They include all manufacturing enterprises across the country employing 10 or more workers. Data from the UBEUS (2009,
2010, 2011, and 2012) were used to check these findings. There are similarities in employment distribution: the share of
Addis Ababa remains dominant, with the city accounting for around half of medium and large firms, and half of total
employment. Also, after 2010, employment share decreased in many other cities, indicating that either firms located in the
capital were more resilient to global macroeconomic shocks, or that firms and people migrated to Addis Ababa.
42 This included providing incentives for setting up industrial zones in and around cities in regions across Ethiopia.
43 An informal entity is defined as person(s) or firms who engage in commercial activities without having a valid business

license or paying taxes associated with their business activities, as required by law. Informal actors can be both
manufacturers and service providers (Proclamation No. 686/2010).

23.      Informality in Ethiopia is less widespread than elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2011, 37 percent of those employed in Ethiopian cities were in the informal sector—this is
low when compared to average rates of 60 percent or higher elsewhere.44 The government
has taken a two-pronged approach to dealing with informality. On the one hand, the
Commercial Registration and Business Licensing Proclamation (passed in January 2011) lays
out severe penalties for those engaging in unlawful (which may include informal) economic
activities. At the same time, local urban governments have established policies to facilitate
the transition of informal firms through skills training, provision of business premises, and

44African cities are characterized by high levels of slums and informal settlements, reaching proportions as much as 60 –
80 percent in some East, Central, and West African cities. See: African Centre for Cities. “A Framework for Working with
Informality.”

access to finance. For instance, in Addis Ababa, informal street vendors were relocated to
sheds, and at the same time encouraged to join savings groups to accumulate adequate capital
to formally register their business. However, informal employment trends are not equal
across different groups—by gender and migration status. More women than men were likely
to be working in informal jobs (48 percent against 28 percent). Many migrants to cities often
find themselves working in the informal sector (which is expanding faster in secondary cities
compared to Addis). The three largest sectors of employment for migrants are trade, domestic
work, and hotels and restaurants; migrants in Addis are slightly less likely than non-migrants
to be found in self-employment.45 Research by the World Bank indicates higher employment
rates for recent migrants than for non-migrants, although male migrants are more likely to
find employment than female migrants.46

24.     Waged employment increases with city size and is primarily formal, while self-
employment is primarily informal, limiting the potential of the demographic dividend.
Even while the scale of informal employment in Ethiopia is smaller than in many other Sub-
Saharan African countries, most employers and associated waged employment are within the
formal sector (Figure 10). Most of those who are self-employed work in the informal
economy and most are young, aged 16 to 45 years old. This matters because international
research suggests that waged employment, not self-employment, leads to the emergence of a
middle class in developing countries. 47 Importantly in Ethiopia, there is a positive
relationship between city size and the share of the labor force in waged employment. This is
encouraging and suggests that as cities grow, their labor force is more likely to be in waged
employment. And as waged employment is not only associated with higher and more stable
incomes48 but also lower levels of poverty, 49 it is good for growth and poverty reduction.

25.     Waged employment growth is lagging in many fast-growing cities. Firms in
emerging cities such as Adwa, Sebeta, and Debre Zeyit (Bishoftu) are the most employment-
intensive. Yet while fast-growing industrial towns such as Nazareth (Adama), Hawassa, and
Mekele attract new firms, these new entrants do not create as many jobs as those in other
cities. Thus, new economic activity in some cities has been associated with less than
commensurate levels of job opportunities.

26.    Evidence from small-scale enterprise surveys suggests that the average firm has
increased in size over time, although to various degrees across regions. Data from the
Survey of Small Scale Manufacturing Industries (2007–08 and 2010–11) indicates that the
average firm in the survey is small, employing around two people—the smallest firms
employ no additional labor, while the largest firms employ between 18 (2007–08) and 27
(2010–11) people.50 There is some evidence that the average small-firm size has increased
from 2007 to 2011, but the changes are not standard across regions; firms in Oromia and
Harar were 10 percent larger in 2011, while those in Tigray and Bensha were much smaller.

27.    Wages grew, on average, by 15 percent across all micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) between 2007–08 and 2010–11, although consumer prices
increased at an average 19.5 percent over the same period.51 The slow increase in wages
seems commensurate with the increasing proportion of informal enterprises within MSMEs
over the period. In 2007-08, 80 percent of MSMEs were informal (around 3.7 percent were
formal, the balance semi-formal), and in 2010, 83 percent of MSMEs were informal, with
only 1.8 percent formal.

28.     Micro and small enterprise (MSE) development is at the heart of the Ethiopian
Government’s urban development strategy for reducing unemployment and poverty.
One way the Government is supporting MSEs is through the Micro and Small Enterprise
Development Agency. With a focus on youth and women, the agency provides a wide range
of support including business development training, equipment, loans, and working premises
for new businesses in clustered areas. The focus on MSE has had a visible impact. According
to the Addis Ababa City Government, over 83,000 MSEs and 74,457 new jobs were created
over 2004/05–2008/09 (AABOFED 2009).52 More recent research, however, indicates that an
uneven economic landscape has been generated, in which MSEs find it difficult to expand to
medium size without further support from the government, partly because many are
“necessity entrepreneurs” engaged in business due to lack of alternative employment
opportunities. 53

29.    These self-employed “necessity entrepreneurs” account for a sizable share of the
urban poor. Interventions that enable them to upgrade to wage employment or more
productive forms of self-employment are essential to building socially sustainable cities.
Simulation exercises suggest that encouraging wage employment by supporting opportunity

51 However, in some regions average wage increases outpaced inflation, including Harar, Somali, and Addis Ababa.

entrepreneurs (who hire others) or reducing inefficiencies in hiring and search costs can
reduce poverty more than general policies that encourage self-employment.

30.     Most sustained job creation is coming from incumbents and not from new firms.
Most industrial waged jobs in urban areas in Ethiopia are created by existing firms (Figure
11). There is much spatial variation in job creation (Figure 12). Cities like Mekele and Adwa
in the north create and sustain employment across different industry-types, including wearing
apparel and nonmetallic minerals. Others, such as Dire Dawa and Harar, create jobs in certain
industries but also destroy jobs in others, leading to net losses (in Dire Dawa) and net gains
(in Harar). The technical annex paper provides an econometric study of the effect of factors
specific to industries (such as intra-industry clustering), versus those common to all industries
within a city (such as infrastructure) on the ability of cities to create and sustain
employment.54

31.    Firms in Ethiopia are less likely to graduate to larger status, possibly because of
misaligned incentives and business environment concerns. Large firms create and sustain
jobs, yet Ethiopia exhibits significantly low rates of graduation from micro to small firm


                                               22

status, and from medium to large firm status.55 Econometric analysis56 conducted as part of
this report suggests that the ability of firms to “gazelle,” or grow rapidly and contribute to
sustained increases in employment, is affected positively by the level of industrial
clustering,57 particularly in smaller cities.58 In addition, high licensing costs negatively impact
growth, particularly for small and medium firms. 59 Ongoing qualitative research work in
Ethiopia seems to illustrate that while entrepreneurs are often provided with multiple
incentives, including access to land and business premises, those that are looking to expand
do not enjoy any benefits.60 This suggests misaligned incentives or a business environment
that isn’t conducive for firm growth and graduation.

32.      In summary, cities are becoming more attractive for people and economic
activity—yet waged and productive job creation is not keeping up. There are two main
reasons for this trend. First, many jobs are being created either in the informal sector or in
self-employment activities, which do not add productive value and tend to stay small. Second,
even when small to mid-size firms are moving to cities, they fail to create commensurate
increases in jobs. This is problematic since the overwhelming evidence shows that it is
primarily waged and formal employment that is associated with the emergence of a middle-
class. Moreover, this analysis has shown that firms are failing to graduate, and the net effect
of low graduation is countries like India and Mexico has been associated with a 25 percent
drop in total factor productivity.61 At the same time, secondary cities are already getting good
at attracting economic activity and seeing the formation of industrial clusters, which should
be further encouraged. Moreover, as we shall see, there are ways the government can also
seek to build a more competitive environment for firm graduation through clustering, access
to infrastructure, and policy aimed at tackling fees and licenses. In addition, research shows
that local governments, with increased administrative remit and commensurate capacity, can
in fact achieve significant progress at the local level, indicating the importance of investments
in urban local government capacity.


2.3          The Infrastructure and Services Gap

33.    Developing infrastructure is one of the key priorities guiding Ethiopia’s
development efforts, and progress has been made over the past two decades in water,

55 Of the total number of microenterprises (employing fewer than 20 employees) within the dataset, only 16 percent become
small (employing 21–50). Fewer still, just 3.34 percent, become medium firms (employing 51 –100), and only 1.51 percent
become large (employing 101–1,000). None graduates to very large status (employing 1,001 or more).
56 See the technical background paper: “Which Cities Create Jobs? Evidence from Ethiopia.”
57 Ali, et al., (2014) look at clustering in Ethiopia and find that it helps smaller firms to overcome obstacles to access finance

and at lower rates, and to supply to larger firms.
58 In other words, intra-industry clustering seems to have a positive effect on rapid firm growth, especially when such

clustering takes place in smaller cities.

discouraging plants from undertaking costly investments. The difficulty of contract enforcement might also make it costly to
hire the skilled managers needed to grow beyond a certain size. Bloom et al. (2011) suggest that the most productive textile
plants in India do not grow beyond 250 employees because they cannot find the necessary mid-level managers that would
allow them to grow further.

sanitation, solid waste management, roads, and access to electricity. Though figures vary,
some data estimate that water supply coverage rose from 70 percent in 1990 to 89 percent in
2009. Official data on sanitation from the Ministry of Health show steep increases in
coverage, in the form of septic tanks and pit latrines, from a baseline close to zero in 1990 to
39 percent in 2009 (30 percent in rural areas and 88 percent in urban areas). Access to
electricity has been growing extremely fast—in the five years prior to 2011 more than
41 percent of towns and villages were connected to the grid, and the number of electricity
consumers grew from 800,000 to more than 2 million.62 Access in urban areas is very high at
86 percent, as compared to an African average of about 65 percent.63

34.      Despite progress, more must be done to satisfy present demand for urban
infrastructure and services. Coverage rates must be further improved for water and
sanitation, especially access to safe water. Ethiopian cities struggle to manage solid waste,
which is often dumped into open areas and endangers health. Ethiopia has one of the most
underdeveloped power systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, though most of these needs are in
rural areas. Ethiopia’s road density is also below the African average but again, road density
is far higher in urban areas than the national average.64

35.     Growth, urbanization, and industrialization are all infrastructure-intensive
processes. African countries lag behind countries in other regions in infrastructure stock and
in its efficient use. Foster and Morella (2011) find that the recent infrastructure buildup in
Ethiopia contributed 0.6 percentage points to annual per capita GDP growth. However, they
also find large scope for infrastructure gains. Scaling up the level of infrastructure to that of a
middle-income country would result in growth acceleration of 3 percentage points.

36.     Most urban households (86 percent) have access to electricity and the sector is
growing extremely fast, though quality of service is low with frequent outages. 65 In the
five years prior to 2011, the number of electricity consumers grew from 800,000 to over
2 million.66 However, Ethiopia still has one of the most underdeveloped power systems in
Sub-Saharan Africa, with an installed generation capacity of less than 10 megawatts
per million population (less than half of the low-income country benchmark). Power
consumption, at 33 kWh per person per year, is similarly about one-third of the low-income
country benchmark. Power outages are frequent, and according to IFC’s Business Enterprise
Surveys, irregular electricity is reported as the third more important business obstacle by
business owners.

37.     The infrastructure challenge is more pronounced in water supply and sanitation,
even without population growth. While some sources indicate high coverage, data also
point to low levels of consumption and access to “safe” potable water. In 2012, for instance,
water consumption in Addis Ababa was around 50 liters per person per day67 and about 44

percent of the population had access to “safe” water supply.68 In the city of Hawassa, the
maximum supply of water is around 40 liters per person per day, 69 with coverage at
80 percent and access to “safe” water supply at 66 percent.70 This level of consumption is
low, even by Sub-Saharan African standards. To meet the present target 71 for full coverage of
100 liters per person per day would require a two - to threefold increase in current water
supply. And, accounting for a tripling of the urban population by 2037, to achieve the same
target would require an increase by many fold to the current level—funded almost entirely by
municipal own-source revenues. The sanitation sector requires even more attention.
Addis Ababa is the only city with a municipal sewerage system, and even this serves only
10 percent of the population. Systems that are already failing to meet present levels of
demand are only going to be stressed further as the country continues urbanizing.

38.     Solid waste collection and disposal services are subpar in most cities in Ethiopia,
with formal collection systems picking up just 45–82 percent of locally-generated waste.
These levels are fairly typical for low-income countries, though collection rates often vary by
neighborhood. Higher-income areas sometimes resort to paying for private collection services
to ensure material is removed regularly. The benefits of systematic collection are clear:
uncollected solid waste left on the roadside creates a visual blight, odor, and vector problems,
and it clogs drainage culverts, exacerbating local flooding. In many cities, cost recovery is a
real problem, contributing to inadequate collection services, because low-income households
may be unable to afford the collection fees. 72 Fee collection can also be problematic in
neighborhoods with informal settlements.

39.     Although urban areas have better access to basic services than rural areas,
urban areas have disparities of access between the poor and non-poor. For sanitation
services, for example, while the 35 percent of the poorest quintile has access to sanitation, the
figure goes up to 57 percent for the wealthiest quintile. The “access” variable also does not
capture differences in the quality of services (e.g. the number of people sharing a pit latrine).
More information on the quality of services is needed to assess the real severity of this
imbalance. Water expenditure represents a heavier burden for the urban poor, who spend a
higher percentage of their income on water than the urban average (2 percent versus
1.4 percent), despite being heavily underserved. In some sectors, however, there is no
significant difference in access between the poor and non-poor, including access to waste
disposal vehicles, suggesting that inadequate waste management stems mainly from the
failure of urban municipalities to deliver the service.

72 There are solutions, however. In Guayaquil, Ecuador, cost recovery for waste services is achieved by a 12 percent

surcharge added to the user’s monthly electricity bill. In Ningbo, China, the municipality is incentivizing communities to
separate their waste into organics, recyclables, and residual waste containers. The municipality saves money by diverting
organics and recyclables from the landfill, and provides a financial reward to each neighborhood residents’ committee, based
on quality and quantity of organics and recyclables separated at the source.

40.     User fees charged for infrastructure services are low and do not cover
operational, capital, and debt-service costs. Ensuring cost recovery through tariffs is
important as it opens possibilities for financing that may otherwise be impossible. Without
cost recovery, there may be no funds remaining for maintenance or new investments. By
contrast, adequate cost recovery can open the door to private investment and take some
burden off public finances. Estimates indicate that US$102 million could be captured each
year for Ethiopia’s infrastructure if its services were priced closer to cost recovery level.73
However, there is also a need to be mindful of the distributional impacts and affordability of
full cost pricing schemes.

41.     Ethiopia’s infrastructure financing gap is considerable (though estimates vary
considerably), with a substantial total spending requirement relative to the national
economy. Ignoring, for a moment, the fact that the existing level of urban infrastructure is
already potentially unable to serve the city’s population, what is the unmet need for urban
infrastructure based solely on urban population growth? For example, in a city of 200,000
with a conservative population growth rate of 4 percent, urban infrastructure would be needed
for 8,000 new residents each year. The cost for this infrastructure need is estimated to be
US$400 per additional resident, so the total annual requirement would equal US$3.2 million
a year—around US$15 per resident, or Br 270. 74 Crucially, this general approximation
ignores the ongoing cost for delivering municipal services and for maintaining, rehabilitating
and replacing existing urban infrastructure as needed. Given the wide range of municipal
services that, in principle, fall under the category of urban development and urban services —
ranging from construction and maintenance of roads, to abattoirs and markets, to the
collection and disposal of solid and liquid waste, to urban water systems—average actual
spending of Br 300 per urban resident (around US$17) would be required merely to maintain
the existing level of services for existing urban residents, let alone meeting the needs of
rapidly increasing urban populations.

42.     Subsidized tariffs undermine the financial health of the utilities or service
providers, and hold back the expansion of services to poorer households, which often
pay much higher prices for alternative services. While subsidized tariffs can be justified
on the grounds of affordability, electricity and piped-water services only reach higher-income
groups in society who could typically afford to pay more for the cost of service. As discussed
further in the Chapter 4, cost recovery can be increased by capturing larger amounts of
finance through both user charges and, for some sectors, community or household
contributions to capital costs (in cash or kind). Subsidies should be explicit rather than
implicit, and a subsidy ceiling should be introduced across sectors to ensure that only basic
levels of service are subsidized.

43.    Absent adequate cost recovery, neglect of maintenance remains a pervasive
problem and imposes a heavy cost on users through the higher costs of the eventual
asset rehabilitation. For instance, Ethiopia’s Road Fund—a dedicated fund for road
maintenance and road safety activities—is financed principally by a fuel levy. While the levy

is not high enough to cover all road maintenance costs,75 the road fund’s creation and the
ring-fencing of funds for maintenance are promising.


2.4         The Housing Challenge

44.     In general, poor housing quality and often overcrowded living conditions are the
major housing shortfalls experienced by Ethiopia’s urban households. An estimated 70–
80 percent of the urban population lives in what might be considered slums, according to a
commonly accepted international definition, because the units lack durability, adequate
space, access to safe water and sanitation, or security of tenure (see Box ).76 This is one of the
highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, and higher than in most Arab countries. 77 Around
80 percent of dwellings in urban areas are made from wood and mud (also known as chika
construction), while two-thirds of all urban housing units have only earthen floors, another
indication of very low-quality housing. 78 (See Table 5). The main drivers of the urban
housing shortage are low incomes, insufficient supply of serviced land, and requirements that
housing units meet unrealistically high and costly standards.




75 The distribution of funds from the Road Fund is about 65 percent to federal road agencies, 25 percent to regional road
agencies, and 10 percent to selected municipalities. Allocations are based on the respective percentage of the total road
network—Addis Ababa, for instance, is allocated more than 50 percent of the municipal budget.

Box 2: Defining formal, informal and slum housing

 Formal housing units are the product of coordinated activity between public and private sectors in
 land, construction, finance and regulation. Formal housing, whether for rent or ownership,
 includes infrastructure and utility connections and comports with local land use and building
 standards. In developed economies, housing formality and conformance with regulatory standards
 allows the property to be better evaluated for collateralization, insurance and taxation purposes.

 By contrast, informal housing consists of dwellings that do not conform to the laws and
 regulations that govern land and buildings (UN-Habitat 2003). In Sub-Saharan Africa, informal
 housing constitutes approximately 75 percent of the entire housing stock (World Bank 2015).
 Across the region, informal housing refers to units that have one or more of the following
 characteristics:

        Peripheral urban location
        Designed and built by owner/occupant with local or adapted materials
        Incremental improvement of structure by the occupant over a period of time.
        Construction finance through personal savings, family contributions or loans from savings
         clubs or informal lenders
        Incomplete conformance with building and land use standards
        Lack of connection to network infrastructure and public services

 Informality covers a continuum of shelter conditions and land tenure arrangements. For example,
 some housing units may be physically durable, though lack building permits or land title, while at
 the other end of the spectrum, housing can be made of scavenged or impermanent materials, and
 present a safety hazard to occupants.

 In addition to housing challenges related to formality, some shelter solutions could be considered
 slums based on international standards. According to UN-HABITAT, housing is considered a
 slum if it lacks one or more of the following:
       Durable housing of a permanent nature that protects against extreme climate conditions
       Sufficient living space (not more than three people sharing one room)
       Easy access to safe water in sufficient amounts at an affordable price
       Access to adequate sanitation (a private or public toilet shared by a reasonable number of
          people)
       Security of tenure that prevents forced evictions
 It is important to note that not all slums are the same, and not all households living in slums face
 the same degree of deprivations.

 Though there may be some overlap between informal housing and slum housing, the two terms
 are not interchangeable. It is possible for housing to be informal but adequate by international
 standards. And in Ethiopia there is a unique situation wherein housing that was built informally
 was later formalized by the government, though it is still considered slums by international
 standards because of poor quality construction or lack of access to basic services.

Note:Figures are not additive, since some households experience multiple deprivations


45.     Renting has been an especially important form of tenure in Ethiopia and nearly
two-thirds of households rent. Most units are rented from private owners. Though reliable
price data is not widely available, a one room unit of about 15-20 square meters (m2) built as
an addition to a private house can rent for 150 Birr per month (see Figure 15 and Figure 16,
below). In addition, some of the rental stock is comprised of “kebele housing”—informal
construction that had been nationalized and now serves as government-managed rental
housing. Kebele housing constituted 24 percent of housing in Addis Ababa in 2007 and
slightly below 20 percent, on average, in all cities.79 Although kebele housing was recognized
as “formal” housing by the government in 1975, it is still often considered slum housing
because of overcrowding and lack of key amenities such as drinking water, sanitation,
cooking facilities, power supply, and waste disposal, and is thus included in the estimated
figure of 70-80 percent of all housing units as slums. 80 Kebele housing rents are highly
subsidized (typically Br 10 per month) and do not adequately cover the cost of operation and
maintenance (O&M),81 thus many units have become shacks. Major renovations by tenants
are not allowed by the kebele councils, and tenants choose not to make other repairs for fear
of increased rents.82 In Addis Ababa, kebele housing remains the primary shelter option for
poor households. Within the administrative boundary, average consumption levels of those
renting kebele housing are 33 percent below those renting in the private market. 83 This
indicates that the city’s poorest are much more likely to benefit from government-supported
rental housing than from the private rental options in the city.

46.    Commercial investment in housing has remained limited for several reasons,
including prevailing land management system. While the high end of the housing market
is served by the private development sector, strict development requirements and high
construction standards make basic formal housing unaffordable for large parts of the urban
population. For example, in one sample-based survey in Abraminch town, 42 percent of

homeowners could not afford a house built to the minimum design standards.84 In another
survey, 59 percent of residents in the informal settlement in Kolfe Keranio in Addis Ababa
identified excessive cost of formal housing standards as the main reason they were
squatting.85 With the exception of Jijiga, which does not outlaw chika housing, in the cities
included in this study, chika houses are not considered formal construction despite frequently
being the only construction type affordable for households. In 2004, the Government initiated
a program to leverage private developers in meeting the housing shortfall, by providing large
amounts of free land. The initiative was canceled one year later citing a variety of issues,
including slow construction, land speculation, and lack of infrastructure, thus serving as
further evidence of the magnitude of problems that arise when land is provided at below its
value, and especially when provided for free or below infrastructure cost recovery.86

47.     A key and urgent priority will be to improve the overall functioning of the
housing market. Rapid urban growth compounds the existing challenge in improving
housing conditions, particularly outside Addis Ababa. With the urban population expected to
triple by 2028, the number of urban households will also triple from about 3 million in 2007
to about 9 million in 202887, making the need for housing even more pronounced88. Growth
in Addis Ababa will only account for 5 percent of new urban household formation through
2037 (Figure 13). Rather, urban areas with the most rapid rate of household formation will be
in Oromia and Amhara. Priority in addressing the two key housing challenges of low quality
and overcrowding, exacerbated by urban population increase, will be developing a sector-
wide approach.

48.     Ethiopian standards for formal housing are unaffordable for large segments of
the urban population. This affordability challenge needs to be addressed by taking a
sector wide approach to housing. In addition to the key affordability challenge for basic
formal housing due to high standards, a related and secondary challenge of affordability is the
government’s focus on housing ownership, which needs modification to benefit the urban
poor better. This is necessitated due to the upfront cost barriers of ownership that make it
unaffordable for many households, particularly those in lower-income groups. These cost
barriers take the form of upfront lease payments, condominium down payments, or
cooperative income/savings requirements.89

49.     The government, as the sole supplier of formal urban land, faces an enormous
financial burden in extending required basic services to those plots. The current system
of providing land below cost recovery for required infrastructure is financially unsustainable
and cannot adequately address deficits in the housing sector. In the past several years the
government has auctioned some land lots for individual homes, allocated land for
condominiums at benchmark prices, allocated some land for cooperatives almost free of
charge, and has directly supported the construction of government condominiums (see Figure
14). (For a detailed discussion of urban land management practices, refer to Section 3.2).

recovery for even the most basic infrastructure (blue)

50.     The federal government, recognizing the significant need to improve housing
conditions, is also implementing an ambitious condominium construction program in
Addis Ababa. The Integrated Housing Development Program (IHDP) began in 2005 and was
revised in 2014. Units are allocated by a lottery and financed via mortgage loans with the
government-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). Loans carry an interest rate of 8.5
percent and terms range from 15 to 20 years. Households earning 1,200 Birr per month or
less (equivalent to the bottom quintile) are eligible for the 10/90 loan, which requires 10
percent down payment and can only be used to purchase a studio. Low-to middle-income
households earning more than 1,200 Birr per month are eligible for the 20/80 and 40/60
loans, requiring 20 percent and 40 percent down payments, respectively. See Table 6 for
more details on unit types and mortgage loans. In Addis Ababa, condominiums are one of the
main sources of supply for the rental market, and as many as 70 percent of beneficiary
households rent their units out, sometimes illegally.90 In the first phase of IHDP, 244,436
units were completed, 170,000 of which were in Addis Ababa. During the current phase of
the program, the government plans to build 50,000 units per year in Addis Ababa., which is
projected to be more than enough to meet new housing demand, currently estimated at 20,000
per year, leaving 30,000 units per year to replace poor quality existing housing. This program
represents an exceptionally strong government commitment to improving housing conditions.

51.    The Integrated Housing Development Program, as currently designed, faces
challenges reaching priority population groups. After the first phase, the program was
suspended in all cities except Addis Ababa due to high costs and slow take-up. Figure 13
shows that only 5 percent of new housing needs through 2037 (calculated as household
formation) will be in Addis Ababa.

52.    Even in Addis Ababa, lower-income households may find even the smallest and
most subsidized condominiums unaffordable. Assuming that total housing costs should not
exceed 30 percent of household income, even a studio with 40 percent down remains

unaffordable to the bottom 10 percent of households.91 This is not likely to be feasible, since
the down payment would be more than ETB 25,000 for households whose total annual
consumption is only ETB 11,628.92 Figure 15 and Figure 16 demonstrate the affordability
gap that persists in the IHDP. For example, the bottom two income deciles are eligible for
the 10/90 program, but the monthly payment is more than 30 percent of household income.93
For the bottom third of households, IHDP condominiums are only affordable if households
select small units, take on high down payments and are able to support high-payment-to-
income ratios. In fact, the 3-bedroom unit is unaffordable for even median households in
Addis Ababa. Aside from high monthly payments, there are other reasons the current
structure of the IHDP may not be a feasible housing solution. Notably, beneficiaries of the
10/90 loan may only purchase studios, even though lower-income households are not
necessarily smaller. It is also important to note that these affordability calculations are based
on unit sales prices, which do not include the cost of land, infrastructure, and other financing
costs (see below).

53.     The IHDP has benefitted a very narrow group of beneficiaries with deep
subsidies. First, due to large implicit subsidies, the costs of the IHDP units are much lower
than those in the private sector. In 2014, the program’s cost was estimated to be 3,142 Birr
per square meter, only one-quarter of the cost of private development. These savings result,
in large part, from not including costs of land, infrastructure, financing, etc., in the IHDP
units’ sales prices. Second, the program has injected a large number of new formal units into
the housing stock, thus reducing the qualitative or quantitative housing shortage in urban
areas. Out of the projected 50,000 units to be delivered per year, 20,000 would meet the rate
of new household formation, 94 while the remainder would go towards addressing unmet
demand from the current housing deficit, overcrowding, and dilapidated units in need of total
replacement. Finally, it is important to note that IHDP, by increasing the total supply of
housing stock in some cities, could potentially lead to lower rental rates, thus improving the
affordability of rental options for some income groups. Because low-income households who
are allocated condominium units often cannot afford the payments, households use them to
generate income by renting them out to higher-income households at market rates.95 In fact,
in Addis Ababa, renters of condominiums are richer than the average resident.96

54.   High levels of implicit and explicit subsidies for condominiums, though they
improve affordability, make the program unsustainable as such subsidies restrict the

94
   This would assume that the effective demand among these new households would permit them to afford these new units. However, this is
unlikely.

ability to scale up and reach a large number of beneficiaries. Sale prices are based only
on direct costs of construction (labor and materials), and do not include land (or its
opportunity cost), infrastructure connections, and other costs including financing, which must
be financed from other sources. The IHDP program was stopped in smaller cities and towns
in 2010 as regional states were unable to repay construction loans. In Addis Ababa the unit
cost of construction for such condominiums has been steadily rising, from Br 1,000
per square meter in 2005 to over Br 3,000 per square meter in 2014.97 The financing of IHDP
includes a complex finance structure that includes a loan from the Central Bank of Ethiopia,
structured as a corporate bond.98 Addis Ababa’s corporate bond obligation as of June 2013
was ETB 10 billion/US$534 million. A more updated figure was not available, nor the exact
proportion of financing for the housing program. However, analysis done using the NBE
Quarterly Bulletins shows that in FY 2013-14, the Addis Ababa city government was
allocated a bond for 6.0 billion Birr, or approximately US$275 million. This significant
amount is equivalent to 30 percent of the municipality’s projected own-source revenues.99
The city’s ability to finance and sustain such a large-scale and subsidy-intensive program
remains questionable.

55.     As a result of the priority given to ownership by the two main government
housing programs (land allocation and condominiums), a large but undefined share of
the urban population across the country looks for housing solutions (usually informal)
either in the private rental sector or by buying land informally from farmers in peri-
urban areas. Thus, promoting a diverse range of housing delivery mechanisms—public
programs, private sector investment, including in small-scale affordable rental housing, and
assistance for upgrading slums and regularizing informal settlements—will be key to meeting
the large and growing housing gap in urban areas. These would provide additional options for
upgrading and improving low quality units within informal settlements. The Addis Ababa
Development Plan of 2002 suggested a diversified set of land and housing delivery
instruments, including not only condominiums and self-help housing, but also land
readjustment, design of realistic pro-poor housing standards, and construction of affordable
rental housing. However, this plan required wide-ranging regulatory, institutional, and
financial adjustments to engage the private sector, which were not enacted.100

56.     Given that the urban population is set to triple from 2007 to 2028, adequately
addressing the housing quality gap in urban areas will be critical. As with jobs,
infrastructure and services, gaps in housing quality, availability and affordability will
influence a city’s attractiveness and productivity. It is also important to note the spatial
mismatch between public investments in housing and the current and future housing needs, as
well as the general lack of affordability for the poorer segments of the population. As such,

98 The “corporate bond” mechanism of financing, entirely underwritten by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, is designed as

an intermediate-term relay loan (which is converted to individual mortgage loans issued by CBE as housing units are
delivered to the winners of the housing draw who meet down payment and the mortgage loan standards of CBE). The
interest rate on the bonds, at 6%, is subsidized, and is therefore not priced for risk. The bonds are fully guaranteed by the
federal government; as a result, CBE has no incentive to carry out any due diligence of the financial capacity of Addis Ababa
or of the Saving Houses Development Enterprise (SHDE) to repay the bonds.

government programs are at odds with the needs of low-income families, particularly in terms
of building standards and the emphasis on ownership over renting, and will need to be
modified.

57.     To conclude, progress has been made in almost all infrastructure sectors, though
from a low base. More data is needed to better understand the extent of the infrastructure and
services gap. Yet in many areas where information is available, Ethiopia is faring poorly
compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is a problem because infrastructure
and services are essential to building a strong business environment in cities, as well as
making them attractive places to live and work. As is the case with employment
opportunities, the challenge of providing infrastructure and services is not just to meet current
levels of demand, but also anticipated demand from rapid and significant increases in the
urban population over the coming two decades. In particular, the government will have to pay
attention to the quality of services rather than just access, while also seeking to improve cost
recovery. The following chapter examines how provision of housing, infrastructure and
services can be improved by better management of urban institutions, particularly with
respect to land management and municipal finance.

3.     Urban Institutions for a Middle-income Ethiopia:
       Land, Governance, and Finance

3.1      Introduction

58.     Driving the gaps in jobs, in infrastructure and services, and in housing are
deficiencies in the underlying urban institutions for land management, municipal
governance, and municipal finance. City systems have to be well equipped to provide for
growing populations. Strengthening urban institutions now while urbanization levels are low
will be essential for urbanization’s success in Ethiopia.

59.     First, land management practices result in insufficiently-serviced land for
people, businesses and public uses, shortages which will only be exacerbated by rapid
urban growth. Land supply mechanisms by the government which rely heavily on
allocation have not been able to meet demand. Cities are expanding outward faster than the
population is growing. This has the potential to further increase the cost of infrastructure and
service delivery while also driving informal development, particularly on the urban fringe,
further from jobs. Outward expansion of cities is driven by: (i) lack of market pricing for
land; (ii) inadequate government supply of land to private (formal) developers; and (iii) in
Addis the IHDP, which often replaces dense chika development with less dense and
unaffordable condominiums, driving new informal settlements to the urban fringe. Moreover,
allocation of land under market value and often below cost-recovery levels results in lost
revenues that could otherwise be used to fund urban development. A complex and costly
system of land management means lease payments fail to provide predictable revenue for
local governments. Finally, land management practices have the potential to constrain rural –
urban migration, which in the long run may harm both urban and agricultural productivity.

60.     Second, the limited authority and capacity of urban local governments (ULGs)
hinders their ability to manage urbanization. Local government institutions set the
foundations for economic growth and city competitiveness. Not only do city leaders help
implement national policies locally, their administrative capacity to do so well can change
outcomes for poorly performing firms. In Ethiopia, city proclamations have endowed city
governments with increasing powers, leading to economic convergence across cities and
falling spatial inequalities. Cities tend to have used their new powers well, by favoring the
growth of a broad base of businesses. Going forward, ULGs could spur job creation with the
right interventions to target the business environment for firms’ growth.

61.    Finally, the system of municipal finance influences the resources available to
local governments as they attempt to provide infrastructure and services to rapidly
growing urban populations. Current financing arrangements rely heavily on municipal
own-source revenues, which are insufficient to fill the gap in urban infrastructure and
services. The majority of intergovernmental fiscal transfers fund salaries and other recurrent
expenditures, leaving limited resources for capital expenditures.

3.2         Land Management

3.2.1        Introduction

62.     In Ethiopia, the Constitution stipulates that land is owned by the people, giving
the government an important role in land management and administration. In urban
areas, the local governments act as the sole suppliers of land, currently through two means:
direct allocation (‘allotments’) and auction. Until 2011, allocation through direct negotiations
also existed. Despite the fact that that recent auctions in all cities clearly indicated high unmet
effective demand for residential and commercial/industrial land, local governments continue
using auctions only for a small fraction of the total land parcels allocated:

      o   6.2% in Addis Ababa during 2011-2013
      o   3.6% in Mekelle, 2012-2013
      o   2.3% in Kombolcha , 2012-2013
      o   2.9% in Bahir Dar in 2013 (though it was planned to auction 24% of the land slotted
          for allocation).
63.    Further, direct allocations take place at “benchmark” prices (which since 2011
have to be set up at the cost recovery level). The benchmark prices continue to be
substantially below market prices. Thus, in 2013, the benchmark prices in a number of cities
(e.g. Bahir Dar, Dessie, Kombolcha) were dozens or even hundreds of times lower than
auction prices, while in cities that already increased the benchmark prices (e.g. Addis,
Mekelle, Hawassa, Sheshemene), the difference was 2 to 7 times lower than auction prices.101
Currently, recipients of the allotment land include government agencies (often with very
generous allocations), social services and infrastructure providers, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and religious organizations, but also condominiums (30% of allotment
land in Addis) and housing cooperatives, large and small industry, urban agriculture, and
sometimes unmistakably commercial properties, such as shopping centers or hotels.

64.    While government plans call for compact development, this will be difficult to
achieve if incentive structures built into institutions of land management are not aligned
with that goal. Several issues stand out that will be discussed in his section:

         Government inability to satisfy demand for land through formal channels (allocation
          and auction) drives informal development;
         In the formal sector, incentives for higher-density development are undermined by
          allocation of land below market value;
         Differences between urban and rural land-rights regimes tend to encourage informal
          development beyond the city boundary, further driving outward expansion; and
         Horizontal expansion of built-up land, along with low-density development,
          undermines the efficiency of urban areas in terms of infrastructure and service
          delivery and increases the cost of housing development.

3.2.2       Land for people, businesses and public uses

65.     As sole supplier of land for formal development, the government has not
provided enough urban land to meet demand for residential or business purposes.
Unsatisfied demand from even the wealthiest urban families and businesses is well illustrated
by land auctions in cities, where the number of bidders has been 12–24 times higher than the
number of plots for residential land and 3–7 times higher than available plots for commercial
land.102 Yet the total need for residential land is much higher than these numbers suggest,
because lower-income people do not take part in these auctions. In its Urban Housing
Provision Strategic Framework, the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and
Construction has called on cities to prepare large amounts of land with infrastructure,
according to structural plans, and to make that land available to condominiums, cooperatives,
enterprise housing, real estate investors, developers and private individuals. However, the
financial and institutional capacity of local governments severely limits their ability to do
this.

66.     Urban land constraints hamper economic development and investment. In 2011,
a substantial share of companies in Ethiopia – about 26 percent - reported that access to land
represents a major or severe constraint to doing business (Figure 17). This is a significant
improvement from the previous survey conducted in 2002, when 57 percent of firms
recognized access to land as a major impediment. However, given that land is a critical factor
of production, the current level of firms’ dissatisfaction with access to land indicates that
economic development and investment are hampered by this factor. Figure 17 also indicates
that several neighboring countries (Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya), along with other countries
in the region (Zambia, Mozambique – which has a public land ownership regime, and South
Africa) have better land access conditions for firms, which contributes in their
competitiveness. Finally, countries such as China, Turkey and the Philippines have
corresponding figures of less than 5 percent of firms, as a result of sustained efforts to
address the access to land challenges they faced.

67.     The current land management system is not delivering enough land for public
uses, including roads and streets. Streets are the lifeblood of cities, connecting people and
places and allowing for the infill of vacant land for the emergence of multiple economic
centers. Aside from mobility, streets are also essential for productivity, quality of life, and
social inclusion. Yet in urban areas of Ethiopia, street coverage and land allocated for
associated infrastructure is low compared to international cities (Figure 18). In central Addis
Ababa, for example, the proportion of land allocated to streets (LAS) is only 13.4 percent.
While this is comparable to some other African cities, it still falls short of the threshold
recommended by UN-HABITAT, at least 20–25 percent.103 Figure 18 also compares LAS
and intersection density for several large cities in Ethiopia. When comparing the city center
with the larger urban area, both measures decrease significantly. Among these cities, Mekele
has the highest LAS and intersection density. Based on satellite imagery from Google Earth,
the city features a dense and complete street grid, with clear distinctions between urban and
rural areas. Addis Ababa’s large urban area extends far along major transport routes, so LAS
falls sharply from the city core to the larger urban area while intersection density remains
high. In Hawassa, the street grid is prominent, though not as dense as that in Mekele. The
urban–rural boundary is also clear; the lower LAS and intersection density are a result of
industrial land use on the city edge.

Ababa with 11 other African cities that have low LAS (below 15 percent). Cities with “moderate” LAS (15–20 percent)
include African cities such as Abuja, Cairo, Casablanca, Harare, and Johannesburg, as well as other developing-country
cities like Chandigarh, Kolkota, Manila, and Mumbai. “Moderate to high” LAS is 20–25 percent, and “high” LAS is above
25 percent.

68.      There are ways to resolve poor coverage of streets and associated infrastructure.
First, the planning process should allocate enough land for streets, which must be extensive
and cover all areas. Planning needs to be focused on people, particularly in the Ethiopian
context where the majority of residents are pedestrians. Therefore, planning needs to take
pedestrians into account, and not simply aim to widen roads for vehicles. Second, streets
should ideally be designed to offer enough intersections to reduce both distance and travel

times. As the chart shows, Addis lags on both land allocated to streets and intersection
density.

3.2.3          Urban Morphology

69.     Prevailing practices of land management not only cause constrained land supply,
but also lack incentives for high utilization of existing formal land supply resulting in
low-density, spatially fragmented development and limited mixed use development.
This further increases the challenges of supplying infrastructure. Moreover, if the resulting
character of the built environment results in areas without necessary densities, this may affect
economic efficiency. There are three main ways in which incentives inherent in the
prevailing system of land management produce unintended consequences for urban
development, each of which will be addressed in turn in the sections below:

         Land management practices undermine government policy that seeks to promote
          compact and efficient urban form, while also contributing to the expansion of
          informal development;
         These practices are expensive for local governments; and
         Lack of rural land rights act as a constraint on rural–urban migration, which has the
          potential to slow economic growth.

70.     Urban areas can be defined and characterized by several means, including the
extent and shape of continuous built-up areas, their compactness or fragmentation,
density of physical structures or investments (such as roads), and the mix or intensity of
land use. Global evidence shows that urban areas rarely fall neatly within an administrative
boundary.105 However, it is important to note that urban character is strongly influenced by
market forces, local planning practices and regulations, and investments in infrastructure,
among other drivers. Perhaps the key drivers in determining the shape, size and character of
an urban area are the prevailing land management practices. The following section outlines
some specific land management practices in Ethiopia, and highlights their impacts on urban
areas (particularly in Addis Ababa).

71.      The practice of allocating land below market prices removes incentives for
higher-density planning and development, leading to economic underutilization of
urban land. Entities that have obtained land for free or at below-market prices do not have
any stimulus to use land prudently and frugally. These entities include government agencies
and enterprises, social services, infrastructure providers, non-governmental organizations,
religious organizations, large and small industry, urban agriculture, and sometimes
unmistakably commercial properties such as hotels. Condominiums in Addis Ababa have
been major recipients of cheap land, which unsurprisingly boosted consumption of land per
unit, from about 50 m2 in 2003–04 to 110 m2 on average, in 2005-2011. This has resulted in a

urban extent falls within the relevant administrative boundary; of the 21 urban agglomerations in Indonesia with a population
over 1 million, only 4 are contained within a single administrative boundary. Source: Chandan Deuskar, Mapping a Decade

great increase in the cost of housing production and/or off-budget subsidies provided by the
Government in terms of the opportunity cost of land.106

72.      In the formal sector, inappropriate lot size regulations incentivize low-density
development and affects the affordability of land and housing. Large minimum lot
sizes107 for residential and commercial use, coupled with limitations on land plot coverage
and building heights, discourage high-density formal multi-family inhabitation within any
given formal plot, making formal land and housing unaffordable for many residents. This
results in a trend of horizontal, low-density urban expansion.

73.     In addition, the fact that the government is the sole supplier of land has resulted
in a number of unintended negative social, economic, and spatial consequences. Land is
an important input in housing production and constraints on land tenure rights and transfers
increase the cost of housing. The inability to satisfy demand for affordable land through
formal channels leads to a growing number of informal settlements in many if not most
Ethiopian cities. Informal development in and of itself, is not necessarily bad. As highlighted
previously in the housing section, in Ethiopia, informal settlements are broadly a response to
high and costly standards, and limited access to formal land. It remains the only alternative
for large portions of urban populations in the country. Informal development becomes a key
challenge when structures lack access to basic services and when insecure tenure means
households do not have incentives to improve top structures over time. Current land
management practices in Ethiopia and the government being the sole supplier of urban land,
further encourage informal housing development which exhibits these characteristics and
exacerbates the associated challenges. It also presents a challenge for the government as it is
more expensive to provide basic services to this type of development.

74.     Informal settlements, mostly with very limited access to basic services and poor
living conditions, are growing, including on the periphery of Addis Ababa. Specifically,
mud construction (typically the most affordable housing option for low-income families, but
commonly defined as slums based on overcrowding and infrastructure availability) makes up
almost 80 percent of all housing stock in urban areas.108 This is occurring even in cities that
are actively trying to regularize informal settlements. The case of Dire Dawa illustrates this
dynamic. 109 In 2011, the city had 10,040 informally constructed houses, and the city
administration embarked on a program of pro-active regularization, resulting in 7,000 houses
being regularized. However, by 2014, the city still had more than 10,000 informal houses,
because new informal settlements continued to emerge.

75.    It is important to note that informal settlers in Ethiopia are not necessarily poor.
Many researchers point out that they also include middle class households relocating from
congested dilapidated central areas of cities and building good-quality housing outside



106 According to the data of the Integrated Housing Development Project Office of Addis Ababa.
107 In Addis Ababa the minimum residential lot size for which a building permit can be issued is 150 m² for individual
buildings, and 75–96 m² for attached buildings. The minimum lot size for a business is 250 m². In Hawassa, the minimum lot
size for any residence is 200 m², and in Jimma three types of lot sizes are prepared for residential use: 140, 170, and 200 m².

cities. 110 On the demand side, this process is fueled by a shortage of land for formal
development. There is strong unmet demand for land from people of all levels of income, the
poor in particular, but also from businesses. The government, holding a monopoly on land
supply, yet constrained by limited capacity and financial resources, has not been able to
satisfy the demand for land supplied with the required basic services. Simply put, for many
people, there is no place to turn to except to informal settlements due to limits on the
circulation of land available for development, which drives up the cost to build and purchase
housing.

76.     Moreover, because of the split between urban and rural land rights, incentives
exist for informal development outside the city boundary. As soon as previously rural
territory is planned for urban expansion, its inhabitants become the subject of “default”
expropriation, with compensation only in cases where they have legal rights to the land, and
at prices that are many times lower than farmers can fetch on the informal market. This
incentivizes many rural residents on the urban fringe to preempt such processes and
subdivide and sell the land, helping to satisfy demand for land and housing not met through
formal channels within the city and further encourages the expansion of informal settlements.

77.    Supply of land for informal settlements is provided mainly by farmers who have
strong financial incentives to sell land informally. Indeed, often the only other option
farmers have is to wait until the government expropriates their land for official urban
development, given that there is no policy and no legal mechanism to convert rural land
holding rights into urban rights when land is slotted for development. However, available
data indicates that prices on the informal market are substantially higher than compensation
for expropriated land, strongly incentivizing informal sales (see Table 7).

78.     It is important to recognize that using land for informal development and
consequent sales is a much larger dynamic than farmers’ land sales alone. In fact, this is
a complex and diverse industry, which includes, in addition to farmers, informal developers,
squatters, and various secondary transactions with older informal plots (see Table 8).

79.      In sum, the land system and the government’s inability to service that land with
the required basic infrastructure (because benchmark prices fetched are below land
delivery costs), and powerful forces of demand and supply, new development is being
channeled into informal urbanization. The longer the demand for formal urban land
remains substantially unmet, the higher the cost for providing basic services, as informal
settlements are known to be expensive to upgrade with proper roads and infrastructure. If
China, with its strong commitment to public ownership of land, is any example, conversion
of rural land into public urban land can follow a different approach. In the case of China,
first, land rights of farmers were substantially improved and made similar to urban rights by
the introduction of land lease rights for rural land. Second, China experiments intensively
with allowing peri-urban villages to supply land for urban development.112

80.     As a result of the unintended incentives for low-density formal development and
the growing informal settlements which mostly lack basic services and infrastructure,
total built-up areas are expanding in Addis Ababa as well as in secondary cities. In
Addis Ababa, the built-up area of the total urban agglomeration envelope is expanding
horizontally such that the boundaries no longer reflect the true urban extent. Figure 19 shows
land that was developed from 2007 to 2014 (in blue), much of which is on the fringe of the
existing built-up area (in yellow) and just outside the administrative boundary. Figure 20
further classifies open and built-up land in the urban area. The core 113 of the urban
agglomeration envelope (both built-up area and urbanized open space) now extends more
than 50 kilometers across. From 2006 to 2013, this core grew by 59 percent, and captured
open space114 increased by 162 percent. Today, a more compact and less fragmented form of
this urban core could fit in a circle with a radius of only 9 kilometers—well within the
administrative boundary. Secondary cities are also experiencing rapid horizontal expansion
Commonly, planned increases of designated urban areas are based on overly high land
consumption practices for added territories and have resulted in planned increases for some
cities of as much as 2.3–6.2 times the city’s current territory,115 often including more land
than is needed to accommodate actual population growth. This boundary expansion is based
on a common perception of a shortage of development land inside cities, although this is not
necessarily the case, as satellite imagery reveals.

81.     Land consumption is growing faster than the urban population in Ethiopia,
though this was not always the case. From 1994 to 2007, the population of Addis Ababa
grew by 30 percent. Over roughly the same period, the extent of Addis Ababa’s total urban
core, or “agglomeration envelope,” increased just 19 percent. Put differently, for every
1 percent increase in population, the urban extent only increased 0.63 percent. However, from
2007 to 2014, the population of Addis Ababa increased 17 percent, while its urban extent
increased 51 percent—nearly three times as fast. At the former rate of expansion, by 2028 the
urban extent of Addis Ababa would increase only 25 percent, from 325 to
406 square kilometers, but at the latter rate it would more than double, to 777
square kilometers (the two scenarios are presented in Figure 21).While Ethiopia’s land
consumption can increase as the country develops, especially as incomes increase, the extent
of this horizontal expansion and the character of the urban form can have important effects on
the efficiency of the urban form in terms of infrastructure and service provision.

82.     As land consumption outpaces the rapid population growth, densities will decline
with serious implications for service delivery, as recognized by the government’s
“Compact City” plans. In Addis Ababa, from 2007 to 2014, the average density of built-
up areas of declined from 146 persons per hectare to 136. 116 As shown in Figure 22,
although density increased at the city center, it decreased in the built-up areas 4–
14 kilometers from the center. In addition to the factors mentioned above, lower densities
also arise from the replacement of kebele housing with new government-supported
condominium development concentrated in more distant locations. In 2012, residential land
use constituted one-quarter of all built-up area within the administrative boundaries, but more
than half of land newly built-up since 2006. This type of overwhelmingly single-use, lower
density development comes at the expense of other uses like infrastructure. It also has the
potential to undermine the economic efficiency of the city, if jobs are primarily located in the
urban core rather than the periphery, and the dominant commuting direction is toward the
center, and if there is an absence of transport links between peripheral urban nodes.117

Box 3: The relationship between income and land consumption per capita
 As Ethiopia moves toward middle-income status, one would expect per capita land consumption to
 increase. Global evidence suggests that growing urban populations and rising incomes are likely to lead
 to an expansion in urban land consumption. Cities in countries with higher incomes tend to have lower
 densities, and a doubling of income per capita is associated with a 40 percent decline in average
 density.2

 This trend is already becoming apparent in Ethiopia: from 2007 to 2014 GNI per capita increased from
 US$220.0 to US$470.0, as the density of built-up land fell from 146 to 136 persons per hectare.
 However in some instances the trend has been reversed. In East Asia for example, despite rapid
 population growth from 2000 to 2010, urban areas became slightly denser on average (from 5,400 to
 5,800 people per square kilometers). Except for China, 92 percent of urban areas in the region became
 more dense.3 Global research has shown that land use regulations and the broader regulatory
 environment, more than income or population growth, have a profound influence on city form and
 economic efficiency.4

83.     Uncontrolled horizontal expansion of urban areas is not inevitable, especially
with proactive government management. Several factors influence the extent to which
increasing urban populations lead to increasing land consumption. The way that land markets
function will be critical in determining the future spatial form of urban areas. Targeted
interventions to improve land management practices have the potential to better shape urban
form such that provision of infrastructure and services for growing populations becomes a
less expensive and daunting challenge.

84.     The challenges of rapid horizontal expansion at lower densities, combined with
of a lack of mixed uses, have been recognized by the government in its master plan
documents.119 As noted in Chapter 2, cities are already struggling to finance and maintain
infrastructure and services, with systems of municipal finance and urban governance already
stretched (Section 3.3 and 3.4). Expanding these services to cater for a threefold increase in
the urban population, and the associated horizontal expansion of urban areas, will be hugely
challenging. Data from California (Box 2) demonstrates the cost savings that can be realized
from denser development. This is well understood by the Ethiopian government, which has
already begun to incorporate a vision for “compact city” development in the new master plan
for Addis Ababa. This will involve density targets for certain urban areas over 10 years, land
use regulations to help meet these targets, and investment plans with phasing and
prioritization.

85.      Many Ethiopian cities have vacant or underused land in prime locations, which
could be leveraged for denser and more contiguous development in existing urban
areas. One outcome of a lack of market valuation of land, alongside government inefficiency
in bringing land to market, is that undeveloped land often constitutes a high proportion of
total city territory: about 46 percent in Addis Ababa and Mekele, 25 percent in Bahir Dar,
77 percent in Dessie, and 32 percent in Hawassa.120 Figure 23 shows large amounts of vacant,
buildable land within the administrative boundaries of Addis Ababa, which could be
developed. Extrapolating from the current population densities of built-up areas in these 10
districts, the vacant, buildable land has a potential capacity of nearly 800,000 households. As
shown, Addis Ababa has already developed a large proportion of its vacant land near the city
center, but much land is still available within the administrative boundaries.

86.     Moreover, several cities report that government agencies hold excessive land. In
Dire Dawa for example, around 57 hectares are held by 18 government bodies. There is much
potential for such vacant and underused land to be redeployed for development, and some
cities are already taking steps in this direction. Hawassa, for instance, has identified and



119 Addis Ababa and the Surrounding Oromia Special Zone Integrated Development Plan Project Office, Integrated
Development Plan for Ethiopian Renaissance. The plan notes, in particular, the following: fragmented, unstructured city
centers; no hierarchical polycentric arrangement of urban centers; concentration of activities in one location attracting one
directional flow; radial orientation with no alternative route to the peripheral settlements; inefficient land use with low
density; and leapfrog-type development in the north and southeast where the built-up area on the periphery is not entirely
contiguous with the city core.
120 This undeveloped land includes greenery/open space/protected areas, urban agriculture, forests, water bodies, and land

labeled as having a “special function,” which includes vacant land, military camps, and reservoirs. These data are from urban
planning materials, not satellite imagery, and in reality some of these territories are most likely occupied by informal
settlements. A further case study of Bahir Dar in 2013 demonstrated that in the central part of the city alone, 54 percent of
the territory was vacant.

released underused government land for development, while the latest plans for Addis Ababa,

121With political support from the regional government, the city government of Hawassa negotiated release of about
120 hectares of the underused land in the city center, previously held by federal and regional government agencies such as
the Hawassa Agricultural Development Enterprise, Hawassa University, Water Resources and Energy Bureau, Bureau of
Agriculture, and a private company Bekele Mola Hotel. This land is now earmarked for development, including housing.
Another 600 hectares were reallocated for an airport.

Box 2: Reducing infrastructure costs by promoting smart growth in California

 By 2050, California is expected to grow from 38 million to nearly 60 million people, with
 24 million jobs. Based on the calculations from the Rapid Fire (Calthorpe Associates)
 model—which estimated the different impacts of current low-rise single-use development
 (“Business as Usual” versus mixed use, denser, and transit-oriented development (“Smart
 Growth”) in California in 2050—smart growth will lead to improvements in emission
 reductions, land consumption, infrastructure capital and maintenance costs, fuel use and costs,
 building energy and water use and costs, and tax revenues (see box table). “Growing smart,”
 where the state would see an increased proportion of urban infill and compact growth, would
 lead to 3,750 square miles of land saved; US$32 billion saved (cumulative) in infrastructure
 capital costs; US$15 billion saved in O&M costs of infrastructure; and 200 MMT of CO2e
 reduced emissions per year.2

87.    This section has shown how prevailing patterns of urban form—and their
associated challenges—are intricately linked to the underlying practices of land
management. The government has been unable to satisfy demand for land, leading to
informal development, particularly on the urban periphery. In Addis, allocation of land at
below-market value, combined with large lot-size regulations, has led to a decline in density
even as the urban population increases. The resulting horizontal expansion of urban areas, in
Addis and secondary cities, exacerbates the challenges of providing infrastructure and
services described in Chapter 2, with potential implications for economic efficiency. The
good news is that proactive governmental management of land, as outlined in Chapter 4, may

                                                    56
Section 3: Urban Institutions for a Middle-Income Ethiopia: Land, Governance, and Finance




help to mitigate some of these trends and thereby avoid locking into inefficient urban forms
as cities continue to grow.

3.2.4         Costs to Government

88.    Beyond their spatial implications, land management practices also come with
costs to government. The land management system can prove expensive for local
governments—already financially stretched and struggling to provide adequate services—as
manifested primarily through:

         Forgone revenues due to allocating land below market value (or even just below cost
          recovery), which could otherwise be used to pay for further infrastructure
          development; and
         Administrative costs due to the complexity of the land leasing system.

89.     Land has an inherent value. The value of land in urban and peri-urban areas
depends on many factors, primarily its location, availability of public and private amenities,
and security of property rights. 122 Therefore, when people sell or rent their houses or
condominiums in Ethiopian cities, the prices they fetch implicitly include the value of land; a
condominium in a central location realizes a much higher price than a similar one on the
periphery. However, as said, the Urban Land Development and Management Policy and
Strategy virtually states that the market value should not be recognized either when land is
allocated in urban areas or when compensation is provided for expropriation.123

90.     By allocating land below market value, the government systematically deprives
itself of revenues that could be used for financing infrastructure. Auctions accounted for
only 2 to 6 percent of land allocations in 2013 in the cities studied,124 even though recent
auctions indicate high unmet effective demand for residential and commercial/industrial
land.125 Instead, governments continue to allocate land through non-competitive allotments at
administratively established benchmark prices. Since 2011, according to the new land lease
proclamation, benchmark prices should be at least at a cost-recovery basis, however, this
requirement apparently is not universally followed.126 In Addis Ababa in 2013 alone, forgone
revenues from allocating land to condominiums at benchmark prices are estimated to be
equivalent to at least 147 percent of the total city budget. The practice also provides large

122 According to a universally accepted notion, the market value of real property is the most probable price that can be
expected when the property rights are transferred in a voluntary typical transaction between a seller and a buyer, after the
property is exposed in the open market for a sufficient time.

Background Paper (World Bank, 2014).
126 Thus, in 2013, some cities were continuing to auction land with very low benchmark prices (17 – 31 birr/m2), which can

hardly be at the cost-recovery level. Moreover, the latest policy and strategy documents, such as Urban Land Development
and Management Policy and Strategy (Second Edition, 2013) and Urban Housing Provision Strategic Framework (First
Edition, 2013), both by the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction, seem to conflict with the cost
recovery idea, as they state that land for housing should be provided at low cost for massive programs such as government-
and enterprise-supported housing, housing cooperatives and for housing for low-income households in general.

indirect subsidies to recipients of free or administratively priced land. However, allocating
land below its market value has been the policy of the government.

91.     Moreover, lack of institutional capacity for financial management leads to
inadequate cost recovery from land allocation and land leases. No mechanism was
created to monitor whether revenues from land allocations at benchmark prices recovered the
costs of land acquisition, infrastructure provision, and land release. Since 2011, the federal
government has required that the benchmark prices for land allocations be set to recover
costs, and local governments in Addis Ababa, Hawassa, Mekele, and Shashemene have
increased their benchmark prices quite steeply. However, even in 2013, Bahir Dar, Dessie,
and Kombolcha continued to allocate land at low benchmark prices, apparently below cost
recovery.127

92.     Cost recovery is also an issue with urban expansion through expropriation. Since
2011, the law has required that expropriated land be equipped with the necessary
infrastructure before it can be allocated for formal construction, but local governments have
expressed concern that they do not possess the financial resources to do this. Estimates for
Assosa, Bahir Dar, Hawassa, Kombolcha, Mekele, and Shashemene suggest that the
expropriation cost of the land needed to accommodate population growth, with the cost of
basic roads, would consume up to 260 percent of total city budgets.128

93.    In stark contrast to Ethiopia, rapid urbanization in China—despite well-known
problems—has been largely paid for by government land revenues. Governments in
China auction urbanized land and use the market value to pay for all the costs of
urbanization, leaving a substantial surplus for other public purposes (Box 3).

Box 3: A Fact Sheet: Chinese Experience with Urban Land Allocation and Cost Recovery

  From 2001 to 2012, the share of government land allocated annually through competitive
  procedures (versus direct allocation) fluctuated but stayed high at 47–79 percent of the total
  allocation.
  Income from competitive allocation of land, as a share of total income from allocation, grew from
  57 percent in 2004 to 96 percent in 2012.
  Income from land allocation always recovered the costs of land acquisition and produced a profit,
  though it declined from 44 percent in 2008 to 22 percent in 2012. The costs of land acquisition
  include compensation to farmers and their resettlement, subsidies to other dwellers on the
  expropriated land, the cost of land preparation (infrastructure and parcelization), and land
  administration costs.
  Local governments use profits from land allocation for urban construction, subsidized housing,
  reserve funds, farmland development, and rural infrastructure, etc.

94.      Additional costs to local governments are imposed by the complexity of land
management in Ethiopia. Local governments have several sources of land and property-
related revenues, of which land leases and payment for “rent” (land permits) tend to be the
largest. However, the urban land leasing system is far more complex, in both legislation and
practice, than most land-leasing systems elsewhere in the world. This is true of three features
in particular: the structure of lease payments; 129 interest charged on the unpaid part of a
lease; 130 and lack of standardized lease payment terms. 131 Managing this leasing system
effectively is nearly impossible with the limited capacity of local governments.

95.     These issues are aggravated by the fact that the structure of lease revenues
incentivizes upfront payments rather than annual payments over the life of the lease.
Cities are heading into a future where they will hold leases that do not generate revenues for
30–40 years.132 Moreover, local governments often lack the capacity to properly track lease
payments and, by extension, to budget for the future. For instance, while numbers of active
land leases and land permit holders can be in the thousands or tens of thousands even in
secondary cities,133 unified fiscal cadasters are rare, which limits local governmental ability to
improve revenue collection. In some cities, even payee lists do not exist, so basic indicators
such as a collection or coverage rate cannot be monitored.

96.     In sum, there is significant potential for the government to finance urban
development through land values (while maintaining the ownership of land by
Ethiopian people) —yet proactive steps are needed. In contrast to countries like China,
Ethiopia is missing the opportunity to pay for infrastructure and service provision through
land revenues. Not only are cities foregoing revenues by allocating land below real economic
value (which, as mentioned above, has been the government policy), they are also failing to
recover costs from allocation and expropriation, exacerbated further by the administrative
costs of complex land lease systems. Options for moving towards a more sustainable model
of urban land management are highlighted in Chapter 4.

3.2.5          Constraints on Rural–Urban Migration

97.  In addition to being costly and driving potentially inefficient urban forms, land
management practices also impact rural-urban migration. Rural–urban migration rates in



129 Lease payments are defined by three parameters: the total lease value over its lifespan; an upfront payment at the start of
the lease (which should not be less than 10 percent of the total lease value, according to the federal proclamation); and the
number of years over which the remaining amount would be paid (in equal installments). Correspondingly, selection of lease
auction winners is defined not by the highest price offered for the lease but rather by a weighted combination of two or three
parameters. For example, in the Amhara Region and Addis Ababa, an 80 percent weight is assigned to the highest amount
offered, and 20 percent to the amount of the upfront payment.
130 The government has attempted to charge interest on the unpaid part of a lease since 2002, while other cities with high

administrative capacity, such as Hong Kong SAR, China, have abandoned the practice due to its complexity.
131 This is the case even within the same city and for the same land use (e.g. residential). For example, auctions in Hawassa

in 2013 resulted in leases where the lease payment varied from 3 to 50 years for residential land, and from 15 to 50 years for
commercial land.

Ethiopia are lower than one might expect.134 Migrants are attracted to cities given their better
infrastructure, access to services, and job opportunities. However, Ethiopian society is still
predominantly rural and migration rates are lower than in many other countries.135 Given the
positive returns to migration, this points to obstacles or constraints.136

98.     The system of land management is one such constraint. Lacking secure land tenure
rights, most households maintain the use right of their land allotment by continuing to farm,
providing adequate care to the land, and remaining a resident in the kebele. There are only
limited opportunities for transfer of land rights in rural areas. Recent policies have promoted
household land security by permitting land transfers to family members, yet transfers outside
the family are rare.137 Regulations prohibiting the sale of land, loss of land rights for those
who leave rural areas, and registration requirements for new migrants all combine to
undermine the desirability of moving to the city. 138 This is similar to China, where
comparable restrictions on sales of land rights have acted as barriers to migration.

99.     Constraints on rural–urban migration may well hinder economic development in
both rural and urban areas. Urbanization needs to be deftly managed: too quick and it can
place a strain on local government capacity to provide jobs and services (already apparent in
Ethiopia); too slow and it can undermine productivity in the industry sector by holding back
agglomeration and scale economies in cities, while limiting labor productivity in agriculture
by inhibiting the incentive to invest.139 Finding the right balance will be a key challenge for
Ethiopian policymakers.

100. While facing various land issues during its urbanization process, Ethiopia is not
alone. Countries with similarly large land holdings by government have many land issues
very similar to Ethiopia, as Box 4 below illustrates. This also implies that Ethiopia can learn
from approaches taken by these countries to tackle their land problems (Box 8).

Box 4: Other countries have land issues similar to Ethiopia

                                 Massive informal housing
    China has “urban villages” built informally by former farmers on the portion of their
collective land that was zoned for dwellings. Such villages are built within newly urbanized
areas and are a product of a dual rural-urban land tenure system. “Urban villages” are un-
planned developments, have narrow driveways, not enough public spaces, and
overcrowded buildings, but provide basic infrastructure such as water, electricity, phone
lines, and natural gas. They are also often well-located close to employment centers. The
“villages” emerged as a market response to demand for affordable rental housing for fast-
growing urban populations which the government was nunable to satisfy with its monopoly
on land supply for formal development. For example, in Shenzhen in 2000, about 2.15
million people lived in “urban villages,” out of the total of about 9 million (Yan SONG,
2007); in Guangzhou, around 70 percent of migrants and 40 percent of the total urban
population are living in “urban villages” (Urban China, 2014). The duality of rural and
urban land rights has major efficiency and equity issues and is considered as “the most
damaging structural flaw in China’s entire housing and urban system” (Renaud, 2014).

    Greater Cairo, Egypt. At least 63 percent of the Greater Cairo population lives in
informal settlements, built without planning or permits, mainly on territories still zoned as
agricultural land, but built up long ago, starting in the 1950s. Over time, while the housing
remains informal, utility authorities provide basic services, such as metered electricity,
potable water, and sometimes sewerage (Sims, 2010).

    The Balkan countries. As of 2011, the share of informal housing in the Balkans was
estimated to range from 25% of the total housing stock (Croatia) to 40% (Albania and
Serbia) (NALAS, 2011). Informal construction was caused mainly by two factors: (i)
effective absence of urban planning/construction permit systems that would respond to
natural needs for new construction, caused mainly by the chaos after disintegration of
former Yugoslavia and local wars in 1990s; and (ii) over-demanding land use and building
norms, when the countries started to function again, which pushed a lot of new construction
and building alterations into the informal sector as non-compliant with the new norms.

Allocating land at administrative prices that are below market value or even below
the cost to government

    Egypt has universally practiced land allocation at low administrative prices or for free.
For example, in 2005, a price for serviced industrial land in two new towns was set up as
LE 95 per square meter (m2), while the market value was LE 400-500 per m2, and the cost
of infrastructure alone was LE 180 per m2 (Wahba et al., 2005). Similarly, the Tourism
Development Agency’s (TDA), which controls land along the Red Sea’s coastline had been
applying “one size fits all” approach by offering beach-front land for US$1/m2, regardless
of the potential market value of these sites. No estimates of the market value of sites prior
to this give away were required or conducted, and hence, it is not known how much
potential income the state has forgone or the value of windfall profits to land developers or
buyers of properties on these lands. Also typical in Egypt is that land, after being allocated,
is held in long-term leases for extremely low payments. In particular, in Cairo, social
organizations (e.g. clubs) have held large sites in prime locations for symbolic payments.

Inefficient use of valuable urban land by government entities

    Mumbai Port Trust, India. The Mumbai Port Trust holds 808.92 hectares of land in
an economically prime location. Only 423.91 hectares (52% of the total) are used for port
operations, and the rest is either vacant or abandoned or leased out on an ad hoc basis,
often at rental rates that are outdated and dramatically below current market levels. The
Trust’s land operations are not transparent. According to Peterson and Thawakar (2013), if
only 200 hectares of the Trust’s land could be managed for its economic value, this land
would have a value of roughly US$25 billion and could produce revenues that would help
finance important parts of Mumbai’s needed infrastructure.

Low-density urban sprawl resulting in limited infrastructure

    Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. About 69 percent of the entire built up area of Ulaanbaatar is
low-density ger area development, with plots for individual housing (on average, 580 m2
of land) allocated often without reserving enough spaces for public uses (streets, schools)
and without infrastructure. The cost of providing modern infrastructure to such large, low-
density areas or retrofitting them is prohibitively high, especially given that the land was
allocated for free and is essentially untaxed (Brhane at al., 2015).

3.3         Limited Capacity and Authority of Local Governments

3.3.1         Introduction

101. The Ethiopian governance structure has three main tiers—federal, regional, and
local. The Constitution, adopted in 1994 and formally promulgated in 1995, recognizes and
assigns powers, functions, and revenues between the first two tiers: the federal government
and the nine “regional states140.” In addition, two cities -Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa- are
each chartered by federal proclamations (laws) and are treated similarly to state-level
governments in some respects. Regional states have their own constitutions and are typically
subdivided into administrative zones, which is a de-concentrated territorial level.

102. Local governments, as the third tier, are established by regions according to
their own Constitutions and governance structures. Notwithstanding minor variations, the
most prevalent local government structures are woredas (in rural areas), and urban local
governments (ULGs) – also referred to as City Administrations (Figure 24). While the
Constitution falls short of recognizing the local government level, or providing constitutional
rights or protections to ULGs, each regional government has adopted city proclamations that
specify the cities’ powers and responsibilities.

in some regions (such as SNNP state), the zonal level is more relevant than in other regional states. In SNNP, the zones have
elected councils, just as Amhara regional state has some special ethnic zones with councils.


103. City administrations/ULGs and woredas (or rural local governments) are semi-
autonomous local government entities, with legal status as corporate bodies with their own
political leadership (council) and their own budget. ULGs and woredas are overseen by their

respective councils, whose members are directly elected to represent each kebele (ward)
within their jurisdiction. ULGs have the right to collect municipal taxes and revenues and the
mandate to undertake an extensive list of municipal and state functions, the latter under
delegation from their regional governments.

104. Besides ULGs, most woredas have at least one, occasionally multiple, urban areas
designated as municipalities. These entities 141 usually collect municipal revenue and
undertake some municipal functions, although much more limited than ULGs. Municipalities
within woredas plan for various development activities. Differently than ULGs, however,
their budgets have to be approved by the wider woreda council. Of the 1,525 urban
settlements in Ethiopia, 140 have been granted status as ULGs by Regional City
Proclamations as of March 2015. The remaining 1,385 municipalities/towns —small
settlements with populations mostly below 20,000 people — do not have the ULG status and
function under the authority of woredas.142

105. ULGs are central to the country’s governance system. ULGs are responsible for an
extensive list of public service delivery functions, including those which they are responsible
for executing on behalf of their regions (see Box 57). Yet, although Ethiopia’s
intergovernmental system has features that resemble those in many other federal policies, it
has unique features in its public sector suggesting that ULGs are less autonomous than those
in federal systems in more industrialized countries. The rest of this section presents some of
these features as they relate to urbanization.




141 Legislation in the nine regions each define urban areas within woredas with varying terminology, which includes “lead
municipality”, “sub-municipality”, “metropolitan town” or “emerging/developing town” (generally a rural area that is in
transition to being formed as a municipality). There are no specific written criteria for these (and some other) definitions of
urban areas within woredas – or in the case of some regional governments, even ULGs/city administrations. Recognizing the
need for providing guidance to regions for a more consistent approach to classification of urban administrations, the Ministry
of Urban Development, Housing and Construction Operation and Maintenance (MUDHCo) launched an exercise called
“Good Urban Governance Institutionalization, January 23, 2015.”

Box 5: Ethiopian Local Governance Framework

 State constitutions and proclamations define regional-local relationships. Although the
 federal constitution only formally establishes two government levels, in practice, Ethiopia is a
 federal state with three main government levels: federal, regional and local. In accordance with
 the Constitution, each regional state has adopted a proclamation establishing its local government
 structure.

 In this report, local entities below the regional level will generally be referred to as local
 governments. The terms urban local governments (ULGs) or city administrations - used
 interchangeably in Ethiopia - will be used to refer to the main urban jurisdictions, which are
 typically recognized as district-level local governments. ULGs are centers of economic and social
 activity, and play a special role in the economic and social development and transformation of the
 country.

 History of ULG dual responsibility. Under the previous regime (and under the imperial rule
 which preceded it), municipalities were semi-autonomous local governments, which were legally
 separate from the deconcentrated local offices of the state at the local level. Under this system,
 deconcentrated structures provided state functions, while municipalities delivered only municipal-
 type services (i.e. solid waste, urban roads…etc). As part of the decentralization reforms (2000 to
 2003), these two separate organizations at the local level were integrated, providing both state and
 municipal functions. As a subsequent step, in 2010, municipal budgets and deconcentrated local
 state budgets were further integrated, by combining all local finances at the local level under a
 single financial management system.

3.3.2      Limited Local Authority and its Implications

106. State government and ULG roles in the execution of state and municipal
functions are not necessarily clear. Legislation for functional assignments is open for
interpretation and a number of regional governments and ULGs are actively seeking to
reorganize the division of labor. In Adama, for instance, land management and building
permit issuance became state government functions in 2013, while these used to be municipal
functions. In Bahir Dar, the city is considering restructuring a number of assignment to make
them state functions. At times, the division of labor between regional government and ULGs
poses challenges. In Adama, for instance, the city manager was asked to use municipal
revenues to cover the construction costs of micro enterprise clusters, which had been initiated
by the state department of trade without adequate advance consultations with the city. Such
examples are seen in many other ULGs. There is therefore a need to clearly indicate the roles
and responsibilities of ULGs and regional governments in the execution of own functions, as
well as the agent functions which the ULGs execute on behalf of the regional governments.

107. Despite their importance in delivering most public services, local governments
below the regional level have limited de facto autonomy. ULGs have key responsibilities
(see Box 5) yet do not have the full power to execute them. Basic regional legislation, such as
city proclamations of each regional state, generally provides some measure of autonomy to
cities, for instance, to deliver services, establish their budget, raise revenues, determine their
organizational structure, perform a full range of personnel activities, expropriate land, enter
into contracts, and incur (domestic) debt. In reality, however, these proclamations tend to be
very broad and are often undermined by more detailed guidance and directives. For instance,
ULGs are typically granted authority through regional proclamations to determine local taxes
and rates, while in reality regional governments tend to issue some form of city tariff
regulations that in most cases nullify or greatly curtail ULGs’ ability to adopt or update local
tax rates. This weakens ULG ability to raise own-source revenue. Mekele city, for example,
still uses tariff regulations from 1997/98 as it is not allowed by the regional government to
update its tariffs. As a result, the city cannot fulfill its revenue collection potential, as the
existing tariffs are severely outdated. Similarly, while proclamations allow ULGs to decide
on their respective personnel requirements and skills-mix needs, in reality, the human
resource structures of ULGs are determined mostly by regional bureaus of urban
development and civil service. In Amhara region, for example, the regional bureau of urban
development established an organizational structure including staffing requirements for Bahir
Dar city and its nine sub-cities. There are also signs of political-economy limitations—the
legal provision in Oromia was amended in 2006 to allow the regional president to appoint the
mayor. Although this is only in one region, if other regions follow, the shift may indicate a
possible trend toward recentralization of authority with regional governments.

108. Limited local authority in these areas hinders fulfilment of municipal services —a
challenge compounded by rapidly expanding urban populations that are expected to nearly
triple by 2037. In at least four crucial areas, regional governments retain important powers
while most local governments lack the autonomy and capacity to execute:

       Human resources and personnel management. The authority to establish staffing
        needs, set wage rates, add or eliminate positions, and to change the classification of a
        position tends to be held by regional governments through their proclamations on
        personnel management or civil service regulations. Regions’ practice of setting

                                               66
Section 3: Urban Institutions for a Middle-Income Ethiopia: Land, Governance, and Finance




          standard staffing composition for local governments in their jurisdiction not only
          erodes local government autonomy, but also creates uniformity which reduces the
          efficiency of service delivery in different cities. The inability to set wages, in
          particular, makes it hard for local governments to attract qualified staff, especially in
          departments related to construction, finance, and land management. For instance in
          Hawassa, the highest allowable career structure is Professional Level 8, which
          commands a monthly salary of Br 3,817 (around US$200). Beyond staff shortages,
          the capacity of staff is low, made still worse by high turnover (attributed to poor
          remuneration).
         Land management. Regional and/or federal governments tend to control city grades
          and classification, parameters of land leases and land payments, and land use
          categories.
         Operating practices and organizational structure. Cities have limited authority to
          restructure their organization or develop innovative mechanisms to capitalize on their
          staff skills. There is often widespread duplication and artificial separation of duties
          and functions in local administrations, yet the authority to introduce changes remains
          at the regional level.
         Municipal finance and revenue. Financial regulations, tariff regulations, revenue
          rates, new revenue sources, and the urban grading limit are often determined at the
          regional level.

3.3.3         Limited Local Capacity and its Implications

109. Studies conducted by the government and development partners 143 that have
measured capacity at the ULG level make three observations. First, larger ULGs have
higher capacity than smaller cities to execute basic municipal functions, such as participatory
planning, procurement, and financial management. Second, existing capacity has emerged
primarily from capacity-building efforts financed by individual interventions. Third, ULG
capacity, particularly in own-source revenue mobilization or enhancement, asset management
and land management, has remained low despite a focus on these two areas.

110. The first two observations – the greater capacity of larger ULGs and better
access to capacity-building support - are interrelated. The studies show, for instance, that
86 percent of core staffing positions as recommended by civil service guidelines were filled
in the 18 biggest ULGs in the country 144 —i.e. those participating in the World Bank–
financed Urban Local Government Development Program (ULGDP)—while the 26 smaller,
non-ULGDP cities studied have 77 percent core positions filled. Similarly, the education
level of ULG staff shows variations: 44 percent of staff in Hawassa—one of the biggest
cities—have a BA/Bsc or higher degree, but only 3 percent in Motta, a smaller city. The
spread is partly due to the key subnational capacity-building programs targeting either the
regional government (the Public Sector Capacity Building Program) or larger ULGs (the

ULGDP/GIZ UI). A key reason for under-staffing at the ULG level is insufficient local
government budgets.

111. Further, despite federal government priority given to ULGs to enhance their
own revenue sources, and asset and land management practices, municipal capacity
particularly in these three key areas is generally weak. Experience in ULGDP
implementation between 2008 and 2014 shows that most ULGs do not have, and lack the
capacity to develop, comprehensive land (and other) asset registries, despite the importance
of land-related revenue. Additionally, although most ULGs prepare revenue-enhancement
plans, the plans are usually prepared by external consultants to fulfill the ULGDP
requirements to receive funds, and there are limited links between these plans and actual
enhancement practices. And only a few ULGs are meaningfully computerized for revenue
collection or land registry. Furthermore, although the collection of state revenues at the ULG
level attracts substantial guidance, backstopping and oversight from the regional government,
the supervision and backstopping provided is much weaker when it comes to municipal
revenues.

112. These ULG institutional capacity limitations have an important bearing on the
creation of jobs and delivery of basic infrastructure and services. The intergovernmental
fiscal architecture assigns ULG own-source revenues the role of key financier of urban
infrastructure and services. Such a role requires mobilization of fiscal revenues at the local
level. Increasing tax receipts, through broadening the tax base at the ULG level, would create
much needed fiscal space to support ambitious public expenditure plans for urbanization.
Improving ULG institutional capacity to determine the most optimal policy to maximize
revenue (including fiscal) potential therefore becomes a key priority.

113. The importance of enhancing the institutional capacity of ULGs for fiscal and
revenue management is reinforced by the roles that ULGs are already playing in
accelerating economic growth and reducing spatial disparities. Recent research suggests
that greater autonomy along with capacity building for cities in Ethiopia seems to have
improved economic outcomes at the city level, lowering regional spatial inequalities. 145
Notably, decentralization has led to convergence across city-level outcomes (including
employment and number of firms), suggesting that poorly-performing cities started to catch
up with their better-performing counterparts in tandem with decentralization. Importantly, the
analysis finds that national policies, such as the introduction of value-added tax, are better
implemented in cities with greater administrative powers and capacity, benefiting the
business community directly.

114. ULG institutional capacity for fiscal management, including licensing, directly
affects the ability of firms to grow quickly. Research for this report found that increases in
tax rates and licensing rates adversely affect rapid firm growth, especially in secondary cities.
146
    While tax rates are outside city policy remits, the role of ULGs is important, given their
ability to apply and implement licensing. Recent qualitative work conducted across subcities
in Addis Ababa found that differences in capacity strongly affected the ability of firms to pay
taxes and renew licenses. In addition, interviews with small and medium enterprises indicated

probability of doubling employment (and thus, potentially graduating to large firm status) by 9.3 percent.

that business incentives (especially those relating to land) were targeted at encouraging new
entrepreneurs, leading to higher burdens on incumbents looking to expand business
operations. 147 Local, regional, and national governments might want to use different
instruments to address job creation, given their comparative advantage and their existing
sector and firm-size distribution.

115. In summary, while ULGs are central to the success of urbanization, they often
lack capacity and de-facto authority for good urban management and local governance.
In many cases, regional proclamations limit the power that ULGs exercise in practice, with a
negative impact on the provision of municipal services. Combined with limited capacity for
land management and municipal finance, these trends increase the challenges outlined in
Chapter 2: creating jobs, providing infrastructure and services, and supplying adequate
housing. While there is much that could be done to improve local authority and capacity, this
will need to be accompanied by changes to the fiscal framework in which cities operate so
that there are sufficient finances available for urban development, which will be discussed in
the following section.


3.4         Inadequate Municipal Finances for Urban Development148

3.4.1         Introduction

116. Despite their long list of mandates and importance for Ethiopia’s growth, ULGs
have limited financial resources to meet their expenditure needs. Urban expenditure
needs are largely met through municipal own-source revenues149 and to a smaller extent, from
federal and state level resources and international sources (Table 9).150




147 See “Spatial Determinants of Growth in Addis Ababa,” draft memo b y George Washington and World Bank Capstone
Project (2014).
148 See Annex 2 of the report for challenges associated with analyzing local government finances in Ethiopia and the study

methodology adopted.
149 Municipal own-source revenues (OSR) are collocated by ULGs and municipalities within woredas and clearly defined in

the Government chart of accounts (codes 1700-1799). In this report, all tables indicating municipal OSR include the
municipal OSR from both ULGs and the municipalities within woredas, unless otherwise indicated.
150 Two important caveats should be noted in interpreting the data in Table 9. First, while data on flows from the federal

government to the regions are reported diligently, those for funds from the regions to ULGs are not uniformly reported. This
creates barriers to any attempt at systematic analysis of regional–ULG fiscal transfers. Still, the use of the “urban
development spending” category under the “economic activities” budget line item in the chart of acco unts was used to create
Table 9. Second is the assumption, based on interviews with federal, regional and local government officials, that all
municipal own-source revenues (OSR) collected are spent on urban services and other urban development activities. This
data cannot be verified from accounting systems due to inconsistencies in categorizing and/or coding the underlying budget
data, and because consolidated budget accounts in Ethiopia only report on spending by treasury (federal/state revenues and
block grants) and external sources (international grants and loans), but exclude local expenditures funded from municipal
own-source revenues.

117. Bearing in mind the caveats above,152 data in Table 9 suggest that most urban
development spending (over 90 percent) is at subnational levels, with the majority of
funding coming from ULGs. State-level urban development spending takes one of several
forms (beyond the recurrent costs of urban development bureaus): Regions co-fund the Urban
Local Government Development Program (ULGDP) 153 spending at the local level, some
regions provide direct state-level spending on urban development projects and some regions
provide ULGDP-inspired incentive grants to municipalities/ULGs for urban development
expenditure. Yet, the majority, i.e. over 60 percent, of urban development spending is funded
from municipal own-source revenues.

118. The largest source of urban expenditure funding – municipal own-source
revenue – is insufficient. The most recent data (Table 10) shows that only three percent of
all revenues collected in Ethiopia is municipal revenue. The Constitution defines the division
of main revenue sources between federal and regional state levels, with most high-yielding
sources assigned to the federal level or jointly to the two levels. The federal government
collects 81 percent of all revenues, while regional governments collect 16 percent. This
significant vertical fiscal imbalance is offset through fiscal transfer from the federal to the
regional governments.




151IBEX data presented in Table 9 does not fully include ULGDP resources. Once ULGDP (and other flows) are fully
integrated and tracked through IBEX, a more accurate analysis will be possible. Given the quantum of ULGDP resources
(approximately ETB 780,000 total in EFY2004), additional data would not change the fact that the majority of expenditure
on urban development is incurred by local governments.

performance, measured independently, against a set of institutional and capital investment results. The Program is explained

119. The existing fiscal arrangements for meeting urban expenditure needs, which
rely heavily on municipal revenues, are too small to fill the gap in urban infrastructure
and services. Given the rapid population growth of urban areas in Ethiopia, unmet urban
infrastructure needs are significant. And although municipal revenue—which finances the
majority of urban investments—has grown in nominal terms, in real terms between 2006 and
2011, its annual growth was lower than growth in public revenue or GDP.155 Reasons for this
include the limited ULG capacity, fiscal autonomy, and financial resource capacity
(highlighted above). Most important, however, is the difference in indexation used for
municipal, as opposed to federal and regional revenues. Municipal revenues (especially fees
and charges) tend to erode with inflation as they are typically specified in nominal terms (and
any adjustment to these must be approved by regional governments), while federal and
regional revenue sources, such as value-added tax or taxes on personal and business income,
are generally specified in percentage terms.

3.4.2         Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers

120. Intergovernmental fiscal transfers form a critical component of sub-national
finances in Ethiopia. Regions receive the majority of their financial resources through fiscal
transfers from the federal government, and in turn, provide intergovernmental fiscal transfers
to the local level. The main federal to regional transfer is in the form of non-earmarked block
grants.156 These transfers comprised 66 percent of all state revenues in FY2010/11 (Table 11)
and they have been increasing, from Br 9.9 billion in 2006/07 to Br 26 billion in 2010/11 and

154  Data limitations should be taken into account in interpreting these figures. The IBEX data provided by MoFED did not
have municipal revenue for Oromia Regional State. To provide a more complete fiscal picture, data on Oromia municipal
revenue collections were requested from Oromia BOFED/Revenue Bureau and were added to the calculations.
155 World Bank. Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study, Part II (2014).The figures on municipal revenue growth,

inflation, and GDP are based on data from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) Integrated Budget
and Expenditure System (IBEX) and the International Monetary Fund.
156 In addition, other types of funding from various development institutions have occasionally been referred to as “special

purpose grants” including the ULGDP and the MDG fund. However none of these have (yet) been assigned an account code
in the government account system within fiscal transfers series (IBEX code 1600) and cannot be tracked in national or state
government accounts.

to Br 41 billion in 2012/13. Although resources flowing through the block grant system are
increasing, on average 80 percent of these resources are used to fund salaries and other
recurrent expenditures, while resources for capital expenditures are limited.157

121. In addition to these fiscal flows, in 2008 the Government of Ethiopia established
the Urban Local Government Development Program (ULGDP) which is a performance-
based fiscal transfer program that disburses to a number of ULGs158 in direct proportion to
their performance - measured independently - against a set of institutional and capital
investment results. Based on the success of the first phase (2008-2014) of the World Bank-
supported ULGDP, a second phase was launched in 2014, where participating ULGs and
their respective regions provide different levels of co-financing to the grant. While
technically the ULGDP should be tracked in the public financial management system and be
reported as a transfer, it is not – thus, does not appear on the table above, which indicates data
from IBEX. The key reason for this is that when the ULGDP was launched in 2008, IBEX
was not fully operational in most ULGs, who used a mix of accounting systems to monitor
ULGDP funds. Government has expressed its intension to fully integrate ULGDP transfers in
IBEX in the coming years. Nevertheless, analysis of ULGDP disbursements (Table 12)
indicate that while in aggregate terms, the program’s median disbursement of approximately
US$43 million per annum is not a significant sum when situated within the larger grant
funding from the federal government, at the ULG level, funds from the program comprised a
significant amount of funding, averaging around 70 percent of ULG total urban capital
expenditure.

122. Despite the Constitution’s decentralization of revenue resources to the regional
level, with the exception of Addis, regions in Ethiopia are not able to cover their
expenditure needs from their own-revenue sources. This is due to the fact that regions
have been given extensive de jure responsibility for service delivery but an insufficient
economic base and regional inequality in resource mobilization (most of which is de facto
delegated down to local governments). The mismatch between expenditure responsibilities
and revenue assignments is financed through transfers from the federal government. The
main justification for the central government to give unconditional grants to states is, first, to
correct vertical fiscal imbalances (to ensure adequate sub-national funding for provision of a
minimum or reasonable level of public services), and second, to achieve horizontal fiscal
balance (that is, to equalize fiscal capacities of different states). Thus the formula for sharing
the block grant among the states is based on a quite sophisticated assessment of (i) revenue
potential and (ii) specific expenditure needs of each state. Administration of the formula is
managed through the House of Federation. The House of Federation compiles data for
regional collections and (proxy) tax bases for seven main revenue sources in each regional
state: payroll tax, agricultural income tax, land use fee, livestock tax, profit tax, turnover tax,
and the value added tax, as well as data on expenditure needs. Similarly, the formula
determines the level of each region’s expenditure needs by taking into account previous
years’ expenditure share of each sector as a weighting mechanism for determination of the
expenditure requirement of a sector. Expenditure needs are then determined for each
functional grant window based on a sectoral formula which includes: general administration
(28%); primary and secondary education (33%); public health (11%); agriculture and rural
development (11%); drinking water development (5%); and urban development (4%).
Remaining functions attract 8 percent of the allocation formula. These block grants account
for the vast majority of all regional states (except Addis). Table 13 below presents the
funding sources of regional state budgets for EFY 2003 (most recently available EFY for this
data), broken down between state revenues, grants (subsidy revenue), and external funding.
The data show that close to two-thirds of regional state resources come from
intergovernmental fiscal transfers from the federal level. Close to 2.1 billion US$ (Br 41.6
billion) was transferred from the federal level of government to the states in FY2012/13.

   123. While Addis Ababa has regional government status, unlike the nine regional
   governments and Dire Dawa, it does not receive block grant transfers from the federal
   government from the treasury sources. Instead, it receives a small amount of transfer for
   the road fund (ETB 41.6 million in 2010/11, most recently ETB 50 million in 2013/14) and
   ad hoc, project specific capital transfers which have been borrowed by the federal
   government from international sources for key infrastructure investments in the city (Table
   14). These financiers include the World Bank (IDA), China EXIM Bank and L'Agence
   Française de Développement through the Caisse Franchise de Développement. The majority
   of the investments are in the water sector. As of May 2015, 11 infrastructure projects such as
   the Akaki Liquid Waste Treatment Plant, Third Water Supply Project, Legedadi Water
   Supply Expansion and the Biogas Project, are financed through such mechanisms. These
   transfers, which are all in the form of grants to Addis, have grown considerably over time
   (Table 15), from ETB 70 million (US$3.4 million) in EFY 2004 (FY2011) to ETB 280
   million (US$13.6 million) in EFY 2007 (FY2014), with a peak of ETB 1.6 billion (US$78
   million) in EFY 2006 (FY2013). The share of these externally borrowed funds which are on-
   granted to Addis have been growing. They reached eight percent of Addis’ total revenues and
   financed 13.6 percent of the city’s capital expenditure, in EFY 2006 (FY 2013/14).

159 It is important to note that Addis has been creating an operating surplus, as also highlighted in previous analyses
including the 2014 "Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study, Part I: Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study Part I –

124. In addition to the on-granting of externally borrowed financing by the federal
government, Addis borrows, through MOFED guarantee, directly to meet some of its
financing needs.161 In the past, Addis borrowed from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
(CBE) to finance the rolling stock for the city bus enterprise (fully repaid) and more recently
for housing construction, in the form of the “corporate bonds”. The federal government
authorizes Addis to borrow and provides a guarantee to the CBE. Addis’ corporate bonds can
be considered as private placement bonds; in essence they are a form of medium-term relay
loans (with issuance of coupons), which, in the case of Addis, are then converted by the CBE
from Addis debt to individual mortgage loans to the final beneficiaries of the housing
program. In other words, when housing construction is finalized and the properties are
transferred to beneficiaries, bonds are converted to mortgage loans issued by the CBE to the
individual beneficiaries. Project finance for housing projects accounts for the largest share of
outstanding debt of Addis. The amount of Addis’ outstanding bonds of reached ETB 10.1
billion (US$534 million) by the end of June 2013. As of 2015, the total outstanding bonds of
Addis reached ETB 18.375 billion (US$875 million). These bonds are registered under the
Addis Ababa Housing Development Agency (AAHDA). This total amount of outstanding
bonds corresponds approximately to the city’s total expenditure in EFY2006. Although a
thorough discussion of subnational borrowing, including by Addis exceeds the scope of this
study, it is worth mentioning that the practice of subnational borrowing as briefly described
above has the following key flaws and challenges:

          i. There is a potential risk of contingent liabilities from indirect guarantees and the
               lack of what seems to be a proper regulation of guarantees, which Addis and other
               regional governments may offer to their entities, authorities or enterprises;
          ii. The current framework for subnational borrowing does not address the remedies
               should Addis, a regional or ULG borrower, default or reach a position of
               insolvency;
          iii. There is no common debt reporting framework and the federal government has not
               defined any debt management ratios (e.g. restricting subnational entities against
               borrowing more than a certain percentage of their operating revenues);
          iv. The full guarantee of the federal government can lead to a moral hazard risk,
               whereby the CBE has little to no incentive to carry out any municipal credit
               evaluation, as it can rely exclusively on the sovereign guarantee.
          v. Finally, concentration of high amounts of subnational debt relative to the CBE’s
               capital base could potentially risk the stability of the country’s largest bank.

125. Transfers from the regional governments to local governments are difficult to
analyze systematically, as the budget reporting system provides inadequate information
on regional-local block grants. In principle, the distribution of the regional to local transfers
is determined by the regional council through a set of formulae in each region. These
formulae are often modified from year to year. Fieldwork interviews conducted for this and
previous similar studies indicate that the formulae used by regional governments follow

161 The conditions under which Addis Ababa and other Ethiopian sub-national governments may borrow directly are
determined by the legal framework and practices. Ethiopia’s subnational borrowing framework can be characterized as a
“direct control” policy framework, which includes the following elements: (i) requirement for federal government approval
of all loans contracted by regions and Addis Ababa (borrowing by urban local governments is subject to the approval of their
respective regions); (ii) domestic borrowing by regions and Addis is (currently) authorized only from approved state-owned
commercial bank; (iii) all loans to/ bonds issued by the regions and Addis are guaranteed by the federal government; and (iv)
loans are extended at subsidized interest rates, which do not price risk.

broadly the same parameters as the federal one. The share of the block grant for each woreda
and ULG is indicated in the annual budget proclamation of each regional government, and is
approved by the regional council. The allocations are then published in the Negarit Gazet.
The ULGs receive these published amounts as a budget ceiling for their state expenditures
and record the ceiling in their budget proclamations as a block grant.

126. However, in practice, allocations differ significantly from these proclaimed
amounts. The proclaimed amounts are not reflected in the actual regional government or
ULG accounts. Part of the amount comes out of the state revenue collected by the ULG on
behalf of the region, rather than through a direct transfer from the regional account. ULG
revenue offices collect state revenues as an agent of their region, with the rationale that the
collected revenues should be used for state functions across all woreda and ULGs within the
particular state in an equitable and need-based manner. Thus, part of the collected amounts
are retained by ULGs in lieu of a transfer from the region of their share of the block grant
allocation and the rest is transferred to the regional government accounts. Yet, regional
governments do not prepare state-level budget reports that transparently reveal funding flows
from the regional state level to the local level, and vice-versa. Therefore, it is very
challenging to accurately analyze the exact amount of financial flows from the regional
governments to ULGs using the existing IBEX system.

127. Of the state revenues collected by selected ULGs in this study, there is a net
transfer of funds from ULGs to their regional governments. Hawassa has a special status,
as it has been formally granted the right to retain all its state revenue. All other ULGs
analyzed make net transfer of fiscal resources to their respective regional governments (Table
16). For the most recent year (EFY2006) Bahir Dar and Adama effectively transferred close
to 70 percent of the state revenue collected to the regional governments, and Mekelle
transferred approximately 40 percent of the amount.

128. For selected ULGs in this study, all municipal capital expenditure was funded
either by ULGDP financing or own-source revenue. Moreover, formal fiscal transfers -
including block grants for recurrent and capital expenditure and the road fund - vary
significantly across ULGs. Although the annual regional budget proclamations indicate the
amount and types of transfer from the Region to the ULGs, the budget reporting system
(IBEX) provides inadequate information on region-to-ULG block grants, making it nearly
impossible to engage in a systematic analysis of regional-local fiscal transfers. Table 17

illustrates that in Adama, the ULG accounts did not include any of the formal transfers, while
in Mekelle, Bahir Dar and Hawassa, these transfers helped finance 6, 15 and 16 percent of all
ULG expenditures, respectively.

to urbanization, is that it does not support urban expenditure. Block transfers to regional
and local governments increase accountability in service delivery by bringing decision-
making closer to citizens—consistent with Ethiopia’s decentralization strategy. However,
given Ethiopia’s urbanization rate, it is not properly aligned with the growing urban
investment needs. The federal-to-regional level transfer formula assigns only four percent to
urban investment needs in determining the amount of transfers to regions. The country’s
largest urban agglomeration, Addis Ababa, though given extensive powers to raise its own
revenue, does not receive any block grants. The federal grant funding it receives is for
specific infrastructure projects, and is insufficient for its overall infrastructure and
institutional funding needs. ULGs return significant amount of state revenues in excess of
their state function expenditures, and the recurrent and capital block grants they receive are
not robust enough to make a significant contribution to their expenditure needs. Other
weaknesses of the system include:

            i. Salaries are set at the regional level and often absorb a large portion of block
               grants, leaving few funds for other purposes (Table 18). The funding for services
               delivered by regional and local governments is also difficult to predict, making
               planning unmanageable. On average 80 percent162 of block grants are used to fund
               salary costs, while resources for capital expenditures are limited.

            ii. Operation and maintenance (O&M) needs are often neglected for capital
                expenditures. Because municipalities can appropriate funds intended for
                operating revenues to finance capital expenditure, adequate O&M for
                infrastructure is unlikely. For instance, the country’s 19 largest ULGs in the
                ULGDP are required to plan and use annual O&M budgets, but between 2008 and
                August 2014 only 13 reached the target of using 75 percent annual O&M budgets
                in their capital investment plans.

 3.4.3        Municipal Revenues

 130. While municipal revenues are the main source of funding for urban expenditure,
 they are much smaller than state revenues. Besides collecting their municipal revenues,
 ULGs also collect regional state revenues on behalf of their regional governments. States
 show considerable variation in the (nominal and relative) levels and composition of local
 revenue collections (Table 19). Of revenue collected at the ULG level, 16 percent is
 municipal and 84 percent is state/regional.

 131. Given Ethiopia’s federal structure, municipal revenue is regulated by state
 legislation and regulations and thus, municipal revenue assignments vary from state to
 state. The role of federal and regional governments is to assist ULGs enhance their municipal
 revenues. To this end, the federal government (mainly MUDHCo, in concert with MOFED)
 prepares prototype proclamations or regulations on municipal finance issues for consideration
 by regional authorities. One such proclamation is the “Model to Provide for City Government
 Finance Administration” prepared by the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and
 Construction (MUDHCo) and transmitted to the regions in 2005 (and gradually adopted by


                                                       80

different regional states from 2006-10). This prototype regulation suggests that municipal
revenues might include fifteen specific municipal revenue sources.163

132. Key challenges exist in federal government guidance and support to municipal
revenue enhancement. The federal government is, in theory, responsible for supporting
regional revenue authorities and Bureaus of Finance and Economic Development (BOFEDs).
These entities then support ULG revenue-enhancement efforts. In practice, however, there are
challenges associated with this chain. At the federal level, MUDHCo was charged with
providing support and guidance for revenue enhancement to regional governments until 2008.
In 2008, this responsibility was given to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development,
which subsequently delegated the function to the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Agency
(ERCA). ERCA is now technically responsible for providing support and guidance to
regional government revenue entities through its decentralized structure. However, the
founding proclamation of ERCA gives it legal responsibility only for state revenues and
customs, and not municipal revenues, which is why ERCA’s focus is exclusively on
regional/state revenues. This creates a wide gap and leads to lack of systematic federal
support and guidance on municipal revenues for regional entities. This gap feeds through to
the regional-to-ULG support. Regional governments, through their revenue authorities and
BOFED, are responsible for assisting ULGs in ensuring that the tax rates/bands and revenue-
enhancement plans are realistic and ambitious and for updating ULG tariff proclamations.
Yet in practice BOFEDs and the regional revenue authorities focus on maximizing collection
of state revenues, leaving an important lacuna in real-time guidance and support to ULGs in
enhancing their municipal own-source revenues.

133. ULGs that collect higher state revenues than foreseen at the start of the year are
required to transfer the excess collections to the regional level. This significantly reduces
any incentive to collect state revenues at the local level beyond the planned threshold, as local
governments cannot retain even a portion of these resources.

134. Municipal revenue displays considerable variation across ULGs. In addition to
potential differences in municipal revenue effort, differences in municipal revenue collections
across regions are likely to stem from differences in geographic and demographic conditions,
and in the economic structure of regional states in Ethiopia. In addition, a city’s population
size is found to be highly correlated with the size of the city’s formal economic base, which
will have an important impact on own-source revenue potential and collections. The amount
of per capita revenue collected is generally positively correlated with city size. Table 20
highlights this relationship for the twelve selected ULGs and shows a relatively strong,
positive relationship between city size and per capita municipal revenue collections. For
every ten thousand person increase in population, a city might be able to collect roughly two
more Birr per person. All else being equal, this means that smaller cities have lower revenue
potential than larger cities. A number of cities including Bishoftu, Jimma, Axum and Shire
Enidasilase deviate from this pattern, as their municipal revenue per capita is higher than
expected at their population level. This is largely explained through the local urban economic
growth in these cities that outpaces national growth, particularly in industry and tourism.

163 The fifteen municipal revenue taxes would include: Real property tax; residence tax (a “head tax” or “poll tax”); fuel and
utility tax; telephone, fax, telegram and other electronic services tax; environmental protection tax; business tax; sur-tax on
tobacco, alcohol, soft drinks; cattle tax; boat tax; bicycle tax; cart tax; emblems & sign board tax; market stall fee; fees and
charges; other taxes/fees/charges as may be levied from time to time.

135. The three most important municipal revenue sources are: (i) municipal rents,
including rentals of housing, land, shops and market stalls, administered by ULGs; (ii)
lease income from land administered by the ULG; and (iii) licenses, fees, and other
municipal charges (Table 21). Cities are given tax and user-fee authority for own-source
revenues and are allowed to retain all the revenues from land leasing. In principle, this is a
viable division of financing responsibilities. It provides cities with incentives to develop own-
source revenues to meet city-specific service priorities. The theory of subsidiarity—the basis
of fiscal decentralization—suggests that smaller units of government can better determine the
appropriate level of taxation and allocation of public expenditures to match people’s choices
and needs, bringing allocation efficiency to the fiscal architecture. Consistent with this, each

unit of government would seek to balance own resources with expenditures, thereby both
preserving fiscal autonomy and promoting accountability to tax-paying constituents.

136. Reliance of larger cities on unsustainable land lease revenues. 164 Some
municipalities’ increased reliance on land- and property-related revenues165 injects a degree
of risk into the municipal finance system, because land-leasing revenues are volatile and will
eventually decline. 166 This is particularly true of land leases with upfront payments and
installment payments that end long before the lease expires. The present practice of using the
proceeds from land leasing to finance municipal infrastructure investment shields municipal
governments from some of this risk, but over the intermediate term, revenue generation from
land leasing is expected to slow its rate of growth.

137. Ethiopia is one of the few countries in the world where own-source revenues are
the primary source of finance for urban infrastructure. But it faces problems:

          i. Revenue generation. Municipalities on average collect around Br 210 (US$11)
             per urban resident in municipal revenues. (More populous cities typically collect
             more municipal revenues per capita than smaller cities, but with heavier reliance
             on land lease revenues.) This amount is comparable to other countries in the
             region. Yet because most urban investments are expected to be funded through


164 The Constitution designates land as belonging to the people of Ethiopia. The government administers the land on behalf
of the people. ULGs are delegated powers to administer the land, including leasing for extended periods to households.
165 Reliance on land revenues is increasing in some (i.e. Bahir Dar from 40 percent in FY 2011/12 to 63 percent in FY

2013/14) but not all ULGs: In Addis Ababa, land revenues have grown in absolute terms but decreased as a percentage of
the total budget.
166 In EFY2004, for instance, urban land lease constituted 52 percent, 45 percent, 41 percent, and 40 percent of total

municipal revenues in Mekele, Adwa, Bahir Dar, and Hawassa, respectively.

Section 3: Urban Institutions for a Middle-Income Ethiopia: Land, Governance, and Finance




               these revenues, and given other investment priorities, urban areas face a steep
               funding shortage;

          ii. User fees charged for infrastructure services are low and do not cover
              operational and capital costs. Ensuring cost recovery through tariffs is
              important since it opens possibilities for financing that may otherwise be
              impossible. Without cost recovery, there may well be no funds remaining for
              maintenance or new investments. By contrast, adequate cost recovery can open
              the door to private investment and take some of the burden away from public
              finances. If services were priced closer to cost recovery, estimates suggest that
              US$102 million could be captured each year for Ethiopia’s infrastructure.
              However, there is also a need to be mindful of the distributional impacts and
              affordability of full cost pricing systems;

          iii. Lack of local control over rate-setting. Licenses, service fees, and charges are
               an important revenue driver. For seven out of 12 sample ULGs167 studied closely,
               service fees and charges represent the largest municipal revenue category,
               followed by income from municipal rent and land lease. Collection of service
               charges is robust, which ensures a strong link between municipal service provision
               and revenue collections. However these revenues are, in principle, tied to funding
               specific services and therefore do not provide the municipality with general
               revenues to finance important infrastructure and services or to provide other
               municipal amenities for which user charges are not practical.168 Moreover, taxes,
               service fees, and charges are prescribed at fixed levels in the regional tariff
               proclamation, leaving ULGs unable to adjust user charges to reflect actual service
               costs, gauge economic demand for different services in light of these costs, or
               generate project revenue to finance high-priority investments in the future.169

138. In short, urban local governments face significant financial constraints, despite
their importance to the process of urbanization within a decentralized governance
structure. Only 3 percent of public revenue collection took place at the municipal level,
while municipal own-source revenues are expected to finance majority of urban development.
By contrast, inter-governmental transfers are often barely enough to cover operating costs.
Combined with the limited authority and capacity of local governments, these financial
constraints make it much harder for cities to finance the necessary infrastructure and services
to provide for rapidly growing urban populations.

Gambella, Asosa, as part of the World Bank. Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study, (2014).
168 It is possible that, despite their categorization, some of these service fees are actually collected in the shape of taxes. For

instance, a sanitation charge might be collected as a surcharge to a (simple) property tax. In fact, some of these charges may
even be collected to fund non-excludable public goods, such as road drains.
169 Fortunately, this problem has been recognized. Regions are starting to take steps to remove the constraint. Oromia

Region, for example, formally authorized first-grade cities to establish their own fees, charges, and tax rates, taking into
account local ability to pay, local service costs, and local demand for services.

4.     The Path Forward: Connecting All Ethiopians to
       Prosperity

4.1      Introduction

139. Ethiopia’s transformation from a predominantly rural society to an urban one is
not automatic, nor should the potential benefits—for individuals and the economy—be
taken for granted. If urbanization is to work for the country’s development and connect all
Ethiopians to prosperity, it must be managed by proactive government leadership. There are
clear signs of this, particularly under the vision created by MUDHCo. Suggestions in this
section aim to strengthen this vision.

140. First, land management and administration system should be reformed and
strengthened, along with underlying institutions for urban governance and municipal
finance (subsections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4). Second, targeted sector interventions should
ensure that cities are attractive places in which to live and work—and that urbanization
contributes to economic growth (section 4.5). Policies and investments that fail to address
underlying causes are unlikely to achieve long-lasting results. To promote better and better
managed urbanization and close the gaps in jobs, infrastructure, and services, a robust
institutional framework is required to allow for efficient and sustainable land management,
urban governance, and municipal finance. The roles for national, regional, and urban local
governments will have to evolve as they transition from being the sole agents of planning,
management, and implementation to being the enablers and coordinators of action by a
growing number of stakeholders, public and private.


4.2      Land Management

141. The current land management system of supplying land and infrastructure for
legal urban development has several consequences. Substantial portions of the urban and
peri-urban populations have no choice but to seek housing in growing informal settlements,
mostly living in slum conditions (according to international definitions). These settlements
account for a large part of urban growth, with urban populations expanding outwards rather
than upwards. The resulting urban expansion has further ripple effects for infrastructure and
service delivery. And the residence requirements built into the existing land tenure system act
to discourage rural–urban migration, which in the long run may hamper effective distribution
of labor.

142. The longer the delay in addressing these issues, the higher the future costs of
rectifying unruly urbanization to benefit all citizens, including inhabitants of informal
settlements. Moreover, further delays may render such rectification infeasible given
limitations on resources available to the government and Ethiopian people.

143. International experience indicates that the strategic direction of reforms should
be to redefine the roles of government and the private sector in urban development.
First, the government needs to reposition itself as an enabler of the private sector and an


                                              85
                                           Section 4: The Path Forward




effective regulator, rather than a direct and leading provider of key components of urban
development. Second, in order to help address shortages of land for formal development and
affordable housing, the country needs to engage its private sector in at least two key areas:
assisting the government in the delivery of housing (including affordable rentals) and in the
supply of serviced land and infrastructure. This paradigm shift needs to be accompanied by a
recognition of the true market value of urban land, which would allow the government to
benefit from its fair share of this value. Or, even if the government decides to price the land at
below market price, it would be cognizant of such a gap and be able to ensure pricing that
permits land cost recovery. This reform can be pursued while still abiding by the current
paradigm of government land ownership, as stated in the Constitution. The policies that
Turkey followed along its path to urbanization, and how Singapore maintains the balance of
public and private interests, are shown in Box 6 and Box 7, both offering possible lessons for
Ethiopia.170 Similarly, the positive experience of Vietnam (Box 15) shows how the housing
needs can be addressed through the large-scale supply of rental housing by private land
holders.




170Though Singapore’s experience is not directly applicable to Ethiopia, because of the huge difference in wealth and the
fundamental differences between a city-state and the great geographic expanse of Ethiopia, a substantial share of its
developable land is in private ownership, and its government manages very few leases compared with Ethiopian cities.




                                                             86

Box 6: Making Urbanization Work for Turkey

 Turkey may offer important lessons for Ethiopia’s urbanization journey. Advancing from nascent
 urbanization in the 1950s to its current fully developed stage, it offers a glimpse for Ethiopia of how
 this process took place, how Turkey managed to harness agglomeration economies, and how urgent
 infrastructure services were delivered (including the policy and institutional adjustments needed to
 more effectively manage urbanization). Several factors contributed to Turkey’s growth -oriented and
 inclusive urbanization.
 First, Turkey allowed its markets to work. Policies in the 1980s promoting economic liberalization
 attracted new domestic and foreign private investment. This created a critical pull factor for rural
 migrants, enabled the convergence of production and consumption markets, and promoted
 agglomeration economies in cities.
 Second, a metropolitan municipality regime adopted in 1984 provided the administrative framework
 to manage fast-growing cities across their economic footprint.
 Third, a permissive tenure regime granted squatters on urban public land legal status, which prompted
 households and host municipalities to invest in their dwellings and neighborhood infrastructure,
 avoiding the squalid conditions of slums prevalent in many other fast-urbanizing developing
 countries.
 Fourth, efforts to scale up housing supply through state brokering services triggered a private sector
 response, which helped accelerate the expansion of the housing stock. On the demand side, mortgage-
 based finance was expanded, particularly over the past decade, with extended maturities that allowed
 the housing sector to expand downmarket.
 Fifth, interventions from national programs helped fiscally-constrained localities meet national
 service coverage targets, through the use of matching-grant subsidies to support the expansion of
 access to water, sanitation, and other basic municipal services.
 Sixth, policies that promoted market-based pricing of municipal services helped attract private
 investment and partnerships to share the financial burden, while private management know-how
 enabled innovation and efficiency gains in service delivery.

Box 7: Singapore—Roles of Public and Private Sectors in Urban Development
 Singapore, an island nation of around 710 square kilometers with more than 5 million people, is one of
 the densest yet most livable cities in the world.1 How does the city-state manage its most precious
 asset—land? Currently, 75–80 percent of the land is state owned (around 60 percent under direct state
 ownership, 15–20 percent on lease to government agencies, and 1 percent leased to the private sector),2
 while the other 20–25 percent is privately owned (freehold).3 The private sector plays a leading role in
 land development. A key principle is maintaining the delicate balance between safeguarding and
 delivering for public interests, and leveraging private sector resources and market forces for
 development.
 Long-term, integrated, land-use planning provides the broad guidance necessary for development, and
 ensures corresponding public infrastructure provision (capacity and timing). Development principles
 and land use decisions, reflected through the master plan, are overseen by an interministerial, master
 planning committee. In addition, a “whole-of-government” approach is taken, in which all
 development-related agencies consult with each other. This enables coordinated planning, financing,
 and delivery of infrastructure, services, and amenities according to the plan. Land use plans are also
 highly transparent (e.g. the use and density stipulated for every plot of land can be found online), yet
 flexible (e.g. private developers can initiate a request for a change in land use or density). This enables
 easy participation by the private sector and increases its confidence in investments.
 The land-tendering process is market-based and highly transparent, to maximize land value captured.
 State land is released through two main channels: from the state to government development agencies
 for public services provision, or through the Government Land Sales Program to private developers for
 commercial, residential, and industrial uses. In both cases, the land is sold on long-term leases with a
 clear, accountable land value. Land sales to private developers are all conducted through competitive
 market mechanisms (tender and auction) and are subsequently directly marketable and transferrable.4
 The government plans and publicly releases a list of sale sites every half-year for bidding, with the
 primary objectives of meeting market demand, supporting stability of the property market and
 economic growth, and realizing national planning and development objectives (such as providing
 affordable housing). The inventory of sale sites is sourced from the stock of available state land. To
 determine the appropriate level of land supply, detailed and realistic projections for the demand on
 various types of properties are carried out based on floor area (considering both land area and
 development density).
 Private land is acquired for developing public infrastructure and practiced very prudently. Urban
 development relies more on mutually beneficial public–private collaborations. The government can
 acquire private land, but only for developing public infrastructure such as roads and public transit.
 Compensation is paid at the prevailing market value and owners can appeal if they are dissatisfied. In
 fact, land acquisition is practiced very judiciously and the government employs innovative ways to
 advance urban development, especially through incentives. For example, bonus gross floor areas are
 awarded for sites near a mass transit station to promote higher density and transit-oriented
 developments. Over the years, the master plan has also been revised to encourage and allow for higher
 density, compact, and mixed-use developments that cater to the rising population and economic
 growth. With the stipulation of higher gross plot ratios, developers are incentivized to voluntarily
 redevelop their land to increase the value of their property.

 Notes:
 1 Singapore is also wealthy. Its GDP per capita increased from US$2,530 in 1960 to US$36,898 in 2013 (constant 2005
 US$).
 2 This 1 percent translates to around 7 sq km, or 1,200 sites since 1967 (the majority of land development parcels are
 around 1 ha or less), with investments totalling around US$35 billion (or around US$30 billion).
 3 Given that only 30–40 percent of total land is considered “developable,” i.e. usable for work (commercial/industrial)
 and living (residential) spaces, about half of the developable land is in private sector–led developments.
 4 According to the sales conditions, the successful tenderer must complete the entire development (i.e. ready for
 occupancy) within a certain time (usually five or six years) as agreed in the tender document. No sales or subleases are
 allowed before the development is complete. After that, generally, the successful tenderer may sell, sublease, or
 otherwise dispose of the land and the development, in whole or in part.

144. Given the complexities in Ethiopia, no single action can channel urbanization
onto a more sustainable and efficient path. Comprehensive, multi-dimensional reform of
land management and land administration is therefore needed, which would entail revising
some of the current policies, laws, regulations, and practices. The following options for
reform are divided into three time categories, ranging from incremental changes that can be
implemented fairly quickly to more systematic reforms that the government may wish to
consider over the longer term. The suggested changes also explicitly unbundle land issues so
that they can be addressed separately, contributing in gradual and identifiable improvements.
It is also crucial that the needed land reforms go beyond the scope of any single ministry, and
therefore requires strong intergovernmental cooperation.

145. International experiences indicate that un-bundling land issues and addressing
them separately can be an effective way forward. Box 8 below presents examples of how
China, Egypt, countries in the Balkans and Poland have been reforming specific components
of land management, thus improving the overall situation.

Box 8: Approaching land reform by un-bundling the issues

 Legalizing illegal housing

      The Balkan countries. All of these countries introduced laws and procedures to
 legalize informal, unauthorized buildings, while preventing their further emergence. The
 latter is achieved by a combination of (i) clear legal rules on what constitute illegal
 construction and their enforcement and (ii) elimination of backlogs of issuing permits at
 local governments. As a result, new illegal construction in such countries as Croatia,
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia has diminished. Regularization of
 informal settlements remains to be done.

 Reforming dual rural-urban land tenure

     China. Chinese government and society, while proudly recognizing “China’s
 economic miracle,” acknowledge that transition to an urbanized society won’t be
 accomplished as long as a divide exists in land and social rights of rural and urban people,
 and urbanization is based on involuntary land requisition by government (Liu Sgouying,
 Li Yihao, 2014). Land reform is envisioned as the core factor of China’s new growth
 model and a national priority. It will include integration of rural and urban land rights
 (based on provincial and municipal experiments with innovative land tenure
 arrangements), integration of rural and urban land markets, and shifting land supply from
 quantity increase to improving land use efficiency (including economic density of urban
 land uses).

Diversifying and improving land pricing

    China. Starting in the 1990s, Chinese local governments exercised diversified
approaches to pricing urban land they were releasing for private and semi-private uses.
Land for industrial use was allocated directly at low administrative prices (often 10-30
times lower than prices fetched at competitive allocations). In 2006, the government
introduced a law requiring competitive procedures for allocating industrial land.
Meanwhile, allocation of commercial and residential land has been dominated by
competitive procedures since 2001. On average, however, until 2011, the amount of land
allocated competitively across China has been always higher than in direct allocations
(Urban China, 2014).
    Egypt. Various government agencies are trying to make better use of the economic
value of land, though this has not become yet the nation-wide policy. The Ministry of
Housing has made land auctions the main mechanism for disposing of primary public
land, except for land intended for low-income housing. New Urban Communities
Authority (NUCA) started using auctions to allocate large tracts of land. The first auctions
in June 2007 generated LE 17 billion from the sale of six large land sites, with some
parcels (e.g. in New Cairo) going at LE 4,050/square meter. There were speculations in
Egypt – though without hard evidence - that prices on these auctions have been driven up
by the influx of investment money from oil-rich neighboring countries. The Tourism
Development Agency reportedly conducted an experimental auction of two sites, and took
off the market six sites previously offered for the administrative price of US$1/square
meter (Kaganova et al., 2007).

Making urban planning more attuned to infrastructure costs and needs of the
private sector

    Poland introduced a legal provision that requires urban planners to estimate costs and
revenues associated with implementation of spatial development plans. A special
Financial Impact Study (FIS) must estimate expected land-related revenues from the area
covered by the local development plan and public expenses related to its implementation.
On the revenue side, the property tax and other land-related revenues should be estimated
based on size/density and expected value of taxable properties allowed by the plan. On the
expenditure side, FIS must estimate the cost of building streets, sewerage mains, water
mains, and the cost of purchasing private land to build this infrastructure. Reportedly,
there are examples when the costs associated with the local development plans turned out
to be so high that urban planners had to redesign the plan in order to reduce the cost (e.g.,
by narrowing a street so that less private land needed to be expropriated) and increase
revenues (e.g. by allowing higher density of land use on privately-controlled land sites)
(Kaganova and Buczek, 2010).

4.2.1      Short Term

R1.      Establish an inter-ministerial task force, under the leadership of MUDHCo that
brings together different levels of government to define approaches to land management
and land administration reform, as well as an action plan for implementation. Similar to
China, the biggest challenges of land management take place at the interface of urban and
rural land. It would be difficult to address them in an optimal manner without very close
collaboration between branches of government responsible for urban and rural land (at all
levels of government), which is the main reason why intergovernmental cooperation is
needed. The task force should work within an agreed agenda and schedule, and preferably be
facilitated by technical experts. The task force’s work product should be a document that
would lay the groundwork for further legislative, regulatory, and implementation action. The
approaches developed by the task force should be publicly discussed to incorporate feedback
from the government at all levels, the public, and those in professional circles. The resulting
framework and roadmap could be officially adopted by the federal government as binding
guidance for further action. The action plan should identify which documents will be
prepared, when, and by whom.

R2.     Undertake a total inventory and audit of land in urban areas held by all levels of
government and their entities, initiated and spearheaded by the federal government.
The purpose is to identify excess land that could be reclassified and released for
development. Agencies that hold such land need to be provided with incentives for releasing
their land (e.g. eligibility for a share of revenues from auctioning the land for private
development). In the medium term, all agencies should maintain land inventories and be
responsible for protecting their land from unauthorized use. Hawassa has positive experience
with such land reallocations, which could be leveraged in other areas (Subsection 3.2).


R3.       Moderate land consumption by government entities and for public purposes, in
order to increase efficiency of land use and reduce the costs of urban development.
Allocation of free-of-charge land for government agencies to provide public services,
including basic utilities, needs to be based on more efficient land utilization patterns
(densities, etc.). This would be consistent with international good practices; many
governments are minimizing their footprint as well as land and floor space consumption,
locating their offices in modest, not prime, locations, and using their real estate occupancy or
land development to revitalize neighborhoods. In addition, land consumption planned for
public use (e. g. roads) can be reduced according to international good practices, particularly
in newly urbanized territories.

R4.     Diversify land allocation mechanisms with different pricing implications, in
order to improve cost recovery for the government and provide cross-subsidies for the
needy. Key forms of land allocation (direct allocations, lotteries, various types of auctions,
and requests for proposals), along with land pricing associated with each form and suggested
applicability of these forms, are presented in Annex 5. No single instrument is universally
applicable for all situations. Therefore, a diversified approach is recommended. For example,
while allocating land on newly-subdivided territories, several allocation forms and associated
land pricing can be combined (a schematic illustration shown in Figure 25):
     A small number of small parcels inside blocks can be allocated at below-cost prices
        via direct allocation or lottery to low-income people (a cross-subsidy that is facilitated


                                               91
                                 Section 4: The Path Forward




       by other methods, such as auctioning, without compromising the ability to cover the
       cost of acquiring and servicing the land);
      Some other, slightly larger parcels can be allocated at prices that are above-the-cost of
       land to government (i.e. the cost of land acquisition and infrastructure provision), also
       via direct allocation or lottery, to people from the waitlist;
      Some blocks of parcels can be sold at auction, but with limited access to participation
       (e.g. for housing cooperatives only) and starting prices just above-the -cost of land to
       government;
      Finally, some of the best-located parcels (corner parcels, parcels along main streets /
       roads) can be sold at open auction with starting prices slightly below estimated market
       value, in order to maximize revenues from these auctions and use proceeds to cross-
       subsidize below-cost allocations inside the block.

Figure 25: A Schematic Example of Using Diversified Land Allocation Mechanisms within the
Same Territory




Such a combined approach would allow recovery of all or most of the costs of making this
land available for development by cross subsidizing between uses and beneficiaries. At the
same time, when single parcels of government land are allocated for commercial uses
(including non-subsidized housing), particularly when in desirable locations, as a rule, these
parcels should be allocated through auctions. In general, the share of land allocated at market
value or, at the very least, above cost recovery for land acquisition and infrastructure, should
be increased substantially from the current small proportion.

In particular, it is critical that the government stop uncontrolled hidden subsidies when
allocating land for free or below market prices (e.g. for condominiums), as these subsidies go
to private developers and buyers of condominiums at the end of the chain rather than benefit
the broader public or low-income people. Moreover, pricing land at market value would
moderate land consumption and reduce the amount of land needed to accommodate
population growth, with an important positive impact on mobility and productivity. Further,
revenues from land allocation (and auctions in particular) should be earmarked for
infrastructure development or other capital investment in social infrastructure.

R5.     Start and continue building capacity of local governments and local consulting
entities on land economics, land management, and urban planning. Key issues include
the impact that land use planning requirements and limitations (e.g. proportion of land
reserved for public use, land coverage, and building heights) have on productivity of urban
land and its value (Box 9). Another skill acutely needed is the ability to estimate the cost of
implementation of urban development plans.

Box 9: Using the Bertaud Model to Examine How Land Use Influences Market Value

 The Bertaud Model is a spreadsheet model that connects parameters of land uses on a specific land
 site, all costs of real estate development, and expected revenues from the final real estate product. It
 allows a user to calculate land use parameters (such as maximum land coverage, number of floors,
 etc.) that would make market-oriented real estate development attractive for private investors. It also
 suggests starting land prices for municipal land auctions. Calculations are based on prices typical for
 the local real estate market, construction and development costs, and assumptions about the
 expected profit of a developer.
 The model has been widely used internationally by the World Bank and adopted by governments
 and private consultants. For example, this model was used for proposed residential, commercial, and
 mixed-use development projects in Russia (Kazan, Nizhni Novgorod, Novgorod, St. Petersburg, and
 Tver), and it proved its worth in all cities. It also was used in training for urban planners in seven
 Balkan countries and the Kyrgyz Republic.


4.2.2      Medium Term

R6.     Revise rural and urban land rights in a way that harmonizes them, particularly
in territories subject to rural-to-urban conversion. According to good international
practices, holders of rural land should be allowed to convert it into land for development in
alignment with urban growth and service delivery plans, and to benefit from its increased
value (in one form or another) along with the community or government.

R7.     Better utilize the private sector in closer cooperation with government for urban
development, through forms of cooperation such as “land readjustment” or “land
pooling.” Given that current practices are unsustainable fiscally, spatially, and socially, they
need to be gradually replaced. In particular, land expropriation in areas of urban expansion
needs to be reduced to the absolute minimum required for public infrastructure. Developing
the rest of the needed land can be achieved through a combination of tools, including better
targeted urban planning (e.g. selection of urban growth areas where minimal expropriation
will be needed), reduced land consumption through higher density of land use, and use of
participatory techniques of land assemblage for development (such as government-led land
assemblage and “land readjustment” and “land pooling”—Box 10 and Annex 4).

R8.       Substantially simplify the urban land leasing system with the purpose of
making lease rights investment-friendly for private holders, and easily manageable for
local governments. In particular, lease payments need to be simplified and standardized to
equal annual payments during the total duration of a lease (with periodic inflation adjustment
but without interest incurred on future lease payments). Winners at auctions need to be
determined by one simple criterion—the highest price offered—as is universally practiced in
international auctions. In the Ethiopian context, this would mean the highest annual lease
offered. Further, draconian measures against leaseholders deviating from government-

imposed construction schedules need to be removed or substantially relaxed. Such controls
would not be needed if the lease is priced at market value, since land holders will incur costs
if they delay action. Moreover, in market economies, investors and developers need flexible
time frames for construction, to respond to market demand signals.171

R9.     Substantially modify and modernize the system of urban spatial and land use
planning, along with building standards for small-scale housing. Rigid and static land use
planning, typical for many counties, is giving way to more market-responsive systems. The
current Ethiopian Urban Plan Preparation and Implementation Strategy already signals a
positive shift in this direction. Elements included in the list below, many of which are
interrelated, would help modernize urban planning practices further:

         Regional and local governments need to have more flexibility in establishing
          standards and requirements for spatial and land use planning documents (along with
          building standards for small-scale housing). This would allow the creation of
          standards reflecting what ULGs and local residents can afford at a particular time,
          within the paradigm of “fit for purpose” 172 , as opposed to the current centralized
          standards that reflect city’s size and grade but still are oriented toward international
          standards173 that are used in countries with higher financial and human capacities. For
          example, is it reasonable to consider chika houses illegal when they represent
          80 percent of urban housing stock and are often the only form of housing that people
          can afford? 174 As areas become more prosperous and as higher standards become
          more affordable, land use and construction standards can be revised locally. Also, as
          soon as people have more secure land rights, they will invest voluntarily in improving
          their homes.
         Overall policy needs to aim at reducing the number of rules and regulated parameters
          to the minimum that society can afford. A useful tool can be a regulatory audit to
          review the body of regulations and identify those for which costs (monetary and
          social) exceed the benefits they produce.175
         Land use plans must be based on current maps of land use, which can be obtained
          through inexpensive satellite imagery. In particular, these plans need to realistically
          reflect and respond to the presence of informal settlements, and should be coordinated
          with relevant local policies.
         Before spatial and land use plans are approved, a “price tag” should estimate
          government implementation costs, including the cost of land acquisition or
          expropriation and the cost of public infrastructure stipulated in the plan (roads, water,
          etc.). Knowing the expected costs would stimulate the government to ask for
          affordable planning options.
         Moderate land consumption standards should be used when planning how much new
          land is needed for urban expansion.
         The objective of the Urban Land Development and Management Policy and Strategy
          that establishes land use proportions (30% roads and infrastructure, 30% social, and
          40% economic/construction) needs to be reexamined, as this target may be neither
          feasible nor beneficial for sustainable urban development.
         Permitted land use densities within existing city borders should be increased.
          Permitting high densities is especially critical where the market value of land can be
          high, as in city centers or along main transport arteries and public transport routes.
          The intent is to permit densities that do not limit market demand. For example, even if

            the market is expected to ask no more than a floor-to-area-ratio of five, the regulation
            should allow a somewhat higher threshold to adjust for market changes. Further,
            internationally known methods of increasing land use density need to be applied, e.g.
            through spatial design, mixed use, and later such advanced instruments as density
            bonuses and tradable development rights. Such measures would help reduce
            development of informal settlements and increase efficiency of urbanization.
           Among all land use planning goals and related land management tools, a top priority
            should be planning and securing land for an adequate street network as well as public
            open spaces.176
           Mixed-use planning should continue to be promoted in practice at the city level. The
            Urban Plan Preparation and Implementation Strategy already requires that any
            residential land use be planned as mixed use instead. The Addis Ababa 2013
            Structural Development Plan follows this rule and defines all residential zones as
            mixed use (although it is unclear whether other cities already follow this rule).
            Further, mixed use of land should be permitted and encouraged for nonresidential use
            as well, when functions are not mutually exclusive for ecological or health reasons.
            Areas for mono-use (e.g. “industrial”) should be phased out to not more than 10–
            15 percent of the territory, according to international good practice.177

R10. Better coordination of infrastructure planning and delivery with land use
planning. In particular, allowing higher land use densities may require increasing capacity of
public infrastructure in these areas (roads, water, schools, etc.), which should be planned,
financed, and delivered accordingly.

R11. Encourage and support local experiments, and publicize successful experiences.
Though developing and adopting the concept of reform is a matter of national importance, the
complexity of land reform warrants local experiments with land reform before moving to
countrywide implementation. For example, the government, perhaps with donors’ assistance,
may allow legal pilot experiments with property rights, land re-adjustment, and farmers
supply of land on the market. Positive local experiences, such as reallocation of land held by
government agencies in Hawassa or regularization of informal settlement in Dire Dawa,
deserve national dissemination.

4.2.3            Long Term

R12. Establish a system for registering property rights of urban holders (a legal
cadaster) developed within a unified minimum set of requirements and made simple
enough to secure long-term operational sustainability. It may be wise to not try to
reproduce the cadaster system set up in Addis Ababa and other cities, given the complexity
and cost of operations. Instead, simpler systems should be considered:

           Special state property registration bodies need to be established, and local
            governments relieved from sole registration responsibility.

                                            Section 4: The Path Forward




           The urban registration system needs to be made compatible with land certification in
            rural areas, particularly to accommodate the rural registration and certification
            documents in kebeles converted from rural to urban jurisdictions.
           According to a 2014 international generalization of past experiences with cadaster
            systems in developing countries, the systems that work and can be sustained over time
            possess such key qualities as:178
              Affordability for the government to establish and operate and for society to use;
              Attainable terms of establishing the system within a short time frame and
                available resources; and potential for
              Ability to incrementally upgrade and improve over time, in response to social and
                legal needs and emerging economic opportunities.

R13. Review and revise land administration regulations and building standards. A
general direction should be legalization and regularization of regulations and standards, as
already required by the Urban Land Development and Management Policy and Strategy.
Simultaneously, the current scope of regulations and standards need to better reflect local
conditions. For example, rules on land use and construction standards could be modified to
allow for more flexibility and draw on a graduated approach to better accommodate the
ability of lower income groups to meet these rules. These rules can be developed and refined
through consultations with local communities to comport with their specific needs and
expectations. Positive local experiences with legalization of informal settlements, as with
Dire Dawa, can be used and further improved.

R14. Clarify justifications for government expropriation of land. In particular,
determine in laws and regulations what constitutes a valid public purpose for
expropriation, and improve the procedural elements. Current regulations, along with the
timelines set for expropriation, compensation, and appeals, substantially deviate from
international best practices. Updating practices could start by documenting and discussing the
extent to which current expropriations in rural and urban areas are in line with, or deviate
from, international best practices, particularly when current requirements affect households’
ability to maintain their livelihoods. This collected evidence will be valuable in
recommending regulatory and procedural changes at the federal and regional levels, which
might include: assistance to region governments on harmonizing regulations on land
valuation; structuring compensation for expropriation; and establishing administrative
appeals procedures independent of the expropriating agency and representative of all
stakeholders. The government can then put in place programs to build expertise, based on
realistic estimates of administrative capacity required for such changes.

R15. Recognize the true value of land and help create a market-based land valuation
and compensation system. Government transactions with land, including allocation and
expropriation, need to reflect (to a greater or lesser degree) the market value of land, even
when this value is not used in a particular transaction (such as direct allocations at below-
market, cost-recovery prices). In particular, “market-led compensation” for land
expropriation is an acute issue. To estimate the market value of land and prevent land-related
conflicts, local governments and other market participants need access to two important
elements of real estate market infrastructure (to be further developed):

                                  Section 4: The Path Forward




         A trained cadre of appraisers. This can be achieved through the private sector and
          educational or training institutions, with the help of international professional
          organizations, such as the Counselors of Real Estate (United States) or the Royal
          Institution of Chartered Surveyors (United Kingdom), and supported by donor
          organizations if needed.
         Access to data on property transactions, with basic attributes of the property.
          Local governments must be obliged to publish such data on each parcel they auction.
          The data on private-to-private transactions should eventually be published by the
          cadaster (property registration) offices. Private sector entities (real estate brokers,
          banks, private appraisers, etc.) should be encouraged to share these data voluntarily,
          for example through professional associations or by promoting advantages of multiple
          listing services.


4.3         Urban Management and Governance

4.3.1        Institutional Structures

146. Since the early 2000s, Ethiopia has devolved substantial legal authority and
responsibility for service delivery to ULGs. But despite ULGs’ increasing importance in
local governance, they are constrained in carrying out their mandates because key powers are
still retained by regional governments. This issue is particularly pronounced in municipal
finance, personnel management and land management.

147. Regional governments retain control of key legislative functions in areas such as;
financial and tariff regulations, personnel management (including deciding on ULG level
staffing, functions, and salaries, the power to set wage rates, add or eliminate positions and
change the classification of a position), and the definition of land use categories. This is not
only significantly limiting for ULGs to properly carry out their mandates, but at times also
contrary to the proclamations for the organization of ULGs in the regions.

148. The existing legal and institutional structures do not make a clear distinction
between state and municipal functions at the local government level. Local governments
in Ethiopia are responsible for a significant number of essential municipal services and state-
level functions which they execute on behalf of their respective regional governments.
However, legislation for functional assignments is open for interpretation and ULG duties
can be assigned inconsistently or without the assignment of necessary revenue to finance the
function.

4.3.2        Organizational Structures

149. ULGs have very limited ability to determine their organizational structures in
line with their particular local imperatives. Internal organizational structure of a ULG is,
in principle, to be decided by the ULG. Some legislations (such as the Amhara City
Proclamation) even make this explicit by law. However, in practice, while it is true that
ULGs hire their own staff, decisions on their staffing levels, employment conditions and
enumeration and even the level of qualifications for particular posts (pay grades) are
determined by the state bureaus of civil service. Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible, for


                                                99
                                 Section 4: The Path Forward




ULGs to design their particular organizational structures to best address their own contexts,
or provide incentive packages to address their particular human resource (HR) needs.

150. Many direct household municipal services such as collecting garbage, emptying
pit latrines, and maintaining drainage systems are carried out at the kebele level.
Kebeles provide a range of services that can be difficult to deliver effectively and efficiently
from one administrative center. Most cities with multiple service centers – kebeles – are often
better at mobilizing local resources for service delivery. The extent of decentralization to
kebeles varies among regions and ULGs. Subcities in Mekele, for instance, have their own
budget and autonomy, while all these functions are centralized in Bahir Dar.

4.3.3      Capacity

151. Many cities simply lack human and financial resources to provide effective
governance and service delivery. Fieldwork conducted for this study, along with other
analysis, suggests that a very basic level of local capacity to perform key municipal functions
exists, with significant variation across ULGs, notably on key areas such as participatory
planning and identification of priorities, procurement, financial management, asset
management, operation and maintenance, and revenue collection. It is important to note the
capacity variation between cities in the ULGDP and cities which are either recently included,
or not included in ULGDP. Notwithstanding these, there is rarely enough staff for
infrastructure creation and management in almost all ULGs. Further, the overall capacity of
local government staff is low, and no ULG has the full staffing for approved posts.

152. There is a need for deepening the understanding of HR management issues in
ULGs. While there is a wide recognition of existence of problems related to staff retention
and motivation in ULGs, a substantive and robust analysis on the topic is lacking.

153. The shortcomings on institutional, organization and capacity structures are
interlinked and mutually compounding, where the lack of actual power to design the
appropriate organizational structures and employ (and retain) adequately qualified staff
compounds the existing capacity problems.

154. Both the federal government and the regional governments will have important
roles to play in reforming and strengthening the urban local government system. The
federal government’s role in providing the overall guidance, direction, enabling environment
and leadership for the overall reform will be key. The regional governments, on the other
hand, will have the crucial role of actually executing the reforms, as they have the legal
relationship with and oversight over most local governance matters. Therefore, the regional
governments will be the de-facto implementing entities of the changes suggested below.

155. In light of these issues, options for reform to urban governance and institutions
presented below may offer a path to making urbanization work better for Ethiopia:

R16. Create a comprehensive list of local government responsibilities, along with a
clear distinction between mandatory or permissible functions. MUDHCo realizes that
there are shortcomings in the current legislative framework and has started an exercise to




                                              100
                                       Section 4: The Path Forward




address these problems. 179 In doing so, special attention should be paid to state level
mandates without the necessary state level revenue assignments.

R17. Align ULG powers with mandates - particularly in municipal revenue, staffing
and land management. Local officials must be able to restructure their organizational setup
to correspond with community priorities and other local contexts. To do this, they need to be
able to determine their own human resource needs, set wage scales and capacity. To attract
and develop qualified personnel, ULGs must be given the incentives to have flexible salary
structures for responding to local conditions, and to provide training.

R18. Invest in human resource capacity at the ULG level. On the one hand, Ethiopia’s
local governments are responsible for delivering a long list of key services. On the other
hand, they suffer from chronic staff shortage and are not able to attract qualified personnel.
Correcting this imbalance in the nearest term will be key in ensuring that ULGs are able to
properly execute all mandates assigned to them. To do this, the federal government needs to
significantly ramp up its efforts, in collaboration with the Ethiopian Civil Service College and
other possible training providers, in training staff with necessary urban management and
governance skills. In parallel, and in cooperation with regional governments, the federal
government needs to help ULGs introduce staff retention and talent development incentive
schemes.

R19. Conduct a follow-on analysis on urban institutional strengthening and capacity
building. This urbanization review shows the need for a significant amount of institutional
strengthening regarding the powers, mandates, structures and human resource establishments
of urban local governments, and capacity building, pertaining to the administrative and
operating systems and skills levels of local governments in Ethiopia. A number of key
recommendations have been made to help improve these. However, a follow-on analysis,
covering both of these above dimensions is suggested. This work, at the institutional level,
should build on this report’s analysis and examine the structural and institutional weaknesses
of the urban local government system. It should provide detailed proposals for the
development of specific institutional reforms to the local government external and internal
institutional structures. Secondly, the work should undertake a detailed assessment of the
operating systems and human resource capacities of urban local governments. Further, the
follow-on work should develop a capacity-building strategy and action plan, to be executed in
cooperation with the institutional-strengthening plan, covering actions of the national and
regional governments.


4.4        Municipal Finance

156. Financing needs of rapidly growing urban areas in Ethiopia are mostly expected
to be addressed through meager municipal own-source revenues. This points to a
disconnect between the significant funding requirements of rapidly growing cities and the
overall system to provide the capital and recurrent resources for these requirements.

                                Section 4: The Path Forward




157. Budgetary and public financial management (PFM) systems in Ethiopia require
a more robust system of reporting and monitoring municipal expenditures and
intergovernmental fiscal transfers. There is also a lack of systematic data collection and
reporting on municipal revenues at all three levels of government.

158. Consolidated government accounts present data on spending and revenues at
each level—federal, state, and woreda—but essentially ignore intergovernmental fiscal
flows. This would be appropriate if all government levels were administrative tiers of the
same government entity, as often found in centrally-planned economies and de-concentrated
systems. In a devolved system such as Ethiopia’s, intergovernmental fiscal transfers from one
government level to another should be systematically captured in government financial
reports, on revenue and expenditure sides at each government level.

159. BOFEDs are responsible for guiding and supporting ULGs in enhancing own-
source revenues. In practice, however, the BOFED and regional revenue authority seem to
focus almost exclusively on state revenues. Similarly, too few regional Bureaus of Urban
Development provide good practices on enhancing municipal revenues, although they
technically backstop ULGs for preparing revenue-enhancement plans for ULGDP. Site visits
suggest that these bureaus are generally inappropriately staffed—nor do they have the
necessary technical skills—to effectively champion and backstop municipal revenue
collections within their regional state.

160. Federal policy leadership on municipal revenues needs to be improved. MoFED
is the steward of all public finances in Ethiopia, including municipal finances. In 2008 it was
given the task of helping enhance municipal finances, a role previously played by MUDHCo.
MoFED delegated this role to ERCA, without making the necessary amendment to the
proclamation that established ERCA to include this new mandate. Thus ERCA, the sole
federal entity formally tasked with guiding municipal revenue enhancement, is not focusing
on municipal revenues. MUDHCo, the federal entity that interacts with ULGs on a daily basis
for coordinating a range of responses on urban municipal-revenue issues (such as potentially
introducing a property tax system and implementing the largest local government program in
the country, the ULGDP) does not have a systematic approach to coordinating activities with
MoFED or ERCA.

161. With these issues in mind, a three-pronged approach is suggested to improve
urban financing in Ethiopia. In the short run, a set of measures are proposed to help
enhance the municipal own-source revenues collected, while in the medium run, changing the
fiscal architecture to widen the fiscal resources available to local governments and improving
the budgeting and accounting system are recommended, as detailed below.

4.4.1      Short run: Enhancing municipal own-source revenues

R20. Conduct a study to provide details on and implementation guidance for
improving urban financing in Ethiopia. The scope of this urbanization review is to provide
an overall analysis of urban financing and possible pathways to help improve the system.
Given the analysis in this study, which shows a disconnect between urban financing needs
and the fiscal system, a follow-on analysis is recommended, which would build upon the
analysis and recommendations presented in this report and would focus on the details and
next steps of improving financing for urban, drawing from international good practice.


                                             102
                                         Section 4: The Path Forward




R21. Strengthen the fiscal autonomy of cities through reforms to municipal finance.
Because municipal service delivery is mostly financed through a city’s own-source revenue,
ULGs have to raise enough revenue to properly deliver services. Cities need autonomy to
recover direct costs of service delivery through transparent and accountable processes and
systems. ULGs should therefore not be constrained by outdated tariff schedules set at the
regional level, which limit their revenue-raising potential. Possible solutions include giving
ULGs a rate and tariff band within which they can set rates without the approval of the
regional governments.

R22. Introduce true user costing. The present tax and fee system is based, theoretically,
on recovering from users or beneficiaries the costs of municipal service provision. At present,
however, municipalities do not use any program or project cost information in setting fees,
and in fact do not have the legal discretion to do so. As urban capital investment gains speed,
the ability to identify and allocate costs to users will become crucial, requiring both the
capacity (and information) to accurately identify costs, and the legal ability to allocate
project-specific costs to users, in the form of true cost-based user fees.

R23. Introduce automatic inflation adjustments for municipal fees and charges. Given
the analysis presented in the main text of this report, which shows that the annual growth of
municipal revenue was slower than inflation, GDP growth, and overall public revenue growth
between 1999 and 2004, introducing automatic inflation adjustment for municipal revenues,
which are currently determined in nominal terms, can stop the erosion of these revenues.

R24. Consider allowing local governments to keep state revenues generated in excess
of targets as an incentive for increased revenue collection at the local level, which would
enable better service delivery. Steps should be taken to incentivize regional governments to
allow the local governments in their jurisdictions to have greater control over state revenues
generated in excess of the threshold agreed at the start of the fiscal year. As mentioned in the
main text, Hawassa is an interesting example in this respect, which should be studied further
and with necessary adjustments, replicated in other ULGs.

R25. Coordinate federal support for municipal revenue more tightly. Two key
measures need to be adopted. First, assess whether ERCA is the ideal entity to support ULG
own-source revenue-mobilization efforts on behalf of MoFED. If so, its founding
proclamation should be amended to include this additional task in its mandate, and its human
resources should be aligned with it. Second, ensure cooperation among local representatives
of MoFED, MUDHCo, and ERCA to secure coherent support to ULGs. The regional revenue
consultation workshops proposed under ULGDP II could present an ideal platform for this.180
Ensuring that these proposed consultations take place and include non-ULGDP ULGs would
be a good start.

R26. Exercise caution on the potential idea of introducing a property tax system.
Introducing such a system while fundamental land management challenges persist requires
careful policy analysis and solid preparation for any changes. Thus property tax reform
should be viewed as an intermediate- to longer-term issue, which needs to be approached in


180The aim is to bring together ULGs with all federal and regional entities working on municipal revenues once every two
years, in order to review ULG revenue-enhancement plans and to update tariff proclamations.

parallel with urban land management policy reforms and thoroughly examined with all the
parties to be involved in its administration and revenue payment—most important, citizens.

4.4.2      Medium run: Revisiting the fiscal architecture and improving public
           budgeting and accounting system

R27. Increase investment in urban development, to help reduce the extensive
investment gap. The current system of urban development financing is insufficient. The
majority of investment is based on municipal own-source revenue, which is limited. Targeted
efforts to increase municipal own-source revenues of ULGs should be a high priority, to be
accompanied by an increase in the scope of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, targeting
ULGs.

R28. Ensure that Addis’ infrastructure and institutional needs are adequately
addressed. Addis Ababa does not receive block grants from the federal government. Instead,
it is given extensive powers to raise own-source revenue and it benefits from grants received
from federal government’s engagement in international financing sources. However, the
actual revenue collected in Addis on a per capita basis is not significantly higher than other
ULGs. The on-grant infrastructure funding it receives through federal government
international borrowing is ad-hoc and does not cover more than 10 to 15 percent of its
infrastructure expenditure. Given Addis’ importance, the financing system that is supposed to
meet its investment needs should be revised and better aligned with its real needs.

R29. Bring systematic clarity and proper regulation on subnational borrowing . A two
tiered approach is recommended:

        i. At the national level, introduce rules and regulations that will target: (i)
           eliminating current potential risks of contingent liabilities by regulating
           guarantees to be provided by subnational entities to their entities, authorities or
           enterprises; (ii) introduction of a subnational insolvency/bankruptcy framework;
           (iii) subnational debt management ratios; (iv) elimination of the potential moral
           hazard risk introduced by full federal guarantee of subnational debt to pave the
           way for heavier reliance on municipal credit evaluation, rather than the current
           practice of exclusively relying on sovereign guarantee; (v) limiting subnational
           debt relative to the Central Bank of Ethiopia’s capital base to prevent a possible
           destabilization of the country’s largest bank.

        ii. For managing Addis’ debt, the city needs to: (a) introduce a debt policy to clarify
            the limits to guarantees that it may issue to its constituent agencies; and (b)
            develop a specific reporting on all the debt the city has guaranteed and is
            potentially liable to pay if the guaranteed entity does not meet its obligations.
            Thus, Addis should develop a set of consolidated accounts which shows not only
            direct city budget but also the accounts of off-budget entities for which the city is
            sole owner and over which it has some level of decision-making authority as well
            as may be at risk for potential liabilities.

R30. Prepare a periodic analysis (i.e. once every three years) of intergovernmental
finance, similar to South Africa’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Review. Such an analysis



                                               104
                                Section 4: The Path Forward




would provide an ongoing evidence base for policy discussions on urban (municipal) finance
in Ethiopia.

R31. Improve the government’s chart of accounts and the budgetary accounting and
reporting processes. The recommendation on the periodic review of intergovernmental
fiscal transfer system cannot be implemented in the current state of financial reporting
systems in Ethiopia, simply because there is no consistent data to properly analyze flows
between regional and local governments. The key goal of improving the budget accounting
and reporting is to ensure that intergovernmental fiscal transfers (block grants and earmarked
funds) are properly and consistently accounted for at all three government levels as revenue
and expenditure sources, per International Monetary Fund budget classification.

R32. Improve reporting on municipal revenue collections at all government levels . For
instance, in order to ensure clarity and consistency, municipalities need to consistently use
the revenue classification codes contained in the chart of accounts as they prepare their
budget documents, their revenue-enhancement plans, and the revenue reports produced
upward to the regional level. Enhanced municipal revenue transparency toward local
taxpayers is a hallmark of sound local revenue practices. (The World Bank Ethiopia team,
through its financial management and urban practices and operations, is working closely with
the government on public financial management (PFM) solutions for local governments and
woredas.) In the long run, as the PFM system in Ethiopia matures, cities should transition to
accrual accounting, although given current capacity this will be challenging in the short run.
An ideal incremental approach would be to start with rolling out a modified cash system in all
cities. Once these practices have matured, other options, including accrual accounting, can be
considered.

R33. Introduce more transparent budget practices at the regional government level.
This would entail proper inclusion of ULGDP funding as revenue (subsidy) to the regional
state, while recording the grant allocations to city administrations as intergovernmental
transfers in the regional state budget.


4.5      Targeted Interventions

4.5.1      Jobs and Competitiveness

162. Ethiopia has a small, yet significant, window of opportunity to exploit its
demographic dividend. Its labor force doubled over the past two decades, and it continues to
have a very large youth bulge entering the labor market in the next 20 years. Many of these
young people will be moving to cities in search of employment. Urbanization could become
one of the most important catalysts to tackle economic growth and job creation in the next
few years, even decades. Cities should aim to create the conditions for entrepreneurs, firms,
and industries to become competitive, to which end the following options are put forward.

R34. Identify and invest in cities’ competitive advantage. Secondary and smaller cities
are seeing the growth of naturally forming industrial clusters, while Addis Ababa’s advantage
seems to lie in its diverse industrial structure. As the government’s Micro, Small, and
Medium Enterprise Strategy notes, not all cities will be able to attract medium and large
enterprises in equal measure; cities will end up specializing in particular sectors and


                                             105
                                    Section 4: The Path Forward




industries. Cities in Ethiopia will have different functions, and their capital and labor needs
will differ accordingly. The government can encourage discrete growth corridors (e.g. Bahir
Dar–Gonder, Mekele–Dessie, Harar–Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa–Hawassa) by
strengthening inter- and intracity cluster links and providing the necessary infrastructure.
More generally, cities should develop their local economic development strategies (Box 11)
and invest in quick-wins for identifying and exploiting their comparative and competitive
advantages.

Box 11: Identifying the success of local economic development strategies

 Local economic development (LED) strategies are a structured attempt at planning and organizing
 interventions at a subnational level, with the aim of improving city competitiveness outcomes. In
 developing countries, these strategies are often posed as a choice between poverty alleviation,
 survival, and self-reliance on the one hand, and participation in the global economy, competitiveness,
 and finding niche markets on the other. This has sometimes created LEDs in emerging countries and
 cities with no extended engagement of the private sector, limited pro-poor interventions, and a failure
 to spur job creation and economic growth. A review of the literature of the common success factors for
 strategic economic development initiatives, particularly in low-income, low-capacity contexts, yields
 the following:
 1. Factors such as leadership, long-term commitment, consensus building, and stakeholder
    participation are common to economic development strategies in many different environments.
 2. However, some new themes emerge that are relevant to low-capacity cities:
        Sustainable funding for strategy implementation and other forms of continuity (like
         institutionalizing the strategy to protect it from political change) are important.
        Strategies should move quickly by taking up tangible, manageable projects and getting the
         coordination working—in other words, placing more focus on coordination than on large
         projects.
        Analytic work is often neglected in LED but it is important in setting a good direction for
         interventions. However, not all such work is equal, and the particular types of analysis
         (especially involving outreach to private stakeholders) can yield large gains.

R35. Identify and invest in growing the “missing middle” of companies and jobs
across urban areas. Most of existing employment takes place within small, entrepreneurial
firms, many of which are also informal. At the same time, new and sustained job creation in
Ethiopia comes from medium and large firms. Small entrepreneurial firms seldom sustain

                                                   106
                                           Section 4: The Path Forward




increases in job creation. In particular, the quality of employment and associated incomes is
low, suggesting that self-employment will not be a panacea for robust economic growth.
Franklin (2014) finds that young people often turn to self-employment while searching for
stable jobs, frequently involving long periods of transition. Wage employment is crucial to
job growth and sustainability, but Ethiopia has a sizable “missing middle” – mid-sized firms
that have the ability to sustain large increases in employment. Research (in Ethiopia and
elsewhere) demonstrates that waged employment is associated with a fall in urban poverty
and the emergence of more formal employment, the latter also increasing with city size.
Stable employment in developing countries has been associated strongly with the emergence
of a middle class, which in turn leads to faster growth. In fact, most waged-employment is in
the formal sector, while self-employment is mostly informal and mostly young. This suggests
that firm graduation from small to medium to large sizes, and the creation of stable jobs, will
be crucial for growth and for poverty reduction. These patterns differ across cities—city size
affects the emergence of formal and waged-employment—and so cities must identify and
invest in the factors that allow existing firms to expand and create new jobs, and that
encourage firms to graduate, such as better regulated taxes and access to infrastructure.

R36. Target interventions according to the constraints and the needs of different
typologies of firms. The Government of Ethiopia has already taken several steps to target job
creation across the spectrum – for instance, the Micro and Small Enterprise Development
Agency focuses attention on the needs of micro/small firm. Secondary cities are becoming
hubs for medium-sized firms owing to the emergence of clusters, and the Ministry of Industry
is using industrial zones to attract investment across different regions by large firms (whether
foreign or domestic). These initiatives could be strengthened further:

         Household/Informal Enterprises: 181 Local governments can have a large policy
          remit with regard to targeting household and/or unregistered, i.e. informal,
          enterprises. Indeed, developing country cities have used several innovative
          approaches to create an environment conducive to the growth of such enterprises.
          Although returns to urban informal sector activities are significantly lower than to
          formal work (often because these activities offer less security of income and
          tenure182), these enterprises provide much needed employment and services to those at
          the bottom of the pyramid. Addis Ababa has provided targeted assistance to informal
          vendors to overcome key barriers – see Box 12. Other countries, for instance
          Mozambique, 183 have tried to liberalize labor-market policies, and simultaneously
          bring down the costs of doing business and living, enabling even micro firms to grow.

         Small enterprises: Global evidence suggests that small and informal firms produce
          and sell low-quality goods and services, effectively meeting the demand for these
          products in developing countries. And while they tend to suffer from low levels of
          productivity, there is much scope for increases in operational efficiency and size if
          they are provided an opportunity to tap larger markets, with labor, technology and
          other inputs to production. Thus, local and national governments should provide light-
181 Many of the micro and small enterprises in the country operate within the informal economy. Production within the sector
is characterized by a lack of skilled labour and social protection, unregulated markets, family ownership of enterprises, and
small-scale operations usually involving own or family labour and indigenous technology.

       touch, supportive regulation of household-enterprises, aimed at ameliorating their
       constraints without adding to regulatory burdens. This could be achieved by: (i) the
       provision of small-scale facilities that allow enterprises to enjoy the advantages of co-
       location exploiting buyer-supplier, labor market and technology linkages; and (ii)
       support the development of small-scale businesses in sectors which have significant
       potential and can expand symbiotically with formal sector enterprises e.g. “boda
       boda” motorbikes feeding BRTs (see Box 13).

      Mid-size enterprises: The research illustrates that improvements in local business
       licensing and permitting systems help firms to grow more rapidly. The ability and
       capacity of urban local governments to manage their growing administrative remit
       (especially in cities with newly-expanded mandates) is crucial – firms interviewed in
       different sub-cities in Addis repeatedly identified the low capacity of public-sector
       employees as an important constraint on productivity. In addition, ULGs should also
       consider extending some of the enterprise support services, including access to space
       and facilities being provided to start-ups, to existing firms to enable them to expand
       operations faster.

R37. Large enterprises: Large enterprises in Ethiopia account for the bulk of sustained job
creation in the manufacturing sector, and their continued success has much to do with the
city-level business environment – including factors such as licensing, permitting and tax
systems. The implementation of these systems fall under the remit of ULGs (even if rates and
bands are set by regional and/or national government) with effective implementation a
function of local capacity. Availability of serviced land and infrastructure also matter greatly
to large investors. The federal government has taken several policy measures to support
industrialization across the country, including the creation of industrial zones close to major
urban centers, including in and around Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. There is a need for a
better understanding of how best to maximize the potential benefits of the co-location of
cities and industrial zones, owing to their linkages across strategic objectives (jobs,
investment), spatial policies (access to land and infrastructure) and industry-level issues
(access to labor and final markets, regulations).

Box 12: Using clusters to help informal firms in Addis Ababa




 The Addis Ababa city administration is using a cluster-based approach as an instrument to
 monitor and help urban micro and informal enterprises to overcome constraints to growth. In
 Kaliti, a sub-city within Addis Ababa, there are 270 informal traders operating within
 Government-supplied temporary sheds. Interviews carried out with the traders revealed that
 these were street vendors who had been relocated by local authorities. One of the street vendors
 stated that he has now been operating in Kaliti for almost four months – before this, his modus
 operandi involved walking around, selling his goods, while trying to avoid attention by the
 police or formal authorities. In his words, “If they had caught me, they would have confiscated
 my goods”. Not only were traders given temporary sheds, but they were also organized into
 savings groups – and interestingly, were exempt from any taxes, business registration and
 licensing fees.

 The city is able to regulate, albeit partially, the informal sector by limiting activities into
 spatially concentrated pockets. There is also a better understanding of the sector, which was
 previously almost entirely in the shadows. Evidence from the city of Bangkok reveals how
 metropolitan governments can use public space cleverly to find space for vendors, allowing for
 the growth of a dynamic consumption economy within the city (see Gisèle, Y and Nirathro, N.
 2014).

Box 13: Formal-informal linkages in urban transport

 Boda Boda – motorcycle taxis – in Uganda and neighboring countries, like Kenya, operate when
 more conventional services are uneconomic or physically impossible. They provide vital feeder
 services to major public transport routes. They primarily provide three types of - predominantly -
 short-distance services: (i) within the main urban areas, where they compete with conventional
 sole hire taxis and taxis; (ii) as feeders to urban areas on routes that - due either to the low density
 of demand or the roughness of the route - are unattractive to taxis; and (iii) as feeders to the main
 roads in which role they tend to complement taxi and large capacity bus services.
 In many areas they are run by micro or household enterprises and tend to be in the informal sector,
 or run by loosely organized operator associations. Nonetheless, their functions are complementary
 to those in the formal transport sector, and they meet an important element of demand for urban
 transportation. Because of their limited capacity travel costs per km are 2-7 times those of large
 capacity buses, but cheaper than hire taxis. Their popularity derives from the convenience they
 offer and ability to meet demands that other services cannot. User surveys suggest that median use
 of boda boda services by users was four years, with 15 percent claiming more than 8 years. For
 over 90 percent of men and women users, boda boda services increased the range and number of
 the activities in which they engage, at the time increasing their personal performance and output.
 In Uganda alone, 7 percent of the population depend for part of their livelihood on the industry.
 The livelihoods of a further 100,000 people sare supported from the repair and sustenance services
 the industry needs.

R38. Create a competitive environment for economic growth and job creation. Private
sector dynamism in Ethiopian cities is low and variable—not enough companies survive and
thrive, while there remain many city economies dominated by large publicly-owned
enterprises.

      In the short run, it will be important to increase the capacity of ULGs to properly
       design and implement incentives for firms. Not only will ULGs remain the focal
       points for initiating and managing initiatives aimed at targeted sector interventions,
       but they will also be responsible for efficient functioning of factor markets and the
       business environment more generally. A strategic focus on economic growth and job
       creation will require ULGs to better understand their potential for growth, to prioritize
       sectors and interventions, and to design implementation strategies targeting these
       objectives. Key policy recommendations that ULGs could target include: (1)
       identification of skills and qualifications that are required to design and implement
       incentives for private sector growth; (2) initiating a network for best practice and
       experience exchange; (3) leverage educational actors and private sector to target
       technical training and labor supply-side issues; and (4) ULGs ought to build up in-
       house capacity for recurring monitoring and analysis for tracking the impact of
       interventions on the constraints to limit to private sector growth,
      In the medium term, cities must provide better access to the main determinants of
       private sector growth—power, transport, and finance—connecting markets and
       consumers. Foundational and capital-intensive investments could be tackled by
       ULGs, but would also require multi-stakeholder analysis (supporting the process of
       diagnostics, prioritization and implementation), wherein private sector, regional and
       national governments could be leveraged. This is particularly true of projects with
       cross-cutting regional returns to scale and those that require private sector
       collaboration across sectoral supply chains. Key policy recommendations that ULGs,
       in collaboration with other stakeholders, could target include: (1) identify flagship
       investment projects that would have a transformational impact; (2) target and leverage
       large-scale grants, donor funding and private sector resources, including Public-
       Private Partnerships; and (3) establish cross-jurisdictional working groups to identify
       spillovers from projects, also to avoid duplication and to coordinate better on
       implementation and to maximize scale benefits.
      In the long run, cities will need to enable smarter regulations in land markets to allow
       for efficient allocation of land and resources. For more details, see Section 4.2 within
       this Chapter.

163. Some of these factors might lie outside the policy mandate of local urban
governments, such as interventions on educational infrastructure or intercity transport
infrastructure—but a number of them can be affected directly by city officials. For
instance, the importance of tax and licensing fees for firm start-ups and growth suggests that
differences in local capacity to carry out functions related to private sector development
could have significant effects on city competitiveness. In addition, the ability to provide land
and business premises in support of clusters falls within the administrative remit of city
governments, and could be used strategically in line with knowledge of comparative
advantage and quick wins.

4.5.2      Investing in Infrastructure

164. Many of the issues related to infrastructure are linked to the institutional factors
of land, finance, and governance. To the extent that the options outlined above help ULGs
promote more compact urbanization—aided by increased authority, capacity, and financial
resources—they will help make it easier for cities to invest in infrastructure. And beyond the
institutional reforms outlined in the previous subsection, other interventions are targeted at
infrastructure:

R39. Increase cost recovery through subsidy reform and user fees. Prices for basic
services are low and do not cover operational costs. While subsidized tariffs can be justified
on grounds of affordability, electricity and piped-water services reach only higher-income
groups in society. Affordability is a real concern and the government will be unable to
eliminate subsidies, but it should ensure that they are well designed and targeted. Cost
recovery can be increased by capturing a larger amount of finance through user charges and,
for some sectors, through community or household contributions to capital costs—in cash or
kind. Box 14 provides an Ethiopian example of using explicit subsidies for connection fees to
increase access to electricity.

Box 14: Rural Electricity Access Expansion

 The goal of the Second Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project is to establish a sustainable
 program for expanding access to electricity in rural communities, thus supporting broad-based
 economic development and helping alleviate poverty. Ethiopia’s goal is to increase the rate of
 household connections to the main power grid in rural towns and villages that already have
 electricity. The project allows Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) to implement a
 connection charge financing program in which rural households pay 20 percent of the US$75
 connection charge with the balance collected over five years as an interest-free loan. The utility
 receives an overall subsidy of US$35, which covers the interest rate for financing over five years.
 In total, the household must pay US$15 for the connection upfront, with the rest being paid in
 installments of about US$1 per month, which covers the remainder of the payment over five years.

 The results of the project are very promising, as a high number of poor households are finding the
 electricity connection charges affordable thanks to the financing structure. A recent survey
 showed that close to 70 percent of participating households have annual cash incomes of US$300
 or less, indicating that the subsidy has been well-targeted. Many households rely on informal
 connections wired in from another household, and virtually all households in the survey had
 completed their own internal house wiring. These preliminary results appear to confirm that
 spreading the initial connection charges over time increases the number of households adopting
 new electricity connections.


R40. Improve efficiency through capacity building. By some estimates, operating
inefficiencies cost Ethiopia’s infrastructure sectors US$451 million a year, or 3.4 percent of
GDP. The largest component relates to undermaintenance of infrastructure assets, which
should be addressed as a priority. Capacity building could help utilities in, for example,
business planning, investment planning, asset inventories, financial accounting, and improved
billing efficiency. Ethiopia’s Road Maintenance Fund ring-fences funds to be used explicitly
in maintenance, ensuring these cannot be appropriated to build new roads. While the fuel levy
that finances the Road Maintenance Fund is only about half of what it would need to be to
adequately finance road maintenance, it is a step in the right direction.

                                                111
                                        Section 4: The Path Forward




R41. Make sure not to neglect ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M). User fees
are generally the most appropriate source of revenue for ongoing O&M, but as cost recovery
is usually poor, other sources must be tapped and plans made to adequately maintain
infrastructure assets. In South Africa, it was recognized that the “unintended consequence of
constructing more and more new infrastructure, without addressing the condition of the
existing infrastructure, in the attempt to address imbalances in access to services, is a
widening gap in infrastructure maintenance”. 184 South Africa’s Municipal Infrastructure
Grant (MIG) was introduced in 2003, and replaced all capital grants for municipal
infrastructure. While the MIG program is aimed at covering the capital costs of basic
infrastructure for the poor, one of the conditions of MIG funds is that the municipality must
prove that it has the capacity to manage the infrastructure. 185 The MIG program requires
municipalities to carefully consider the costs of adequate O&M and to include budgets for
personnel, materials, and equipment to ensure that the infrastructure created is sustained.
Municipalities must submit three-year capital plans, with budgets that reflect O&M costs of
the three years and beyond.186 The national MIG unit supports and monitors these plans.

R42. Improve sector planning and utility reform. This should emphasize a clear
strategy, including delineation of responsibilities between different government agencies; an
investment program, including details of hardware requirements and technology choices; and
a financing strategy. Prioritized infrastructure investment plans should be developed by the
line ministries (e.g. for electricity) and ULGs (e.g. for roads, water, sanitation, and solid
waste management) using some form of cost-benefit analysis. These plans should set out
expenditures over a three- to five-year period, taking into account the affordability and
feasibility of what is being proposed.

R43. Improve budget execution. Low execution of capital budgets in infrastructure results
in losses of around US$63 million a year. For the sectors covered by this review, this appears
to be a particular problem for roads. Further analysis is required to understand why actual
spending versus that budgeted is low, and to suggest ways in which municipalities can
improve the execution of their investment programs.

4.5.3         Housing

R44. Undertake an independent technical evaluation of Addis Ababa’s Integrated
Housing Development Program (IHDP). IHDP has resulted in improving the overall
quality of the housing stock in Addis and improving the availability of rental stock. It has
thus resulted in a reduction in the qualitative deficit in Addis. On the other hand, it is highly
subsidized and expensive, therefore may not be financially sustainable in terms of the
government subsidies required. At the same time, despite the large subsidies, the lower
income segments of the population cannot afford it. It is important to note also that the
program is working only in Addis, whereas there is an acute housing need for new

households outside of Addis, due to rapid urban growth. An independent technical evaluation
of the program would take these shortcomings into account and be able to suggest appropriate
revisions for government policy for increasing the efficacy of the design, scale and scope,
affordability and outreach of this important program.

R45. Develop a sector wide approach to improve the functioning of the housing sector
overall and to realize high standards, with the goal to address the key challenges of low
quality, overcrowding and affordability. These challenges are inter-related and require a
systemic sector wide approach which, among other things, should:

      Provide public sector subsidies for basic infrastructure and services for the bottom
       sections of the housing market;
      Focus available fiscal resources on provision of land and infrastructure for low-
       income groups and informal settlement upgrading;
      Rationalize housing standards and allow informal housing consolidation to support
       affordable housing delivery and household investment in top structures;
      Improve security of use rights in informal settlements;
      Increase the penetration of formal developer-supported delivery of formal housing in
       downmarket areas;
      Manage existing publicly-owned stock, including kebele stock, in order to achieve
       defined government objectives (ie, prioritizing access for poor households;
      Support and enable private delivery of affordable rental housing at scale. This may be
       a matter of a separate donor-assisted policy development effort. In particular, the
       experience of Vietnam, (see Box 15, with the caveats noted), which managed to
       engage the private sector in rental housing, including massive additions of rental units
       by small-scale homeowners, can be useful for Ethiopia.

R46. Invest in informal settlement upgrading. Given the prevalence of informal housing
in urban areas, investing in in-situ upgrading and service delivery to these areas based on a
well-defined targeting mechanism can increase the supply of quality housing for the urban
poor. For example, this could ensure that new investment in services is channeled to areas
which have the greatest deprivation. Such interventions can include requiring the
participation and contribution of local community groups and civil society organizations or
engaging the private sector through PPP arrangements. Improving access to infrastructure and
services in these areas would improve residents’ quality of life by expanding access to water,
sanitation, health and education services and increasing urban mobility. If bundled with
access to credit or small loans for eligible households, these infrastructure upgrades could
encourage incremental investment to improving top structures.

Box 15: Avoiding the Spread of Informal Settlements in Vietnam

 Note: It is important to note that while Vietnam’s practices of avoiding widespread slums are good
 practice examples for Ethiopia, attention must be paid to the fact that Vietnam is a US$1,740 GNI
 per capita economy, whereas Ethiopia’s level is US$470 GNI per capita. Therefore, Vietnam’s
 good practice examples must be adopted to the Ethiopian context, particularly given the difference
 in incomes.
 As a lower-income and rapidly urbanizing country, why does Vietnam have so few slums? The
 answer lies in Vietnam’s “accepting” regulatory approach to customary and affordable housing
 development. Coupled with an innovative small-scale private housing construction and rental
 sector, this has resulted in a very low incidence of slums in its cities. This is particularly striking
 compared with cities in countries that have even higher urban incomes, such as Brazil, India,
 Indonesia, and the Philippines, to name a few. The following features have proven very successful
 in Vietnam:
     1. Tolerance of small lot sizes, allowing people to trade location for floor space (in many
        cases floor spaces as small as 25 m2).
     2. A permissive attitude toward floor-to-area ratio increases, which has enabled an increase in
        the supply of floor space without the need for more land.
     3. Incorporating and densifying peri-urban villages into the urban fabric.
     4. Investment in primary/trunk infrastructure near these urbanizing villages, with
        communities then investing in incremental improvements in the village.
     5. Dynamism of efficient and entrepreneurial low-cost, self-help, small-contractor
        construction.

                 Annex 1: Surveys Used in the Report
1.      Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are conducted by the Central Statistical
Agency (CSA), Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The DHS was designed to
provide population and health indicators at the national (urban and rural) and regional levels.
The DHS is a sample survey of households, which are stratified at two stages. The first is the
enumeration area, which are administratively below the kebele, and the second stage is the
household. Administratively, regions in Ethiopia are divided into zones, and zones into
administrative units called woredas (sometimes spelled weredas). Each woreda is further
subdivided into the lowest administrative unit, the kebele. The sample was designed to
provide estimates of health and demographic variables for Ethiopia as a whole (urban and
rural) and by 11 geographic areas (nine regions and two city administrations): Tigray, Afar,
Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples
(SNNP), Gambella, Harar, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. The first survey was conducted in
1999, the second in 2006, and the latest in 2011, which this report uses. The survey identifies
the unit of observation at regional, zone, and woreda levels.

2.      The Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing and Electrical Industries Firm
Survey (LMMIS) has been conducted annually since 1978 by the CSA. The survey’s
universe is confined to those public and private industry establishments engaging 10 persons
and above and using power-driven machines. The survey collects basic quantitative
information on employment, volume of quantitative information on employment, volume of
production and raw materials, and structure and performance of these industries. The unit of
analysis is the establishment/enterprise. The survey identifies the unit of observation at
regional and urban centers/towns. In this report we use all years between 1999 and 2010
except 2005, as that year took a sample of enterprises (unlike other years when it covered all
large and medium enterprises).

3.      Urban Bi-annual Employment Unemployment Survey. The CSA launched a Bi-
annual Employment Unemployment Survey program in October 2003. It conducted two
rounds in October 2003 and April 2004, and a third survey in 2006. In 2009, the survey
became annual instead of biannual. The survey has covered 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010,
2011, and 2012. The survey is mainly aimed at providing information on the economic
characteristics of the population aged 10 years and older—their activity status, employment,
and unemployment situation. It also covers detailed socio-demographic variables such as age,
gender, relationship to the head of household, educational status, training, and marital status.
The unit of analysis is the household and individuals aged 10 years and older. The survey
identifies the unit of observation at regional, zone, and woreda levels.

4.      Welfare and Monitoring Survey. This survey was conducted by the CSA, focusing
on a wide range of socioeconomic indicators like health, education, anthropometry, access to
selected facilities/services, amenities and assets, all of which are vital inputs in monitoring
and evaluating policies, particularly in poverty-reduction strategies. The fourth survey (2005)
covered additional features like HIV/AIDS–related information, major prevailing diseases,
and other variables. In this report we use the fifth (2011) survey. The units of analysis are the


                                              115
                                 Section 4: The Path Forward




household and members. The survey identifies the unit of observation at regional, zone, and
woreda levels.

5.     Household Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HICES). The HICES
has been conducted by the CSA every four or five years since 1995/96. It provides statistics
on household income, consumption, and expenditure. This report uses the latest, fifth (2011)
survey, which does not cover household income. The unit of analysis are the household and
members. The survey identifies the unit of observation at regional, zone, and woreda levels.

6.       Survey Limitations

        All the surveys identify the unit of observation at regional level, but this analysis
         requires observations at the town or city level.
        Only LMMIS identifies the unit of observation at the town level whereas all other
         surveys identify the unit of observation at regional, zone, and woreda levels.
        As a first step, this analysis mapped the town code to woreda codes. Only selected or
         major towns could be matched with woredas, using the 2007 Census administrative
         classification. Selected towns could be matched the under following conditions: if the
         name of the woreda was the same as the town and the woreda had only one town; the
         town is a combination of more than one woreda; and the town has an administrative
         status equal to region or zone.
        The 2007 Census administrative classification usually clearly separated medium and
         small towns as woredas, whereas in the previous census classifications, medium and
         small towns were subdivisions of woredas. Therefore extending the mapping of the
         previous year was not possible for selected towns based on the 2007 Census.
        Though the unit of observation was identifiable at woreda level, the sampling and
         official purpose of all the surveys were to estimate variables at national or regional
         levels.
        Bootstrapping and inflating samples for small towns is one possible future approach
         to improve the precision of variables at town level.

                Annex 2: Methodology and Definitions
GNI per Capita (Atlas Method)
Gross national income (GNI) per capita is GNI converted to US dollars using the World Bank
Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. The GNI accounts for the total domestic
and foreign output of residents in the country, by factoring the gross domestic product (GDP)
plus the total income earned by foreign residents, minus income earned in the domestic
economy by nonresidents. The World Bank uses Atlas method GNI per capita in US dollars
to classify countries for analytical purposes and to determine borrowing eligibility.
GDP and Nightlights Data
GDP growth is rarely measured in cities or subnational regions. But recent innovations based
on the use of satellite imagery have developed methods to estimate growth in economic
activity at the subnational level. By looking at the extent of the lights at night and the
brightness (intensity) of these lights, Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (2012) propose
satellite data on lights at night as a proxy to measure GDP growth. They develop a statistical
framework that uses growth in lights to augment existing income growth measures, under the
assumption that measurement error in using observed light as an indicator of income is
uncorrelated with measurement error in national income accounts. For countries with poor
data on national accounts, this new estimate of average annual growth differs as much as
3 percentage points from official data. Most important, lights data allow for measuring
income growth in cities and subnational regions, as well economic activity in the formal and
informal sectors.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-ordinary least square annual nighttime
lights data are composites of cloud-free images of the world at night, captured by US Air
Force satellites. Satellites fly sun-synchronous polar orbits and scan the earth's surface,
recording light emissions from human settlements. The data are available for 1992–2012.
Each pixel in each image represents the average light observed by a satellite over that
location throughout the year. The data are described well in papers such as the CIESIN guide
to nighttime lights (Doll 2008), or on the DMSP website http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/
Over the last two or three years these data have become a popular proxy for economic
activity. Papers such as Doll et al. (2006), Chen and Nordhaus (2011), and Henderson,
Storeygard, and Weil (2012) establish a strong correlation between nighttime light emissions
and GDP. In the absence of economic statistics calculated at a high degree of spatial and
temporal disaggregation, nighttime lights are now often used instead.
For Ethiopia, computations were made at the woreda level and for each satellite-year. These
estimates correspond to the sum of total light within the boundaries of each woreda using
ArcMap 10.2 software and customized Python 2.7 scripts. For years where multiple satellites
recorded data, estimates were calculated as the average total light of each satellite.
Zipf’s Law
Zipf’s law is a very tight constraint on the class of admissible models of local growth. It says
that for most countries the size distribution of cities strikingly fits a power law: the number of
cities with population greater than is proportional to           (Gabaix 1999). This relationship
was empirically tested in the Ethiopian context using Census data for the period between
                           Annex 2: Methodology and Definitions




1984 and 2014. This analysis showed that this mathematical relationship also holds in the
Ethiopian context. In terms of variability across years, population size in cities like Nazret
(Adama) and Mekele have grown rapidly, escalating their positions in the country’s
population ranking to become the second and third largest cities in Ethiopia, respectively.
Satellite Imagery Classification
World Bank calculations were based on remotely sensed data from the NASA Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectrodiometer (MODIS) at 500m spatial resolution (publicly available)
and proprietary satellite image (2014 Digital Globe). The MODIS 500m data provide
classified layers depicting global land cover following the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme (IGBP) classification. This provides 16 land-cover classes based on spectral and
temporal information, including built-up area (IGBP Type 1-Class 13). Ancillary satellite
imagery (2014 Digital Globe) was classified using an image-based classification algorithm
(Graesser et al. 2012). The total area of the urban footprint was calculated based on the
classified -and geo-referenced- satellite imagery using ArGIS Map 9.3.

Built-up Areas of Addis Ababa
World Bank calculations were based on satellite imagery classification (see above). The total
area of the urban footprint was calculated in ArcMap 9.3, from classified and georeferenced
satellite imagery from DigitalGloble (2014). In this instance, built-up areas included
commercial, industrial, residential (formal and informal), and transport land use; they
excluded vegetation, barren land, and water features. Distances were measured from the
center of the city (roughly the National Palace) to the center of each cell in the satellite
image.
Population Density Gradients
Calculations are based on satellite imagery classification (see above) and the 2007 Census
and the 2014 Population Projections, both from the CSA. Total built-up area was estimated
for each woreda using satellite imagery classification in ArcMap 9.3. The raster shapefile of
built-up areas was aggregated into 200m x 200m cells (4 hectare (ha)) using the Generalize
tool, and then converted to a points shapefile (1 point per 4 ha cell). Each point was assigned
its respective woreda using the Spatial Join tool. Using the Near function, distances were
measured from each point to the center of the city, and added to the po ints shapefile’s
attribute table.
To calculate densities, the total urban population of each woreda was divided uniformly by
the number of points within that woreda (each representing 4 ha), i.e. total population of each
point = total urban population of that cell’s woreda/total built-up area in that woreda. And
population density of each point = population of the point/4 ha. A table was created, listing

                                             118
                                  Annex 2: Methodology and Definitions




each woreda and its population density per point. The table was joined to the points shapefile
of built-up area, using the Join function in ArcMap.
The resulting attribute table of points (Point ID, population density, and distance) was
exported to Excel for further analysis. Distances were rounded down to the nearest kilometer,
and then all distances and population densities were summarized using a PivotTable.
This analysis was limited to woredas within the formal administrative boundaries of Addis
Ababa. Beyond these boundaries, urban populations and built-up areas did not account for a
large percentage of their respective woredas, and would have skewed the analysis.
Land Allocated to Streets, Street Density, and Intersection Density
World Bank calculations were based on methodology from the UN HABITAT report, The
Relevance of Street Patterns and Public Space in Urban Areas (2014). For 30 global cities,
the report measured the percentage of land allocated to streets, the number of intersections
per square kilometer, and street density (the total length of streets divided by the total land
area). Street data are publicly available for download from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Two
study boundaries were delimited for each city: the city core and the urban agglomeration
“envelope,” which contains the city proper, suburbs, and continuously settled commuter
areas. 187 The urban agglomeration envelope is defined by UN HABITAT as a continuous
settlement of 20 ha or more no more than 200 meters apart, with a minimum density to be
considered a “built-up or densely populated area,” and having a minimum functional
dependence on the city proper (e.g. for employment and services).188
The same methodology was repeated for this report. For each of the cities, two study
boundaries were outlined using satellite imagery from Google Earth (publicly available). The
boundaries were exported as .kml files and imported into ArcMap 9.3 using a tool developed
by Jason R. Parent at the University of Connecticut (publicly available).189 Data from OSM
were downloaded via Geofabrik (publicly available).190
In ArcMap, the street data were clipped to each urban boundary using the Clip tool and
exported to new layers (one streets layer per boundary). Using the Measure tool in Google
Earth, the author recorded average streets widths for each type of street within each
boundary. Unpaved roads were omitted from the analysis. The spreadsheets of street widths
were joined to their corresponding street shapefiles in ArcMap.
Land Allocated to Streets: In ArcMap, each street shapefile was buffered by half the street
width (in both directions) and then dissolved to create a single large polygon. Land allocated
to streets was calculated as the area of the streets polygon divided by the total study area.
Street Density: For each city in ArcMap, the paved roads were selected and exported to a
separate layer. The author measured the total length of paved streets using the Calculate
Geometry tool. Street density was calculated as the total length of paved streets divided by
the total study area.

Intersection Density: Using the same shapefile of paved roads, the author used the Intersect
tool in ArcMap to create a layer of points where each road intersected another. Intersection
density was calculated as the total number of intersections divided by the total study area.


Infrastructure Cost per Urban Resident
As an example, assume that an average city of this population size has 20 kilometers of
hardened (paved) road, or about 10 centimeters per urban resident, and assume a very rough
estimate for the cost of procuring paved (or cobble-stoned) road at US$2 million
per kilometer. If new residents were to contribute an average level of new road infrastructure
(in order to extend the road network in peri-urban areas and prevent congestion on the radial
access roads and in the city center), the cost for the required additional road infrastructure for
each new resident would around equal US$200 per new resident.
This assumes that no congestion point is reached and that there is no diminishing marginal
need for urban infrastructure as the urban population grows. If paved roads make up x percent
of the urban infrastructure asset base, then the total infrastructure cost of a new resident
would equal (100/x) * US$200. For the purpose of this exercise, paved roads are
conservatively assumed to make up 50 percent of the municipal asset base of urban areas in
Ethiopia, and therefore that the estimated urban infrastructure requirement for a new resident
is US$400.
An alternative way of calculating the cost of new residents would be to take into account the
cost of site preparation for land plots for new urban residents. Such costs can easily reach
much higher, in the range of US$1,000–2,000 per new urban resident.
Vacant, Buildable Area in Addis Ababa
World Bank calculations were based on 2014 Digital Globe imagery (see Satellite Imagery
Classification above). “Buildable area” is defined as vacant land, at least 4 ha in area, with an
average slope that does not exceed the 99th percentile of all slopes in the currently built-up
area. 191 In the case of Addis Ababa, the maximum slope for vacant, buildable land was
15 degrees. Slope data were calculated in ArcMap 9.3 using the Routine ASTER Digital
Global Digital Elevation Model from the NASA LP DAAC and USGS. In ArcMap, the
satellite imagery classification was generalized from 8 sq m x 8 sq m cells to 200 sq m by
200 sq m cells (4 ha) using the median classification value. Buildable land was identified as
barren land or vegetation, at least 4 ha, with an average slope less than or equal to 15 degrees.


Challenges Associated with Analyzing Local Government Finances in Ethiopia
Conducting a comprehensive and proper fiscal analysis of local governments (woredas and
ULGs) in Ethiopia is considerably complex and challenging. There is no consistent official
data, or analysis on woreda, ULG or municipal finances conducted by the federal or state
governments, just as MOFED only includes partial information on municipal finance in
national consolidated accounts. Analyzing local government revenues and expenditures
requires physically visiting local governments, because such data is not available either at the
federal or at the regional government levels. Fiscal transfers from regional governments to

(2005).

                            Annex 2: Methodology and Definitions




local governments are not monitored or reported on at the federal level. Thus, MOFED does
not have comprehensive and accurate data regarding the regional-to-local government
transfers. At the regional government level, while some, such as Amhara and SNNP, track
and report on transfers to local governments, other regional governments such as Oromia do
not. In Oromia, and similar other regional governments, municipal revenues (revenue series
1700) and municipal expenditures (expenditure series 500) are managed completely
separately from rest of revenue and expenditures (including the use of a different IBEX data
base) and therefore are not included in the regional accounts or national accounts.

In addition to absence of local government revenue and expenditure data at the federal or
regional level, at the local government level, expenditures are not consistently recorded as per
the unified code of account structure of the Government of Ethiopia. While local
governments respect the hierarchy at the high coding level (capital/recurrent/salaries), data at
lower coding levels are not always consistently applied to allow for cross-local government
comparison. Furthermore, for ULGDP cities, ULGDP expenditure data is captured through
stand-alone reporting from the ULG to MUDHCo, and not through the ULG consolidated
accounts.

For these reasons, a mission to visit the following local governments was fielded as part of
the EUR: Bahir Dar, Adama, Hawassa, and Mekelle (ULGs), Durbete municipality within the
rural Woreda of Achefer in the Amhara Regional State, and Addis Ababa (Chartered City). A
much larger mission with a similar objective had been fielded to 12 ULGs in 2014, for the
preparation of "Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study, Part II: A Situational Analysis of
Urban Local Governments in Ethiopia: The Institutional, Governance, and Fiscal Context of
Local Governments" by the World Bank. The analysis presented in the EUR draws from this
study, as well as the background paper on urban governance, as appropriate.

      Annex 3: Detailed Methodology for Alternative
  Urbanization Projections Produced as Part of This Study
The Central Statistical Agency (CSA) recognizes that the growth of urban populations is
attributed to three factors: natural growth, migration to existing urban centers and project
sites (particularly industrial establishments such as sugar plantations and irrigation sites), and
statistical growth of urban population due to upgrading of rural villages to towns and formal
expansion of existing urban areas. Given the difficulty of projecting each of these
components individually, the CSA employs the Urban–Rural Growth Differential (URGD)
method to estimate their net effect. Also known as the United Nations Method, the URGD is
defined as the growth rate of the ratio between urban and rural populations, equal to the
difference between the urban population growth rate and the rural population growth rate.192

In projecting urban populations to 2037, the CSA has made separate assumptions regarding
the URGD for each region of Ethiopia. It estimates the urban population to be 42.3 million
people in 2037, or 31.1 percent of the total population. The CSA notes, however, that the
assumptions about future URGD are explicitly arbitrary, “as there are no clear guidance or
policy statements that would help quantify the likely change.”193
Indeed, there are a couple of urbanization factors that have not been captured by these CSA
projections that would account for faster urban population growth in the future and a
higher percentage of urban population. These are:
      1. Migration to existing urban centers and new project sites. According to the 2012
         Inter-Censual Population Survey, migration information is only reported for
         interregional movement. Even though the urban population in the country is expected
         to increase due to migration from rural to urban areas, efforts were not made by the
         CSA to estimate rural–urban migration within regions, as MUDHCo has strong
         reservations that the URGD method would adequately account for this migration
         effect. In addition, the Ethiopian Government has plans to construct hydroelectric
         dams and mining centers, and establish a number of sugar plantations and factories in
         different parts of the country. Each of these megaproject sites will attract migrants to
         the new project sites that would engage in nonagricultural activities and lead to an
         increased urban population.
      2. Statistical growth of urban population due to upgrading of rural village to towns
         and expansion of existing urban centers. According to the Development Plan of
         Action for Ethiopia, there are and will be tremendous efforts to upgrade rural villages
         into urban centers in each of the regions. Rural villages are upgraded into towns based
         on criteria established by regional Bureaus of Urban Development and Construction,
         including: (i) over half of the population are engaged in nonfarming activities such as
         petty trading, service provision, and the like; (ii) most of the residents in the area are
         benefiting from urban-based facilities like electricity, pipe water supply, telephone,

192 For example, in the Afar region from 1994 to 2007, the urban population growth rate was 6.62 percent per year, and the
rural population growth rate was 1.69 percent per year. Therefore the URGD for Afar over this period was 4.93 percent per
year, meaning the urban population grew faster than the rural population by 4.93 percentage points per year.

          school, and health services; (iii) total population living in that particular location
          numbers 2,000 people and above; and (iv) the area is believed to have potential for
          economic growth and attraction of migrants to engage in nonfarm activities. These
          newly designated urban centers are not captured by CSA projections, but they will
          increase the urban population of the country. In addition, there is evidence that large
          cities such as Addis Ababa, regional capitals, and other town administrations have
          plans to formally expand their urban boundaries and incorporate nearby settlements.
          These expropriated areas would be reclassified as “urban,” and their populations
          would contribute to the total urban population.
As a result, this study constructs a more detailed projection for the urban population,
disaggregated by each of the four urbanization drivers: natural increase, migration, new town
formation, and urban expansion. The calculations and assumptions for this projection are
outlined below.
Natural Increase
Prior to periods of demographic transition, mortality in cities tended to be high and, as a
result, migration was the only major factor of urban population growth. Currently in many
African countries mortality is lower than fertility, such that urban population increases
organically.194 This projection uses the same assumptions as the CSA for natural increase,
based on fertility and mortality rates obtained from the Ethiopian demographic and health
surveys conducted in 2005 and 2011. For this projection, natural increase is expressed as a
rate of natural increase in percentage points.
Migration
Rural–urban migration can arise from “push” factors (e.g. high fertility combined with fewer
jobs in rural areas) or “pull” factors (e.g. employment opportunities or improved access to
services in urban areas).
In this projection for the period 2007 to 2014, rural–urban migration rates were estimated
based on the 2012 Inter-Censal Population Survey by the CSA. In each region, the total
number of out-migrants from urban centers was subtracted from the total number of in-
migrants to urban centers, and then divided by the projected mid-year population of all urban
centers in that region. The migration rate is expressed as net in-migrants per 1,000 residents.
For the years after 2014, it was assumed that the migration rate would change with
employment growth. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, around 204,000 jobs
were created in the manufacturing sector in 2012.195 Using data from the 2012 Large and
Medium Scale Manufacturing and Electrical Industries Survey (LMMIS), as well as
government plans to transform the economy, the Ministry of Industry projects that national
job creation will increase as follows:

According to the 2013 Labor Force Survey, one-third of migrants to urban areas had moved
in search of employment opportunities. Therefore the migration rate for each region in 2008 –
14 was disaggregated into migration due to employment growth (33 percent of the net in-
migration rate) and migration due to other factors (67 percent). For the years 2013–30,
migration due to employment was increased at the same rate as job creation, while migration
due to other factors was held constant.

Development projects induced migration: Migration to urban areas of Ethiopia is also
affected by the job opportunities created by megaprojects near resource centers. These
projects have a capacity to attract workers and their families, and to develop from settlements
to urban centers. This projection focused on sugar plantations and irrigation projects, which
tend to generate substantial employment after construction. Data on planned projects was
obtained from the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation and the Ministries of Water, Energy, and
Irrigation (see tables A3.3 and A3.4 below).
The Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation Department of the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation
provided rates of job formation per project. In the case of sugar plantations, it was assumed
that one job would be generated per 2.5 hectares of project land. Furthermore, each new job
would result in 3.7 new residents in total (the average household size in 2012), and all of the
new residents would live in urban areas. In the case of irrigation projects, it was assumed that
one job would be generated per 0.5 hectare of project land. Each job would result in 3.7 new
residents in total, but only half would live in urban areas. This assumption is based on the fact
that the agglomeration of the population residing in such irrigation areas does not only
comprise those who directly engage in farming activities but also those who engage in

provision of technical support as well as business transactions. About half of the population
living in irrigation sites in Ghana (Drechsel and Keraita 2014) and the Central Oregon area
located within the upper basin of United States (Aylward 2006) are urban residents.
For both types of projects, it was assumed that 70 percent of jobs (and urban residents) would
be generated in the first year of the project, and the remaining 30 percent would be realized in
the second year. Although project data were not available beyond 2020, the Ministry of
Water and Irrigation estimates that irrigation project sites will increase by 50,000 hectares per
year during this period. For the projection, this land area was allocated across the regions
according to their total share of planned projects.

Statistical Growth of the Urban Population
The population living in urban Ethiopia is also increasing due to upgrading of rural villages
into towns and areal expansion of existing cities and towns.

Upgrading of rural villages into towns: Each year some rural settlements are reclassified as
“urban,” when they meet criteria outlined by regional governments. The Ministry of Urban
Development, Housing and Construction provided data on new town creation by region from
2007 to 2014 (Table A3.5). In the four large regions (Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, SNNP)
MUCHCo assumed that new town creation would continue at half the current rate. In Afar,
Somali, and Gambella, no new towns were designated between 2007 and 2014; however,
MUDHCo assumed that these regions would follow the same trend as Benishangul as they
are all pastoral areas.

Each of the new towns created in 2007–14 had populations under 5,000. Therefore in each
region the population of newly created towns was assumed to be the average population (in
2014) of all existing towns under 5,000 people in that region.

Boundary expansion of existing urban areas: In Ethiopia, the urban population increases as
cities expand their administrative boundaries and rural residents are reclassified as urban
residents. To account for this factor of urbanization, the urbanization projection assumed that a
city’s territory expands at the same rate as its total population growth. For example, if a city’s
population increases by 3 percent in a year, this projection assumes that its territory will
expand by 3 percent as well. This methodology is based on the New York University’s urban
expansion research initiative in Ethiopia.196
Land areas were available for 23 cities in six regions. Expandable area was defined as the
average city area multiplied by the region’s average annual urban population growth.
Population increase from urban expansion was assumed to be equal to the expandable area
multiplied by the region’s rural population density. For example, in Amhara, the average city
was 74.9 square kilometers, and its population grew by 3.2 percent from 1994 to 2007. It is
assumed that the territory expanded by the same rate, or 2.4 hectares per year. Based on the
region’s rural density, this would be equivalent to 287 additional urban residents per year per
city.

The population increase due to urban expansion was not applied uniformly to all towns in a
region. For those with populations between 50,000 and 100,000, the increase was divided by
half; for those with populations between 20,000 and 50,000, the rate was divided by one-
fourth. Finally, the regional increase due to urban expansion was converted to a percentage:
increased urban population from expansion, divided by the urban population of the region in
2007. In the population projection, this percentage increase is held constant for each region
through 2030.

Urban Population Projections

According to the CSA, the urban population of Ethiopia was 11,833,785 in 2007. Based on
the authors’ projections, it is estimated that Ethiopia’s urbanization rate will reach 30 percent
by 2027, and its urban population will triple to nearly 36 million by 2028. The tables and
figures below summarize the factors behind these projections.

           Annex 4: International Experiences on Land
                         Readjustment
When a local government wants to expand a city by building infrastructure in formerly rural
areas, or wants to redevelop areas within the city, it generally has to acquire land through
expropriation and compensation, which is often expensive and contentious. The original
landholders are usually displaced and do not benefit from the project improvements. Land
readjustment (LR) is seen as a more efficient and inclusive instrument for orderly rural-to-
urban conversion or urban redevelopment, still led by the government but with the
engagement of local land holders.

In an LR project, the land to be developed is reparceled in a pattern appropriate for
development, with some percentage of the land dedicated for streets and other public use, and
infrastructure is built. The new, reshaped parcels are returned to the original landholders;
while these parcels are smaller than before, their land value has usually increased due to the
infrastructure and the fact that they can now be legally developed. LR is applicable to land
that is either privately owned or held under leases or other partial rights, as long as they are
protected by law and transferable. In some cases, the government also sets aside some land
for public auction and uses the proceeds to recover the infrastructure cost.

Figure A4.1: Land readjustment




In this way, the original landowners, the government, and the city as a whole all benefit from
the project. For example, in 103 LR-type projects in Ahmedabad, India, 31.5 percent of land
                   Annex 4: International Experiences on Land Readjustment



on average was taken—23.7 percent for public use and 7.8 percent for auction. 197 All
landowners lose the same proportion of their land (e.g. if the total amount of land taken for
public purposes is 30 percent, each landowner’s new parcel will be 30 percent smaller than
their original parcel), except in cases where the original parcels are very small.

LR has been used in Germany since 1902, Japan since 1919, and in Hong Kong SAR, China;
India; Israel; Republic of Korea; Taiwan, China; and some cities in Australia and Canada. For
example, in Japan, almost 30 percent of urban areas went through LR by 2003, with 11,400
projects covering about 3,683 sq km.198

Use of LR techniques needs special legislation which frames the LR process and defines a
number of parameters, in particular: (i) the conditions under which dissenting landholders can
be forced to either participate or sell their land rights to the LR entity; (ii) the degree to which
consensus of landholders is needed to implement the project (e.g. in Japan, holders of at least
66 percent of the land should agree to participate; in Taiwan, China the consent requirement
is 50 percent; in Germany and Israel, an LR project can take place without such consent,
though opposing landholders still can go to court);199 (iii) an upper limit of a portion of land
that can be taken for public use or auction to recapture the cost.

Many details of LR vary by country, but a general framework includes the following key
elements.

Project Initiation
An LR project can be initiated by a public entity like a local government (Japan), a
government corporation, or a private entity (e.g. individuals, landholders associations). This
stage usually includes defining precisely the boundaries of the area to include in the LR,
establishing an initiative group, and preliminarily mapping of all existing parcels. An entity
to carry out a project is established/registered, at least tentatively.

Developing Community Support
The initiating group or entity develops a preliminary territorial development plan and a
preliminary financial feasibility study, to be used in public hearings and negotiations with
landholders to encourage them to participate. In good practices, this is done even in countries
where the law does not require obtaining the consent of landholders. Further, in good
practices, landholders participate, together with the planning authority, in planning of the
final layout of reparceled land and its use; they also collectively negotiate the compensation
price with those landholders who want to sell their land rights. An LR project is only
considered acceptable if it can secure that the market value of parcels obtained by holders
after LR is not less than the value of their initial parcels. Therefore, market demand for land,
land use and permitted density are critical for creating sufficient value.

Land Resubdivision and Servicing
After the final land layout and reparceling is agreed with landholders, public infrastructure is
built on the designated land. The cost of infrastructure is usually covered by one of two
sources: (i) direct public subsidy, especially for arterial roads and water mains; or
(ii) auctioning off some parcels specially reserved for this purpose. Some land for continuing
agriculture also can be preserved.

Land Reallocation
After local infrastructure is built, landholders receive back their new parcels, of smaller size
but with the same or higher value. They can build on them or sell their rights at full market
value. Thus, instead of expropriating land and paying compensation, government instigates
property exchanges, and enables landholders to partake in land development and enjoy
financial gains generated by the project.

However, success of LR projects is not guaranteed. For example, it is estimated that in Japan
only one third of initially suggested LR projects materialized. Some preconditions of success
include: (i) a proper legal framework; (ii) organizational capacity to prepare and implement
LR, including presence of people at local governments or the private sector who are capable
of leading on project implementation; (iii) cooperative actions with the affected community
and strong informal relations there; (iv) clear market demand for reparceled plots, so that they
can be sold by the implementing entity and landholders; and (v) flexible attitude of planners
permitting higher density of land use, to support land value that can make a project
financially viable.

A Note of Caution
In Ethiopia, LR is not a panacea, and what it can deliver should not be overestimated. In
addition to a proper legislation and implementation capacity, the following is critical:

           LR can be successful only in locations with effective demand for land, so selection of
            locations for LR should be based on demand signals and not just master plans.
           Permitted density should be increased or deregulated very substantially, and
            construction standards reduced (at least for one-floor buildings) to make land and
            final real estate more affordable.
           LR projects can take a long time to implement, and this time can impose hardship on
            landholders: their old occupations (agriculture) may already be disrupted, while
            revenues from land development have not materialized yet. Therefore, old factual use
            of land, except that needed for roads, should be preserved as long as possible, even
            when land is already reparceled for reallocation.
           Given wide proliferation of informal settlements on urban fringes in Ethiopia, LR will
            take place, most probably, on areas with some informal development. It is important
            to integrate this development into LR instead of demolishing it, especially because
            these developments are an important channel of cheap rental housing for new
            migrants.200
           In cases where an LR project is carried out on land under active agricultural use, it
            implies that landholders will change their sources of livelihood and find occupations

different from their rural ones (as it would with expropriation). This is a major
economic issue that goes beyond land conversion and needs to be addressed. As a
safety net, a possibility of obtaining replacement agricultural land and compensation
for house and relocation can be an important option to provide to those on an LR
territory who wants to continue farming instead of becoming urban dwellers.

201A very important assumption in this table is that the market value of land (and hence the market prices) is higher than the
costs of land acquisition and infrastructure provision. If this is not true, and the costs are higher than market prices, supply of
such land is not economically sustainable, and the whole scheme needs to be re-examined, to see whether land value can be
increased while the costs reduced. A main avenue for rebalancing the value and the cost includes choosing desirable
locations iOn of

3. Auctions: by definition, this is a form of competitive allocation in which a winner is selected based on a
single criterion – the highest price offered. The most common forms of auctions include: (i) bids submitted
in sealed envelopes, (ii) verbal auctions, and (iii) on-line auctions. Forms (i) and (ii) can substitute one for
another, and which one is used in practice is sometimes defined by tradition. However, experiences of post-
socialist countries indicate that the sealed bid form of an auction is apparently more prone to corruption and
abuse by government, unless rules of a procedure explicitly establish that the envelopes can be submitted in
public, immediately before all envelopes are opened.

The main advantage of on-line auctions is that they broaden geographic outreach to buyers and extend
auction’s duration, compared to the traditional forms (i) and (ii). As a result, on-line auctions can produce
sale prices substantially higher than achievable at regular auctions. However, on-line auctions are more
expensive and require special on-line infrastructure, so they are not recommended until the more traditional
forms are tested and perfected.

Notes on data

This report uses the best data available to describe the observed trends as precisely as
possible (Annex 1). However, as is the case in many countries, particularly in developing
country environments, there are data limitations in Ethiopia, which means that some
estimates, projections, and figures might be discounted or overestimated. Where these
limitations are evident, they have been acknowledged in the report. Calculations in this study
should, therefore, be interpreted more as indications of overall trends rather than precise
figures. Additionally, although this report relies on primary data from official sources—
mainly the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia—for most of the analysis, complementary
data were used in cases where disaggregated information were unavailable. For instance,
nighttime lights data were used as a proxy to measure economic activity in cities because data
on gross domestic product growth at the subnational level was not available. Given the
caveats and limitations of using nighttime lights data for measuring economic activity, 202
these data have been used in a limited way to supplement other more traditional data and as
such the report’s main messages do not derive from this data source.

Where possible, the analysis incorporates relevant legislation and policies. However, certain
important documents were unavailable to the study team because of confidentiality or other
reasons. The report is therefore not a comprehensive review of all existing legislation and
policies in Ethiopia, but based on the best available information at the time of publication.

The State of Ethiopian Cities Report, expected to be completed by the end of September
2015, is funded by Cities Alliance, managed by World Bank, and implemented by Ethiopian
Civil Service University with support and guidance from the Ministry of Urban
Development, Housing and Construction. Complementary to the Urbanization Review that
describes the observed urbanization trends in Ethiopia through rigorous analysis, the State of
Ethiopian Cities Report provides baseline data for 23 cities and attempts to explain urban
trends by analyzing the state of urban affairs from the bottom up. For the federal and regional
government, the study aims to serve as a source of baseline information on the current
realities of the urban sector, which can help inform urban development policy. For cities
themselves, the data will help serve as the basis for identifying and prioritizing key urban
development issues, creating local development strategies, and generating benchmarking and
horizontal learning among urban centers.

The Ethiopia Urban Expansion Initiative, launched at New York University (NYU) in 2012,
is part of an action program for rapidly growing cities to make realistic and tangible

202 Some of these limitations respond to the nature of the data collection process. For instance, since these images are taken
at night, areas that rely more heavily on electricity (presumably urban areas) are more likely to be “sampled.” Similarly, the
contribution of agricultural activities to economic activity might be underestimated if the productive land is only used during
day time.

preparations ahead of inevitable urban expansion. The action plan for Ethiopia consists of
four initiatives: (i) preparing realistic maps of lands to be converted to urban use in the next
30 years; (ii) compelling federal and regional authorities to create a single municipal
jurisdiction to execute plans for the entire area of expansion; (iii) delineating a 30-meter wide
arterial road grid, and transferring the rights-of-way for roads to the municipality; and (iv)
identifying a hierarchy of public open spaces throughout the expansion area, and transferring
land rights to the municipality. An interim report was published in August 2013 on four
cities—Adama, Hawassa, Bahir Dar, and Mekele. The team is led by Dr. Shlomo Angel,
Senior Research Scholar and Adjunct Professor of Urban Planning at NYU, with Dr. David
de Groot, Mr. Richard Martin, Yohannes Fisseha, Tsigereda Tafesse, and Patrick Lamson-
Hall. The program is supported by the Urbanization Project at NYU Stern School of Business
and by the Marron Institute of Cities and the Environment. The program has also been
strongly endorsed by H.E. Mekuria Haile Teklemariam, Minister of Urban Development and
Construction.

The National Urban Development Spatial Plan aims to help guide and manage urban
development across the country through analysis of current and future trends in urbanization,
beyond providing concrete local development and urban design plans. The project consists of
two components:

      National Urban Development Scheme: A national assessment of the structure and
       functioning of the existing (2014) urban sector, in addition to scenarios for what the
       urban sector might look like in 2037.

      Local Development and Urban Design Plans: Preparation of neighborhood
       development plans and urban design plans for 12 cities in Ethiopia, which may also
       be used as templates for other urban areas in the country. An Urban Design Manual
       will also be produced.

The project began in January 2014 and is scheduled for completion in June 2015. The
Ethiopian executing agency is the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and
Construction.
