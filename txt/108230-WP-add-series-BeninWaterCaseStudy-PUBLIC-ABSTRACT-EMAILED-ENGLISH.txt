    BOX 3: mWater: what is it and how does it work?

    mWater is a “mobile-to-web” technology that can be used for three different type of services:
     •	 Asset inventory and mapping (from pipes inventory to user mapping);
     •	 Water services mobile management for optimizing operations’ efficiency;
     •	 Monitoring water services, via a web platform accessible to asset owners (the municipalities) and other
        authorized parties (e.g. central government).

    mWater services can be contracted by different types of users: municipalities and central government
    seeking to improve their assets’ knowledge (so as to enable sound investment decisions) or POs looking
    to improve the management of PWS, particularly through increased responsiveness to maintenance needs
    and regulatory authorities.




   In order to be functional on a PWS, mWater requires that the system be geo-referenced. The system also
   automatically registers the amount of bulk water that is produced. POs’ staff enter operations data in the
   system using their mobile phones (crucial data relate to meter reading and the maintenance work carried
   out). This data is instantly accessible to the management via the web platform. The same data is also visible
   to other authorized parties.

   Further, mWater enables the generation of the activity reports that POs have to be submit to the municipalities
   on a monthly basis. These reports can be generated “with a simple click” if the data is entered correctly and
   regularly, and include calculation of the monthly fees and charges due by the PO to the municipality. The
   municipalities can verify the amount submitted based on their knowledge of the amount of water that has
   been produced.

   This technology comes with a business to business cost model agreed with the stakeholders during the pilot
   phase supported by WSP: the asset inventory (network mapping and water points referencing) cost FCFA
   400,000 (USD 800) per PWS and FCFA 100,000 (USD 200) per PWS for subscribing to the mobile phone
   configured for monitoring and management services including training on using the technology as well as
   the mobile phones that will be used by POs’ staff on the ground. POs contribute with base fees of FCFA
   10,000 (USD 20) and variable audit fees per PWS each month for accessing the mobile management, user
   assistance and coaching services.

    BOX 4: mWater: A difficult shift, especially for POs

    Despite this sustained effort to commit municipalities and POs to the use of mWater, by early 2015,
    the tool was not central to several of the POs interviewed in the context of this case study. POs gave a
    number of reasons for this relative lack of interest, including the following:
      •	 Weak phone signals that does not allow POs to send the data instantly on site as requested by the
         system;
      •	 Poor customer services on behalf of Manobi;
      •	 The FCFA 10,000 (USD 20) monthly cost per PWS for accessing the platform.

    It is not unlikely that one major reason for this lack of interest is a resistance to transparent management
    on the part of the POs. By agreeing on using mWater, POs accept to make all their activities transparent to
    municipalities and other authorized parties, a situation which they are not used to.

    Similarly, although municipalities recognized the benefits the tool generates, none of the municipalities
    were using the tool to renew their subscription. It has to be noted that different donors have been
    presenting Benin’s municipalities with different PWS management tools. The Dutch Embassy for example
    has been equipping some municipalities with the AkvoFlow tool for making an inventory of all water points.
    GIZ provided a management software that enables anticipating and budgeting for heavy repairs. This
    “overcrowded” situation may be contributing to municipalities’ relative lack of interest for mWater. Finally,
    although municipal services may be aware of the particular advantages of using mWater (in comparison
    with other services), they need to find the budget for it and therefore need to obtain the municipal council’s
    agreement for carrying out such investments.

    BOX 5: Key differences between the subsidized concession and an OBA model

    OBA is a type of Results-Based Financing instrument that has been put forward by the Global Partnership
    on Output Based Aid (GPOBA). OBA ties the disbursement of public funding (in the form of subsidies) to the
    achievement of pre-specified results that directly support the poor to access basic services. OBA subsidies
    cover a funding gap when poor or excluded households cannot afford such services. Service delivery is
    contracted out to a service provider, which can be a private enterprise, a public utility or a non-governmental
    organization. The disbursement of funds to this service provider is tied to the independent verification of
    outputs achieved, which is carried out by an independent verification agent (IVA).

    Although the subsidized concession contract structure proposed in Benin aims to improve water
    access to some of the poorest in rural areas, it differs in some key areas from an OBA funding model,
    as implemented by GPOBA:
     •	 Limited pro-poor targeting: there is no explicit mechanism to ensure that these improvements actually
         reach the poorest. More specifically, although the contract defines a target for the number of HC to be
         made, it leaves room for the PO to choose the type of customers that will be targeted for these HCs.
         Indeed, the contract only “indicates” where reinforcement and extension should be made – the PO and
         the municipalities can agree during implementation to provide extensions towards different areas.
     •	 No independent verification of outputs. In the subsidized concession model, the municipalities carry
         out the verification of the expected outputs – in other words there is not IVA, which would ensure that
         the poorest have been targeted.

    What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed model in comparison with OBA?
    OBA implies an expensive verification mechanism and can induce complexities in the disbursement of
    funds to the POs. The original concept note for the project had estimated that some USD 1 million would
    be needed for the IVA. The project as approved by the GoB did not include any funds for verification, as
    municipalities themselves would have to do it. This keeps monitoring costs down but also creates a risk of
    dispute between the parties over the amount of subsidies that can effectively be paid.

    One key issue, however, is to ensure that subsidized HC are offered to the poorest (and not those who could
    afford an unsubsidized rate). In the present contractual set-up, only strong monitoring of PO’s activities,
    with clear guidelines for allocating the subsidy, and municipalities’ commitment to serving the poorest can
    ensure that the project reaches the neediest.

    WSP included a post-transaction phase involving the services of a CePEPE for monitoring these key aspects
    of contract implementation.

         Box B.1 : FADeC: budget lines to support municipalities (MDGLAAT 2008)

         FADeC is a national funding mechanism established in 2008 as part of the decentralization reforms for
         transferring financial resources to the municipalities. The mechanism was set up to:
           •	 Mobilize resources for developing municipalities and inter-communal structures;
           •	 Transfer additional resources to municipalities so that they can exercise their powers and correct imbalances
               between municipalities;
           •	 Finance activities to strengthen municipalities’ institutions; and
           •	 Harmonize municipalities’ financing procedures.

         Administered by the National Commission of Local Finance (CONAFIL) under the Ministry of Local
         Government, FADeC is implemented through the GoB general budget. The GoB feeds two budget lines to
         support municipalities:
           •	 A budget line to fund operating expenses;
           •	 A budget line to fund capital investments.

         Within the budget line to fund investments, part of the budget is specifically allocated to a sector, whereas
         municipalities are free to use the other component based on their own investment priorities.

         As presented below, FADeC feeds directly into the municipalities’ funds. Funds are transferred from the national
         treasury into municipalities’ bank account as soon as the Ministry of Local Governments approves the provisional
         budget proposed by municipalities.

         Box B.2 : Public procurement bodies at municipalities level

         The Person Responsible for Public Procurement (PRPP) (“Personne Responsable des Marchés Public”) is the
         person responsible for implementing and overseeing public procurement procedures (from preparation of tender
         documents to contracts monitoring). In municipalities, mayors are responsible for fulfilling this role.

         The Public Procurement Commission (PPC) (“Commission de Passation des Marchés Publics”) is under the
         PRPP’s authority. Its responsibilities include:
          •	 Examining tender documents before transmission to Public Procurement Control unit (see below);
          •	 Opening proposals (dépouillement des offres). This is a public procedure and can be made in the presence
              of the bidders;
          •	 Setting-up a sub-commission (“sous-commission d’analyse”) for evaluating the bids and proposing a
              provisional award. Sub-commission members should have the technical competency for evaluating the
              bids;  
          •	 Transmission of the proposals opening report (rapport de dépouillement) to the National Directorate of
              Public Procurement Control.

         In municipalities, the Commission should be composed as follows: the PRPP (or a representative), two communal
         advisors, the accountant (“le receveur-percepteur”) and a public procurement specialist. The PRPP can decide
         to add to the Commission individuals whose competencies are deemed necessary.

         The Public Procurement Control Unit is responsible for validating the procurement process, including:
          •	 Validating plans and tender documents before launching the call for proposals; and
          •	 Carrying out juridical and technical assessment of tender documents that have been approved by the
              Commission.

         The Control Unit should be composed as follows: a head of unit (“chef de cellule”), a specialist in public
         procurement, a public works engineer, two senior administrative staff and any other individuals with the right
         competencies.
