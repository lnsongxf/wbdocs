Abstract:

        This study aims to evaluate and develop recommendations on how the HIV/AIDS
program in Peru can achieve better Value for Money. In Peru, the HIV epidemic
concentrates mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM), with AIDS being the
first cause of death for men ages 30-49 in 2010 and the second cause of death for women
aged 25-34 (BOD, 2013). UNAIDS (2013) estimates there were 76,000 people living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in 2012, and this study estimates 67,000 PLWA in 2013. The
Ministry of Health reports that 27,502 PLWA currently receive ART, a 43-48 percent
coverage of eligible people, and 66 percent coverage of all diagnosed eligible individuals
(WHO, 2013 guidelines).

        In 2011, there was a transition from international to domestic public funding,
which increased from US$17.7 million in 2005-10 to US$57.8 million in 2011-13. The
main achievements of the Peru HIV/AIDS program to date include: (i) collaboration with
NGOs to provide ART; (ii) free provision of ART; (iii) educating poor women on mother
to child HIV transmission; and (iv) access to reduced ARV prices through the PAHO
Drug Fund. Major challenges include: (i) limited testing and laboratory capacity in the
provinces; (ii) less than half of the budget is allocated to high-risk groups; (iii) wage bill
issued by other programs and; (iv) limited number of community health workers (CHWs)
for IEC.

        This study recommends targeting high-risk groups with proactive testing,
promotion of condom use, and supervised ART administration by CHWs to close the
coverage gap. In addition, there is a need to expand coverage of rapid testing points
through greater diversity of contractual arrangements with NGOs and the private sector,
which can only be achieved with the support of a human resources plan that centrally
positions CHWs in HIV prevention and ARV treatment.

        Though HIV/AIDS still places a great disease burden in countries around the
globe, declining international funding and increasingly domestically funded national
programs call for more judicious and targeted spending. Despite victories in the last
decade in the fight against HIV/AIDS, the disease continues to infect over 100,000
individuals every year in Latin America and the Caribbean alone. The high costs of
HIV/AIDS treatment regiments and the prolonged treatment duration of this chronic
disease also add to the need for long-term budgetary planning and more efficient
allocation and use of health resources.

        This study is part of a series funded by the Global HIV/AIDS Partnership, in an
effort to shine light onto the Latin America and Caribbean countries’ responses to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic through the years. This study, in particular, assesses current
HIV/AIDS resource distribution in Peru, including the current level of funding and future
resources needed to address the testing and treatment coverage gap. Efforts such as this
one are and will become increasingly important, as the Region’s leaders must make
difficult decisions on how to allocate resources in the best health interests of their
constituents.

        I would like to recognize Andre Medici, who served as the Task Team Leader and
coordinated the efforts involved in the development of this study. His efforts were
supported by the World Bank peer reviewers Daniel Maceira, Eliana Zeballos, Rafael
Cortez, and Jaime Bayona, who provided insightful comments to the author. Finally, I
would like to recognize Marelize Gorgens, David Wilson, Fernando Lavadenz, and the
entire HIV/AIDS team, whose support made this study possible.

                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

        According to the Global Burden of Disease Studies produced by the Institute of
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME 2013), AIDS was the number one cause of death
in Peru in 2010 for men ages 30-49. For women ages 25-34, AIDS was the second
greatest cause of death. The HIV epidemic in Peru is concentrated in certain populations
(UNAIDS 2013). Data shows that the greatest rates of infection are among men who have
sex with men (MSM), with much lower rates found in the general population. The
prevalence of HIV in Peru is estimated at 0.4 percent, which is below the average of
Latin American and Caribbean countries (UNAIDS 2013). UNAIDS estimates that
around 76,000 people in Peru were living with HIV/AIDS in 2012; our simulation results
estimate the 67,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2013. Geographically, 76
percent of the reported cases of AIDS are from Lima-Callao area, with the remaining 24
percent distributed mainly in coastal and Amazon areas.

       The program consists of a set of coordinated interventions distributed among the
Ministry of Health, social security or Comprehensive Health Insurance, regional
governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The public health system—
Ministry of Health (MOH) and Regional Health Bureaus—is the principal provider of
HIV/AIDS services, including ART, to about 81 percent of the infected population, along
with the support of NGOs. The remaining 19 percent is covered by social security.

        This study sought to analyze the priorities and budget of the HIV/AIDS program
launched in 2011, with the objective of developing recommendations for greater
efficiency. HIV/AIDS funds allocation was examined across the following four
dimensions: (i) appropriate budgetary allocation of financial resources to high risk
groups; (ii) program effectiveness as measured by the decrease in number of premature
AIDS-related deaths, the percentage of people diagnosed and living with AIDS receiving
antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the increase in women’s knowledge of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV/AIDS; (iii) average expenditure on ART per patient across
provinces; and (iv) effective regional budget management.

       Data was gathered across a range of sources, including interviews with key
individuals and information from databases of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the
Department of Epidemiology, PAHO, UNAIDS, Unit of Health, Sexuality and Human
Development of the University Cayetano Heredia, as well as the NGOs IMPACTA and
Socios en Salud. A literature review and visits to The Global Fund and Care-Peru
websites were conducted.

        The report is divided into eight sections. The first section describes study
objectives and methods, reviews the principles of Value for Money and states the four
main indicators. The second describes current trends in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Peru
and at-risk populations. The third and fourth sections describe past and current
intervention strategies. The fifth reviews national and regional program expenditures. The
sixth and seventh sections evaluate the Value for Money of programs expenditures for
2014-2016. The eighth section presents conclusions and recommendations.

                                           xiv
       Over the past ten years, Peru has made great development strides, reaching a per
capita Gross National Income (GNI) of US$5,880. Its achievements include significant
advances in social and development indicators (World Bank 2012). This study found that
the HIV/AIDS program in Peru achieved important gains in reducing premature mortality
following the free delivery of antiretroviral drugs (ARV) in 2004 and the successful
execution of the Multisectoral Strategy 2007-2011. The Burden of Diseases Study reports
a 54.7 percent reduction in deaths related to AIDS in Peru from the peak year to the
present (Ortblad et al. 2013). A progressive decrease in premature AIDS deaths occurred
in Lima, Callao, and the coastal areas after the initiation of the ART program. However,
the number of premature AIDS deaths has increased in some regions of the Amazon
(Alarcón, Pun, and Gutiérrez 2012).

        Public financial resources are available for the HIV/AIDS program. The program
received significant external support from international cooperation from 2005 to 2010—
an average US$24.3 million each year. The Global Fund contributed US$41 million to
support the successful execution of the Multisectoral Strategy 2007-2011. Today, the
program belongs to one of the few prioritized public interventions in the health sector in
Peru. The program’s share of public funding has increased from US$17.7 million per
year from 2005-2010, to US$57.8 million yearly from 2011-2013. As part of the
government decentralization process, more than half of public resources have been
allocated to regional governments, that is, outside Lima and Callao. Regarding allocation
of financial resources by risk group, around 44 percent of the total budget was directed to
pregnant women, infected children, adolescents, MSM and PLWA, while the remaining
financial resources were allocated to the general population.

        ART services coverage is at the medium level. In 2013, around 27,502 people
received ART—or about 43 to 48 percent of the estimated number of people who are
eligible for treatment and 66 percent of the diagnosed eligible group, under the WHO
2013 guidelines. Under the same guidelines, the percentage of ART coverage for
estimated infected pregnant women has risen to 59 percent. However, alternative
estimates based on health service data and WHO guidelines from 2010 reports ART
coverage of about 92 percent (UNGASS 2012).

        The results of our simulation show that about 49 percent of MSM and PLWA
eligible for ARV treatment are receiving ART from the public sector, NGOs, or the social
security system. However, health and social services are not appropriately following up
with children infected through mother-to-child transmission, as the coverage of this
population has been estimated to be a mere 18 percent. Some infected children are in
need of both health services and foster care. Finally, the native communities of the
Amazon are in need or urgent attention. These communities are an emerging risk group
whose needs have not been addressed by the program.

        Regarding equity of access, Silva-Santisteban et al. (2013) performed a study in
four cities in Peru and reported that 82 percent of diagnosed PLWA receive free ART
regardless of socioeconomic status. On a different dimension of equity, the Demographic

                                            xv
and Family Health Survey 2004-2012, shows that Peruvian women of child bearing age
from quintiles 1-2 demonstrated an increase in accurate knowledge of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV from 30 percent in 2004 to 46 percent in 2012. This may also reflect
effective mass media and educational campaigns.

        We now know that a fast response is an important element for successfully
combating HIV/AIDS; countries that rapidly increase coverage of HIV treatment have
faster decreases in the incidence of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS 2013b). UNAIDS recommends
a faster treatment scale-up to cover at least 60 percent of the appropriate population. The
incremental cost of scaling up the program from 2014-2016 has been estimated by this
study at about US$32 million over three years.

        Key interventions in scaling up the program include providing MSM with HIV
testing services and full access to ART. The Ministry has access to low-priced ARVs
obtained through an Alliance with PAHO Strategic Drug Fund, but has limited regional
laboratory capacity. Currently, the network of regional laboratories is under hospital
administration, and the organizational model seems to have reached its limit in meeting
the program’s needs. Additionally, there are not enough financial resources in the budget
to expand diagnostic platforms during the fiscal year 2013. A financial plan that is
aligned with program coverage targets is needed.

        The case study revealed that a significant percentage of financial resources
allocated for human resources are not reaching the HIV/AIDS program, but are being
spent by other programs, some of which are related, such as the Sexually Transmitted
Disease (STD) program. This issue is greatly affecting human resources availability for
preventive activities directed to high-risk populations. The shifting resources have limited
the number of community health workers dedicated to HIV/AIDS prevention and
education, which threatens to undermine Peru’s potential to accelerate progress on
HIV/AIDS. Issues related to community health workers include: (i) whether they should
become part of the formal health system, and (ii) how they should be compensated.

Recommendations

      The public delivery system should target a greater percentage of its budget to
       interventions for high-risk populations, such as infected children and MSM. We
       recommend NGO partnerships to host infected children and adolescents, as well
       as association and private sector partnerships to perform HIV tests.
      Closing the coverage gap means active testing, promotion of condom use and
       proactive ART with the support of CHWs so that people are able to follow up
       after their diagnosis.
      Most of the financial resources needed to close the high-risk population coverage
       gap can be made available with a re-appropriation of existing financial resources
       allocated to the program.
      The development of a human resource strategy—where CHWs play a significant
       role for preventive and ART services—should clarify boundaries between related

                                            xvi
    programs. Cost-effective models for Peru’s HIV/AIDS program include the
    community health workers program in controlling tuberculosis from Peru and the
    Brazilian community health agents program.
   Increasing laboratory capacity to regions and expanding rapid diagnostic testing
    to the maximum number of points of care would have the greatest impact on
    increasing program coverage. Coverage can be further expanded through rapid-
    tests procured through the PAHO Strategic Fund, collaborative agreements with
    private laboratories, and rapid-testing at diverse points of care, for example,
    shopping centers, festivals and gay pride events.
   Finally, it is important to open a dialogue on the needs of native Amazonian
    communities regarding the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The survival of the native
    communities of the Amazon is a “public good” and other public and national and
    international private institutions should be invited to contribute.

                      PART I – OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
        The objective of this study is to analyze the Value for Money of the HIV/AIDS program
through the framework of prioritization and financial decentralization, as well as its new resource
allocation approach, referred to as results-based budgeting (RBB). Value for Money is the
allocation of limited resources and interventions to maximize results, in this case ensuring that
resources are allocated to populations at increased risk of HIV transmission and in high
transmission areas. This has proven to be highly cost-effective in the context of epidemics.

        The primary concern of this study is “Value for Money” or the transformation of
financial resources into outputs and outcome (Smith 2009), which is a multi-step process. First,
government financial resources available to the HIV/AIDS program are used to purchase
physical inputs, such as laboratory services and antiretroviral drugs (ARV). Second, the inputs
are used to produce a series of activities that generate: (i) health care services such as ARV
therapy, and (ii) outcomes such as improving and extending healthy life years due to the lower
number of new infections.

   This paper uses four indicators in order to demonstrate levels of Value for Money in the
HIV/AIDS health program in Peru.

      Appropriate budgetary allocation of financial resources to the HIV/AIDS program as
       measured by the proportion of resources allocated to high risk groups, that is, populations
       with the highest HIV prevalence and identified as a priority, such as men who have sex
       with men (MSM) and mothers and children (World Bank 2012). This indicator measures
       the program’s cost effectiveness in targeting high-risk groups.

      Program effectiveness as measured by the percentage decrease in the number of
       premature deaths during the last decade and by knowledge among women of childbearing
       age, especially related to the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy
       in quintiles 1-2 (the poorest 40 percent). This knowledge is a precondition for behavioral
       change and increases the chance that infected mothers will adhere to treatment and
       thereby reduce the number of infected children.

      Average expenditure of ARV therapy per patient across provinces. This indicator offers a
       summary measure of cost efficiency and indicates the extent to which: (i) inputs are being
       purchased at minimum price; and (ii) the organization is deploying them in an optimal
       fashion.

      Effective management of human resources budget. This indicator allows for assessment
       of regional authorities and their ability to use and appropriately manage resources.

    Data was gathered through interviews and databases. Program expenditures from 2011-2013
were extracted primarily from the information system of the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF), through its Integrated System of Financial Administration (SIEF) and the “Consulta
Amigable” web system, MEF officials who provided access to unpublished supplementary data,
the Ministry of Health and the IMPACTA NGO.1 Data from the 2003-2010 international
cooperation was compiled from the AIDS health accounts developed by UNAIDS/Peru, and
from the websites of Care-Peru and the Global Fund.

    Data on planned and executed budgets was gathered and analyzed according to the following
levels of aggregation: i) type of intervention, ii) governmental level, and iii) group of
beneficiaries.2

    Clinical and epidemiological information was provided by the HIV/AIDS program from
MOH at the central and regional level, the Department of Epidemiology, PAHO, UNAIDS, the
Unit of Health, Sexuality and Human Development of the Universidad Cayetano Heredia, and
the NGOs IMPACTA and Socios en Salud.

    Two visits to the Amazon province of Loreto–one of the regions where deaths are
increasing–were conducted with the objective of understanding how the HIV/AIDS program and
corresponding financial system function at the regional level. During the second visit, a case
study was carried out to support analysis of the fourth indicator (the ability of local authorities to
use and appropriately manage resources).

    Finally, based on preliminary results of the efficiency analysis, policy and decision-making
authorities were interviewed regarding the allocation of financial resources at national and
regional levels. The purpose of these interviews was to better understand the underlying causes
of some deficiencies.

                  PART II – THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC IN PERU
THE GLOBAL CONTEXT

        In the last 30 years, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has emerged as a major global public health
challenge, beginning as a relatively small problem in the 1980s to one of the leading causes of
mortality and burden of disease over the last decade. HIV/AIDS mortality was the fifth leading
cause of global DALYs in 2010. However, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is heterogeneous among
regions. There has been a decrease in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in some areas, such as sub-
Saharan Africa and Latin America, and an increase in others, such as Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. In addition, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS continues to grow, in part due to
the increasing availability of anti-retroviral (ART) treatments. Latin American and the Caribbean
(LAC) is regarded as a low prevalence region, with an estimated 0.6 percent prevalence and 1.86
million people estimated to be living with HIV in the region (Teva et al. 2012).

TRENDS IN HIV/AIDS CASES IN PERU

        Peru is an upper-middle income country, with a per capita Gross National Income (GNI)
of US$5,880 (World Bank 2012). Over the past ten years, Peru has made great development
achievements, including high growth rates, low inflation, macroeconomic stability, and
significant advances in social and development indicators (World Bank 2013).

        The prevalence of HIV in Peru is estimated at 0.4 percent, which is below the LAC
regional average (UNAIDS 2012). Recent estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases study
show that HIV accounts for 1.8 percent of the total burden of disease in Peru and 1.9 percent of
the total number of deaths (Ortblad et al. 2013). Recent figures (as of December 31, 2012) from
the Department of Epidemiology of the Peruvian Ministry of Health show that 48,809 cases of
HIV and 29,454 cases of AIDS have been reported since 1983. This may be an underestimation,
since many people with HIV do not know they have the disease. UNAIDS (2013), estimates that
around 76,000 people (36,000-230,000) in Peru were living with HIV/AIDS in 2012. Our model
estimates that around 67,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in 2013. From 2001 to 2013, 56
percent of reported HIV cases were in the Lima-Callao area, with 10 percent in the mountain
region, 15 percent in the Amazon region, and the remaining 16 percent in other coastal states. An
estimate 3 percent of reported cases had no known location (MINSA, 2013a). Reported
HIV/AIDS incidence among native communities of the Amazon has risen during the last decade
(Box1).

Box 1. HIV/AIDS and native communities of the Amazon: An epidemic in progress

The rising incidence of HIV/AIDS during the last decade, in conjunction with a number of socio-
cultural factors, made the native communities of the Amazon a highly vulnerable group for HIV/AIDS.
Data from a study in the Amazon region shows that cases increased rapidly since 2003, from 86 in
2003-2007 to 239 in 2008-2012—a 3.8 factor increase. The province of Condorcanqui had 22 cases in
the period 2003-2007 and 97 cases in the period 2008-2012 (Figure B.1).

The socio-cultural context that fosters the rise of HIV/AIDS begins with the social and economic
marginalization of the Amazonian peoples. Because the government has little control over the areas
inhabited by indigenous communities, public programs and services are mostly absent. The area is also
host to a number of illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, timber harvesting, and illegal mining.
Initially, young people from indigenous communities migrated to urban centers for work and returned
to their communities as HIV carriers. Adolescents have been subject to sexual exploitation in cities and
illegal sites. An increasing number of women have left their communities and some cases of mother-
to-child transmission have been reported recently.

Risk behaviors in the indigenous communities consist of early sexual initiation, multiple partners, and
resistance to condom use. In some communities, male adolescents initiate their sexual activity with
other males. Health issues associated with sexuality are not addressed and HIV/AIDS is regarded as a
disease of homosexuals. Men who have sex with both men and women are not regarded as
homosexuals. There is a lack of understanding that a person who may appear healthy can still be a
carrier of HIV. Condoms are not considered a means of preventing the transmission of the virus.

Available health services can identify new cases with rapid diagnostic tests. However, preventive
actions and ART are almost nonexistent.

        There was a steady increase in cases from 1983, when the first case was reported, to
2008. From 2008 onwards, the MOH reports a decline of new cases as shown in Figure 1.
However, the decline in new cases can be attributed to a decline in the number of screening tests
performed, as testing is offered in a relatively small number of health centers (CERITSS).3
Regarding infected children, the MOH reports that the total number has dropped over the last 10
years, from 5,600 cases in 2000 to 4,000 in 2010 and 3,200 in 2012 (MINSA 2013a). The decline
of cases among children was reported by diagnostic and laboratory services.

THE EPIDEMIC IN KEY POPULATIONS

        Figure 2 illustrates a ranking of premature AIDS deaths by age and sex compared to other
leading causes in Peru. Due to the nature of HIV/AIDS transmission and the timing of sexual
contact, HIV/AIDS mostly burdens young adults. In fact, AIDS is the number one cause of death
for men in the age group 30-49. For women aged 25-34 years, AIDS is the second cause of
death. In children under 5, HIV/AIDS ranks eighth for girls and ninth for boys as a cause of
mortality.

       The HIV epidemic in Peru is concentrated in certain populations (UNAIDS 2013). The
data show the greatest rates of infection are among men who have sex with men (MSM), with
much lower rates found in female sex workers (FSW), and still lower rates among the general
population. The UNAIDS (2013) results are consistent with the data from Figure 2, where
HIV/AIDS is shown as the leading cause of premature death for males aged 30-49.

       In Peru, the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women has remained stable.
Table 1 shows the latest HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Peru was estimated at 0.28
percent, although the prevalence peaked at 0.44 percent in Lima in 2002. While 97 percent of
HIV transmission is sexual, vertical transmission from mother to child also occurs. According to
our estimates, around 370 infected children were born during 2013. Screening of pregnant
women and timely initiation of prophylaxis and therapy are key interventions to control vertical
transmission. With these interventions, transmission can be reduced from 30 percent to less than
2 percent (Dr. Llanos, PAHO personal interview, 2003 and De Vincenzi, 2011).

       With HIV infection spreading through heterosexual intercourse, the ratio of men to
women with HIV/AIDS has been stable for a decade, at around 15:3 (Bracamonte, UNAIDS,
personal interview, 2013).

       The HIV prevalence among MSM was estimated to be around 12.4 percent in 2012, but
higher for transgendered women, at 20.8 percent (Table 1). On the other hand, for the sub-
population of male sex workers (MSW), prevalence was estimated at 14.6 percent, while for
female sex workers (FSWs), HIV prevalence is estimated at 3 percent in Lima. Results of the
research carried out by Cáceres et al. (2009) suggest that incidence among MSW and
transgendered women actually decreased during the period 2000-2012 (Table 1). However,
according to UNAIDS (2012), MSM still represent the largest source of new infections in Peru,
reaching 56 percent.

PART III – THE FIRST PHASE RESPONSE TO THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC
                            IN PERU
       The first response to the epidemic occurred during the 1990s, with the establishment of
the National Strategy for Control of STIs for preventing HIV/AIDS (PROCETSS). From 2002 to
2010, the response was a combination of efforts by the government, the Global Fund, USAID,
NGOs, academic and research communities, and civil society. The current response is being led
by the government, and is supported by the Global Fund and UN technical agencies such as
PAHO and UNAIDS. (Figure 3)

THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF STDS, 1995

         The Multisectoral Commission against AIDS was established in 1983 following reports
of the first AIDS case. In 1995, the Special Program for Control of AIDS (PECOS) was created
with the aim of developing prevention strategies to target youth and to train staff on counseling.
Initially, the approach was to treat STIs as a way of preventing HIV/AIDS transmission.

      From 2002 to 2013, Peru received US$75.9 million from the Global Fund solely for the
HIV/AIDS program (the TB program received additional funding). As the implementer of



                                                   25
Global Fund activities, CARE-Peru was involved in grant Rounds 2, 5 and 6. This grant has been
one of the largest in the Latin American region (Annexes A and B).

        For the second round in 2002, the Global Fund selected Peru to receive a US$6.5 million
grant. These resources were used to expand coverage of the HIV/AIDS program at the hospital
level, and to establish technical standards. In 2005, Peru obtained financing for the proposal
“Closing gaps: towards the achievement of the objectives of development of the Millennium in
TB and HIV/AIDS in Peru.” The main focus of this proposal was the regional expansion of
program activities.

THE GLOBAL FUND AND THE MULTISECTORAL STRATEGIC PLAN, 2007-2011

     In 2006, the Global Fund approved a US$41 million contribution that was used to support the
first Multisectoral Strategic Plan, 2007-2011. The plan’s objectives included the following
interventions directed to both general and at-risk populations:

      Reducing vertical transmission. In 2005, technical standards were enacted for the
       prevention of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child (MCT). The first
       protocol was defined for the diagnosis of HIV in pregnant women, ART prophylaxis, and
       clinical management of HIV-exposed neonates and positive mothers. Starting from the
       sixth round, the strategy of prevention of MTC transmission was institutionalized. In
       addition, HIV tests were implemented at a massive scale for women of childbearing age. 4
      Increasing HIV testing, counseling and condom distribution. The promotion of safe
       behaviors to avoid contracting STI-HIV/AIDS targeting FSW, MSW, and MSM included
       increased access to—and uptake of—HIV testing, counseling, and condoms. In the period
       2006-2008, educational activities were directed to high-risk groups, 54 percent to FSWs
       and 21 percent to MSM.
      Diagnosis and early treatment of HIV. The Global Fund, along with other UN
       organizations, such as PAHO and UNAIDS, and various NGO programs, have been key
       in raising national policy awareness of the need to scale up access to ART. In 2006, the
       government started ART support for adults. The program included giving the CD4 viral
       cell count/viral load test to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) and according to an
       established schedule.5 Initially, the program was established solely in hospitals but has
       been expanded to selected health centers. Since 2004, ART therapy has been provided
       free of charge.

    Finally, in 2010 Peru was awarded US$12 million for the project “Building social capital for
HIV prevention and access to comprehensive health for transsexuals, gays, and MSM
populations.” These groups have high HIV/AIDS prevalence and low coverage. The grant was
awarded to the NGO INPARES but was recently reallocated to PARSALUD. The project targets
eight regions that account for 80 percent of reported HIV/AIDS cases: Coastal areas, including
Lambayeque, La Libertad, Lima, Callao, Ica; and Jungle areas, including Loreto, San Martín,
and Ucayali.



                                               26
CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

        In the 1990s, various civil associations were created to operate as self-help groups in the
absence of effective treatment. During the 2000s, the Global Fund and the National Multisectoral
Coordination (CONAMUSA) brought together civil society organizations and PLWA. The time
period saw the appearance of new organizations, including Peruanos Positivos, the first national
network of people living with AIDS. Later, the arrival of the coalition Vida led to legal changes
regarding the provision of treatment. In addition, these organizations participated in the
implementation of projects financed by the Global Fund and have been key players in HIV
policy making. Further, these organizations have led to greater national recognition of the rights
of those affected by the epidemic.

        Religious communities and churches have also shown commitment to human rights in
health. For example, the Anglican Church of Peru and the Rosa Blanca Ecumenical Parochial
Center and have been involved in the support of people living with AIDS.

       Finally, in Peru, there is a large body of HIV/AIDS research. Approximately 250 articles
on HIV/AIDS —with clinical and epidemiological focus— were published between 1985 and
2010 (Caballero 2011), released mainly in the last decade. Research on HIV in academic centers
has enabled the characterization of the epidemic and the identification of more vulnerable
subgroups, such as MSM. Also, clinical research provided empirical evidence for the new
guidelines, asserting that ART can serve as HIV prophylaxis for heterosexual men and women
(Cáceres 2013 personal interview). The studies have been conducted by a group of researchers
from the universities San Marcos and Cayetano Heredia in collaboration with the Universidad
Católica, NGOs, and economic research centers.

        Despite these notable accomplishments, there is a gap between research and government
policy, which is being addressed through various efforts. For example, well-known researchers
are participating in panel discussions focusing on emerging strategic discussions, such as
“Getting to Zero.”

  PART IV – THE CURRENT RESPONSE TO THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC
MAIN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NOT-FOR-PROFIT STAKEHOLDERS

       Regarding the provision of HIV/AIDS services, the Peruvian health system has a public
and a private not-for-profit sector. The public sector consists of a tax-funded system and a
contributory social security scheme. The tax funded system supports the Ministry of Health,
Comprehensive Health Insurance (SIS), and the Regional Directorates for Health (DIRESAs).
SIS covers people without health insurance and gives priority to those living in poverty and
extreme poverty.

        The state provides HIV/AIDS services to about 70 percent of the infected population,
mainly through the public health system (MOH/DIRESAs). With the support of the MOH,
various not-for-profit NGOs provide HIV/AIDS services to about 10 percent of the patients. The
MOH supplies NGOs with ARV and laboratory tests services. These national and international
NGOs target the most-at-risk populations such as MSM, MSW, and transsexuals. Some NGOs
also carry out HIV/AIDS clinical trials and drug studies in association with the Ministry of
Health, the American National Institute of Health (NIH), and private pharmaceutical companies,
and at the same time provide services to AIDS patients.

about 20 percent of HIV/AIDS patients.

NEW PUBLIC POLICY SCENARIO: PRIORITY PROGRAMS, FINANCIAL
DECENTRALIZATION AND RESULTS-BASED BUDGETING

        In 2008, the Ministry of Economics and Finance began to prioritize selected health
programs. These programs are protected at the time financial resources are allocated. Since 2011,
HIV/AIDS and TB were added to the list of priority programs and the government has assumed
full funding of the treatment and care of HIV patients in Peru. The new program purchases the
antiretroviral drugs, HIV diagnostic tests, condoms, and health education for the general
population and the most-at-risk groups.

        Beginning in 2002, the government began decentralization. With regard to the health
sector, decentralization provides the regional health centers and the national and regional
hospitals autonomy from the MOH and makes them recipients of direct financial allocation from
the MEF. This process included the implementation of two robust information systems, the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (SIAF) and the Integrated Administrative
Control System (SIGA). The information systems permit a comprehensive yet user-friendly
overview of the whole financial system.

Financial Flows of the HIV/AIDS Program

         The MEF allocates financial resources to the MOH, the National Institute of Health
(INS), the General Directorate for Supplies and Drugs (DARES), Comprehensive Health
Insurance (SIS), the 25 regional governments, Regional Directorates for Health (DIRESA), and
the national and regional hospitals. Financial resources are transferred directly to these
institutions without the administrative participation of the MOH. However, each institution at the
regional level needs day-to-day approval from the regional government regarding the execution
of the assigned resources (Figure 4).

     The funds allocated to the HIV/AIDS program are channeled to different institutions:

        The lines allocated to the MOH are designated for policy definition and monitoring
         purposes.
        The lines allocated to DARES are used to purchase ART, condoms and other inputs.
        The lines allocated to the National Reference Laboratory, which is located in the National
         Institute of Health in Lima (also falls under MOH), are used to support the viral load and
         CD4 viral count tests and process laboratory tests. However, the rest of the laboratory
         network falls under the DIRESAs and hospitals.
        Funds allocated to the Comprehensive Health Insurance (SIS) cover laboratory,
         diagnostic services for pregnant women, and the consultations costs of other HIV/AIDS
         patients. These financial resources are transferred to the providers via the regional
         government.
        Finally more than half of the funds allocated to the regional government are earmarked
         for wages. The remaining allocation is directed to health education and community
         information services.

Results Based Budgeting Process

        The new method for allocating financial resources, budgeting-for-results (BFR), involves
linking the public budget with the delivery of services to different risk groups. For example, the
budget line “Adults and young people receive STDs and HIV/AIDS screening tests” targets the
general population 15-49 years old for STDs and HIV testing (Annex B).

    As shown in Table 3, budgeting-for-results involve the participation of all decentralized
institutions in different roles:

       The MOH and the MEF suggest priority groups to be covered and the types of
        interventions to be addressed, but each decentralized unit drafts budget formulations:
        MOH HIV/AIDS program, National Institute of Health (lab services), General
        Directorate for Supplies and Drugs (DARES), Comprehensive Health Insurance (SIS),
        Regional Directorates for Health (DIRESA), and national and regional hospitals. The
        budgeting process includes quantification of intermediate outcomes and interventions, as
        well as the activities, goals and associated financial resources, using SIGA and SIAF
        software.6
       Budget consolidation and approval: The MEF consolidates budget implementation
        progress every six months. After the information is updated it is published on the MEF
        website. Adjustments to the HIV/AIDS program budget are made continuously
        throughout the year in every institution, but they need approval from the regional
        government and the MEF.
       Monitoring of HIV/AIDS: Every national and regional institution has access to real time
        monitoring of HIV/AIDS program budget changes and execution by accessing the public
        databases SIAF and SIGA at the MEF-website. Activities include analysis of budget


                                                   31
                         execution, achievement of operational targets, number of services provided, and analysis
                         of intermediate and final results.7
                        Measurement of intermediate indicators for impact monitoring: The MEF and the MOH
                         decide on the indicators they want measured and the National Institute of Statistics and
                         Informatics (INEI) collects and analyses the data using the demographic and family
                         health survey (DFHS). The indicators assess, for example, the knowledge of transmission
                         of HIV/AIDS among women of childbearing age. It is important to mention that the
                         survey includes only women in its sample; men are not yet included. The results of the
                         measurements are not linked to budget approval.
                        Finally, the MEF plans to do a future (2015+) baseline study to compare and measure the
                         performance of the HIV/AIDS program.8
   This new budgeting method should facilitate higher levels of accountability in the delivery of
HIV/AIDS services and link spending with results. Also, this approach may help determine any
necessary expenditure increases or decreases in a particular line/intervention.

SERVICE DELIVERY: ANTIRETROVIRAL AND SCREENING

        In 2004, the SIS began financing the ART therapy of infected children. In 2005, the
MOH began delivering ART drugs free of charge. As shown in Figure 5, cases of treatment with
ARV therapy have increased by a factor of five since 2004. MOH currently covers 19,552
patients (71 percent), and the NGOs cover 2,595 patients (10 percent) with ART medications
provided by the MOH (Figure 5). Since 2002, the social security (EsSalud) has delivered
treatment to its members and 5,355 cases (19 percent) were covered in 2012 (Figure 5). In total,
there are 27,502 people receiving ART. Based on this information, this report estimates ART
coverage of all diagnosed and eligible PLWA at 66 percent based on currently available
guidelines that favor starting ART at CD4 count of 500 (Box 2).9

Source: Author’s elaboration based on data from Llanos 2010, and the HIV/AIDS program

       Initially, the program identified and addressed the key problems associated with delays in
the enrolment of patients. Thereafter, a successful strategy was implemented to rationalize and
                                                                  32
simplify the diagnosis and initiation of treatment with the support of community health workers
(CHWs). The strategy was patterned on the MDR-TB-Dots Plus program, which had a
successful CHW program (Lecca 2013, personal interview; Sebastian et al. 2006; MINSA 2009).

Coverage for Pregnant Women and Children

         Among interventions to prevent MTC HIV transmission is the testing of all mothers who
come in contact with health services. A rapid HIV testing program is used and those infected
start treatment immediately.

        Figure 6 shows that the percentage of pregnant women tested for HIV has increased
steadily since 2004 at all levels of care, after the introduction of rapid testing or on-site testing.
In 2011, around 75 percent of all pregnant women attending antenatal care were tested for HIV
(ONUSIDA/OPS 2012). The coverage of screening pregnant women has currently been deferred
due to problems with the reimbursement of laboratory services. SIS can purchase rapid HIV tests
and the regional laboratory might process them. However, the regional lab is part of the hospital
and SIS currently reimburses the hospital rather than the regional laboratory. The result is that
the lab does not have the incentive to perform rapid testing.

       Figure 6 shows the total number of pregnant women on ARV treatment of the total
estimated number of infected pregnant women. The coverage has increased from 20 percent to
59 percent in the period 2000-2012 (Llanos et al. 2008; ONUSIDA 2013). Alternatives estimates
based on health service data —of HIV positive pregnant women, who received ARV for
prophylaxis or treatment in MINSA— show an increase from 48 percent in 2004, to 92 percent
in 2010 (UNGASS 2012).



                                                                     33
       In contrast, ART coverage for infected living children is estimated at 18 percent. Among
the approximately 3,200 children living with HIV, only 584 are currently on treatment (MINSA-
Spectrum 2013). There is little information on this group beyond press reports (MINSA and
Socios en Salud 2010). Some faith-based NGOs, with the support of the international
cooperation, host children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS—such as the residents of San Camilo
and the Good Shepherd (MINSA 2011). These institutions reported that there were 267 orphans
in Lima in 2007. Independently, the NGO Vida Libre reported 232 orphan children in Lima. Of

demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of a group in need of both health services and foster care
(Llanos et al. 2008).

TRENDS IN HIV/AIDS PROGRAM EXPENDITURE 2002-2013

        There are three subsectors that finance and provide health interventions for the prevention
and treatment of HIV/AIDS: (i) the public sector, which includes the MOH and social security;
(ii) the private non-profit sector with NGOs such as Socios en Salud, and Via Libre and (iii)
bilateral and international organizations such as the Global Fund and USAID (projects Vigia and
Policy).

        Figure 7 shows HIV/AIDS program expenditures during the last decade by the
government, the Global Fund, USAID, and others (excluding out-of-pocket expenditures). As
seen in Figure 7, the government has increased its participation. An increasing share of funding
is coming from the public sector, comprised of the MOH and social security (EsSalud). Other
important funders are the Global Fund and bilateral organizations, such as USAID, and
international organizations that provide technical assistance, such as UNAIDS and PAHO.

        During the period 2005-2010, the total program expenditure reached about US$41
million annually (US$ as of 2013). In recent years (2011-2013), this amount increased to US$60
million annually. The Global Fund has been the most important external source of funding and
spent an annual average of US$8.6 million during the period 2003-2010 (Figure 7). During the
last three years, the amount disbursed by the Global Fund fell to an average of US$2.5 million
(Annex C).

       Regarding intervention type, HIV prevention reached 32 percent in the period 2005-2010
(MINSA, 2010) and increased to 46 percent in the following period (2011-2011). The 2010
expenditure decrease by international organizations and the government affected the
procurement of ARV and preventive actions.

                                                                            35
TRENDS IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY REGIONS

       Since 2005, the program’s share of public funding has increased from US$18.5 million
spent annually during the period 2005-2010, to US$57.8 million in 2011-2013 (Annex C), with
more than half of these resources allocated to the regions outside Lima and Callao. In contrast,
the public sector allocated 4 percent to regions during the previous period, 2005-2010.

        Figure 8 shows the distribution of resources allocated by the MEF to the central and
regional governments. As mentioned above, two important changes were observed: (i) a
significant increase of the resources allocated to the program, and (ii) the emergence of the
regions—outside Lima and Callao—as main beneficiaries of public funds.

         PART VI – VALUE FOR MONEY IN THE HIV/AIDS PROGRAM
        In practice, the pursuit of more Value for Money consists of distributing resources to
interventions that are more cost-effective or where a greater “value for money” is achieved. At
the same time, it is important to evaluate the extent to which the program has been focused on
the most vulnerable groups or people with a greater need for health interventions. Therefore,
efficient allocation of resources should combine the dimensions of efficiency and equity.

        The inclusion of the HIV/AIDS program in the RBB method allows for more detailed
analyses, because the budget lines correspond to easily identifiable activities and intervention
type for the beneficiary group. A summary of the analysis of the indicators selected for analyzing
Value for Money is presented in Table 4.

APPROPRIATE BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR HIV/AIDS

       Costs associated with high-risk groups were analyzed in order to evaluate the
appropriateness of program priorities. Key populations are comprised of infected pregnant
women and their infected children, MSM, female and male sex workers, and PLWA.

       The average budget allocated to high-risk groups, estimated by the public system during
the period 2011-2013 represents just 79 percent of the estimated total costs. Furthermore, the
amount allocated by the MEF to high-risk groups during this period represents 44 percent of total
program expenditures (Annex D). Most of the remaining program expenditures are directed at
the general population (Annex D). Since activities for the general population overlap with other
program interventions (i.e., the STDs Program), the remaining funding can be easily requested
and used by these other programs (See case study in Loreto-Section D).

    The analysis took the following steps:

       Size of the key population was estimated using the following sources: population
        projections were extracted from the World Development Indicator (2013), number of
        pregnant women was assumed to be equal to 1.3 of the number of children born—which
        is estimated at a birth rate of 21.3 per 1,000 in 2010, and 19.6 per 1,000 in 2015. The
        percentage of adolescents (aged 15-19) was taken from CELADE (2012).
       Number of MSM was estimated at 6 percent of males aged 15-49 years (Alarcón et al.
        2012). Number of FSW estimated at 2 percent of females aged 15-49 and number of
        other PLWA were estimated as the residual of other categories. Prevalence was assumed
        to be 0.28 percent for pregnant women, 5.16 percent for MSM, 0.5 percent for female sex
        workers and 0.24 percent for the general population 15-49 years old years (Alarcón et al.
        2012).
       Current coverage by health services was estimated by using the number of people served
        by the health services over the total relevant population, as defined by the WHO 2013
        guidelines. The number of people served was based on recent data from the Ministry of

                                                   39
       Health HIV/AIDS program (Figure 5). The dataset contains the total number of PLWA
       on ART and provides details on the total number of children. Then, the total number for
       other populations was estimated on residuals.
      Unit cost of providing treatment for adults was estimated at US$409, consisting of an
       ARV annual cost of US$294 and a consultation cost of US$115 (details in Annexes E
       and F). The ARV therapy costs were based on 13 ARV combinations used by patients of
       the public program. Consultation unit costs were based on estimates from the NGO
       IMPACTA. The cost for treating children was estimated at US$555. The ARV cost for
       treating children is 50 percent higher according to HIV/AIDS managers (Dr. Gonzalez,
       personal interview). Consultation services for adults and children have been estimated at
       US$115.5 and are based on De La Grecca (2013). The study includes human resources
       and clinical supplies but excludes the costs of ART and laboratory testing—which are
       provided free of charge by the public sector to the NGOs (Annex F). The cost per testing
       pregnant women was estimated at US$9 (Dr. Cabezas, Director National Health Institute,
       personal interview, 2013). The unit cost of screening, condom distribution and peer CHW
       was assumed at US$103 using World Bank estimates for Peru (2011).
      Total estimated costs were estimated by multiplying the estimated number of people
       reached by the health interventions times the unit cost.
      Average budget allocations directed to high risk populations in 2011-2013 are presented.
       Other budget lines not included in Table 5 are not specific for high-risk populations.
       These budget lines presented include human resources, ARVs and clinical supplies but
       exclude overhead and costs of monitoring and managing the program from the central
       and regional levels (Annex D).

    In summary, financial resources are available, but funding for high-risk groups corresponds
to less than half of the budget. Any increase in the coverage of services for high-risk populations
will require a re-allocation of the available funding.

Solutions Proposed, Rapid scale-up of Diagnostic and Laboratory Services

        Financial resources are available but ART treatment services covering MSM are in the
medium-low range, denoting insufficient testing and diagnostic services. Therefore, a key
intervention is scaling up HIV testing to MSM and then providing full access to ART. HIV
testing can dramatically decrease the epidemic, as the treatment of more infected MSM could
reduce the infection rate (UNAIDS 2013).

        According to our analysis, resources allocated for laboratory HIV testing for the period
2011-2013 were insufficient (Annex D). Therefore, a review of the budget lines allocated to
testing and a financial plan aligned with the program coverage target is required (Annex G).
Currently, the network of public regional laboratories is under the Regional Health Bureau
administration, and the National Health Institute manages the central laboratory. This
organizational model seems to have reached its limit in meeting the increase in coverage of
diagnoses. During the early phase of the program (2002-2010), testing activities were supported
by private laboratories, which is an option that should be revisited.


                                                40
       Furthermore, testing services should urgently be decentralized. The MOH laboratory
network should focus on counting CD4 lymphocytes and viral load, and rapid-testing should be
available at the maximum number of public and private points of care. For example, Brazil’s
Fique Sabendo (know your status) promotes testing in places like shopping centers, festivals and
gay pride events, and can serve as a model (UNAIDS 2013).

PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS

Reduction in Number of Deaths

        Regarding mortality, Ortblad et al. (2013) analyze the Global Burden of Diseases Study
data and compare changes from the peak year to present (2002-2012), and report a 54.7 percent
(from 83.0 to 11.5 percent) reduction in the percentage of deaths attributable to AIDS in Peru.
These gains were achieved by the government-led scaling up of the ART program for infected
persons, which began in 2004 and continue with the successful execution of the Multisectoral
Strategy 2007-2011. This effort involved the delivery of free ARV therapy to infected mothers in
order to prevent transmission to their babies and the delivery of ART to other high-risk groups.

Amazon has slightly increased during the same period.

       In summary, a progressive decrease in premature AIDS deaths occurred in Lima and
Callao after the initiation of the antiretroviral drug therapy program. The number also decreased
in the coastal area. However, the number of premature AIDS deaths has increased in some
regions of the Amazon, such as in the department of San Martin.

Accurate Knowledge about MTC HIV

        MTC transmission is a major route of HIV infection among children throughout the
world and these infected children are likely to die before their teens. MTC HIV transmission is
preventable. If infected mothers could be identified and treated early, their chances of giving
birth to an infected baby would be greatly reduced (Llanos 2013, and De Vicenzi 2011).

        Due to the increase in HIV infection among women of childbearing age, the Ministry of
Health is implementing antenatal HIV screening to identify infected mothers. Accurate
knowledge about MTC HIV transmission has been selected as a second indicator of the
program’s effectiveness. Accurate knowledge of the transmission of HIV from mother to child
has the potential to shape an infected individual’s level of perceived risk and behavior regarding
adherence to the treatment, elective C-section, and bottle-feeding among a certain percentage of
the mothers. Lack of accurate knowledge is certainly a risk factor of HIV transmission.

                                                                                       42
         The ENDES 2004-2012, a large and representative national survey of Peruvian women,
shows that 62 to 66 percent of women knew that “HIV infection can be transmitted from mother
to fetus during pregnancy. “The women of quintile 1-2 (40 percent of the poorest) demonstrated
an increase in accurate knowledge, from 30 percent in 2004 to 46 percent in 2012. This is an
important result as it signals improvements in equity (Figure 10). However, not all improvements
can be attributed exclusively to the program. All-encompassing activities supported by total
program expenditures together with the public media create a receptive environment that
facilitates information sharing.

        In summary, the indicators suggest the program has achieved its objectives and has been
effective in decreasing the number of premature deaths attributed to AIDS, and has helped create
a positive environment for accurate knowledge sharing, even to the hard-to-reach women of
quintiles 1-2.

Equity of access to ART services by PLWA

         There is scarce information on access to ART by different socioeconomic status. The
ENDES survey has not incorporated men in its HIV survey module. However, Silva-Santisteban
et al. (2013) performed a study in four cities in Peru. They report that most PLWA (96 percent)
access some kind of HIV-related health services regardless of their socioeconomic status, and 84
percent were receiving those services at a public facility. Approximately 85 percent who reported
access to care was receiving ARV and 17 percent of those patients not in treatment they
indicated they were going to start treatment. However, transgendered people and those younger
than 35 years old were associated with lower access to health care. To increase access, the ten
round of the Global Fund has made supporting the transsexual population a priority (Annex A).

        The public delivery sector has around 100 public HIV/AIDS health centers (CERITSS
and UAMPS) across the country specialized in providing services to MSM and sexual workers
(MINSA 2011). These centers focus on preventive interventions such as condom distribution,
testing and IEC. However these services are not directed to middle class MSM (Cáceres 2013,
personal interview) who receive services from NGOs, which is a more diverse MSM population.
NGOs receive free ART and laboratory services from the MOH to serve their beneficiaries.

 Box 2. Peru Treatment Cascade from HIV Positive to Antiretroviral Treatment

 Individuals living with HIV need to be diagnosed as early as possible. Based on UNAIDS and
 MOH data, an estimated 27 to 36 percent of positive individuals have not been diagnosed (See
 Figure B.2).
 For many people, accessing ART depends on immunological status. The WHO’s new 2013
 guidelines recommend a CD4 threshold of 500 for initiation of HIV treatment, in contrast to
 the previous 350. Along similar lines, UNAIDS (2013) reports sharp gains against HIV —
 reduced incidence by 50 to 70 percent—in countries in which HIV treatment has reached over
 60 percent coverage. In Peru, ART coverage is estimated at 43 to 48 percent of all ART
 eligible individuals under WHO 2013 guidelines, and at 66 percent of all diagnosed and
 eligible PLWA. Closing the coverage gap will require increasing the number of individuals on
 ART in about 10,000 more beneficiaries.

 Closing the coverage gap means active testing, promotion of condom use and proactive ART
 with the support of CHWs. Then, people can continue to access care following their diagnosis
 and are not “lost to follow up”.


COST-EFFICIENCY OF ART EXPENDITURES

      The Ministry of Health allocated around 23.5 percent of program resources to ART
(Annex D and H). The government has established special agreement with the PAHO Strategic
Drug Fund to procure low-priced ARV (PAHO 2014).

      Another indicator is the unit cost of ARV medications distributed to the regions for the
PLWA in treatment. This indicator offers a measure of cost efficiency and indicates the extent to
which ARVs are being distributed at minimum price and are being deployed in the correct

                                                         44
quantities. The budget expenditure on ART by the Directorate for Medications, Supplies, and
Drugs was matched with the number of patients reported by the program in each region. This
information was used to estimate expenditure on ARV per patient by region.

        The 25 regions were grouped according to the two variables: number of patients and
region. The estimated expenditure by patient was then compared to an estimated annual cost for
ART treatment (Annex H). The weighted average for ART therapy per adult patient per year is
assumed to be US$409-555 (See indicator 1).

   Table 6 presents the results grouped into three categories of ARV expenditure per patient:

      Lima and Callao, which represent 76 percent of the reported HIV/AIDS cases in the
       country, are the historical bases of the program. More than 90 percent of the budget
       executions indicated a good understanding of the accounting and RBB functioning rules
       on the part of the management team in these areas. In Callao, the expenditure per case is
       US$437. In Lima, the expenditure per case is US$564, which is closer to the estimated
       cost per case of US$409 to US$555. These results suggest an appropriate distribution of
       financial resources in both regions.
      The US$820 cost per patient in Loreto falls within the first range and indicates an
       acceptable cost per ART per patient. Budget execution inefficiency in Loreto, Ica, and
       Ucayali can be explained by financial mismanagement with in the regional government.
      A third group of mostly coastal regions demonstrated higher per patient spending than the
       estimated average. This might indicate that the program reached fewer patients than were
       reported, or patients did not adhere to treatment and did not come back for medications.
       The result could also indicate diseconomies of scale. Cost per delivering ART increases
       with a decreasing scale of activities and number of cases, as fixed costs are spread across
       fewer units of output.
      Finally, a group of ten regions, most of which are in the mountains, have a low number of
       reported cases and a high average cost per ART per patient. In this case, the scale of

                                               45
       operations may affect cost-efficiency. The cost per unit of delivering services generally
       increases with a decreasing scale of activities.

    These results suggest the presence of economies and diseconomies of scales, where urban
areas with better infrastructure and human resources, such as Lima and Callao, show lower unit
costs than more scarcely populated areas and those with fewer infrastructures, such as the
mountain regions. At the same time, these results are consistent and correlate with trends in
premature deaths by region, as reported by Alarcon et al. (2012) and as shown in Figure 9.
During the period 2000-2011, there was a decrease in the number of AIDS deaths in Lima and
Callao, especially after the introduction of the ART program in early 2000. This is consistent
with the above analysis, a thorough budget execution, and appropriate per-patient expenditure.
The same holds true for the coastal regions, which already had adequate budget execution.

    From this analysis, we cannot draw clear conclusions on the quality of resource allocation in
regions with high unit costs. Therefore, we recommend a detailed study of one region that
experienced an increase in deaths attributable to AIDS that might be related to insufficient
delivery of ARV medications (See next section Loreto case study).

EFFICIENCY ON BUDGET MANAGEMENT

       The last indicator focuses on the efficiency of spending allocated to the HIV/AIDS
program. The regional government of Loreto was selected for this case study. Loreto reports the
highest number of premature deaths, after Lima and Callao. The number of premature deaths
associated with AIDS has increased. In 2005, 102 premature deaths were recorded, and in 2011,
that number rose to 175, which is an increase of 71 percent (Alarcón et al. 2012).

       The case study analyzes the utilization of the wage bill managed by the DIRESA. As
presented in Figure 4, the wage bill is allocated to the regional government and managed by the
Human Resources Office at each decentralized institution. The region started to receive
additional funding in 2011. The total 2012 budget was US$4.3 million, and the total 2013 budget
(from January to October) was US$3.2 million. This budget included funding for the Regional
Health Bureau of Loreto and Alto Amazonas, the Health Network of Marañón, and the Hospitals
of Loreto, Iquitos and Santa Gema de Yurimaguas.

        The total budget spent during the period 2012-2013 is fairly stable at around US$1 per-
capita, although it displays a spike around the end of the fiscal year in December 2012 (Figure
11). In parallel, the ART services for PLWA started to rise, which should help to reduce
premature mortality within the next few years. In spite of this positive trend, there are areas
where services are lagging. For example, HIV testing during pregnancy reached 84 percent in
Maynas. But in the province of Requena, where the case number is significant (accumulated
cases is 104 per 100,000), testing during pregnancy falls to 65 percent. Additionally, health
services have not reached native communities of the Amazon that have high numbers of HIV
infections. Culturally competent interventions, including consultation with indigenous leaders on
the implementation of the HIV/AIDS program are needed (Box 1).

        Employees with limited contracts are the largest budget line in the regional government
budget, reaching 23 percent of the total. The Regional Health Bureau of Loreto manages the
wage bill of employees and CHW of the program. The list of employees, their respective
salaries, and the time they allocate to the program were analyzed in conjunction with the
manager of the program. Regarding CHW, there are two main types: the voluntary and the
remunerated CHW. The remunerated includes the peer CHW. The existing remunerated program
provides education through peer CHW, who work with established networks of sex workers.10

        Figure 12 shows the time allocated to the program by the 29 contracted employees and
for the 14-16 CHW in 2012 and2013 (Annex I). The results showed that only four employees
were working full time for the program. Others spent half of their time on the program, and the
rest were deployed to other programs, often related to reproductive health. Thus, 54 percent of
this wage bill was effectively allocated to the HIV/AIDS program.

       Peer CHW are a well-recognized and effective intervention in populations at high risk of
contracting HIV. Previous research has demonstrated that among those who start ART through
CHW in Peru, treatment coverage increases and mortality decreases (Muñoz et al. 2009,
Sebastian et al. 2006, and Cerda et al. 2011). Peer CHW has budget support, but only a small
percentage is used. There are around 14-16CHW active peers in the entire region of Loreto.
Currently, the Regional Health Bureau of Loreto pays them a monthly salary of about US$150
and provides them a kit with information, communication and education (IEC) material (Herrera
2013, personal interview) (Figure 12).

       In summary, budget management had a number of flaws. The peak resource expenditure
occurred around the last month of the fiscal year, which is indicative of insufficient planning and
improvised management. Additionally, only 54 percent of the working time of contracted
employees is accountable to the program and there is a limited number of peer CHW available to

                                                                                                                                       48
work for the program. The MEF has supported improvements in budget formulation, but this
finding suggests that the program could be significantly improved with monitoring of program
implementation at the regional level and support for a strategic human resources plan.

Proposed Solution: Rationalization of Human Resources with a Focus on CHW

       Each of the HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and TB health programs has a CWH cadre with its own
contracts and arrangements. The CHW program is fraught with challenges, such as poor
planning, multiple competing programs with little coordination, poor supervision and support,
and under-recognition of the CHW contribution (Tulenko et al. 2013).

        A number of CHW-related issues need to be addressed, including the incorporation of
CHWs into the formal health system. For example, most CHWs have low levels of formal
education, which presents a problem—according to the human resource officer of DIRESA in
Loreto—when it comes to fulfilling contract requirements. CHW compensation—whether cash,
voucher or goods—is another unresolved problem. Some NGOs, like Partners in Health,
compensate CHWs with a monthly food basket (Dr. Lecca 2003, personal interview). Other
international programs offer successful examples, such as Brazil’s community health agents
program. All CHW receive a salary, and training requirements and the scope of practice are
defined under federal law (Schneider et al. 2008).

  PART VII – PROJECTING INCREMENTAL COSTS OF THE HIV/AIDS
                          PROGRAM
       We now know that rapid response is an important part of successful HIV/AIDS treatment
(UNAIDS 2013b). A recent assessment of UNAIDS data shows that faster decreases in the
incidence of HIV took place in countries that rapidly increased coverage of HIV treatment.
Countries that sharply scale up the program and where ART coverage reaches more than 60
percent of the infected population can expect to decrease incidence by 50 to 70 percent. In
contrast, countries like Peru, with ART coverage of around 43 to 49 percent, might be able to
reduce incidence by 20 to 40 percent (UNAIDS 2013b).

       The WHO’s new 2013 guidelines on The Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and
Preventing HIV Infection were used to estimate current coverage. The guidelines recommend a
CD4 threshold of 500 for initiation of HIV treatment. This threshold made about 85 percent of
HIV positive individuals eligible for ARV treatment, as well as provided lifelong treatment for
pregnant women living with HIV and infected children irrespective of CD4 cell count (WHO
2013).

       Financial resources necessary to scale up the delivery of the key cost-effective HIV/AIDS
interventions for the period 2014-2016 are presented. Two scenarios are considered: a
counterfactual scenario whereby the program maintains the current coverage for ART and
preventive activities, and a second scenario whereby the coverage of ART reaches on average 60
percent of the infected eligible population, screening services over 75 percent of the high-risk
groups and condom and personal sex education reach 75 percent of FSW, 20 percent of the
MSM and 10 percent of adolescents.

        This section is based on the unit costs and baseline estimates presented earlier in Table 5
and described in Section VI. To calculate counterfactual or current total costs, the first step was
to estimate numbers in the target population currently treated or served. Target populations are
defined in the second column of Table 7. Program costs include only direct delivery costs of the
interventions directed to the targeted population, salaries and medications. Overhead and
infrastructure investments are excluded.

    The total cost of scaling up the program and increasing coverage of key populations reaches
US$32 million in the three years 2014-2016. The proposed scaled-up program consists of the
following three interventions:

      About 55 percent of the total incremental budget will be directed to HIV testing; 90
       percent of pregnant women and 20 percent of MSM will be tested by 2016.
      About 20 percent of the incremental resources will be used to increase the coverage of
       ARV therapy to 60 percent of the ARV-eligible people; (i) to infected mothers and their
       children from 59 percent and 18 percent to 70 percent and 50 percent respectively, and
       (ii) PLWA coverage of ARV therapy will be increased from 49 percent to 52 percent
      Finally, 26 percent of incremental resources may be directed to empowering adolescents,
       and specifically to increasing their access to sexual education and condoms, and to
       expanding behavioral interventions for high prevalence populations such as MSM and
       male sex workers and their clients. Peer CHW can deliver the majority of these services
       on an individual basis.
    In summary, reaching 60 percent coverage using the new WHO 2013 treatment guidelines
criteria would require an additional US$32 million during the period 2004-2006.

          PART VIII – CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
        Public financing resources are available for the HIV/AIDS program, as the program is
among the few prioritized interventions in Peru. Since 2011, the program has received an
increasing share of public funding, from US$17.7 million spent annually during the period 2005-
2010, to US$57.8 million spent annually in recent years. This budget increase is accompanied by
financial decentralization, meaning that the MEF allocates the budget for the HIV/AIDS program
directly to the MOH, the 25 regional governments, the DIRESAs, and the hospitals. The new
method for the allocation of financial resources uses budgeting-for-results (BFR), thus linking
the public budget with the delivery of services to different risk groups.

        According to the analysis of the allocation of resources by risk group, just 44 percent of
total program expenditures were allocated to high risk groups in 2011-2013: pregnant women
and children, MSM, adolescents and PLWA. Furthermore, our model results estimate around 43
to 48 percent of the proportion of eligible infected people —under the WHO 2013 guidelines—
are being treated with ART by the public system, including social security. Although, the
coverage rises to 66 percent if only diagnosed and eligible PLWA is used as the reference group.
On the other side, the percentage of ART coverage for infected pregnant women has risen to 59
percent in 2012, while the percentage of tested pregnant women attending antenatal care to 75
percent.

       Equity has improved among women of childbearing age in quintiles 1-2, which includes
40 percent of the poorest. The ENDES 2004-2012 shows an increase in women who are
knowledgeable about the transmission of HIV infection from mother to fetus, from 30 percent of
women accurately informed in 2004 to 46 percent in 2012. However, it is estimated that only 18
percent of the infected children are being treated. The situation becomes even more critical in
native Amazon communities, which constitutes a new emerging at-risk group currently missing
from the program discussion.

        As discussed, ART treatment services coverage is on the medium side. We now know
that rapid response is an important element for success in combating HIV/AIDS. Recent
assessment of UNAIDS data shows that faster decreases in the incidence of HIV took place in
countries that rapidly increased coverage of HIV treatment (UNAIDS 2013b). UNAIDS
recommends a faster scale-up of adult ART coverage. If at least 60 percent of the adult infected
eligible population were covered, HIV/AIDS incidence would likely decrease by 50 percent-70
percent. The total cost of scaling up the program and closing the coverage gap among high-risk
groups is estimated at around US$32 million over the three years 2014-2016. The high-risk
groups include infected pregnant women and their children, MSM, sex workers and native
populations from the Amazon. The native populations need culturally appropriate interventions
and comprehensive messages in local languages.

        Closing the coverage gap means active HIV testing, promotion of condom use and full
access to ART with the support of CHWs. Increased laboratory capacity and expanded rapid
diagnostic testing would have the greatest impact on program coverage and can dramatically
decrease the epidemic, as the treatment of more infected people in ART could reduce the
infection rate. The MOH has secured access to price-reduced ARV, through an agreement with

                                               52
PAHO’s Strategic Drug Fund. However, the public laboratory network faces gaps in the
technical capacity needed to support increased diagnostic services, which has the very real risk
of undercutting the potential for accelerated progress in HIV/AIDS treatment. Furthermore, the
Loreto case study detected important management issues. The program did not have the capacity
to claim and retain the human resources funded with its own budget, and about half of the
working time of employees with limited contracts was unaccountable to the HIV/AIDS program
manager.

       The limited number of CHWs could also potentially undermine accelerated progress in
HIV/AIDS. Additional questions related to CHWs include whether they should become part of
the formal health system and how best to compensate them: cash, voucher or goods.
Programmatic expansion of CHW models that have proven cost-effective for vulnerable
populations in Peru, such as Partners in Health and their work with CHW in the TB control
program, and international examples, such as Brazil’s community health workers program,
should be considered. Resolving issues surrounding the CHWs would be an appropriate first step
in developing a strategic human resources plan.

         In conclusion, some of the incremental resources needed for extending coverage to key
populations may well be funded with a re-appropriation of existing financial resources. This
initiative could accompany a discussion on human resources in which there is ample room for a
more cost-effective allocation of resources.

                                            NOTES
1
 In order to increase transparency and improve public resource management along with the
support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the Ministry of Finance
implemented an information system consisting of two main programs: (i) the Integrated
Financial Management System (IFMS), and (ii) the Integrated Administrative Management
System (SIGA). This information system monitors revenues and expenditures at the national,
provincial, and municipal levels. It should be noted that this system provides reliable information
on a periodic basis. Citizens can also access this information system through a website called
“Consulta Amigable.”
2
 The information contains the Institutional Budget Opening (PIA), the Institutional Budget
Modified (PIM), and the executed budget during different phases. The information is broken
down by the Implementing Units (UEs) of the national government, regional governments, and
local governments.
3
 As Caceres (2013) and Medici (2013) point out, an alternative assumption is that the AIDS
epidemic remains constant, in which a decline in the number of new infections in the adult
population still needs to be demonstrated.
4
 With regard to screening for HIV in pregnant women, if the HIV result is reactive, another
blood sample must be drawn for a confirmatory test, specifically, the CD4 count and the viral
load (VL) test. If a rapid test had been used and the result is reactive, then an ELISA test or
another rapid test must be performed before the confirmatory test. The confirmatory tests used
for HIV are Western Blot (WB), Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA), and Recombinant
Immunoblotting Assay (RIBA) (Dr. Cabezas, Personal interview, 2013).
5
 Although the 2008 norm stipulates that the confirmatory test is the responsibility of a high level
facility, at the moment only the INS has a laboratory capable of performing CD4 counts, VL
tests, and RIBA confirmatory tests. According to the 2008 norm, confirmatory samples must be
sent within 48 hours of being obtained, and the results should be available in the electronic
medical record system NETLAB after 10 working days (Dr. Cabezas, Personal interview, 2013).
6
 SIAF and SIGA are complementary software used to organize the administrative management
of the programs at the central, regional and local governments. It simplifies their tasks and
reduces reporting. At the same time, it makes budgetary management more transparent through
the publication of information on the web.
7
  Program managers deliver information, including activities carried out. Adjustment and
revisions are incorporated into the designs of the budget. The MEF is in charge of the follow-up
through the administrative databases SIAF and SIGA.
8
 The MEF has been working on other baseline indicators: nutrition, maternal and neonatal
health, population access to ID, and the conditional cash transfer program JUNTOS.
9
 According to UNGASS (2012) based on WHO guidelines of 2010 (CD4 < 200) about 93
percent of people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were receiving ARV treatment in 2011.




                                                54
10
 When the HIV/AIDS epidemic set in, PLWA had no choice but to help one another. The peer
health worker structure evolved: Female sex workers helped and educated other sex workers, and
gay men educated and supported gay men.

This study aims to evaluate and develop recommendations on how the HIV/AIDS program in Peru can
achieve better Value for Money. In Peru, the HIV epidemic concentrates mostly among men who have
sex with men, with AIDS being the first cause of death for men ages 30-49 in 2010 and the second cause
of death for women aged 25-34 (BOD, 2013). UNAIDS (2013) estimates there were 76,000 people living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in 2012, and this study estimates 67,000 PLWA in 2013. The Ministry of Health
reports that 27,502 PLWA currently receive ART, a 43-48 percent coverage of eligible people, and 66
percent coverage of all diagnosed eligible individuals (WHO, 2013 guidelines). In 2011, there was a
transition from international to domestic public funding, which increased from US$17.7 million in 2005-10
to US$57.8 million in 2011-13. This study recommends targeting high-risk groups with proactive testing,
promotion of condom use, and supervised ART administration by community health workers to close the
coverage gap. In addition, there is a need to expand coverage of rapid testing points through greater
diversity of contractual arrangements with NGOs and the private sector, which can only be achieved with
the support of a human resources plan that centrally positions community health workers in HIV
prevention and ARV treatment.
