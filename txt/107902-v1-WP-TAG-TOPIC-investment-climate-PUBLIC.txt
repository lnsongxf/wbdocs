    Foreword



          Demand for food safety regulatory reform can come from many quarters: domestic businesses,
          exporters, traders, retailers, foreign investors, and most importantly, consumers. Well-crafted
          regulations can guide and assist domestic farmers and firms to effectively compete with imports
          or allow them to access new export markets. As the agricultural sector in a developing country
          evolves and the quality and breadth of food processing increases, establishing a viable food
          safety system is a key element of success.

          This Toolkit aims to empower reformers with a suite of tools to assess market potential, build
          capacity, and assist in mitigating barriers to development in the area of food safety. The Toolkit
          tackles each step in the reform process. It examines the related system development in a strate-
          gic way supported by best practice examples and sound principles of institutional structure and
          legislative reform. Risk-based approaches to regulation and regulatory delivery are considered
          alongside the need for flexible and proportionate responses to both.

    Foreword

          Design of the Investment Climate Food Safety Toolkit builds on the IFC’s Sustainable Business
          Advisory Food Safety Toolkit which sets out practical tools and techniques for verification of
          effective food safety systems at the firm level. These two complementary tools, addressing
          both public and private sector dimensions to the development and implementation of effective
          food safety systems, can form the basis of a public private partnership that fosters reform and
          growth. Products, sectors and entry points may vary but the need for confidence in the safety
          and quality of the products produced for the benefit of both markets and citizens remains
          constant.

    Module 2   Guiding principles of food safety reform

               For all projects related to food safety reform, the following guiding principles should be kept
               in mind:

                •	 Regulation and official controls by themselves cannot ensure food safety.
                •	 Primary responsibility (and liability) for the safety of food rests on food business operators.
                •	 Food safety should be secured across the entire food chain.
                •	 A preventative and risk-based approach should be the basis for regulatory reform, decision
                   making, and control and self-control of food safety.
                •	 International standards and scientific justification should form the basis of all regulatory
                   measures.
                •	 The impact of food safety reform on trade, consumer prices, economic output, and jobs
                   should be carefully considered – costs and negative impacts can be significant from an
                   economic perspective.
                •	 The food safety system will always involve multiple players; coordination and collaboration
                   are vital.
               Note: Not all projects will go through all the following steps – selecting what will be covered will
               be based on the project scope and design as defined above, depending on country needs, capacity,
               resources, and the specific role of the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group.



    Module 3   Legislative reform

               For a food safety reform project to be successful, it is not enough to alter only texts in legisla-
               tion, or structures in the government or processes in inspectorates. It involves a different way of
               thinking by many people and a change in attitudes and behaviors. This can be the most difficult
               part of the project and easily underestimated or even overlooked. Applying food safety reform
               can in many countries be an extremely radical change in fundamental assumptions about
               safety and about the role of the state.

               It is important to be clear about the starting point and destination. For countries that are
               realistic candidates for European Union accession, the destination is a pre-existing package
               of legislation within the EU system and this path has been followed by a number of other ac-
               cession countries previously. For countries not in line for EU accession the destination may be
               joining other trade agreements and there may be in some cases similarly clear packages of food
               safety regulations to adopt. For other countries, getting a clear vision of the destination can be
               difficult and the timescale for that journey can be challenging and often insufficiently thought
               through. The World Trade Organization Sanitary and Phytosanitary (WTO SPS) agreement pro-
               vides a general framework, but many details have to be fleshed out in each specific case.

                       To assess the starting point for any legislative reforms, you have to have a good grasp of how            Module 4   Institutional structure
                       the current system operates and how embedded it is in institutions, practices, and the culture
                       of practitioners as well as of businesses and consumers. It is also essential to think about capac-                  Start from a map of the current distribution of responsibilities and roles, which are likely to be
                       ity of economic operators and regulators and about consumer incomes and education. It is not                         spread across a range of ministries, agencies, and inspectorates. The field of food safety im-
                       simply a matter of aligning legislative texts or of aligning systems and thinking. Depending on                      pinges on many other policy areas, and the particular distribution of roles in a country is likely

                                                                                                                                            inspections, supervision, testing, enforcement) than the policy inputs (that is, setting rules
                        These are some key questions to ask:                                                                                and requirements on all aspects (production, animal health, chemicals, water, residue levels in
                                                                                                                                            food). Therefore, much can be done with a single inspectorate, even if regulations are issued

                           to inspect each and every business, process and product)?
                        •	 Have any of the norms and standards been aligned with international standards?                                   There may be a strong desire to try and set up a single food safety agency that covers policy
                        •	 Can the legislation be identified clearly as being about food safety or is it mixed with issues                  and implementation, but such institutions are quite rare. It may not be appropriate or feasible

                        •	 What is the implementation capacity, existing problems in enforcing applicable legislation,
                           and what challenges are to be expected in bringing reformed legislation to life?                                 Although there is probably a preference internationally for a single agency, at least in terms of
                                                                                                                                            inspections, it does not have the status of international best practice, precisely because of the

    Purpose of the Toolkit

          The purpose of this Investment Climate Food Safety Toolkit is to provide reformers, project
          teams supporting reforms, and policymakers with an overview of the principles of food safety
          reform, the primary objectives, key instruments and critical success factors, as well as provide a
          number of specific examples and case studies. The Toolkit is aimed at supporting work on food
          safety and inspections reform to support development of the agribusiness sector.

          This toolkit may also be used as a guidance document for external audiences, such as partners
          and stakeholders in reform programs, so that they can understand the scope of food safety
          reform, the importance of collaboration of public and private sectors, the value of education
          of all involved parties, the importance of transparency, and the strength of the market-driven
          approach.

          This toolkit focuses on the overall architecture of food safety regulation and answers the fol-
          lowing questions:

           •	 What does it entail?
           •	 What other components form the “food safety system” and are essential for it to work ef-
              fectively?
           •	 What are the key elements of best practice (and what elements are disputed)?
           •	 What can interventions by the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group
              focus on (and achieve)?

          This toolkit emphasizes the roles of all players in the food chain, including food business opera-
          tors and states providing the regulatory and control environment.

          The Toolkit emphasizes solutions and approaches that are realistic, and conducive to private
          sector development and broad-based, inclusive growth. At the same time it warns against
          potential pitfalls, including the danger of “gold plating” and the introduction of regulatory
          requirements that are not commensurate to the level of development of the country or of its
          businesses.

          Finally, it should be noted that the Toolkit does not attempt to provide full, in-depth prescrip-
          tions on all aspects of food safety regulations, as this would both make the Toolkit unwieldy
          and duplicate information readily available in public documents.
