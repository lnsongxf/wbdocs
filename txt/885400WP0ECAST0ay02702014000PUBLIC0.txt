Objectives and background

The overall objectives of the ECASTAT trust fund are to address the capacity and financial
constraints of the statistical systems of countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) region, and, thereby support their development outcomes by
strengthening the production of reliable and relevant data on a timely basis for evidence-based
decision making at all levels of their governments.
To achieve its objectives, the ECASTAT trust fund supports both regional and country specific
projects and is organized as a two-window programmatic trust fund. Window 1 comprises
regional projects and focuses on the development of materials in the Russian language on
methodologies, and technical assistance and training in specific thematic areas. Window 2
comprises country specific projects aiming at implementing National Strategies for the
Development of Statistics (NSDSs). Activities taking place under the two windows aim to be
complimentary, while care is taken to harmonize support with other donors and organizations.
Although ECASTAT is established as a multi-donor trust fund, to date only the Russian
Federation has pledged funding in an amount of USD 15 million. Total contributions as of May
2014 amount to USD 10.5 million, with another USD 2.5 million expected by the end June 2014.
In 2013, the Steering Committee approved window 1, regional specific grants of up to USD 2.4
million and window 2, country specific grants in the amount of USD 5 million. In addition, funds
have been allotted for ECASTAT administration, project preparation and supervision, leaving
ECASTAT with just under USD 4.9 million for allocation during the current work plan period,
2014.


Financial status as of May 2014

Contributions received by end calendar year 2013 (CY13) were USD 10.5 million while
allocations and commitments made in CY13 total USD 8.2 million. A balance of approximately
USD 2.4 million was carried forward to CY14. Available resources for the 2014 work plan period
totals just under USD 4.9 million when combining the donor contribution due on June 30, 2014
(USD 2.5 million) and the current fund balance (USD 2.4 million). ECASTAT’s financials for the
CY14 work plan is somewhat lower than last year’s allocation, which included funds for project
preparation and supervision, and amounted to USD 7.7 million. More details on the ECASTAT’s
current financial situation can be found in table 1.

Suggested work program activities

The work program has been developed with the aim of utilizing funds as they are made
available/transferred to the World Bank. With just under USD 4.9 million available, the Project
Team will invite proposals for both regional and country specific activities. The proposed
allocations are listed below.


Window 1, Regional specific activities

It is proposed that approximately USD 1 million be allocated for regional activities. The stream
of work suggested under this window is linked to economic statistics with a focus on national
accounts and prices. The UNECE has expressed interest in executing this work.


Window 2, Country specific activities

The Project Team proposes allocating the balance (USD 3.9 million) for window 2 activities
supporting implementing elements of country NSDSs. A call for proposals will be issued in early
summer 2014. The available resources should be sufficient to grant funding for two country
specific projects.
Countries’ needs are likely to exceed available resources. However, taking into account that
ECASTAT grants may have a catalytic effect, working with other development partners, and
because country specific projects will benefit from activities taking place under window 1, the


                                                                                              3
total effect of receiving an ECASTAT grant is expected to be substantial and exceed the
development objectives of each country specific project.
Suggested budget allocations
The suggested work program allocates up to USD 1.0 million towards regional activities and
USD 3.9 million for country specific projects, including costs related to project preparation and
supervision (Bank staff time and travel). A small amount has also been allocated to ECASTAT
management. A more detailed budget breakdown is presented in table 2.

             -   Project preparation and supervision grant(s)                           100,000
         Window 2, Country-specific activities                                         3,860,000
             -   Project grants                                                       3,500,000

Country specific activities/NSDS implementation (window 2 activities) require on average six to
twelve months for project preparation and four years for implementation. December 31, 2018
is the closing date of the ECASTAT, thus it follows that implementation of such projects should
be completed by then. Bearing this in mind, the possibility of advancing the last donor
contribution (currently set for June 30, 2015) is worth considering. Advancing the last
contribution would allow for granting higher amounts (average grant size up from USD 1.75 to
USD 2.75) or extending a grant to one additional country.
