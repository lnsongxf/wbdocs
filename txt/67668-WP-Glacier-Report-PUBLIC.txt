  Accessibility determines the effort needed to reach a particular study or monitoring site, maintain a presence there, and undertake meaningful research. This is a problem
in studying the region’s glaciers, which are commonly located in roadless areas at altitudes of 3,000–7,000 meters above sea level. Scale determines the appropriateness
of data density, and of both data collection procedures and analyses.

The more obvious features are the cornices and
wind slab areas. Also important is snow that drops
out of the wind field on lee slopes and into gullies
and couloirs where avalanches begin. The indirect
evidence of the role of wind is not supported by any
quantitative information, because so much occurs
in the steepest parts of the basins and along narrow
interfluves.

Considerable variability is seen from year to year
in winter and summer contributions, according
to air mass source, and at different elevations
and sites. The snow pits at Biafo also confirmed
field experience of the overwhelming role of a
few large snowstorms, evident in the incidence
of thick, uniform bands of snow, as illustrated in
Figure 3.6. Heavy snowfalls were recorded high up
in summer when little or none appeared in base
camp records at 4,080 m or at valley weather
stations. Before considering the mass balance
implications, ablation conditions in the HKH must
be appreciated.

3.6.4 Ablation in the HKH

In most mountain glaciers, ablation losses are
dominated by surface melting below a certain
elevation and are controlled by energy exchanges
with the atmosphere. The HKH is not unusual in
this regard, but important departures from the                 Photo: Hewitt, 1985.

of Pakistan, to emerge into the Arabian Sea near
the port city of Karachi in Sindh. Tributaries to this
reach of the river from the western Himalaya are
the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej Rivers, from
the Indian states of Jammu Kashmir and Himachal
Pradesh, and the Kabul, Swat, and Chitral Rivers
from the Hindu Kush Mountains. The total length of
the river is about 3,180 km, and its total drainage
area exceeds 1,165,000 km2. The river’s estimated
annual flow at the mouth is 207 cubic kilometers
(km3), making it the 21st largest river in the world in
terms of annual flow.

6.4 Glacier Monitoring Using Satellite
Imagery and DEMs

Although today semiautomated glacier mapping
from optical satellite imagery is a standard tool
in glacier monitoring, problems still exist in the
methodology that cause different results in different
glacier mapping studies. For example, Kamp,
Krumwiede et al. (2013) compared studies of
glaciers in the Mongolian Altai Mountains and found
that the reported glacier number and glacial extent
varied widely: while one study put the number of
“glaciers” in the Mongolian Altai at 120, another
one identified around 731 “glaciers and glacierized
areas;” as a result, the exact number and spatial
coverage of Mongolia’s glaciers are still unknown.
Kamp, Krumwiede et al. (2013) identified two main
reasons for the varying results: the definition of a           Source: PASCO and JAXA.
