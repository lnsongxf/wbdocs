  BOX 1.1: Poverty measures
  In Ethiopia, absolute poverty is measured by comparing a household’s consumption per adult equivalent to the national poverty line
  defined as 3781 Birr in 2011. The poverty line indicates the minimum money required to afford the food covering the minimum
  required caloric intake and additional non-food items. The following three poverty measures are commonly used to assess poverty:
      Incidence of poverty (headcount index): The headcount index for the incidence of poverty is the proportion of individuals in
  the population living below the poverty line.
      Depth of poverty (poverty gap): The depth of poverty indicates how far, on average, poor households are from the poverty line.
  It captures the mean consumption shortfall relative to the poverty line across the whole population. It is obtained by adding up
  all the shortfalls of the poor (considering the non-poor are having a shortfall of zero) and dividing the total by the population.
  Thus, the depth of poverty shows the total resources needed per capita to eliminate poverty assuming that all poor individuals
  would obtain exactly the shortfall between their consumption and the poverty line.
      Poverty severity (squared poverty gap): The poverty severity takes into account the distance separating the poor from the
  poverty line (the poverty gap) as well as the inequality among the poor. Conceptually, poverty severity puts a higher weight on
  households/individuals, who are further below the poverty line.

       BOX 1.2: Inequality measures
       While poverty measures absolute deprivation with respect to a given threshold, inequality is a relative measure of poverty indicating
       how little some parts of a population have relative the whole population.
          In the context of monetary poverty, equality can be defined as an equal distribution of consumption / income across the
       population. This means that each share of the population owns the same share of consumption / income. The Lorenz Curve
       compares graphically the cumulative share of the population with their cumulative share of consumption / income. A perfectly
       equal consumption / income distribution is indicated by a diagonal. The other extreme is complete inequality where one individual
       owns all the consumption / income. These two (theoretical) extremes define the boundaries for observed inequality.
          The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure for inequality. A Gini coefficient of 0 indicates perfect equality while
       1 signifies complete inequality. In relation to the Lorenz Curve, the Gini coefficient measures the area between the Lorenz Curve
       and the diagonal.
          The Theil Index measures inequality based on an entropy measure. A parameter α controls emphasis to measure inequality
       for higher incomes (larger α) or lower incomes (smaller α). The Theil index with parameter α=1 is usually called Theil T while
       using α=0 is called Theil L or log deviation measure.
          Relative and absolute income differences can be used to compare inequality dynamics over time. Usually, percentiles are used
       to compare incomes of different groups. For example, p90/p10 is the ratio (for relative incomes) or difference (for absolute
       incomes) of the average income in the 90th and 10th percentile.

  BOX 1.3: Poverty, growth, and inequality
  Poverty, growth, and inequality are closely linked with each other, while at the same time the exact causal relationships are not
  yet well understood. Three stylized facts, though, help to summarize the current evidence. First, economic growth and changes
  in inequality are uncorrelated. Second, poverty generally declines as the economy grows. Third, the larger the initial inequality
  in a given country, the higher the growth rate needed to achieve the same amount of poverty reduction.*
     Poverty reduction can be formally decomposed into a growth component and a redistribution component. The partial effect of
  positive growth on poverty reduction is always positive. Thus, growth reduces poverty. However, the redistribution component can
  increase or decrease poverty reduction. Therefore, poverty can also decrease in a country with positive growth if the redistribution
  component is disfavoring poverty reduction.

       BOX 2.1: The WIDE-3 qualitative research program
       The Wellbeing and Ill-being Dynamics in Ethiopia (WIDE) research program covers 20 communities in Ethiopia selected as exemplars
       of different types of rural livelihood systems. WIDE is a qualitative research program that began in 1994 when qualitative village
       studies were undertaken in rural communities selected to be part of the long-run quantitative panel (the Ethiopian Rural Household
       Survey) undertaken by Addis Ababa University and the University of Oxford. The communities were chosen as exemplars of the
       main rural agricultural livelihood systems found in the four main regions of Ethiopia at the time. These 15 communities were
       visited for a second time in 2003 and five new sites were also visited: three new agricultural sites, which had been added to the
       ERHS panel in 1999 as exemplars of new agricultural livelihood systems, and two pastoralist sites.
          From 2010 to 2013 the twenty communities have been visited again as part of WIDE-3. These visits were conducted in phases:
       from 2009–2010 six communities about which the team had most information (three drought-prone and food-insecure and
       three self-sufficient); from 2011–2012 eight drought-prone and food insecure sites were researched; and from 2012–2013 the
       remaining six rain-secure higher potential sites were visited. Findings from WIDE 3 are reported in this chapter and in other
       chapters of the Poverty Assessment.
          The research focuses on communities and takes a long-term perspective on development, which allows longer-run and inter-
       dependent changes in the community to be identified. The research looks in particular at how community processes have been
       affected by government activities and broader modernization processes and changes in the communities’ environments. The case
       studies documented by the research in the twenty communities, provide additional insights and triangulation of the quantitative
       findings of nationally representative surveys documented throughout this report.

Note: The columns Urban and Rural specify which indicators are used in the overlap analysis for urban areas and rural areas. Access to a health
facility and access to safe water are present for nearly all urban households, so they are not considered in the overlap analysis. Institutional birth is
not considered in overlap analysis for rural households because almost all children in rural areas aged 0–4 years were not born in a health facility.

  BOX 2.2: Aspirations and educational investments in rural Ethiopia
  Aspirations express goals or desired future states. They have been shown to have an important influence on behavior and economic
  choices such as choice of occupation and educational investments. Aspirations evolve over time in response to life experience
  and circumstances and are largely formed by observing the outcomes of individuals whose behaviors they can observe and with
  whom they can identify.
     Researchers from the International Food Policy Research Institute and the University of Oxford measured aspirations in Doba
  woreda in 2010–11 (Bernard et al. 2014). Doba is historically a food-insecure woreda and the majority of residents are subsistence
  farmers growing sorghum and maize. Aspirations were measured in four dimensions: income, wealth, social status and children’s
  educational attainment. For each of these dimensions, respondents were asked what level on this dimension they would like to
  achieve. Initial levels of aspirations of income and wealth were found to be quite high, 20 times current levels of income and
  wealth. Most parents aspired to provide 13 years of education for their children. Similarly high aspirations for education attainment
  have been found in other sites in Ethiopia.
     The site selected was very remote—only 13% of surveyed individuals left the woreda more than once a month—and as a
  result exposure to experience of people outside of the local area was limited. To ascertain whether increasing information would
  impact aspirations and the sense of control people have about their lives, selected individuals were randomly invited to watch
  documentaries about people from similar communities who had succeeded in agriculture or small business, without help from
  government or NGOs. Immediately after the screening of the documentaries, aspirations had increased among those who
  watched the documentary. Aspirations on the educational attainment of children had increased and six months later aspirations
  were still higher. Individuals who saw the documentary were also less likely to agree with fatalistic explanations that attribute
  poverty to luck and fate after six months.
     These changes in aspirations and attitudes had a significant effect on the investment behavior of households, particularly with
  regard to education. The number of children enrolled in school increased by 15% among those who had watched the documentary.
  These households also had more savings and took more credit (Bernard et al. 2014).
     Using data collected as part of the evaluation of the Agricultural Growth Programme (AGP), analysis has also been undertaken
  to explore rural household’s attitudes to fate and whether they believe that their efforts can be rewarded (Hoddinott et al. 2014).
  Specifically, it applies the notion of “locus of control.” Someone with an internal locus of control believes that their actions
  influence events, while someone with an external locus of control believes that forces beyond their control largely shape life’s
  events. Those with stronger internal locus of control tend to be better-educated individuals, among those who are married and to
  be men. There is little difference across age until 60 years after which it declines. Although no experimental evaluation has been
  conducted to assess the causal relationship between locus of control and investment (as in the case of aspirations), individuals
  with higher internal locus of control were found to be more likely to ensure that girls are attending school and more willing to
  buy fertilizer and improved seeds.

  BOX 2.3: The Multidimensional Poverty Index
  Poverty is multidimensional, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) tries to capture this by considering overlapping
  deprivations suffered by people at the same time. The index identifies deprivations across education, health and standard of
  living. It counts an individual as multi-dimensionally poor if they suffer deprivations in a third of the weighted indicators. The
  index can be deconstructed by region, ethnicity and other groupings as well as by dimension.
     Almost 1.5 billion people in the 91 countries covered by the MPI—more than a third of their population—live in multidimensional
  poverty; that is, with at least 33% of the indicators reflecting acute deprivation in health, education, and standard of living. This
  exceeds the estimated 1.2 billion people in those countries who live on US$1.25 a day or less
     The data underlying the index is the data in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Specifically, the indicators considered
  and the weights they receive are as follows.

  Education (each indicator receives a weight of one sixth in the total):
  •	 Years of schooling: if no household member has completed at least five years of schooling; and
  •	 Child school attendance: if any school-aged child is not attending school in years 1 to 8.

  Health (each indicator receives a weight of one sixth in the total):
  •	 Child mortality: if any child has died in the family; and
  •	 Nutrition: if any adult or child for whom there is nutritional information is malnourished.

  Living standards (each indicator receives a weight of one eighteenth in the total):
  •	 Electricity: if the household has no access to electricity;
  •	 Drinking water: if the household has no access to clean drinking water or clean water is more than 30 minutes walk from home;
  •	 Improved sanitation: if the household does not have an improved toilet or if the toilet is shared;
  •	 Flooring: if the household has dirt, sand, or dung floor;
  •	 Cooking Fuel: if they cook with wood, charcoal, or dung;
  •	 Assets: deprived if the household does not own more than one of: radio, TV, telephone, bike, or motorbike, and do not own
      a car or tractor.

       BOX 2.4: Learning how to provide education to out-of-school girls in Addis Ababa
       Ethiopia has made significant strides in expanding access to education through a range of initiatives, including the alleviation
       of school fees, social campaigns, and availability of non-formal education. While these initiatives have greatly increased
       enrollment rates, there is an interest in honing existing policies to extend equity and quality to vulnerable groups. Findings from
       a recent World Bank research project indicate that out-of-school migrant girls in urban areas are among the disadvantaged,
       and that it is indeed possible to mobilize them through a community-driven and government-supported approach.
          From 2013 to 2014, the World Bank implemented “Powering Up: Social Empowerment for Vulnerable Girls” in partnership
       with the Addis Ababa City Administration Bureau of Women, Children and Youth Affairs and the Population Council. The
       project trained local female mentors to mobilize out-of-school, 12–18 year-old girls throughout 17 woredas (districts) in five
       sub-cities of Addis Ababa city into community-donated “safe spaces” (or girls clubs). The mentors made door-to-door visits
       to inquire about eligible girls and to convince the head of the household for their approval. At times, repeated visits were
       necessary to obtain consent. Within club settings, girls participated in non-formal education and life skills training. Where
       possible, they were mainstreamed into the formal education system with the aid of school material provision.
          A demographic and livelihood profiling of the girls revealed that over 90% were rural-to-urban migrants. Two-thirds of
       the girls had some years of formal schooling, although none had attained education beyond primary school. Almost half
       were functionally illiterate. Two out of three stated that they had no friends, revealing a disturbing degree of social isolation.
          Over a third of girls (34%) lived with their non-relative employers, primarily as domestic workers with an average income
       of 249 birr a month. One-fifth of these girls also received in-kind payment—mainly food and shelter—equivalent to a value
       of approximately 325 birr a month.
          Project results revealed that constraints to formal school enrollment for a large share of the project participants were not
       as strong as expected. Substantial increases in enrollment can be achieved by strong nudging of household decision-makers,
       coupled with appropriate coverage of hidden school costs. Further, results also suggest that girls can easily be absorbed into
       existing alternative basic education centers as they provide a similarly flexible learning environment as the girls clubs.
          Data was also collected on girls who declined participation in Powering Up. Much like the project participants, approximately
       one-third of the girls (32 out of 100) lived with their non-relative employers. For girls who lived with relatives, household poverty
       was cited as the major factor affecting the lack of participation, as coping mechanisms are manifested in high demand for
       child labor. As such, further pilot projects need to be carried to better understand the opportunity costs to education, and on
       how to strengthen delivery of existing services to ensure that girls receive an education that is suitable to their lifestyle. For
       those girls who lived with non-relatives as their employees, household heads stated that the girls’ domestic duties were too
       great for participation in the clubs, indicating minimal or no value placed in their employees’ education. Stronger government
       encouragement aimed at the employers of these girls is recommended to adequately address the needs of these girls who
       remain disenfranchised and invisible.

      BOX 3.1: A measure of vulnerability to poverty using cross-sectional data
      Measuring vulnerability is conceptually and empirically much more complex than measuring poverty because it is about what
      might happen, an expectation on the future. The perfect dataset would include several years’ worth of observations for each
      household, and even better, information on what could happen and how probable this is/was in differing states of the world.
        This box details how a measure of consumption vulnerability has been estimated with the data available in Ethiopia: nationally
      representative surveys that do not survey the same household twice, and other data sources on the nature of shocks households
      face. In the future as successive panels of the Ethiopian Rural Socioeconomic Survey have been conducted the nature of data
      available for this analysis will change.
        Measures of consumption vulnerability are the most difficult to estimate, but unlike many of the other measures of vulnerability
      considered in this chapter; they provide an estimate of how likely it is that a household will be poor in the future even if they are
      not poor today. This is often thought to be an important element of vulnerability to capture.

      Step 1: Define a wellbeing indicator, and a level of wellbeing, below which a person is considered poor. Consistent with the poverty
      numbers of the Government of Ethiopia (MOFED 2013), a household is consumption poor or absolute poor in one year if their
      total expenditure on all items is less than the national absolute poverty line. This is the amount of money needed to purchase
      food of 2200 kilocalories for every adult-equivalent in the household, and other necessary items for everyone in the household.
      In this chapter a household is defined as extreme poor if their total expenditure on all items is less than the amount of money
      needed to purchase food of 2200 kilocalories for every adult-equivalent in the household. This is different from the measure
      of food poverty used by the Government of Ethiopia, which compares total spending on food (rather than total spending on
      all items) to the food poverty line. In reality this measure of food poverty results in a similar number of food poor and absolute
      poor households in Ethiopia.

      Step 2: Estimate the relationship between shocks and the wellbeing indicator. In the absence of repeated observations for each
      household, the spatial and historic distribution of shocks is used to estimate the average impact of that shock on household
      wellbeing. Objective measures of rainfall-induced crop losses are used to measure the impact of drought on wellbeing (as in
      Thomas et al. 2010 and Anttila Hughes and Hsiang 2013) and household reported shocks are used for other types of shock.
      Given the impact of a shock on wellbeing is dependent on the ability of a household to manage the shock; the impact of the
      shock is allowed to vary across different types of individuals.

      Step 3: Calculate how likely a shock is to happen for each household. This is done in two ways depending on the type of shock.
      For shocks that do not tend to happen to everyone at once (idiosyncratic shocks), the frequency of similar households that report
      that shock is used to determine the probability that a given household will experience that shock in the future. For shocks that do
      happen to many people at once, covariate shocks such as weather-induced yield losses, the probability and severity of shocks
      is determined by using other sources of data for shocks in that location for the last 18 years. In particular, the Livelihoods, Early
      Assessment and Protection project (LEAP) system, developed in 2008 by the Government of Ethiopia in collaboration with WFP          ,
      is used to calculate the rainfall-induced crop loss in woredas throughout Ethiopia from 1995 to 2012.

      Step 4: Simulate the likely distribution of wellbeing for each household in one year’s time using the likelihood and estimated cost
      of shocks. One thousand possible outcomes for each household are simulated in which households experience these shocks
      according to how likely they are. Each time a household experiences a shock its impact on consumption is calculated using the
      regression estimates of the impact these shocks have on households. The result is a distribution of likely consumption outcomes
      for a given household.

      Step 5: Calculate the probability that the household would have consumption below the national poverty line. A cutoff of probability,
      above which a household is defined as vulnerable is set. Most studies use 50% probability of poverty to classify vulnerability (i.e.
      household has more than a 50% chance of being poor), and that is what is used in these estimates also.




         Across most measures of vulnerability, rural                       reflecting the fact that rainfall and crop production
     households appear more vulnerable than urban                           was better than average in 2010–11. One quarter of

       BOX 4.1: What does decomposing changes in poverty entail?
       In this chapter the results of two decomposition methods are presented. The first method is the Ravallion and Huppi (1991)
       inter-sectoral decomposition method that quantifies how much poverty reduction among different groups or movement between
       different groups accounts for national poverty reduction. The second method uses Recentered Influence Functions (RIF, Firpo et
       al. 2009) in which traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions are applied to different percentiles of the consumption distribution.
       This allows an assessment of the amount of poverty reduction that can be accounted for in changes in the characteristics of
       households and individuals (“endowments”) compared to the changing nature of the Ethiopian economy and poverty.
          Both decomposition methods rely on defining a counterfactual scenario and estimating what would have happened to poverty
       had the counterfactual scenario occurred. By defining a counterfactual scenario the changes that have been important to overall
       poverty reduction can be quantified. The figure below depicts how this can work for two different counterfactual scenarios.
          In the Ravallion and Huppi method the focus is on a counterfactual of no change in the proportion of population in different
       sectors; and a counterfactual of no change in poverty among people in a given sector. These counterfactuals are used to examine
       the amount of poverty reduction that took place within sectors (as if sectors had not changed), and the amount of poverty reduction
       that took place as a result of people moving between sectors.
          In the RIF analysis the focus is on a counterfactual of a constant relationship between endowments and poverty in Ethiopia
       over 1996 to 2011. This counterfactual is used to determine which changes in endowments could have contributed to poverty
       reduction, and how much poverty reduction could have changed as a result of a changing relationship between poverty and
       endowments. The latter is sometimes referred to as changes in the returns to endowments, but really it represents how the
       conditional correlation between a given endowment and consumption has changed.
          In all decomposition approaches there is an interaction effect which can be interpreted as a measure of the correlation between
       population shifts and inter-sectoral changes in poverty in the Ravallion and Huppi method, and changes in endowments and
       returns in the RIF analysis. In the decompositions shown here it is quite small.

  BOX 4.2: Agricultural growth in 12 rural communities
  The WIDE research covers 20 communities in Ethiopia selected as exemplars of different types of rural livelihood systems.
  Research was conducted in 1995, 2003 and 2010–2013. Findings are reported here for six sites with agricultural potential and
  six agriculturalist food insecure sites for which research was conducted in 2012–13.
     In the six communities with agricultural potential, large changes in the local economies since the early 1990s were documented
  with economic growth in evidence in all. Growth was not driven solely by increasing agricultural incomes but also by increasing
  involved in trade and other non-farm activities, wage employment in nearby towns, and remittances. Agricultural growth has
  been driven by improvements in agricultural productivity, increased demand for crops and livestock products, better access to
  markets, food price increases, and new aspirations.
     Economic growth had also been experienced in all six agriculturalist but food-insecure communities as a result of improvements
  in roads, increases in agricultural and no-farm incomes, and the PSNP         . Improvements in agricultural incomes were related
  to agricultural productivity increases, food price inflation, better road access to markets, and diversification into higher-value
  products, many of which depended on irrigation. Cash-crop production and sale had increased everywhere. Failure to maintain
  a road had reduced access to markets in one site. Improved seeds, fertilizer, and new planting techniques had contributed to
  improvements in agricultural productivity.
     The analysis also highlighted the vulnerability of agricultural growth as a sole driver of improvements in wellbeing. Although
  economic growth had been experienced, all food insecure communities had suffered at least one severe drought since 2003.
  Annual rain shortages were experienced although the severity varied by year. Irrigation schemes were of varying importance in
  the sites but demand for irrigation was high.
     Finally, the research provides insights on what has been effective in encouraging agricultural growth in the agricultural sites,
  and what had not been effective:

  •	 Minimal agricultural extensions services were available in the mid 1990s but by 2013 the services covered crops, livestock
     and natural resource management and the government was supporting and monitoring farming activities.
  •	 Although limited credit was available in the early 1990s in 2013 most communities had credit for farm and non-farm activities
     though regional MFIs
  •	 Nearly all government investment in rural economic development had gone to adult male farmers, mostly richer ones. This
     strategy was successful but this group of leading farmers is now sufficiently well-established and aspiring that it does not
     need nudging anymore.
  •	 The engine of growth is the hard work of private individuals trying to change their lives and most cooperatives had failed to
     work effectively.

  BOX 5.1: Terminology
  It is important to define some basic concepts in incidence analysis as the distributive impact of fiscal policy depends on the extent
  of progressivity of taxes and transfers. The terms progressive and regressive can be used in two different senses: in absolute and
  relative terms. Following Lustig and Higgins (2013) the following definitions are used.a
  Progressive: a subsidy (or tax) is progressive if it is progressive in relative terms, that is, if the proportion of the subsidy
  (or tax) relative to income decreases (increases) with household income.
  Pro-poor subsidies and transfers: a subsidy/transfer is pro-poor if it is progressive in absolute terms, that is, if the
  absolute (i.e., per capita) amount of the subsidy/transfer decreases with household income (and therefore if the share of total
  spending is higher for lower income deciles).
  Subsidies/transfers that are not pro-poor: a subsidy is not pro-poor if it is regressive in absolute terms, that is, if
  the absolute amount of the subsidy increases with household income (and therefore if the share of total spending is higher for
  higher income deciles).
  Regressive: a subsidy (or tax) is regressive if it is regressive in relative terms, that is, if the proportion of the subsidy (or
  tax) relative to income increases (decreases) with household income.
  Using these definitions, spending can be progressive (i.e., equalizing) but not necessarily pro-poor.
  a
      All these definitions apply exactly when the net fiscal system does not cause re-ranking. If there is re-ranking, they are a very good approximation.

      BOX 8.1: Youth unemployment and job search in Addis Ababa
      High levels of youth unemployment have long been a feature of the Ethiopian economy and their persistence in
      the face of economic growth and increased educational attainment is a cause of concern. In 2012 unemployment
      rates among males age 15–24 in Addis Ababa are 21%, and 36% among those who have just graduated from high school.
      The striking finding for Ethiopia is just how poor the unemployed are as they search for work. What are their aspirations for
      employment opportunities? What do they do and how do they survive while they are without work? How do the youth find jobs?
      This box draws on a background paper prepared for the Poverty Assessment that uses two datasets, the 2012 Ethiopian Central
      Statistics Agency’s Urban Employment and Unemployment Survey (a large survey taken to be representative of all urban areas
      in Ethiopia) and a panel dataset collected by Oxford University studying the lives of a small sample of unemployed youth from
      areas in and around Addis Ababa conducted in 2013 (Franklin 2014).
         Survey data on unemployed youth in Addis Ababa identify two different types of unemployed: lower educated
      youth who are native to Addis Ababa and higher educated recent migrants. One type of unemployed youth is native
      to Addis and living with their parents. They have some secondary education (60%) but no tertiary education and are often not
      actively looking for jobs as they have become discouraged by a long period of unemployment. They are likely to have done
      some temporary work in the past and have a relatively low reservation wage. In contrast the second type of unemployed have
      just finished school or university and moved to Addis either for education or upon graduating. They live on their own or with
      relatives and they are actively engaged in formal job search. They have not been unemployed for as long, they are less likely to
      have work experience, and they are looking for higher paid jobs. In the Oxford survey, the first type of unemployed youth was
      primarily sampled in slum areas in non-central sub-cities of Addis Ababa and the second type was primarily sampled around
      the job vacancy boards, which are described further below. Descriptive statistics of these two samples of unemployed youth are
      presented in Table 8.5.

      Employment aspirations
      Unemployed youth aspire to escape poverty through a permanent job often in an administrative position,
      however finding permanent employment is difficult, particularly for those without higher levels of education.
      More than 50% of unemployed youth in Addis Ababa were looking only for permanent jobs. In comparison 35% said they were
      looking for any type of work. Although many unemployed seek permanent employment, few have permanent jobs. On average,
      27.7% of males have permanent jobs and 17.3% of females. However the proportion is much lower among 15–24 year olds
      with 13.1% of males in this age group that are in the labor market having a permanent job and 12.8% of females (Table 8.6).
      Those with higher levels of education are more likely to have permanent jobs.

  Few youth actively seek self-employment, but some end up in self-employment when job search does not
provide employment. Almost no unemployed youth said they were planning on making a living in self-employed activities (just
2%). However, four times this number end up in self-employment just four months later. The UEUS finds that self-employment is
more prevalent among old cohorts.
  Increasingly, unemployed youth are looking for and attaining private sector jobs. Serneels (2007) describes the
Ethiopian labor market in the mid-1990s as characterized by the phenomenon of queuing, where reasonably well educated
wait for good jobs usually in the public sector. The presence of relatively well-educated aspiring to high-paying government or
administrative-type jobs is still very much in evidence in 2012/3, but jobs in the private sector are increasingly desirable. In 1994
there were twice as many jobs in government as there were wage-paying jobs in the private sector (Serneels, 2007). In 2012,
the private sector provided more jobs to youth (45.1%) than did the government (33.2%). However, government jobs are still
more likely to be permanent jobs (82.1%) than private sector jobs (23.7%). Public sector jobs are still highly sought after, with
34% of unemployed youth in Addis Ababa stating a preference to work in the public sector compared to 65% in 1993. However
the private sector is increasingly desirable: 55% of unemployed youth in Addis Ababa stated a preference to work in the private
sector, compared to 16% in 1993.
Unemployed life
The unemployed youth of Addis Ababa rely heavily on money from their parents, particularly those who have
just graduated or moved to Addis Ababa. Half of those without work reported that money from immediate family (excluding
friends, spouse, and partner) was their main source of income. The reliance on family was higher for those who had recently
migrated to Addis, or those who had just graduated from school or university. Those with degrees, and recent migrants, are
getting three times the financial support from their parents than someone who was born in Addis, or had no education. Families
provide savings to youth on graduating or on moving to the capital in order to support themselves while they look for work.
   Unemployment spells, however last longer than the number of weeks of search that family support can sustain
and many youth engage in short spells of temporary employment to sustain job search, very often manual labor
in the construction sector. Recent migrants are far less likely to have savings, formal or informal than those who are unemployed
and native to Addis. On average, they have only enough money to survive a few weeks on their own savings, at their regular rates
of expenditure. The unemployed are no longer just wealthy elite that can wait for many months for a permanent job (as found in the
mid-1990s by Serneels 2007). Many unemployed engage in temporary employment to earn money to continue searching for work.
More than half of those who were unemployed and remained after four months, had engaged in temporary work during this time.
Half of casual/daily jobs for men are in construction. Only one fifth (22%) of unemployed youth did not work at all during four months.
   Unemployed individuals of all education levels are just as likely to take temporary work, but recent migrants
and those not living with their parents are much more likely to take temporary work. Well-educated individuals
were no less likely to have taken work over the 16 weeks during which they were tracked. As a result many well educated are
engaged in temporary jobs (such as those in the construction sector) for which they are over qualified. Recent migrants seem
the least able to avoid taking work while searching, they are about 10 percentage points less likely on average to have done no
work over four months, relative to 35% of those who have been in Addis for longer than a year. Individuals that did not take any
work were more likely to be relying on family money and more likely to be living at home.
                                                                                                                (continued on next page)
116   ETHIOPIA – POVERTY ASSESSMENT




      BOX 8.1: Youth unemployment and job search in Addis Ababa (continued)
         Unemployment contains considerable boredom on a daily basis for unemployed youth. The unemployed spend
      on average two thirds (16 hours) of their time in their own homes or yards. Of those waking hours, remarkably, respondents
      report spending at least three hours per day on average “doing nothing,” even after having been asked about 20 different activity
      categories, and asking about any other time spent that had not been accounted for. This time spent doing nothing does not
      include all other leisure activities reported (on average 3.4 hours a day), nor does it include time spent socializing with friends
      (1.7 hours per day on average). This sort of time use behavior fits with the picture of time spent among young unemployed men
      in the anthropological work of Mains (2012), who discussing the considerable boredom of waiting for their lives to progress,
      and having little to do in the meantime.
      Job search
      Visiting vacancy boards is the most common form of job-search method and the one that yields the highest
      probability of finding a permanent job. Job seekers usually try a range of different routes into work, including asking their
      social networks and going door to door to ask businesses for vacancies. However, vacancy boards and newspapers, particularly
      vacancy boards, are the most common forms of job search. They are used by 44% of the urban unemployed, compared to 22%
      who ask friends or relatives for a job (UEUS 2012). They are particularly used for finding permanent jobs: although 38% of
      jobs found by unemployed youth in Addis Ababa were found at job boards, 69% of permanent jobs were found at job boards
      (compared to 63% and 31% found through networks respectively).
         Searching at vacancy boards can be time consuming and expensive involving many visits to the central
      vacancy boards, each of which costs more than the median daily expenditure of unemployed youth. Those with
      lower levels of education that do not visit vacancy boards state it is because they will not find work there (60%) reflecting the
      fact it is more often skilled jobs that are posted on the boards. The majority of those with higher levels of education that do visit
      more but the costs of transport were prohibitively high (82%). Of the sample of unemployed youth sampled at vacancy boards,
      83% had stopped visiting these boards after four months because it was too expensive to travel to the board. The average cost
      of a trip to the town center to look for work is estimated to be 15 Birr, which is higher than the average median expenditure of
      14 Birr per day among the two samples of unemployed youth.
         One in four educated, active job seekers secured permanent employment in four months of search, but rates
      of success are much lower for those who are less educated and less actively looking for work. After 16 weeks,
      21% of the type 2 unemployed had found permanent jobs compared to only 6% of the type 1 unemployed (Figure 8.8). This
      means that type 2 unemployed will stay in unemployment and poverty for a longer period of time. Among those well-educated,
      actively seeking work, one third (32.8%) had been unemployed for 6–12 months and almost one fifth (18.9%) for longer than
      this. Among those native to Addis, 35.3% had been unemployed for longer than one year. Rates of discouragement are much
      higher among the type 1 unemployed.

  BOX 9.1: Policy example: Government response and RCBP in Ethiopia
  The Rural Capacity Building Project (RCBP), implemented between 2006 and 2012, was designed to strengthen agricultural services
  and systems and make them more responsive to clients’ needs. The project encompassed five major components: (1) Assisting
  Agricultural TVET colleges in training Ethiopia’s Development Agents (DAs); (2) Improving and scaling up the effectiveness of this
  agricultural extension system’s capacity to respond to farmers’ demands to enhance women’s participation; (3) Strengthening
  agricultural research, through institutional strengthening of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS); (4) Improving Ministry
  of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD) capacity; and (5) Assisting with analytical work. The RCBP was implemented in
  10 regions, 127 woredas, 635 kebeles and 2,500 Farmer Training Centers (FTC) in the country, beginning in 2007.
      From the beginning, it was decided to make an impact evaluation an integral part of the RCBP in order to rigorously assess
  its effectiveness. The evaluation carried out by Buehren et al. (2014) primarily relied on two rounds of survey data collected from
  farming households in both RCBP project and non-project woredas. The first round of data collection was carried out soon after
  the launch of project implementation, and efforts were made to revisit all baseline respondents after project completion in 2012.
  The resulting panel dataset comprises 1,485 households and nearly 300 DAs spread across four regions: Amhara, Oromia,
  Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Region (SNNPR), and Benishangul-Gumuz (BSG).
      The impact analysis builds on an estimation of difference-in differences using matching techniques and focuses on intention-
  to treat estimates (comparing farmers in project woredas with their counterfactuals in non-project woredas). The results suggest
  that the RCBP has had a significant impact on economic activity: RCBP households utilize more farm labor relative to non-RCBP
  households, with an additional one-half of a person contributing to income in RCBP households. The increase in the number of
  people who contribute to household income is not only statistically significant but it is also estimated to be a sizeable 23–27%
  increase over the baseline value. Over the evaluation period, the amount of farm labor declines overall. However, this decline
  is significantly lower in RCBP areas. On average, RCBP households use 10–12% more labor, in terms of the number of people
  within a household that work on farming, compared to households in the non-RCBP counterfactual group. In addition, there is
  a positive impact of 17–24% on the size of land under agricultural production. It should also be noted that the total size of land
  under agricultural production fell between the baseline and follow-up surveys for all households included in the studied sample.
  However, the decline is significantly lower among RCBP households, indicating that RCBP households have a larger area of land
  under farm use by the end of the project.
      The authors define high value crops as those with a higher value than traditional staple crops and that are used primarily to
  sell in the market, as well as an extended set of marketable crops termed somewhat high-value crops.a The analysis indicates
  that households located in RCBP woredas are more likely to grow high value crops, in response to the program. The estimated
  increase is in the range between 9–11 percentage points for high value crop production. For the sale of these crops, an increase
  in RCBP areas and a decrease in non-RCBP areas are observed. Considering the net difference, this yields a statistically significant
  and large increase in the sale of high value crops among RCBP households relative to control areas by 8–12 percentage points. A
  similar pattern is documented for the somewhat high value crops and incidence of sale of high and somewhat high value crops.
      Repeating the estimations and disaggregating by the gender of the household head shows that, while the positive impact of
  the program on the number of individuals who contribute to income is lower in female-headed households, this difference is not
  statistically significant. Additionally, there is no significant statistical difference in the impact of the number of people who work on
  the farm or for income from agriculture. The same is true for consumption. Finally, in the case of farm size and growing somewhat
  high value or high value crops, there is no statistically significant difference between the impact of the program on male- and
                                                                                                                    (continued on next page)

      female-headed households. A positive program impact only for male-headed households can merely be demonstrated in the
      case of livestock. Hence, the evidence indicates that for most of the outcomes of interest, the program seems to have benefitted
      men and women equally.
        These results powerfully suggest that government intervention does not necessarily lead to a reinforcement of the mechanisms
      that underlie the prevailing gender gap in agricultural productivity. Instead, the authors argue and the results of the impact
      evaluation suggest that adapting the extension system supported by the RCBP     , which traditionally serves male farmers, to the
      needs of women farmers, can contribute considerably to closing the gender gap and unleashing the full potential of farming
      households in Ethiopia.
