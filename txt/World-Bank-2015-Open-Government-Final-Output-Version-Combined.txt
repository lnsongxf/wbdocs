information and abiding by the Philippines’ international commitments to transparency and government openness, all government agen-

and projects. These datasets shall be updated, whenever permissible, at least once every quarter of the year. The Open Data website shall
be maintained and administered by the Open Data Task Force under the Office of the President, or any such similar body designated by the
President for this purpose. For the purpose of making government data more accessible to the public, all datasets published in the Open
Data Philippines website and on LGU [local government unit] websites as mandated in Section 8 of this Act shall be, whenever practicable,
of a machine-readable and open format.

requests are denied, the matrix shall contain the reasons for denial and the status of the appeal if such is done.

individual through a request for information, the said dataset shall also be published in an appropriate website such as, but not limited to,

access to all information that has been requested.

Contact Name          While the JSON Open Data Standard requires the name            Office of the Secretary - Public Information Unit
                      of a person who could take queries on this dataset, the
                      PMO recommends the name of the unit/division in your
                      agency that could farm the queries to the appropriate
                      unit/division that produced this dataset. We imagine this
                      to be your public information or communications unit.
                      However, should you prefer the queries to be directly
                      addressed to your statistics/data unit, you are welcome
                      to do so.

                      Unit, Corporate Planning - Statistics Division

Contact Email         Please provide either the corporate email address of this      publicinfo@dbm.gov.ph
                      unit/division or of any personnel in this unit.

Contact Number        Please provide either the corporate contact                    (+632) 490-1000 loc 2602

                      Please affix “(+632)” on your entry as seen
                      on the example.

Unique Identifier     This is the unique identifier for the dataset within your
                      agency’s internal catalogue/database. This field allows
                      third parties to maintain a consistent record for data-
                      sets even if title or URLs are updated. However, each
                      identifier must be unique across the agency’s catalog
                      and remain fixed. Characters should be alphanumeric.
                      E.g., “aa73hfmsi”, “budgetexpenditure19842013”. If
                      your agency does not use an internal Unique Identifier,
                      please leave this blank. As an alternative, the PMO and
                      the public will simply refer to this dataset by the Title
                      you have provided.

Public Access Level   The JSON Open Data Standard allows for three possible          Public
                      entries for this field: Public, Restricted, and Private. The
                      PMO will only accept datasets agencies are willing to
                      make Public.

Data Dictionary       URL of page on your agency’s website containing
                      definition of terms. If no such page/link is available,
                      leave the field blank.

               For datasets that will be housed in data.gov.ph, the
               PMO will be providing the URL for direct download. For
               datasets that will be housed in the agency’s site, please
               provide the URL for direct download.

Endpoint       Is the dataset available as a web-service such as an
               Application Programming Interface (API)? For example,
               DOTC has established an API which allows users to pull
               data from the DOTC database without having to down-
