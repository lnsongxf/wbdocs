   substantiation of outcomes
   To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, an external consultant
   selected four outcomes [1, 12, 14 and 20) and asked 10 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
   change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. Four people responded
   to three outcomes [except 1]. Four of these substantiators fully agreed on the description of the outcomes and
   WBI’s contribution to them and two provided additional information to clarify their significance. Excerpts of the
   substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

       “The approach is very good because after the training provided by the World Bank, it was time for the
      Government of Burundi to take ownership of this method to integrate it into the implementation of projects
      and programs. Otherwise, we would always be expecting World Bank experts to launch, on our behalf,
      projects to be executed in a short timeframe with tangible results. For the time being, most ministries have
      already integrated this method into the implementation of the action plans.”

      “The World Bank should consider giving further support to this program through a sustained program
      of ongoing evaluation. It should consider providing external coaches to help us better evaluate our
      performances in the rapid results, as often as necessary. It should extend the approach to other institutions,
      even private or parastatal ones.”						                                           —Odette Kayitesi, Minister
      of Agriculture

      “Indeed, over the past few years, there has been an obvious change in the way projects in Burundi are
      managed and implemented using the system of results-oriented activity planning followed by the evaluation
      of results, using observable and verifiable indicators.”

        substantiation of outcomes
        To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant
        selected 4 outcomes [1, 6, 7, 17] and asked 7 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the change to
        review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. Five people responded: 5 fully agreed
        with the outcome description as formulated and WBI’s contribution to it; regarding significance, 1 fully agreed with
        the description and 4 provided additional information to describe the significance. Excerpts of the substantiators’
        comments on the outcomes achieved:

           “The reform team from Bosnia and Herzegovina comprised 6 members: 1 member from the municipality of
           Bijeljina (today the city of Bijeljina), 3 members from the public enterprise regional landfill EKO-DEP,
           1 member from the utility Komunolac and 1 member from the directorate for construction and development
           of the city of Bijeljina.”                                                    —Dragan Lazic, Eko Dep, Bijeljina

           “The agreement, the plan and key steps have been achieved [toward the goal of increasing the amount of
           waste collection]. However, the coverage has not yet been increased by 20% under the specified deadline.”
                                                                             —Milorad Zekic, Head, Komunolac utility

           “Today, the main goal—to cover the whole municipality with waste collection—is almost done. The
           11-month goal to increase coverage for 20% failed because the goal was too complicated for so small a time
           period. But, the Rapid Results Initiative [implementation and achievement of certain outcomes in a shorter
           time period] made good preparation for the long-term goal. WBI had a huge impact on the creation of the
           reform team and made our work much easier and more organized.”

     changes relate to awareness, knowledge or skills, collaborative
     action, or the use of knowledge or innovative solutions. These
     levels are based on the Capacity Development and Results
     Framework. The framework provides a systematic yet flexible
     approach to designing capacity development strategies and
     programs, monitoring and adaptively managing interventions,
     and evaluating and learning from their results.

        substantiation of outcomes
        To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant
        selected 5 outcomes [6, 12, 14, 18, 22] and asked 15 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
        change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. Thirteen people responded
        and all “fully agreed” with the description as formulated of the outcome and its significance. Excerpts of the
        substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

           “The commitment of the high-level policy makers was important to the work of the PSM coalition as it will
           enable their work get the recognition and support it needs in high-level decisionmaking that affects the
           PSM. The bringing together of the PSM Coalitions and high-level policy makers needed a champion and
           WBI played that role well and in a timely manner.”
                        —Ramadhan Mlinga, Chief Executive Officer, Public Procurement Regulatory Authority, Tanzania

           “While such multi-stakeholder coalitions are important, they need to be better aligned with overall World
           Bank engagement in the country level and contribute to better policy dialogue on improving participation
           of stakeholders and enhanced transparency. Therefore, I would like to see much stronger emphasis on
           linkage with the Bank’s long-term engagement in the outcome. This way, WBI contributions will provide
           more sustainable gains.” 		               — Gandham N.V. Ramana, Lead Health Specialist, World Bank

           “To improve lives of the citizens can only be successful with support of the government (high-level policy
           makers), failure to which interventions increasingly achieve minimal results. Working with government senior
           officials has enabled the civil society to fill in gaps within the policy system, a key gap being monitoring
           of impact of the government expended resources. Then direct feedback to high-level policy makers. The
           Kenya Medical Supply Agency has been a key beneficiary of this type of CSO monitoring of their services.”
                                                        — Debra Gichio, Program Officer, Transparency International, Kenya

           “This meeting [National Medicines Dialogue in May 2012] brought a number of agencies and CSOs
           together. Most especially the district CSOs were able to meet the executive directors of the National
           Drug Authority, Joint Medical Stores, National Medical Stores and Ministry Of Health. In fact one of the
           participants said ‘now this is a dream come true because I have always wanted to see National Medical

Capacity Development and Results Framework. The framework
provides a systematic yet flexible approach to designing capacity
development strategies and programs, monitoring and adaptively
managing interventions, and evaluating and learning from their
results.
2 Outcome harvesting is a practical assessment tool from the
outcome mapping community of practice. It can be used for real-
time monitoring and evidence gathering from complex develop-
ment processes that involve multiple stakeholders. It is based
on a similar concept of locally driven change from the Capacity
Development and Results Framework. The tool was customized to
gather information on outcomes—and related outputs and mile-
stones—to learn from what changed, for whom, when and where,
the significance of the change and how the program contributed
to each change.
3 While the Improving Governance in Pharmaceutical Procure-

ment and Supply Chain Management Initiative was established in
2010, over the years it has become part of the global movement
on “Open Contracting,” a multi-sector effort that seeks to pro-
mote greater transparency and accountability in the award and
implementation of public sector contracts.
4 The numbers in brackets correspond to the outcomes in

Figure 1. The text that follows each outcome refers to its
significance. The process of change the outcomes represent is in
Figure 2.
5 Change agents are leaders, groups or organizations from

government or non-state that drive change.
6 Change strategy refers to how change happened to advance
progress toward the development objectives—the development

   substantiation of outcomes
   To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant
   selected five outcomes [3, 17, 19, 22 and 24) and asked 10 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about
   the change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. Six people responded to
   four outcomes [except 19]. Four of these substantiators fully agreed on the description of the outcomes and their
   significance and two provided additional information to clarify these. Excerpts of the substantiators’ comments on
   the outcomes achieved:

      “There is a significant need to centralize and streamline procurement into one institution strictly regulated.
      Such an institution shall minimize the huge public funds lost in the procurement process. This is due to the
      fact that all institutions procure and dispose independently without checks and supervision.”
                                                                           —Ayaga Garang, PAC Clerk, South Sudan

      “All reports go through a hearing but do not reach the level where we account both to the public and
      parliament. This is a serious gap in our country because of the lack of a vibrant multi-party system.”
                                                                              —Hon. Seif Girma, PAC Chair, Ethiopia

     NOTES
     1 PACs are the committees in parliament tasked with scrutinizing
     the government’s implementation of the national budget. Their
     primary source of information is audits reports prepared by the
     Supreme Audit Institutions.
     2SADCOPAC members are Angola, Botswana, DRC, Lesotho,
     Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Sey-
     chelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
     3EAAPAC members are Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan,
     Rwanda and Uganda.
     4 Mapping outcomes—and related outputs and milestones—can

     help us learn from change processes that occur during program
     delivery that often seem complex and opaque because they
     involve multiple actors and address large development problems.
     An outcome is what each social actor (or change agent) did, or is
     doing, that reflects a significant change in their behavior, relation-
     ships, activities, actions, policies or practice. The program may
     influence these changes, directly or indirectly, partially or wholly,
     intended or not. Outcomes are identified at two levels in relation
     to the goal: institutional changes relate to societal, policy and
     organizational changes; and learning/capacity changes relate to
     awareness, knowledge or skills, collaborative action, or the use of
     knowledge or innovative solutions. These levels are based on the
     Capacity Development and Results Framework. The framework
     provides a systematic yet flexible approach to designing capacity
     development strategies and programs, monitoring and adaptively
     managing interventions, and evaluating and learning from their
     results.
     5 Outcome harvesting is a practical assessment tool from the
     outcome mapping community of practice. It can be used for real-
     time monitoring and evidence gathering from complex develop-
     ment processes that involve multiple stakeholders. It is based
     on a similar concept of locally driven change from the Capacity
     Development and Results Framework. The tool was customized to
     gather information on outcomes—and related outputs and mile-
     stones—to learn from what changed, for whom, when and where,
     the significance of the change and how the program contributed
     to each change.
     6 The numbers in brackets correspond to the outcomes in Figure 1.

     The text that usually follows each outcome refers to its significance.
     The process of change the outcomes represent can be seen in
     Figure 2.
     7 Change agents are leaders, groups or organizations from gov-

     ernment or non-state that drive change.
     8 Change strategy refers to how change happened to advance
     progress toward the development objectives—the development
     problems addressed, types of outcomes achieved, WBI contribu-
     tions, and partners involved. A change strategy may include dif-
     ferent types of change processes or outcome areas depending on
     the complexity of the multi-actor institutional changes involved in
     a program.

   substantiation of outcomes
   To verify the accuracy of the outcomes and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant selected
   four outcomes [4, 9, 20 and 24] and asked 13 people who are independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
   change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. Nine people responded.
   Eight fully agreed with the description, significance and contribution of WBI to outcomes 4, 9 and 20. One
   provided additional information to clarify the description, significance and contribution of outcome 24. Excerpts of
   the substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

      “In general, I feel that the establishment of the secretariat [that anchors the Uruguayan stakeholder work],
      although essential, should be considered as just the first step in dealing with so complex and sensitive a
      topic. Its success will depend on its permanence over time and the incorporation of new members.”
                                  —Nilza Salvo, Director of CEJU and Minister of the Court of Civil Appeals, Uruguay

      “I think that bringing the parties together [at the First Latin American Symposium on the Right to Health and
      Health Systems in Costa Rica] is a first step toward understanding of both positions, which can eventually
      facilitate commitments in decision-making.”
                                            —Ana Virginia Calzada Miranda, President, Supreme Court of Costa Rica

      “Dissemination of the judicial hearing, but not the judgment, as the text would seem to suggest, guarantees
      not only the right of everyone to have access to public information on the problem of the regulation and
      control of resources earmarked for financing health systems, but also will afford the general public a means
      of obtaining direct information on the follow up of Ruling T-760 of 2008, issued by the Constitutional Court
      of Colombia, which directs the competent authorities to correct the regulatory lapses that affect the health
      system in order to ensure the effective exercise of this basic right.”       —Jorge Ivan Palacio, President,
      Colombia’s Constitutional Court

      “I feel that the way in which the WBI addressed the issue [technical secretariat] is quite adequate, because
      it offered its collaboration while encouraging local stakeholders to seek their own means of analysis
      and discussion. This has made it possible to take advantage of both external experience and internal
      contributions.”             —Leticia Gómez, Head of Legal Department, National Resources Fund of Uruguay

   substantiation of outcomes
   To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant
   selected five outcomes [1, 5, 12, 16, 26] and asked 15 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
   change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. 12 people responded. Nine
   fully agreed with the description as formulated, and 3 provided additional information to describe the outcome.
   Regarding significance, 6 fully agreed with the description and 6 provided additional information to describe the
   significance. For the contribution of WBI, 7 fully agreed with the description and 3 provided additional information
   to describe the contribution. Excerpts of the substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

      “The current design of the Open Contracting Partnership was due to a collaborative process involving all
      stakeholders.”		                —Christian Poortman, Chair, Construction Sector Transparency Initiative

      “The key outcome of note is that WBI was able to co-create a vision and strategy for the Open Contracting
      project with a diverse group of partners.”                        —Joe McCarron, Partner, Reos Partners

      “WBI has worked with the coalition on this exciting journey. They have provided advice and experiences
      from different countries and even helped the coalition to make breakthroughs in places where initial
      difficulties were experienced.”
                       —Gilbert Sendugwa, Coordinator/Head of Secretariat, Africa Freedom of Information Centre

      “Amidst an opaque governance system, the ministry of education [in Uganda] was quite open and willing to
      work with civil society. This is unlike most government departments, which do not want to get close to civil
      society.”                                     —Bashir Twesigye, Chair, Uganda Contracts Monitoring Coalition,

      “I hope the information provided to the university will be easily accessible to all without any financial
      commitment since they now in most cases recoup all their costs in their work. I also think that this
      information is relayed to stakeholders so that the information can be accessed by all.”
                                          —Florence Dennis, Executive Secretary, Ghana Anti-Corruption Coalition

      “The training provided to the University of Ghana has already borne fruits as the officers involved have
      attended meetings of the Oil Platform and explained to civil society members how to use the web platform
      for advocacy information and demand accountability from duty bearers.”

       Mapping outcomes—and related outputs and milestones—can
     help us learn from change processes that occur during program
     delivery that often seem complex and opaque because they
     involve multiple actors and address large development problems.
     An outcome is what each social actor (or change agent) did,
     or is doing, that reflects a significant change in their behavior,
     relationships, activities, actions, policies or practice. The program
     may influence these changes, directly or indirectly, partially or
     wholly, intended or not. Outcomes are identified at two levels
     in relation to the goal: institutional changes relate to societal,
     policy and organizational changes; and learning/capacity changes
     relate to awareness, knowledge or skills, collaborative action, or
     the use of knowledge or innovative solutions. These levels are
     based on the Capacity Development and Results Framework.
     The framework provides a systematic yet flexible approach
     to designing capacity development strategies and programs,
     monitoring and adaptively managing interventions, and
     evaluating and learning from their results.

substantiation of outcomes
To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, an external consultant selected eight
and asked 16 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the change to review each and record whether they agree
with the outcome as described. Fourteen people responded, at least one per outcome. Some excerpts of the substantiators’
comments:

   “Public finances and the management of public finances (planning, execution and control), represents one of the most
   important elements in the implementation of the city’s strategic plans and programs. Therefore the involvement of
   Cetinje in the MFSA program is important because it will contribute to the acquisition of new knowledge in the area of
   better public finances management in all phases. The World Bank Institute provides a full contribution by informing the
   stakeholders about possibilities of participation in various programs. In that context, the Institute, through adequately
   providing information to the Old Royal Capital Cetinje, influenced our decision to join the previously mentioned process.”
                                                                      —Aleksandar Bogdanovic, Mayor of Cetinje, Montenegro

   “The municipality of Cetinje has been informed about the similar processes in regard to MFSA that has been successfully
   completed by the Municipality of Budva and the Capital City of Podgorica and they wanted to follow the same path. They
   are very interested in taking part at the City-to-City dialogue to establish communication with countries from the region.
   Cetinje believes they would be able to compare the performance data with neighbouring municipalities of Budva and
   Podgorica and to use the MFSA data to better advocate to the State for the grants program.”	
   					                                                       —Natasha Obradovic, municipal finance expert, Montenegro	

   “I fully agree that the series of City-to-City dialogue series were important, but equally important was (i) the dedicated
   support from the local expert fully understanding the tool and its applicability; and (ii) commitment from the municipal
   staff. The selection of participating municipalities also deserves attention.”
                                                                             —Bjorn Phillip, Senior Urban Specialist, World Bank

   “The MFSA provides us with a clear and integrated picture about our financial situation and budget structure and
   measures we have to undertake as soon as possible to keep financial stability and sustainability of the local economic
   development of MGB. Also, the MFSA tool gives a more transparent and integrated management approach that could
   use all members of the municipality top management, which was not a case before. It breaks the sector’s working barriers,
   improving the team approach, and most important, increases the responsibility of all key players related to the financial
   stability of the LSG in structuring their sector programs within the budget structure. It is the first step in providing anti-
   corruptive behavior of all municipal staff and management. Previously this was obligation only of the urban department
   staff, which was a very risky approach.”
                    —Sasho Trajkov, Head of Local Economic Development, Gazi Baba Municipality (city of Skopje), Macedonia

   “This is new and unique experience for them [municipalities], giving them the chance to be active players in the
   diagnosis/identification and the solution development phases, tailored in line with their specific LG needs and challenges.
   Working with municipalities on the ground gives opportunities for in-depth situation analysis that corresponds to the
   actual needs of the municipalities concerned. Bearing in mind the complexity of the undertaking, an in-depth capacity
   building with embedded training has been also envisaged to increase knowledge and skills on leadership, organization
   and change management—all important pillars for more efficient and effective implementation of the efforts/strategies to
   fight corruption.”                                                   —Ljupka Simonoska, local anti-corruption practitioner
   	
   “Apart from financial commitment, the mayor of Zenica has shown to be visionary on curing and preventing corruption,
   understanding its severe implications if not dealt with, as well as seeing and seizing an opportunity to deal with it within
   the project Cities without Corruption. In our encounters he would always underline the wish to create a sustainable
   system, which would stay in place no matter who the mayor is. He was also pleased with the used approach and
   methodology. Apart from the mayor’s significance in the process I would like to mention the importance of the key senior
   staff, which not only committed at the political level, but at the operational level, making the implementation successful
   and smooth.”                                                      —Emina Abrahamsdotter, local anti-corruption practitioner

   substantiation of outcomes
   To verify the accuracy of the outcomes and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant selected
   four outcomes [4, 5, 10 and 18] and asked 11 people who are independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
   change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. 10 people responded. All
   10 “fully agreed” with the descriptions as formulated; 1 substantiator “partially agreed” with the significance of an
   outcome and two substantiators “partially agreed” with WBI’s contribution to two other outcomes. Excerpts of the
   substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

      “The RTA is becoming a reality because it speaks to our aspiration to develop and fully explore the
      principles of transparency and the right to access information in our respective countries, reflecting our
      shared interest in generating a learning process around specific network issues and operations.”
             —Eduardo Gonzalez-Yañez, Director for Operations and Systems, Consejo para la Transparencia Chile

      “It’s important to note that cooperation among the members of the ATI network contributes directly to the
      work of persuading and overseeing the state administration, as the Office of the Ombudsman does in Peru.”
                            —Fernando Castañeda, Deputy on Constitutional Affairs Defensoría del Pueblo de Peru

      “In Mexico, the IFAI has found the ‘mystery shopper’ technique to be very useful since the start of its
      operations as the agency responsible for upholding the Transparency Act, and to this day it continues to
      emphasize using the technique as a mechanism for evaluating the attention given to the requests from the
      public and application of the process.”

      “WBI not only shared information on the various network models but also participated actively in their
      creation—dialoguing with the various stakeholders, offering input and advice on the analysis, which defined
      the network’s scope, and consistently supporting the network in its early stages. It not only arranged for an
      IDF grant; it gave totally ‘demand-driven’ support, consistently fostering its sustainability above and beyond
      the assistance offered by the Bank.”	               —Ana Bellver, Senior Public Sector Specialist, World Bank

     NOTES
     1 Mapping outcomes—and related outputs and milestones—can

     help us learn from change processes that occur during program
     delivery that often seem complex and opaque because they
     involve multiple actors and address large development problems.
     An outcome is what each social actor (or change agent) did,
     or is doing, that reflects a significant change in their behavior,
     relationships, activities, actions, policies or practice. The program
     may influence these changes, directly or indirectly, partially or
     wholly, intended or not. Outcomes are identified at two levels
     in relation to the goal: institutional changes relate to societal,
     policy and organizational changes; and learning/capacity changes
     relate to awareness, knowledge or skills, collaborative action, or
     the use of knowledge or innovative solutions. These levels are
     based on the Capacity Development and Results Framework.
     The framework provides a systematic yet flexible approach
     to designing capacity development strategies and programs,
     monitoring and adaptively managing interventions, and
     evaluating and learning from their results.
     2 Outcome harvesting is a practical assessment tool from the

     outcome mapping community of practice. It can be used for
     real-time monitoring and evidence gathering from complex
     development processes that involve multiple stakeholders. It
     is based on a similar concept of locally driven change from the
     Capacity Development and Results Framework. The tool was
     customized to gather information on outcomes—and related
     outputs and milestones—to learn from what changed, for whom,
     when and where, the significance of the change and how the
     program contributed to each change.
     3 Changeagents are leaders, groups or organizations from
     government or non-state that drive change..
     4 Change strategy refers to how change happened to advance

     progress toward the development objectives—the development
     problems addressed, types of outcomes achieved, WBI
     contributions, and partners involved. A change strategy may
     include different types of change processes or outcome areas
     depending on the complexity of the multi-actor institutional
     changes involved in a program.
     5 The numbers in brackets correspond to the outcomes in

     Figure 1. The text that usually follows each outcome refers to its
     significance. The process of change the outcomes represent is
     seen in Figure 2.

        substantiation of outcomes
        To verify the accuracy of the outcomes mapped and enrich WBI’s understanding of them, the external consultant
        selected four outcomes [6, 7, 11 and 17] and asked 9 people independent of WBI but knowledgeable about the
        change to review each and record whether they agree with the outcome as described. 7 people responded. 6 fully
        agreed with the description as formulated of the outcome, 6 with its significance and all 7 with the contribution of
        WBI. Excerpts of substantiators’ comments on the outcomes achieved:

           “This is particularly important for a professional organization like UPSC that the knowledge is appropriately
           delivered to related decision-makers. We hope this online course can be a catalyst for mayors in China to
           learn more about urban issues and planning.”

           “I hope that this collaboration will demonstrate that wholesaling is a viable approach for e-Institute
           programs and that this will be replicated with other courses in both China and other countries.”

           “The jointly developed course not only helped CAG enrich its curriculum, but also enhanced the awareness
           of eLearning as an important training channel for civil servants.”

     NOTES
     1 Mapping outcomes—and related outputs and milestones—can
     help us learn from change processes that occur during program
     delivery that often seem complex and opaque because they
     involve multiple actors and address large development problems.
     An outcome is what each social actor (or change agent) did,
     or is doing, that reflects a significant change in their behavior,
     relationships, activities, actions, policies or practice. The program

   six fully agreed with the outcomes’ significance as stated. The respondents provided additional information to
   clarify the outcomes’ description and WBI’s contribution. Excerpts of substantiators’ comments on the outcomes
   achieved:

      “From the interaction with the Kenyans, CMS’ emphasis of the citizen role really echoed and broadened the
      awareness of the government representatives on this possibility.”

      “As CMS coordinator and getting related educational information released by DepEd schools, I was able to
      gain insights on the local issues in public schools in Bacolod City as evidenced in its physical facilities and
      resources, as well as direct responses from various relevant stakeholders.”

      “The interest to replicate CMS is definitely a good indicator of the government’s openness. It would be
      great if this will also move to other departments/ministries of Kenya. Certainly, there are some research that
      needs to be done to tailor CMS in the Kenyan context.”             —Jecel Censoro, Project Coordinator, CMS

NOTES

1 Mapping outcomes—and related outputs and milestones—can

help us learn from change processes that occur during program
delivery that often seem complex and opaque because they
involve multiple actors and address large development problems.
An outcome is what each social actor (or change agent) did,
or is doing, that reflects a significant change in their behavior,
relationships, activities, actions, policies or practice. The program
may influence these changes, directly or indirectly, partially or
wholly, intended or not. Outcomes are identified at two levels
in relation to the goal: institutional changes relate to societal,
policy and organizational changes; and learning/capacity changes
relate to awareness, knowledge or skills, collaborative action, or
the use of knowledge or innovative solutions. These levels are
based on the Capacity Development and Results Framework.
The framework provides a systematic yet flexible approach
to designing capacity development strategies and programs,
monitoring and adaptively managing interventions, and
evaluating and learning from their results.

      Outcome harvesting offers innovative, participatory tools to understand
      and document how change happens in complex development programs
      that involve multiple social actors, areas of new learning and profound
      development challenges.

      Understanding and interpreting outcomes is important to improve
      results for development programs—it can facilitate strategic, systematic
      knowledge sharing and management; provide information that can be
      combined with other sources to review results within a task team and
      with clients and partners; and supply new evidence on implementation,
      outcomes, and indicators to inform program development.

      In these pilot experiences, teams applied outcome harvesting tools in 10
      ongoing initiatives in strategic thematic areas. The process encouraged
      dialogue among the teams and clients and answered learning questions
      to maximize the benefits of the interventions, institutional sustainability of
      results, and involvement of the right mix of actors.
