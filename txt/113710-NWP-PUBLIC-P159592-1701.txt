Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the humanitarian response led by the
Government of Fiji following Tropical Cyclone Winston, and looks specifically at the role the
social protection system played in disaster response, as well as complementing the
humanitarian relief efforts. The safety net system or social assistance programs, were scaled
up to provide relief to the most vulnerable, in the form of cash transfer top-up payments.
While the national social protection system was used to channel humanitarian relief in the
form of cash vouchers to the affected families. The interplay between the social protection
and humanitarian assistance efforts in Fiji, presents a compelling case for synchronizing and
complementing relief efforts in the future. And, a set of recommendations have been put
forward for consideration, for strengthening future disaster responsive social protection.

Executive Summary


This discussion paper presents an analysis of the humanitarian response following Tropical
Cyclone (TC) Winston, and looks specifically at the role social protection played in
improving disaster response and complementing the humanitarian assistance effort in Fiji.
The paper also explores the changing landscape of social protection following TC Winston and
documents some of the key achievements and challenges faced in the response period.
Furthermore, a list of recommendations has been put together for further discussion on
future disaster responsive social protection.


Tropical Cyclone (TC) Winston, an extremely destructive Category 5 cyclone, struck Fiji on
February 20th 2016, causing widespread damage and destruction and reportedly impacting
over 540,000 people, or 60 percent of the total population of Fiji. The government estimates
the value of disaster effects arising from TC Winston to amount to F$2 billion (US$0.9 billion),
which is more than 20 percent of current GDP, and can be broken down to include F$1.29
billion (US$0.6 billion) in damage (i.e., destroyed physical assets) and F$0.71 billion (US$0.3
billion) in losses (i.e., changes in the economic flows of the production of goods and services).


In the wake of TC Winston, a state of natural disaster was declared by the Government of
Fiji on February 20th, 2016 followed by a state of emergency. Since then the government has
successfully led all humanitarian response efforts, coordinated through the nine national
humanitarian clusters2 led by the government ministries, and received strong support from
the humanitarian partners, international and national non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), foreign governments, donors and civil society. The government was quick to set into
motion the humanitarian response framework necessary for initiating and coordinating
humanitarian assistance.


2
 The national humanitarian clusters are: Communications; Education; Food Security and Livelihoods; Health
and Nutrition; Logistics; Public Works and Utilities; Shelter; Safety and Protection; and WASH.



                                                     3
The government has received approximately US$33.4 million in humanitarian assistance
for TC Winston. Of the total US$33.4 million, US$21.5 million is against the UN Flash Appeal
and ear marked for the response plan, while the remaining US$13.6 million is unmarked
funding. Approximately 56 percent of the funding of the UN Flash Appeal has been met,
making TC Winston the best funded emergency response in the world for the year 2016, with
generous donations from Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Germany, Belgium,
Lithuania, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States and the United Nations Central
Emergency Response Fund (UNOCHA, 2016). Of the total funding received under the Flash
Appeal, approximately 60 percent went to projects implemented by the government.


As of early April 2016, approximately F$10 million (US$4.7 million) emergency relief
supplies in the form of food rations have been distributed by the government through the
National Disaster Management Office to the families in the affected areas, completing the
first round of assistance. It is estimated that around 370,000 people were reached through
the first round of food assistance (UNOCHA, 2016). The government, in collaboration with
the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, has also provided an estimated 45,000 farmers
with seeds and seedlings, and 14,000 fishermen with fishery assets, in affected areas to
ensure longer term food security as crops are being replanted. Emergency food assistance
through vouchers has been provided to an estimated 82,000 people using the government’s
social assistance system.


The humanitarian response to TC Winston was quick and led effectively by the government.
Some of the response strategies implemented were very unique, not only to the country but
also to the region, and can contribute significantly to the existing literature on disaster risk
management. Some of the broader achievements of the TC Winston response and some of
the challenges and constraints faced in its implementation are as follows:




                                               4
Achievements
   •   The humanitarian response successfully leveraged and built upon the existing national
       systems in place in Fiji.
   •   There was a complementary overlap between humanitarian assistance and social
       protection interventions for disaster response.
   •   The Humanitarian response made wide use of cash and voucher payments, which is a
       relatively new model for the Pacific.
   •   Complex logistical support provided through strong civil-military cooperation enabled
       emergency relief across many isolated islands.
   •   The National Cluster System was put to the test for the first time during TC Winston
       and proved effective in its ability to coordinate response at the national level and work
       with all humanitarian actors.
   •   There was fast deployment of emergency relief following TC Winston due to strong
       institutional capacity of the government.


Challenges and Constraints
   •   Despite the overall success of the funding drive for the Humanitarian Flash Appeal,
       several key clusters were left poorly funded.
   •   The lack of visibility over bilateral donations limited the ability of some clusters to
       coordinate and monitor progress towards meeting needs.
   •   There is a need to strengthen the social assistance database to include near-poor
       families and allow for geographical targeting in future disasters.
   •   Adverse weather and logistical challenges in reaching some of the country’s highlands
       and outer islands posed a challenge for the government and humanitarian actors in
       relief efforts.
   •   Absence of good quality baseline data affected the ability of many clusters in making
       rapid assessment of the total population affected and damages incurred and
       providing adequate relief accordingly.



                                                5
    •    The Agriculture sector, which was the worst hit by TC Winston, was further impacted
         by TC Zena in April 2016. This caused widespread flooding of key horticultural areas
         of Fiji, destroying up to 80 percent of ongoing rehabilitation work.


Following TC Winston, the Government implemented a number of disaster responsive
social protection programs, which have translated into an injection of approximately
F$344.7 million (US$160 million) into the economy. In the immediate relief period following
TC Winston, the government committed to a range of social protection programs, which are
estimated to have impacted the lives of more than 170,000 families (Table 1).

Four weeks into the disaster, the Government disbursed F $19.9 million (US$9.4 million)
using the existing social assistance schemes to efficiently disburse cash to vulnerable
groups and inject much needed cash into the economy. The cash top-up payments were
intended to help people meet immediate expenses following TC Winston and were provided
to all existing beneficiaries, irrespective of whether they resided in the affected areas or not.
A follow-up food voucher payment of F $4.6 million (US$2.1 million) for two months
(May/June 2016) to the social assistance recipients was developed by the government and is
a good example of how humanitarian assistance and social protection mechanisms have
jointly been used by the government for disaster response. The humanitarian assistance
received for food security has also been implemented through the governments existing


                                                     6
framework of social assistance. The government announced the roll-out of a F$70 million
(US$32.6 million) Housing Program, or “Help for Homes” initiative, which is designed to assist
families to rebuild homes that were damaged or destroyed by providing them with vouchers.


The Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) disbursed approximately F$250.2 million (US$116.4
million) to its members in the first two months following TC Winston. The Fiji National
Provident Fund (FNPF), the largest social insurance program in the country, allowed affected
members to withdraw cash nine days after TC Winston, resulting in a significant injection of
cash into the economy. However, this withdrawal may have a long term impact on members
as they will receive reduced pensions in the future, and many will likely not be able to access
any further funds in case of future emergencies.


The government anticipates a 33 percent increase in the number of families requiring social
assistance in the wake of TC Winston and estimates a F$7 million medium term recovery
budget for the expansion of the existing social protection programs. The cyclone is expected
to have impacted the most impoverished strata of the country and the possibility of people
sinking into deeper poverty or more people becoming poor following TC Winston is a distinct
possibility. As a result, the government has estimated a F$7 million (US$3.3 million) medium
term recovery budget until mid-2018 for the expansion of the social protection programs in
Fiji following TC Winston.


Moving forward the government is in an opportune position to reflect upon its response to
TC Winston and refine its Social Protection Policy Framework to include disaster response
for future emergencies. The government has been actively reviewing and refining its social
protection programs in Fiji through reforms aimed at increasing the coverage and
effectiveness of its operations. It has also been learning from its past disasters and has
incorporated many recommendations from TC Evan into its response for TC Winston. In view
of the government’s effective and timely response to TC Winston, the institutionalization of
a Disaster Responsive Social Protection framework for Fiji would further help to refine the


                                              7
response strategies and streamline technical details, such as targeting, payments, and
budgeting to be better prepared for similar natural disasters in the future.


Based on the experiences of TC Winston and the lessons learnt, the following
recommendations can be put forward for the Government’s consideration moving forward,
for a stronger and resilient disaster response framework.


   •   Develop an institutionalized (formal) Social Protection Policy Framework, with an
       embedded disaster responsive component.
   •   Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) and guidelines for disaster
       responsive social protection.
   •   Establish a coordination mechanism for cash transfer interventions in times of
       disaster.
   •   Consolidate and centralize the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS) database so that both
       poor and near-poor households can be targeted in times of disaster.
   •   Complement humanitarian assistance with both in-kind and cash assistance, based on
       access and functionality of local markets.
   •   Develop a Post-Disaster Communication Plan.
   •   Explore options for Disaster Risk Financing in Fiji.

     I.    Country Overview


Fiji is one of the largest and most developed of the Pacific Island Countries (PIC) and serves
geographically and economically as the centre of the Pacific. Fiji is an archipelago of 332
islands (of which approximately 110 are inhabited), and is spread over a land area of
approximately 18,300km2 and a geographic area of almost 50,000km2. The country has a
population of approximately 865,000 3 people, with the majority of people residing primarily
on the two largest islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Fiji is the second-largest country in the
region after Papua New Guinea, and one of the wealthiest in the Pacific, with a gross domestic
product (GDP) of US$4.53 billion and a gross national income (GNI) of US$4,870 per capita 4.
Fiji’s economic growth has been strong in recent years, reaching 3.6 percent in 2013, 5.3
percent in 2014, and an estimated 4 percent in 2015, which is significantly above the average
of 2 percent for the period 1980–2012. This has been a result of strong credit growth, buoyant
remittances, and improved labour market conditions which have boosted consumer demand.
Furthermore, tourism and government spending on infrastructure has also supported the
strong growth momentum. The economy is primarily based on agriculture, sugar, and
tourism, with tourism being the largest foreign exchange earner over the years.


Fiji is highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters and experiences one
cyclone per year on average. Fiji is located in the tropical cyclone belt and experiences
frequent tropical cyclones characterized by damaging winds, rain, and storm surge. It is
situated in a relatively quiet seismic area, but is surrounded by the Pacific Ring of Fire, which
aligns with the boundaries of the tectonic plates and is associated with extreme seismic
activity, volcanic activity, large earthquakes, and tsunamis. Additionally, it suffers from
extreme events associated with climate change, such as sea-level rise, temperature extremes
and droughts. The country experiences on average one cyclone per year, and since 1980 the

various disasters have resulted in average annual economic damages of around F$35 million
(US$16.3 million) and impacted the lives of around 40,000 people each year (Government of
Fiji, 2016). Due to the increasing incidence of global disasters, it is expected that Fiji will incur,
on average, F$158 million (US$85 million) per year in losses due to earthquakes and tropical
cyclones. In the next 50 years, Fiji has a 50 percent chance of experiencing a loss exceeding
F$1.5 billion (US$806 million), and a 10 percent chance of experiencing a loss exceeding F$3
billion (US$1.6 billion) 5, however these figures may be worse once the impacts of climate
change are taken into consideration.


The country has fairly strong human development indicators. Life expectancy at birth is 69.6
years (73 for women and 67 for men), and the adult literacy rate is 93.7 percent (UNDP, 2014).
Enrolment in primary education is almost universal, with a primary net enrolment rate of 96.8
percent, which is well above the Pacific average of 86.4 percent. Net enrolment in secondary
education, at 80.3 percent, is the highest in the Pacific. Fiji is facing stagnant progress in some
of its health indicators, with infant and child mortality rates being high at around 13 and 24
per 1000 births, respectively, compared to the MDG targets of 6 and 9. The maternal
mortality rate is at around 32 per 100,000 births, against the target of 10 (WHO, 2011). Access
to improved drinking water source is to about 95.7 percent of population and access to
improved sanitation facilities is to about 91.1 percent of the population.6


Poverty in Fiji is generally defined as hardship and instances of extreme poverty are very
rare. Due to the country’s reliance on community-based agricultural and fishing traditions
and the presence of strong traditional support networks, which allow for individuals to be
cared for within the community, poverty in Fiji is defined as hardship. This means having a

Although extreme poverty is rare in Fiji, 28 percent of Fijians live below the basic-needs
poverty line (equivalent to US$3.10 a day). 8 Preliminary estimates from the 2013/14
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), show a decline in the proportion of the
population living below the basic-needs poverty line to 28.1 percent, from 31 percent in the
2008/09 HIES. 9 Within that overall trend, rural poverty – which is much higher than urban
poverty – fell from 43 percent to 36.7 percent, and urban poverty rose from 18 percent to
19.8 percent (Figure 1). Poverty rates are highest in the Northern and Eastern Divisions, at
47.9 percent and 40.0 percent respectively (the areas worst hit by TC Winston). The Central
Division, with its large informal settlements around the capital Suva, has the highest number
of people living in poverty (Table 2). Gender disaggregated poverty data is not yet available

from the 2013/14 HIES, but World Bank analysis of the 2008/09 HIES showed that female-
headed households were less likely to be in poverty than male-headed households (World
Bank, 2011). Inequality appears to have decreased between the 2008/09 HIES and 2013/14
HIES, with the income share of the top three deciles falling and that of the bottom seven
deciles rising between the surveys. Inequality is significantly higher in urban areas, than in
rural areas.

Fiji has a low official unemployment rate (6.2 percent), but a high dependence on informal
sector employment and subsistence activities. The labour force participation rate in Fiji is 59
per cent (Table 3), which is relatively low for Pacific Island countries where the regional
average is 65.6 per cent (ILO, 2016). The rate is primarily driven down by low female
participation, which at 41.6 per cent compared to male participation of 75.8 percent.
According to 2010/11 estimates, around 44.2 percent of employment is based in the
agriculture sector, 14.3 percent in industry and 41.6 percent in services, of which nearly 50

percent of the employed are in paid positions, 26.1 per cent in a mix of paid and subsistence
work, and the remaining 24 per cent in subsistence activities. In the agricultural sector, 51.2
per cent of all employment is solely on a subsistence level (ADB and ILO, 2015). Additionally,
around 60 percent of Fiji’s workers are in informal employment and not contributing to the
Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF).

 II.      Fiji’s Social Protection System


Over the years Fiji has demonstrated a strong commitment of providing social assistance to
its vulnerable populations struggling to meet their basic needs. The Department of Social
Welfare (DSW), under the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MWCPA), is
the lead agency for social assistance in Fiji and administers Fiji’s core programs. Historically,
it has focused on four major programs consisting of the Family Assistance Program (FAP),
Care and Protection (C&P) allowance, Food Voucher Program (FVP) and the Free Bus Fare
Program (FBFP). In 2010, these four programs represented the core of the social assistance
provided in Fiji, with a combined budget amounting to F$ 39 million, or 0.6 percent of GDP




                                                     13
(World Bank, 2016). Formal sector workers have also historically been covered through the
Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF).


A rigorous reform process of the social protection system was undertaken by the
government from 2010-2011, through extensive technical assistance (TA) provided by the
World Bank, 10 which resulted in key reforms and an expansion of the existing social assistance
programs. The new system was rolled out in 2013, with the Family Assistance Program being
replaced by the improved Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS), which targeted the poorest 10
percent of households in Fiji compared to the earlier 3 percent. In addition, the Social Pension
Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide social pensions to elderly people (age 70+) who fell
outside the coverage of the FNPF or other social assistance programs. The FNPF was also
scrutinised and reforms undertaken to tighten the rules and regulations governing the various
schemes and its long-run sustainability.


Developing systems for poverty targeting, data administration and beneficiary payments.
The SP reforms process of 2010-11 essentially focused on expanding the overall coverage and
further improving targeting under the social assistance programs, especially the PBS. Under
the PBS, an objectively verifiable targeting methodology was introduced using poverty means
testing (PMT) to establish the poverty threshold for the program and its beneficiaries. As a
self-reporting process, households apply for the PBS and are evaluated for eligibility by the
Department of the Social Welfare. However, the benefit is only awarded to those households
which have a welfare status falling below the poverty threshold. This is currently set at
approximately the bottom 10 percent of the welfare distribution. The “near-poor”
households (those whose welfare score is low, but still above the program’s threshold) are
not given a benefit. Yet, the full information set is collected for all households that ask to be
evaluated for eligibility. At present, regional databases exist for all active PBS beneficiaries,


10
    The key objectives of the TA were to: (i) improve the design, and, ultimately, coverage and targeting, of the
social assistance programs; (ii) introduce new social assistance programs targeting specific vulnerable groups;
(iii) improve operational processes and practices for determination of eligibility and delivery of social transfers.



                                                        14
however, there is yet to be a consolidated centralized database for the program.
Furthermore, the records of the “near poor” households are available on paper with the
regional offices but have not been converted electronically and are not part of the existing
database. However, this does not take away from the fact that Fiji has a robust poverty
registry in place for PBS. In addition, the DSW also maintains separate databases for each of
its other social assistance programs, ensuring that a rich repository of information is available
on the poor in Fiji. Lastly, in the past few years, DSW has transitioned its beneficiaries to
electronic welfare payments, with the majority now receiving their payments through the
formal banking system and only a small percentage, in remote areas, still receiving their
payments through the post office.


Since 2012, the government has allocated more than F $30 million (US$14 million) annually
from the national budget to the four major social protection programs (Government of Fiji,
2016). The core programs are the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS), Care and Protection Scheme
(CPS), and the Social Pension Scheme (SPS), inbuilt with a Food Voucher Program (FVP) and
the Free Bus Fare Program (FBFP). The PBS provides the benefit of F$ 30 per person to up to
4 household members, plus a food voucher of F$ 50. The program currently benefits 23,035
families and has an annual budget of F$ 22 million (US$10.2 million) (Table 4/5). The SPS is
targeted towards elderly people aged 68 years 11 and above, who are outside of the FNPF or
other social assistance coverage, and provides the benefit of F$50 per beneficiary. The
program currently benefits 17,782 individuals and has an annual budget of F$8 million
(US$3.7 million). The CPS targets vulnerable households with children belonging to the
following categories: single parents, deserted spouses, death of breadwinner, and prisoner’s
dependents. Since the introduction of the PBS in 2013, a significant number of cases have
been transferred from the CPS to PBS, and this process continues. The benefit level depends
on the number of children and their age (school grade they are attending), and cannot exceed


11
  The age for the SPS beneficiaries has been reduced to 66 years following the start of the new financial year in
July 2016.




                                                       15
F$110 per household, plus a food voucher of F$ 50. The CPS currently benefits 3,313 families
and has an annual budget of F$2 million (US$0.9 million). In 2014, the Food Voucher Program
(FVP) for pregnant women in rural areas was introduced with an aim to reduce the incidence
of malnutrition (especially anemia) and complications during pregnancy. The program, in
2015, benefitted 4,221 rural pregnant mothers from a $1million budget allocation. The
government has invested more than F $30 million (US$14 million) annually in the four core
social protection programs since the reforms in 2012 (Figure 2).

Since 2009, the government has steadily increased investment in its social protection
portfolio. There has been a significant increase in the amount of funding from F$20.4 million
(US$9.5 million) in 2009 to F $33 million (US$15.3 million) in 2015 (Table 4). The number of
families taking advantage of the programs has also increased, from 23,332 families in 2011
to 43,897 in 2016 (Table 5). The country is still heavily reliant on its social assistance programs.

In the wake of Tropical Cyclone Winston, Fiji has become a pioneer in the provision of
disaster responsive social protection in the Pacific. With a relatively strong social protection
system already in place, Fiji decided to use its existing social protection schemes to provide
additional assistance to poor and vulnerable households, as part of its disaster response
(discussed in detail in later chapters). As a result, the social protection system of Fiji has been
rigorously tested in the face of TC Winston and has come out strong in terms of its ability to
both rapidly respond and disburse cash assistance to affected families, and use its existing
systems for channelling other humanitarian relief efforts.

III.   Impact of Tropical Cyclone Winston


Tropical Cyclone (TC) Winston, an extremely destructive Category 5 cyclone, struck Fiji on
20th February 2016. It was the first Category 5 cyclone to directly impact Fiji, with maximum
average wind speeds reaching 233km/hour and wind gusts peaking at around 306km/hour,
making it one of the most powerful cyclones ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere
(Government of Fiji, 2016). The Eastern Division of Fiji was the first to be hit by Winston and
severely damaged the Islands of Koro, Ovalau and Taveuni, also damaging other Island’s
within its path before reaching its peak strength and making landfall on Viti Levu (Northern
part) and Vanua Levu (Southern part) (Figure 3). In addition to the extreme wind speeds,
storm surges led to flooding in many islands, and in some cases, inundated areas almost 200
meters inland.

                                                    18
In its wake, TC Winston caused widespread damage and destruction and reportedly
impacted over 540,000 people, or 60 percent of the total population of Fiji. TC Winston
caused 44 fatalities and around 40,000 people required immediate assistance.12
Consequently, over 30,000 houses, 500 schools, and 88 health clinics and medical facilities
were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 80 percent of the nation’s population lost power,
including the entire island of Vanua Levu. TC Winston affected approximately 540,400 people
or 62 percent of the national population of Fiji (estimated at 865,611)13, with the largest
affected population being in the Western division, and followed by the Central, the Northern
and the Eastern divisions (Table 6). In terms of livelihoods affected, 57 percent relate to the
agricultural sector, 17 percent to commerce, 10 percent to manufacturing, and 8 percent to
tourism and transportation equally.

 Box 1. The impact of TC Winston at the Village Level

 The village of Bureiwai was one of many villages severely affected by TC Winston. A vibrant
 community, with farming and fishing as its main source of livelihood, the effects of the cyclone have
 been devastating here. There has been extensive damage to property, with only one house standing
 in the entire village, and loss of income. Nearly all the villagers have lost their boats and fishing gear
 due to the tidal waves, and have limited access to their agricultural farmlands (fallen trees and soil
 erosion) following the cyclone. The cyclone also damaged the fences securing the livestock due to
 which some escaped while others entered the village and further damaged the village.

 Impacts: The community is now engaged in daily subsistence activities with the women fishing on
 the shores for everyday survival. They are now eating less (only 2 meals a day) and steadily running
 out of the initial food relief supplies. The community is facing psychological trauma due to the
 cyclone, especially elders and children, who were identified as the most vulnerable groups. They
 have also not received any power since the cyclone as the village generator got damaged.

 Immediate Needs: Rebuilding houses, fishing gears, boats, seedlings (short term crops), farming
 equipment (for clean-up and preparing of land for planting), rebuilding fencing, solar power lights,
 and psychological counselling.

 Central Division of Fiji, had been affected by the disaster, while looking specifically at their changing livelihoods, coping
 strategies, and their immediate needs.


The government estimates the value of disaster effects arising from TC Winston to amount
to F$2 billion (US$0.9 billion), which is more than 20 percent of current GDP. The value of
disaster effects and can be broken down to include F$1.29 billion (US$0.6 billion) in damage
(i.e., destroyed physical assets) and F$0.71 billion (US$0.3 billion) in losses (i.e., changes in
the economic flows of the production of goods and services) 15 (Table 7). The individual
sectors that sustained the greatest damage were housing, accounting for 58 percent of total
damage costs, followed by transport, accounting for 10 percent of all damage. While, the
highest level of production losses was sustained in the agriculture sector and were estimated
at 65 percent of total losses. The housing sector suffered the highest total effects from TC
Winston (including both damage and losses), accounting for 39 percent of the total. Damage

TC Winston is expected to reduce economic growth to 1.3 percent in 2016 compared to the
pre-cyclone estimate of 3.8 percent. The extent of damage incurred by TC Winston to key
sectors, such as housing, transport, manufacturing, agriculture, electricity, communications



                                                    21
and environment, are expected to significantly impact upon the macroeconomic climate of
Fiji. In the agriculture sector, the cyclone’s impact on sugar cane production is expected to be
significant with production expected to fall to around 1.4 million tonnes this year, compared
to 1.8 million tonnes in 2015. The cyclone is estimated to reduce economic growth to 1.3
percent in 2016 compared to the pre-cyclone estimate of 3.8 percent (Figure 4). However,
the government anticipates that if timely recovery and reconstruction activities are started
in 2016 than it is estimated to boost GDP back up to 2.4 percent.16

The government has identified a Recovery Program for TC Winston estimated at F $731
million (US$340 million) for the period covering mid-2016 to mid-2018. The government has
identified key priority needs for TC Winston based on the needs identified through the
humanitarian response, early recovery activities and the PDNA process. The Recovery
Program is estimated at F $731 million (US$340 million) and covers the medium-term

recovery and reconstruction activities over a 2-year period, from mid-2016 to mid-2018, to
be run in parallel with the ongoing short-term humanitarian assistance (Government of Fiji,
2016a). The government plans to allocate F $136 million (US$63.3 million) from its own
resources, donor support is approximately F $22 million (US$10.2 million), and there is a
financing gap of approximately F $575 million (US$267.4 million) which needs to urgently be
addressed (Table 8). In recognition of the long-term nature of recovery and reconstruction,
recovery efforts beyond two years will be integrated into Fiji’s National Development Plan.

 IV.      Humanitarian Response to TC Winston


A state of natural disaster was declared by the Government of Fiji on February 20, 2016
followed by a state of emergency, preceding the devastation caused by TC Winston. Since
then the government has successfully led all humanitarian response efforts, coordinated
through the nine national humanitarian clusters17 led by the government ministries, and
received strong support from the humanitarian partners, international and national non-


17
  The national humanitarian clusters are: Communications; Education; Food Security and Livelihoods; Health
and Nutrition; Logistics; Public Works and Utilities; Shelter; Safety and Protection; and WASH.



                                                      23
governmental organizations (NGOs), foreign governments, donors and civil society. The
government was quick to set into motion the humanitarian response framework necessary
for initiating and coordinating humanitarian assistance.



        4.1 Humanitarian Response Structure


The overall coordination of the emergency response was the responsibility of the Ministry
of Rural and Maritime Development and the National Disaster Management Office based
on the National Disaster Management Plan 1995 and the National Disaster Management Act
1998. The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) immediately activated the National
Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) the day after TC Winston, so that the District
Emergency Operations Centres could start mobilizing and deploying their teams for
undertaking the initial damage assessments (IDA). The IDA’s were the government
preliminary assessments to warrant the need for immediate food relief distributions, and
moving forward to shape the agriculture and housing relief plans. A State of Natural Disaster
was declared for 30 days in recognition of the enormity of the disaster and the government
straightaway requested for international assistance. Moreover, for TC Winston the
government also designated the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) within the Ministry of
Finance, National Planning and Statistics to provide leadership and coordination for recovery
implementation.


The humanitarian response was coordinated through the National Cluster System, which
was first introduced at the time of TC Evan in December 2012. The Clusters are joint
coordination forums with representation from all the agencies involved in that sector. Each
Cluster is led by a Government Ministry, with an international agency as Co-lead 18. The nine



18
  Government coordination of international assistance is also supported by the Pacific Humanitarian Team
(PHT), a regional network of partners that supports governments in delivering effective, appropriate, timely and
coordinated disaster preparedness, response and recovery.



                                                      24
national clusters are: Communications; Education; Food Security and Livelihoods; Health and
Nutrition; Logistics; Public Works and Utilities; Shelter; Safety and Protection; and WASH. The
government activated the National Clusters two days after TC Winston hit, with the NDMO
clearly indicating that the clusters would be identifying needs and working in cooperation
with international partners to ensure gaps were covered. UNOCHA assisted in coordination
between the NDMO and international humanitarian partners. It is worth mentioning here
that the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation is leading the Safety and
Protection Cluster with support from UN Women and UNICEF.


Immediate emergency assistance activities were undertaken through Civil-Military
Coordination. Immediate emergency efforts were supported through military logistical
assistance provided primarily from Australia and New Zealand, and additional support from
France, India, and Indonesia, which enabled rapid deployment of equipment, personnel and
supplies to affected areas. Straight after TC Winston, aerial surveillance of the affected
regions was conducted using the New Zealand Defence Force P3 Orion aircraft to assess the
level of damage, and the sea and air access to maritime areas. During this time the Australian
military helicopters were also on standby for deployment to assist with further surveillance,
medical evacuation or distribution of relief goods.


The GOF and the United Nations jointly launched an emergency humanitarian Flash Appeal
on 4th March, seeking US$38.6 million for the first three months of the TC Winston
response. The needs identified were for the provision of emergency shelter, access to health,
water and sanitation, food and livelihood support, access to education and rehabilitation of
schools, and protection and support to vulnerable groups. The Flash Appeal period ended on
21 May 2016 with 51 percent (US$19.8 million) of requested funding received, making the TC
Winston Appeal the best funded emergency response for the year, receiving generous
donations from Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Germany, Belgium, Lithuania,
New Zealand, Sweden, the United States and the United Nations Central Emergency
Response Fund (UNOCHA, 2016). The response was coordinated at the national level through


                                              25
the Cluster System. The "Flash Appeal" followed the structure of the Government-led Cluster
system, with specific projects submitted and approved by Government leads under each
Cluster.


A Government-led Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) was conducted between
March/April 2016, to assess the socioeconomic impact of TC Winston and assist in the
mobilization of resources for recovery and reconstruction. The PDNA process was supported
by donor agencies who provided their technical expertise, with the World Bank leading the
process followed by the European Union and United Nations (UN), as well as other regional
organizations and bilateral partners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the
government of Australia, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Secretariat
of the Pacific Regional Environmental Program. The PDNA estimates the total damage and
losses as a result of the disaster to stand at F$ 1.98 billion 19. Of this, F$1.28 billion is classified
as damage (i.e. destroyed physical assets), and F$ 0.70 billion as loss (i.e., changes in the
economic flows of the production of goods and services). The combined damage and losses
are about 20 percent of Fiji’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015.



           4.2 Relief Efforts


Strong civil-military and donor coordination led to the fast deployment of relief assistance
in the first few weeks of TC Winston. Based on the aerial surveillance by the New Zealand
Defence Force P3 Orion aircraft, extensive damage was revealed to the outer islands,
particularly in the Lomaiviti group and the north coast of Viti Levu. The government and
humanitarian partners worked closely through the national cluster system to quickly dispatch
urgent supplies and assessment teams to the affected areas. Within days the government
deployed vessels to the Koro Island which had suffered the most damage, with a range of
supplies including food, WASH kits and temporary classrooms, and assessment teams. The

19
     This figure does not include the effects of the damage on the environment sector.



                                                        26
Australian military helicopters already on standby were also deployed to affected areas with
relief supplies for 1500 families as part of an initial A$5 million assistance package (UNOCHA,
2016a). The New Zealand aid initially totaled N$2 million and an emergency flight carrying 12
tonnes of supplies requested by the Fijian Government arrived on 22 February 2016 (as part
of a daily schedule which ran through until 28th February), carrying water containers,
tarpaulins, generators, chainsaws, tool kits and a response team (UNOCHA, 2016b). France
also donated the use of military aircrafts which arrived in late February from New Caledonia,
loaded with almost 12 tonnes of shelter and WASH supplies amongst other relief items
(UNOCHA, 2016c). Furthermore, the Fiji Red Cross already had 22 prepositioned containers
with supplies for 100 families per container including blankets, tarpaulins, kitchen sets,
clothing, hygiene kits, dignity kits, and cleaning kits. The Health and Nutrition cluster also
reported sufficient medical supplies already in-country, including Inter-Agency emergency
health kits for approximately 10,000 people or more for 3 months, and water purifying tablets
(UNOCHA, 2016a). Lastly, the Fijian business community consisting of at least 60 Fijian
companies had given combined contributions of in-kind relief and financial donations worth
of approximately US $1.2 million as of 1st March (UNOCHA, 2016c). This is perhaps one of the
fastest deployment efforts by any government in response to a disaster


Strong institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms were already in place in
Fiji. The government was able to carry out quick deployment efforts in the affected areas, in
part because of the strong institutional arrangements already in existence in the country,
such as the NDMO coordinating the on-ground relief efforts and assessments, military
coordination through the Royal Fiji Forces, and donor coordination through the national
cluster system. The government led all the humanitarian response efforts. The presence of
pre-positioned relief supplies already in country also made it possible for the government to
rapidly roll-out relief supplies in the most affected regions. All humanitarian funding for TC
Winston was either channeled through UNOCHA’s flash appeal or bilaterally to the Fiji
Government for needs prioritization, which enabled the government to strategically lead the
response efforts and eliminate duplication of relief efforts.


                                              27
As of early April 2016, approximately F$10 million (US$4.7 million) emergency relief
supplies in the form of food rations have been distributed by the government through the
National Disaster Management Office to the families in the affected areas, completing the
first round of assistance. It is estimated that around 370,000 people were reached through
the first round of food assistance (UNOCHA, 2016). The government, in collaboration with
the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, has also provided an estimated 45,000 farmers
with seeds and seedlings, and 14,000 fishermen with fishery assets, in affected areas to
ensure longer term food security as crops are being replanted.


Emergency food assistance through vouchers has been provided to an estimated 82,000
people using the government’s social assistance system. The WFP, key partner under the
Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, joined hands with the government to provide top-up
payments in the form of food vouchers to the poor families in the severely affected areas.
The food vouchers were designed to provide two months’ worth of food assistance to the
existing social assistance beneficiaries (PBS, SPS and CPA) residing in the 12 priority areas of
the government (also discussed under the chapter on Disaster Responsive Social Protection).
The distribution of the food voucher (month of May and June, 2016) was sequenced by the
government to immediately follow upon the trail of the social assistance top-up payments
which were provided for three months (February to April, 2016). WFP support demonstrates
the viability of linking the Fijian national social protection system with the timely and efficient
provision of humanitarian aid as a successful example of shock responsive social safety nets.


Within a month of TC Winston, 99 percent of the primary and secondary schools were
operational as a result of the collaboration between the government and the Education
Cluster. Schools were extensively damaged in the affected areas of TC Winston but with quick
relief efforts it is estimated that the needs of approximately 86,000 students enrolled in
almost 500 primary and secondary schools (55 percent) were met in the TC Winston affected
areas. The Education Cluster was also one of the highest funded (92 percent) clusters during
the response period.


                                                28
Furthermore, emergency shelter was provided to an estimated 28,000 households by the
government in collaboration with the Shelter Cluster. The emergency shelter included tents,
tarpaulins, shelter kits and shelter tools. Urgent medical services were provided through
mobile medical services to more than 82,000 persons in the affected area and 18,000 persons
were reached with psychological support. The Water Authority of Fiji and other partners
provided emergency water supplies to more than 244,000 people, which included delivery of
2.7 million liters of water to communities without access to piped water supply. In addition,
11 villages (belonging to Koro and Ra) were assisted, with 300 people engaged in Cash for
Work activities and 400 people engaged in debris clearance activities.



           4.3 Humanitarian Response Funding


The government received approximately US$35 million in humanitarian assistance for TC
Winston. Of the total US$35 million, US$21.5 million is against the UN Flash Appeal and ear
marked for the response plan, while the remaining US$13.6 million is unmarked funding
(Figure 5). 20 Approximately 56 percent of the funding of the UN Flash Appeal has been met, 21
making TC Winston the best funded emergency response in the world for this year (Figure 6),
with generous donations from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Belgium,
Lithuania, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States and the United Nations Central
Emergency Response Fund (UNOCHA 2016). Substantial bilateral funding was also provided
by donors to the Fijian Government. The major bilateral donors providing support – including
in kind support – to the relief and recovery effort have been Australia (US$27 million), New
Zealand (US$10.3 million) and the EU ($4.8 million) (World Bank, 2016).

Of the total funding received under the Flash Appeal, approximately 60 percent went to
projects implemented by the government. Despite the fact that the majority of funding was
received by the UN agencies (85 percent), there was a preference to engage local actors in
the implementation of projects. The distribution of project funding is as follows, with 58
percent funding going to government implemented projects, 8 percent to national NGOs, 14
percent to international NGOs, and 20 percent projects directly being implemented by UN
agencies.

 V.    Analysis of Humanitarian Response to TC Winston


TC Winston was one of the severest disasters to hit Fiji and left a trail of destruction in its
wake. The humanitarian response was quick and strongly led by the government. Some of
the response strategies implemented were very unique, not only to the country but also to
the region, and can contribute significantly to the existing literature on disaster risk
management. This section looks specifically at some of the broader achievements of the TC
Winston response and some of the challenges and constraints faced in its implementation.



       5.1 Achievements


The humanitarian response successfully leveraged and built upon the existing national
systems in place in Fiji. The TC Winston response saw a stronger engagement and role of the
government and national actors in humanitarian assistance compared to other disasters, with
nearly 60 percent of the total funding under the Flash Appeal going to government funded
project, and 8 percent going to national NGOs. There was a move to strengthen local capacity
and provide a localized response.


There was a complementary overlap between humanitarian assistance and social
protection interventions for disaster response. For the first time the existing social
protection framework of the government was used for disbursing humanitarian assistance in
the form of food vouchers. By providing top-up assistance to the existing social assistance
beneficiaries and using local vendors of the government, the humanitarian actors were saved
from engaging in costly procurement and logistical activities. As a result, the response was
more targeted and timely and is a good example of how humanitarian assistance and social
protection mechanisms can jointly be used by the government for disaster response.




                                              31
The Humanitarian response widely made use of cash and voucher payments, which is a
relatively new model for the Pacific. The government following TC Winston immediately
disbursed cash transfers under its social assistance system to provide immediate relief to its
most vulnerable populations. The cash payments were fast and efficient to make due to the
existing electronic payments system already in place in Fiji. Building upon the success of the
cash payments, the government opted to use the same framework for providing
humanitarian assistance against needs such as food and housing. Vouchers were deemed the
most appropriate instrument as they were easy to distribute like cash but limited in what
they could be used against (discussed in detail in following chapter).


Complex logistical support provided through strong civil-military cooperation enabled
emergency relief across many isolated islands. The cyclone cut off access to many of the
outer islands and even populations residing in the rural interior, hindering emergency
response efforts. Many of the humanitarian actors would not have had the capacity or
resources to carry out relief efforts without the support provided by the military.


The National Cluster System was put to the test for the first time during TC Winston and
proved quite effective in its ability to coordinate response at the national level and work
with all humanitarian actors. The National Cluster System which was instituted right after TC
Evan was tried for the first time in a disaster situation for TC Winston. The clusters were seen
to be firmly led by the government line Ministries and did a good job of coordinating
humanitarian response at the national level amongst all actors. Overall response efforts were
well coordinated and seldom showed any duplication. The government and humanitarian
actors were seen to be complementing existing efforts and structures rather than re-
inventing the wheel.


There was fast deployment of emergency relief following TC Winston due to strong
institutional capacity of the government. The government was seen to have strong
institutional capacity and systems in place for leading the humanitarian response; in the form


                                              32
of the NDMO coordinating all on-ground relief efforts and assessments, military coordination
through the Royal Fiji Forces, and donor coordination through the national cluster system.
The presence of pre-positioned relief supplies already in country also made it possible for the
government to rapidly roll-out relief supplies in the most affected regions through military
deployment. Furthermore, the government financed its initial relief and rehabilitation
expenditures by reallocating budgeted resources from lower-priority expenditures, allowing
the government to push ahead with relief operations without delay, while the humanitarian
and donor community organized themselves.



       5.2 Challenges and Constraints


Despite the overall high achievement of the Humanitarian Flash Appeal funding, several
key clusters were left poorly funded. The Shelter Cluster has only met 20 percent of its
funding requirements which has limited its ability to widely roll out its initiatives, such as the
technical training programs on building back safer homes and its direct support for the
construction of core shelters for the most vulnerable. Other clusters with low funding are the
Food Security and Livelihood Cluster (39 percent), and Health and Nutrition Cluster (53
percent).


The lack of visibility over bilateral donations limited the ability of some clusters to
coordinate and monitor progress towards meeting needs. For some clusters such as the
Food Security and Shelter cluster, there was a risk of potential duplication of response as the
clusters did not have sufficient information on the donation items and their distribution being
provided through bilateral donations. One of the factors contributing towards this lack of
visibility was the use of parallel reporting systems amongst some agencies, at the time of TC
Winston. For instance, UNOCHA was coordinating the 3W’s reporting structure for all
agencies, and consolidating and highlighting the donations being received. However, it was




                                               33
witnessed that certain bilateral donations, especially for military support were being reported
directly to the Government, although while still using the 3W’s reporting format.


There is a need to strengthen the social assistance database to include near-poor families
and allow for geographical targeting in future disasters. The government for the first time
used its existing social assistance system for delivering humanitarian assistance. While the
response was well targeted towards the poorest families who were part of the government’s
social assistance programs, they were not necessarily the only or most affected by the
disaster. The present system lacked the flexibility of extending support to the near poor-
households who might have slipped into poverty as a result of TC Winston, and did not allow
for assistance to be exclusively targeted towards only those families residing in the affected
areas. It is felt that humanitarian assistance could have greatly benefited and reached more
affected people, had the social assistance database been updated with the computerized
records of the near-poor families and the system centralized to allow for deeper geographical
bifurcation of beneficiary records.


Adverse weather and logistical challenges in reaching some of the country’s highlands and
outer islands posed a challenge for the government and humanitarian actors in relief
efforts. This challenge was overcome in the initial relief period through the strong national
and international military assistance available. However, in the intermediate period when
such assistance will not be available, it will impact the humanitarian relief efforts as the
humanitarian actors do not have the capacity or resources to reach such far flung areas.


Absence of good quality baseline data affected the ability of many clusters in making rapid
assessment of the total population affected and damages incurred and providing adequate
relief accordingly. Rapid deployment of supplies and equipment was effected as a result.


The Agriculture sector, which was the worst hit by TC Winston, was further impacted by TC
Zena in April 2016. This caused widespread flooding of key horticultural areas of Fiji,


                                              34
destroying up to 80 percent of ongoing rehabilitation work. The Department of Agriculture
and the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, in addition faced the challenge of lack of in-
country availability of seeds which delayed the distribution of seeds to needy farmers.




 VI.        Disaster Responsive Social Protection post-TC Winston


The government estimates that the poorest strata of the country have been affected by TC
Winston. In the Post Disaster Needs Assessment for TC Winston, a comparison was made of
the estimated per capita production losses with the average annual household income which
revealed that TC Winston had affected the most impoverished population strata of the
country (Figure 7). 22 The population in the northern provinces of Bua and Cakaudrove (where
average annual household income is F$14,100/per person) have sustained the greatest
production losses. These findings are in line with the Poverty Mapping study conducted by
the World Bank in 2011 which shows that the poverty incidence is highest (above 50 percent)
in the provinces of Ra, Cakaudrove and Macuata, followed by the provinces of
Nadroga/Navosa and Bua (between 40 and 50 percent). An overwhelming majority of the
poor were found to reside in Ba, which is also the most populous province of the country
(World Bank, 2011).

Social Protection programs can help poor household’s better respond and adapt in the face
of external shocks and natural disasters without having to revert to negative coping
strategies. The poor and near-poor households are generally characterised as having low
savings and poor access to credit and are at high risk of losing life, assets, and livelihoods in
times of natural disasters. They are the first to revert to negative coping strategies, such as
reduction in food consumption, health care, and selling and depletion of productive assets,
which potentially has long-term implications for human development. Consequently,
increasingly frequent disasters can force the poor and near-poor household into transitory
poverty. Social protection programs at times of disaster can provide immediate relief to the
affected families so that they can sustain themselves in the short-term, and not revert to
negative coping strategies. The government in response to TC Winston implemented a
number of social protection initiatives, taking advantage of the existing social protection
framework in place in Fiji.




                                                                       36
The Government decided to use its existing social protection system to provide additional
assistance to the most vulnerable, as a key component of its disaster response. Fiji already
has a well-established social assistance system in place, which provides regular cash and food
voucher payments to vulnerable families. The system has also undergone rigorous reforms
to fine tune the key design and operational features, in particular the poverty targeting, data
collection and electronic payment mechanisms, ensuring that the most vulnerable are being
serviced through the most effective means possible. Under these circumstances, the
Government has been well placed to use its existing programs to scale up assistance through
additional cash payments to its existing beneficiaries. While also successfully making wide
use of cash vouchers for the purchase of both food and rebuilding materials.



       6.1 Social Protection Programs


Four weeks into the disaster, on 18 March 2016, the Government disbursed F $19.9 million
using the existing social assistance schemes to efficiently disburse cash to vulnerable
groups and inject much needed cash into the economy. A total of F$19.9 million (US$9.4
million) was disbursed through the three schemes. Under the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS),
22,802 households were paid a lump sum of F$600, or the equivalent of F$200 for three
months. 17,782 pensioners of the Social Pension Scheme (SPS) over the age of 68 received
an additional F$300 (F$100 over three months). Finally, 3,313 families under the Care and
Protection Scheme (CPS) received a total of F$300 (Table 9). The cash top-up payments were
intended to help people meet immediate expenses following TC Winston and were provided
to all existing beneficiaries, irrespective of whether they resided in the affected areas or not.
This decision was driven by several factors: (i) the urgency of the situation (the need to
respond); (ii) operational constraints (database not of sufficient quality to distinguish
between affected and non-affected areas) (iii) the fact that current beneficiaries are
considered to be disadvantaged anyway (even if they happen to be in non-affected areas);
and (iv) the belief that inter-household sharing of resources would take place (e.g.,



                                               37
households in non-affected areas would share the transfers with their extended kinship
networks in affected areas).

A follow-up food voucher payment of F $4.6 million (US$2.1 million) for two months
(May/June 2016) to the social assistance recipients was developed by the government. The
government on April 8, 2016, announced the approval of a Food Voucher Program (FVP) top-
up of F$4.6 million (US$2.1 million), for the beneficiaries under the PBS, SPS and CPS
programs, residing in the 12 priority regions. The programme has been jointly implemented
by the government and the World Food Programme. As discussed earlier, the social
assistance beneficiary database was used to identify families for voucher distribution, and
the two-month top-up food voucher payments (distributed in May and June, 2016) were
designed to immediately follow-up on the cash transfer top-up payments (distributed from
February to April, 2016) delivered by the government. The food vouchers are expected to
have assisted approximately 44,169 households. As discussed in earlier sections, this is a good
example of how humanitarian assistance and social protection mechanisms can jointly be
used by the government for disaster response.




                                                 38
On April 9, 2016, the Government announced the roll-out of a F $70 million (US$32.6
million) Housing Program, or “Help for Homes” initiative which has been designed to assist
families to rebuild homes that were damaged or destroyed. A total of 30,369 homes were
reported damaged or destroyed by TC Winston, and under this program the government will
provide   affected    households     with    vouchers       (electronic   cards)   for   housing
rehabilitation/reconstruction. The program is targeted towards households with an annual
income of under F$ 50,000 (US$ 24,000), who have experienced housing damage. The three
categories of benefits being provided are: F$ 1,500 (US$ 717) for houses with partial roofing
damage; F$ 3,000 (US$ 1,434) for houses with a serious roofing damage; and F$ 7,000 (US$
3,345) for almost/completely demolished households. Those living in informal settlements in
affected areas are also eligible to receive $1,500 (US$750). In addition, applicants who have
already repaired their homes can request refund, but need to provide evidence. The budget
allocation for this program is F$ 70 million (or about 1 percent of GDP), although the expected
total cost is F$184 million (US$85.6 million) up to 2018.


The Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) disbursed about F $250.2 million (US$116.4 million)
to its members in the first two months following TC Winston. Fiji National Provident Fund
(FNPF), the largest social insurance program of Fiji, allowed affected members to withdraw
cash nine days after TC Winston, resulting in a significant injection of cash into the economy.
Active members were allowed to withdraw up to F$1,000 (US$465), plus an additional
F$5,000 (US$2,325) if they could present proof (property title) of having a house in the
cyclone affected area. Within the first two months of the disaster, the FNPF processed and
approved 170,000 withdrawal applications, including 35,000 in the second (F$5,000)
category. These one-time withdrawals have resulted in a massive injection of around F$250.2
million (or about 3 percent of GDP) cash into the economy.

         6.2 Impact of SP Programs and Funding


The government’s disaster responsive social protection programs following TC Winston
have translated into a financial contribution of F$344.7 million (US$160 million) into the
economy. In the immediate relief period following TC Winston the government committed
to a range of social protection programs, and it is expected that the programs will impact the
lives of approximately 170,000 families with a budget of approximately F $344.7 million
(Table 10).

The government financed its initial relief and rehabilitation expenditures by reallocating
budgeted resources from lower-priority expenditures. This provided the government with
the flexibility of implementing programs of its choice, such as the social protection programs,
through its existing structures. As a result, relief efforts were well targeted and coordinated,
with strong government leadership. This is evident in the string of disaster responsive social
protection programs which were implemented immediately following TC Winston, with the
objective of providing immediate relief to the vulnerable population and injecting much
needed cash into the economy. Apart from the Food Voucher Program (FVP) which was
funded by WFP, the remainder of the programs are all being financed through the
government’s own resources.

There are long term implications of the withdrawal of F $250.2 million (US$116.4 million)
from the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPD) following TC Winston. The FNPF approved
approximately 170,000 applications for withdrawal of funds and it is the first time the Fund
has allowed members to make maximum withdrawals from their pension funds (ceiling of 30
percent). This has a long term impact on the members as they will receive reduced pensions
in the future, and for many, they will not be able to access any further funds in case of future
emergencies.



           6.3 Evaluation of the Impact of the Social Assistance Top-up Payments


The government recently conducted an evaluation of the social assistance top up transfers
with World Bank assistance in order to determine the impact on households and to inform
future disaster response efforts 23. The main objectives of the impact evaluation were to: (i)
assess the impact of TC Winston on the affected households, (ii) analyse the effects of top-
up transfers and how they were spent, and (iii) assess whether top-up transfers were an
appropriate response. The evaluation was conducted in the affected areas of Viti Levu (Ba
and Ra provinces) and surveyed two groups of households, those eligible for the social
assistance schemes (poor) before the disaster, and those ineligible but still poor.


The impact evaluation survey was conducted in June 2016, nearly 3 months after TC
Winston. The impact evaluation data was collected in Fiji during June 2016, with a sample
size of about 700 households. The evaluation strategy uses the regression discontinuity
design (RDD) in defining the treatment and control groups based on the Poverty Benefit
Scheme (PBS) eligibility (poverty score) threshold. The treatment group is the PBS recipient
households (20 percent below threshold) in affected areas that have also received an

intervention (top-up PBS benefit) post TC Winston. The control group is the PBS-evaluated
(pre-TC Winston) households in affected areas that are not eligible for PBS, as they are above
(but within 20 percent) the threshold. These households did not receive an intervention.
Furthermore, a qualitative survey was carried out in November 2016, with a sample size of
over 100 interviews, to understand better some of the findings of the quantitative field
survey.


Summary of key findings:


The results of the impact evaluation of the TC Winston social assistance top-up transfers can
be summarised into the following key findings;


The disaster responsive social protection intervention, in the form of top-up transfers to
beneficiaries, was found to be an effective response following TC Winston. It was rapidly
implemented within one month of the disaster and clearly targeted towards the poorest
households (PBS, SPS, CPS recipients). With an advanced electronic banking system already
in place in Fiji for regular social assistance payments, it comes as no surprise that 98 percent
of PBS recipients surveyed reported having received their top-up transfers through electronic
means. The findings of the impact evaluation survey also indicate that 76 percent of
households withdrew their top-up payments within the first month of receiving them.
Furthermore, the top-up transfers were found to be distributed in a timely manner (by
planning or default) that allowed affected families to take advantage of recovering markets.
The PBS recipients reported a sharp decline in their ability to purchase all necessary goods
and services from their local markets, with access to local markets dropping from 83.9
percent to 37.4 percent immediately after TC Winston. However, market access was restored
to nearly the same level within a month (Figure 8). The impact evaluation findings suggest
that the top-up payments were an effective intervention one month after the disaster, once
the markets were restored, and should be planned as such for future response interventions.

The in-kind humanitarian assistance provided effective immediate assistance to all affected
households, and played a crucial role in sustaining the families until the markets were
restored. The results of the evaluation suggest that the efforts of the Government of Fiji,
military, development partners and NGOs have resulted in the effective delivery of a wide
range of items, to sustain the households in the first few days and weeks after the TC Winston.
Nearly all households in the affected areas were reached with some form of non-cash
assistance, in the form of food rations, building materials and temporary shelters, regardless
of top-up benefits. The survey also finds that both groups of PBS recipients and non-PBS
recipients were similar in receiving all types of non-cash assistance, with the exception of the
food vouchers (which were by design targeted to PBS recipients) (Figure 9). This assistance
was found to be even more crucial immediately after TC Winston when the markets were
severely impacted. Therefore, when markets did recover one month after TC Winston, the
cash assistance top up transfers meant that families could purchase their own resources and
recover faster from the disaster impacts.

Both poor and near-poor households were similarly affected by TC Winston, and the
households receiving the top-up transfers were quicker to recover from the disaster shocks.
The results indicate that both PBS recipients (treatment group) and non-recipients (control
group) faced similar shocks in the affected areas, with the highest shocks reported for: (i)
damage to the dwelling’s roof (72.7 percent and 75.6 percent, respectively), (ii) loss of
crops/harvest (50.9 percent and 52.6 percent respectively), and (iii) damage to agricultural
land (41.5 percent and 46.3 percent, respectively) (Figure 10). The results also indicate that
three months after the cyclone took place, beneficiaries under the PBS were more likely to
have recovered from the shocks they faced, relative to comparable households that did not
receive the additional assistance. Importantly, the findings suggest that in times of disaster
all affected households need to be provided with assistance, while the social protection
system can be used to target assistance towards the poor and near-poor households. The
results also indicate that assistance should be closely targeted to the affected households, as
inter-household transfers from less affected areas will not necessarily be forthcoming.

Households acted rationally in their spending patterns and the top-up payments were used
on essential items, which helped the beneficiaries cope and recover faster from the shocks.
Top-up transfers were predominantly spent by recipient households on essential items, and
the majority of top-up payments were fully utilized within the first month of receiving them.
The results indicate that 99 percent of the top-up spending was done on essential items, with
food and materials to repair damaged dwellings forming the two most important categories
of expenditure, followed by clothing and school supplies (Figure 10). Less than 1 percent of
the assistance was reported to be spent on kava, alcohol or cigarettes, addressing a common
concern that additional social assistance would be used unwisely for ‘non-essential items’,
and making the top-up transfers a good disaster response strategy.

Knowledge on the top-up transfers was very low amongst the recipients, with majority of
recipients unaware that they would be receiving the payment. The findings indicate that a
more comprehensive and engaging public information campaign could have been employed
by the government for reaching out to the affected communities and beneficiaries, and
informing them about the forthcoming support, the eligibility and advice on how best to use
the money received. The findings suggest the need for strengthening communication
outreach in times of disaster and sharing important messages on the initiative for achieving
greater impact.




VII.   Changing Landscape of Social Protection following TC Winston


The government anticipates a 33 percent increase in the number of families requiring social
assistance in the wake of TC Winston and estimates a F$7 million (US$3.3 million) medium
term recovery budget for the expansion of the existing social protection programs. The
cyclone is expected to have impacted the most impoverished strata of the country and the
possibility of people sinking into deeper poverty or more people becoming poor following TC



                                                            46
Winston is a distinct possibility. The government anticipates an additional 33 percent of the
population, on top of the existing beneficiaries, to seek government assistance following TC
Winston. 24 This translates into an additional 14,486 beneficiaries potentially joining the social
protection programs, bringing the total number of families to 58,383 who will potentially be
serviced by the government’s social protection programs (Figure 12). As a result, the
government has estimated a F $7 million (US$3.3 million) medium term recovery budget until
mid-2018 for the expansion of the social protection programs in Fiji following TC Winston. 25

Moving forward the government is in an opportune position to reflect upon its response to
TC Winston and refine its Social Protection Policy Framework to include disaster response.
The government has been actively reviewing and refining its social protection programs in Fiji
through reforms aimed at increasing the coverage and effectiveness of its operations. It has

  The F $7 million budget will primarily address the increase in the number of PBS beneficiaries as many new
households will now become eligible for the benefit due to the damage to their houses following TC Winston.
However, it is important to mention here that the government has recently announced a decrease in the pension
age of SPS beneficiaries from 68 to 66 years which will see a rise in the number of beneficiaries in the coming
months, not related to TC Winston.



                                                       47
also been learning from its past disasters and has incorporated many recommendations from
TC Evan into its response for TC Winston. In view of the government’s effective and timely
response to TC Winston, the institutionalization of a Disaster Responsive Social Protection
framework for Fiji would further aid to refine the response strategies and streamline technical
details, such as targeting, payments, and budgeting to be better prepared for similar natural
disasters in the future.




VIII.   Recommendations for Strengthening Disaster Responsive Social Protection


Based on the experiences of TC Winston and the lessons learnt, the following
recommendations can be put forward for the Government’s consideration moving forward,
for a stronger and resilient disaster response framework.


Develop an institutionalized (formal) Social Protection Policy Framework, with an
embedded disaster responsive component. The social protection and safety nets structure
of Fiji has been rigorously tested in the face of TC Winston and has come out strong in terms
of its ability to rapidly respond and disburse cash assistance to the affected families, and the
use of its existing framework for channelling other humanitarian relief efforts. This makes Fiji
a pioneer in the use of social protection programs for disaster response in the Pacific, and can
contribute significantly to the regional debate. Therefore, due to the increasing prominence
of social protection programs in Fiji and their recent role in emergency response, there is a
need to review the existing social protection policies and legislation to bring them up to date
and make them a vital element of future disaster response strategies for Fiji, and set an
example for the rest of the Pacific. The government can also look towards broadening its
disaster responsive social protection interventions to include more interventions for the
youth and working age populations as well as public works programs.




                                              48
Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) and guidelines for disaster responsive
social protection. The government’s response to TC Winston was unprecedented in terms of
its use of the existing social protection programs for disaster response, and although the
overall response was found to be generally swift and effective, it did run into certain
implementation challenges, such as the inability to target near-poor households, limited
geographical targeting, and an ineffective information campaign on the top-up payments to
the beneficiaries. There is a rising need to work on preparedness for future disasters and the
development of standard operating procedures and guidelines will be a step in this direction.
The SOP’s and guidelines should enable the government to smoothly roll-out an emergency
cash transfer operation in the event of a disaster. The SOP’s should categorise the disaster
levels and determine what the SP response should be at each level, and should be linked to
the broader Disaster Management Framework of Fiji. These documents can further provide
guidance on how to activate and scale up existing social assistance programs in response to
disasters and can help the government deliver better targeted and timely programs.


Establish a coordination mechanism for cash transfer interventions in times of disaster. The
government was quick to identify opportunities for channelling humanitarian assistance
through its existing social assistance system. This collaboration has led to the response being
better targeted, timely and reducing duplication of effort, on the part of both the government
and humanitarian actors. There is a need to now formalise this coordination mechanism
between the two, so that in future disasters all cash transfer interventions (including cash,
vouchers and public-works) are managed separately by the government. One
recommendation could be to consider adding a new national cluster for this, or even
formalising the informal Cash and Voucher Working Group, which was operating as an
informal cluster during the time of TC Winston. Having a dedicated national cluster would
ensure that from the beginning all cash-based interventions are prioritised and sequenced to
provide the maximum relief to the affected families.




                                              49
Consolidate and centralize the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS) database so that both poor
and near-poor households can be targeted in times of disaster. The PBS is a poverty-targeted
social assistance program of the government and maintains a comprehensive poverty
Registry of households meeting the minimum poverty threshold of the program (i.e., eligible
for the PBS), and those households which are above the poverty cut-off score (i.e., not eligible
for the PBS). As a result of TC Winston, it is anticipated that households in the PBS which were
previously just above the poverty cut-off, may have drifted below the cut-off and are now in
need of urgent assistance. Following TC Winston, the government was unable to extend its
social assistance to these near-poor households as the PBS database had not been upgraded
to include the electronic records of these households. It is suggested that the government
intensifies the efforts of consolidating and centralizing the PBS Registry, through allocation
of additional staff and resources, so that in future disasters it has the option of extending its
assistance to near poor households as well as undertaking geographical targeting of
assistance, based on the registry.


Complement humanitarian assistance with both in-kind and cash assistance, based on
access and functionality of local markets. The case of TC Winston demonstrates the
effectiveness of in-kind humanitarian assistance in providing immediate relief to affected
families, especially during the period when markets are severely impacted. However, once
markets are restored, the top-up cash payments have been found to be an effective
intervention one month after the disaster, allowing the families to use the cash assistance to
purchase their own resources and recover faster from the disaster impacts. For future
disasters, the government may consider channelling humanitarian assistance in the form of
both in-kind and cash assistance, and synchronising the two so that the in-kind assistance is
substituted by cash assistance, once the markets are up and running. This could save valuable
time on procurement and boost the local economy, provided that the markets are sufficiently
capacitated by then.




                                               50
Develop a Post-Disaster Communication Plan. Post TC Winston the government has been
seen to struggle to effectively reach out to the communities, especially for information on
top-up payments. The impact evaluation results also show low awareness amongst
beneficiaries that they would be receiving the top-up payments, while this was followed by
low understanding on the overall intent of the top-up payments. There is a need to therefore
strengthen the communication channel for future disasters and develop a Post-Disaster
Communication Plan which identifies the strategy to be employed by the government for
reaching out to the beneficiaries in times of disaster and informing them and the
communities about the assistance being provided to them.


Explore options for Disaster Risk Financing for Fiji. Due to the increasing occurrence of
disasters in Fiji and the adverse impact on the economy, there is a need to improve the
country’s fiscal resilience to natural and climatic disasters, and introduce solutions for
reducing its financial vulnerability to natural disasters. At the moment Fiji has F$3 million
available in Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) instruments to respond to disasters
through two sources of dedicated funds, namely the National Disaster Relief and
Rehabilitation Fund (NDRRF) and the Rehabilitation Fund. However, there is a 57 percent
chance of Fiji experiencing government emergency losses exceeding the F$3 million
contingency provision (World Bank, 2015). Therefore, there is a rising need to look into access
to additional contingency funds and credit in emergency or pre-emergency situations for Fiji.
One such option could be the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) which has
recently been made available for Fiji.

Abstract

This paper presents an analysis of the humanitarian response led by the Government of Fiji following
Tropical Cyclone Winston, and looks specifically at the role the social protection system played in
disaster response, as well as complementing the humanitarian relief efforts. The safety net system
or social assistance programs, were scaled up to provide relief to the most vulnerable, in the form
of cash transfer top-up payments. While the national social protection system was used to channel
humanitarian relief in the form of cash vouchers to the affected families. The interplay between
the social protection and humanitarian assistance efforts in Fiji, presents a compelling case for
synchronizing and complementing relief efforts in the future. And, a set of recommendations have
been put forward for consideration, for strengthening future disaster responsive social protection.
