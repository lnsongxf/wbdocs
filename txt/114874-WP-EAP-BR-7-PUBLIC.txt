valuable investments both in the short and long run.
          Since a human influenza pandemic would
rapidly spread all over the world, stopping or controlling
avian flu is therefore a true global public good, which all
countries have an interest in acquiring. Thus, while
country level leadership and engagement is essential for
success, it must be backed by global resources. Even
though the benefits of containing a pandemic are
overwhelming, individual governments may still be
daunted by the social, political and economic costs of
various policy measures, especially when these measures
are in the nature of global public goods that benefit many
more than just the people of that nation.
