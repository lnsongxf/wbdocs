Foreword
The science is clear: breathing polluted air increases the risk of debilitating and deadly diseases
such as lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, and chronic bronchitis. Air pollution is now the
world’s fourth-leading fatal health risk, causing one in ten deaths in 2013.

At the same time, air pollution from industries, construction sites, agricultural practices, vehi-
cles, and the combustion of dirty energy sources continues to grow. About 87 percent of the
world’s population now live in countries in which ambient pollution levels exceed air quality
guidelines set by the World Health Organization. In low- and middle-income countries, the
danger is even more pronounced: 90 percent of the population in these countries was exposed
to dangerous levels of ambient air pollution in 2013.

To reduce the number of people gradually being contaminated by the air they breathe, pollu-
tion control would need to be at the top of the agenda for most governments. However, in
most countries, such expenditure competes with other budgetary priorities and policy objec-
tives. Demonstrating the economic burden of pollution can help tilt the balance of decisions
in favor of investments in clean air.

This study is the result of a collaboration between the World Bank and the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Seattle. It represents an effort
to merge cutting edge science and rigorous economic analysis for the good of public health.

The study has found that premature deaths due to air pollution in 2013 cost the global econ-
omy about $225 billion in lost labor income, or about $5.11 trillion in welfare losses world-
wide. That is about the size of the gross domestic product of India, Canada, and Mexico
combinedand a sobering wake-up call.

However impressive and abstract these large numbers are, it is our hope that the cost of pre-
mature deaths for countries’ economies will leave the pages of this study and inform public
debate and policy decisions at the national level. In country after country, the cost of pollution
in human lives and on the quality of life is too high. We must work together to reduce it.

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	         ix
Executive Summary

Introduction
Air pollution is recognized today as a major health risk. Exposure to air pollution, both ambi-
ent and household, increases a person’s risk of contracting a disease such as lung cancer, stroke,
heart disease, and chronic bronchitis. According to the latest available estimates, in 2013,
5.5 million premature deaths worldwide, or 1 in every 10 total deaths, were attributable to air
pollution. Air pollution has posed a significant health risk since the early 1990s, the earliest
period for which global estimates of exposure and health effects are available. In 1990, as in
2013, air pollution was the fourth leading fatal health risk worldwide, resulting in 4.8 million
premature deaths.

Air pollution is especially severe in some of the world’s fastest-growing urban regions, where
greater economic activity is contributing to higher levels of pollution and to greater exposure.
But air pollution is also a problem outside cities. Billions of people around the world continue to
depend on burning solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, coal, and dung in their homes for cooking
and heating. Consequently, the health risk posed by air pollution is the greatest in developing
countries. In 2013 about 93 percent of deaths and nonfatal illnesses attributed to air pollution
worldwide occurred in these countries, where 90 percent of the population was exposed to dan-
gerous levels of air pollution. Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than
60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries.

Air pollution is not just a health risk but also a drag on development. By causing illness and
premature death, air pollution reduces the quality of life. By causing a loss of productive labor,
it also reduces incomes in these countries. Air pollution can have a lasting effect on productiv-
ity in other ways as well—for example, by stunting plant growth and reducing the productivity
of agriculture, and by making cities less attractive to talented workers, thereby reducing cities’
competitiveness.




Motivation for This Study
This study sets out to calculate the economic costs of premature mortality from air pollution
to strengthen the business case for governments to act ambitiously in reducing pollution. The
costs of pollution to society are many, but a full accounting is beyond the scope of this report.
Instead, it will focus on what many studies have shown to be the largest and most damaging
cost of pollution: premature mortality.

The number of deaths each year attributable to air pollution makes a compelling case for
reducing pollution. Valuing the costs of premature deaths associated with pollution helps to
further highlight the severity of the problem. Governments face a wide array of competing
development challenges, and monetizing the costs of pollution can help them decide how to
allocate scarce resources to better the lives of their citizens. Monetary values can also help

them measure the benefits of policies to tackle pollution and, when compared with costs of
implementation, to devise cost-effective air quality management plans.

This study also presents the results of 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2013 Col-
laborators 2015). The GBD measures illnesses and premature deaths from a multitude of
causes and risk factors around the world, including air pollution. It offers the most extensive
estimates of exposure and trends in air pollution levels and their associated burden of disease.
The GBD effort dates to the early 1990s when the World Bank commissioned the original
GBD study for feature in its World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health. Since 2010,
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Seat-
tle, has steered the GBD study, with the latest set of estimates for 2013.



Methodology
The disease burden attributable to air pollution is estimated by first measuring the severity
of air pollution and the extent to which people are exposed to it (Brauer et al. 2016;
Cohen et al. n.d.). The GBD evaluates exposure to outdoor (ambient) air pollution as well as
indoor air pollution in households cooking with solid fuels. The GBD approach to estimating
ambient air pollution aims to make the greatest use of information from different sources in
the most reasonable way possible, combining data from ground monitoring with satellite
observations and chemical transport models. Exposure to household air pollution is estimated
from a combination of data on the proportion of households using solid fuels, estimates of
indoor pollution concentrations associated with fuel use, and the ratio of personal to area
exposure.

The GBD then evaluates how personal exposure raises people’s relative risk of contracting ill-
nesses such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung
cancer, acute lower respiratory infections, and pneumonia. Elevated risk among the exposed
population translates into a higher portion of deaths from these conditions each year, which
are attributed to air pollution.

Using the GBD estimates of premature mortality attributable to pollution, this study values the
economic costs in dollar terms following two different approaches: (1) a welfare-based
approach that monetizes the increased fatality risk from air pollution according to individuals’
willingness to pay (WTP); and (2) an income-based approach that equates the financial cost of
premature mortality with the present value of forgone lifetime earnings. Each of these
approaches is given equal weight in this report, although they are tailored to different
purposes.

The welfare-based approach is intended to measure the economic costs of fatal health risks to
the individuals that make up a society. By increasing people’s risk of contracting a deadly ill-
ness, air pollution represents a threat to the many things they value, including consumption,
leisure, good health, and simply being alive. This value is reflected in the WTP, which captures
the trade-offs that individuals are willing to make to reduce their chances of dying. The value
of statistical life (VSL) represents the sum of many individuals’ WTP for marginal changes in


The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                        xi
their risk of death. It is not the value of any single person’s life or death, nor does it represent a
society’s judgment as to what that value should be. The VSL is also not meant for cross-­country
comparisons as to the value of life and death in different countries. The WTP-based approach
is best suited for analyses of economic welfare, and it has become the standard approach in
high-income countries for valuing the mortality risks associated with pollution (see Viscusi
1993; Cropper 2000; OECD 2012).

The income-based approach is more suited to financial analysis and measuring pollution costs
within the extended boundaries of the national accounts—for example, as a component of the
World Bank’s adjusted net savings (ANS) measure. ANS, or “genuine savings,” is a measure of
the change in the value of a nation’s assets, including manufactured capital as well as natural
and human capital (see Hamilton and Clemens 1999; World Bank 2005, 2011). Positive sav-
ings represents an investment in future well-being as a nation accumulates the assets needed
to drive economic growth and at least sustain current levels of consumption. Within the ANS
framework, premature mortality due to pollution represents a disinvestment in a nation’s
human capital stock. As with the degradation of other forms of capital, this disinvestment is
valued according to the expected loss of income over the lifetime of the asset. The Ministry of
Social Development in Chile, for example, has adopted this approach for valuing premature
mortality (Chile MDS 2014).



Key Findings
In 2013 exposure to ambient and household air pollution cost the world’s economy some
$5.11 trillion in welfare losses. In terms of magnitude, welfare losses in South Asia and East
Asia and the Pacific were the equivalent of 7.4 percent and 7.5 percent of the regional gross
domestic product (GDP), respectively (figure ES.1).1 At the low end, losses were still equal to
2.2 percent of GDP in the Middle East and North Africa. Household air pollution from

cooking with solid fuels was the biggest cause of losses in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
In all other regions, losses were largely caused by ambient air pollution from fine particulate
matter (PM2.5). Labor income losses, while expectedly lower than welfare losses, were none-
theless substantial in regions with younger populations. Lost income for countries in South
Asia totaled more than $66 billion in 2013, the equivalent of nearly 1 percent of GDP. Globally,
the labor income losses totaled $225 billion in 2013.

Moreover, air pollution costs have grown since 1990. From 1990 to 2013, welfare losses nearly
doubled and labor income losses increased by 40 percent, despite countries having made great
gains in economic development and health outcomes (figure ES.2). In low-income countries,
declines in death rates were more than offset by population growth and greater total exposure
to polluted air. In middle-income countries, total exposure and health impacts also increased.
However, most of the estimated increase in welfare losses stemmed from people placing a
greater value on reducing fatality risks. Similarly, from 1990 to 2013 average wages increased
in real terms in all but the high-income countries that are not members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), causing forgone labor income losses per
premature death to be higher. Across countries in all income groups, the age profile of people
affected by pollution shifted, so that a higher proportion of deaths occurred among people
later in their working life, having a countervailing, but not equal or greater, effect on income
losses.

Ambient air pollution is becoming a greater challenge, and household air pollution remains a
persistent challenge despite some gains. Since the 1990s, exposure to ambient air pollution has
grown in most countries (other than high-income), with some of the greatest increases in the
heavily populated, fastest-growing regions, including South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific.
By 2013 about 87 percent of the world’s population was living in areas that exceeded the Air

Quality Guideline of the World Health Organization (WHO), which is an annual average of
10 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) PM2.5. Although the age-standardized death rate due to
ambient PM2.5 exposure has decreased in most countries since 1990 because of overall improve-
ments in health, population growth and increased exposure have nonetheless increased the
number of premature deaths. From 1990 to 2013, premature mortality attributable to ambient
PM2.5 increased by 30 percent, from 2.2 million deaths to 2.9 million deaths per year. Global
welfare losses from exposure to ambient PM2.5 rose 63 percent over the same period, reaching
$3.55 trillion—a reflection of worsening exposure in many fast-growing countries as well as the
higher marginal costs for fatality risks associated with rising incomes. Labor income losses due
to ambient PM2.5 climbed from $103 billion to $144 billion per year.

Although two-fifths of the world’s population was exposed to household air pollution from
cooking with solid fuels in 2013, exposure has declined in most countries since 1990. Declines
in exposure ranged from nearly 100 percent in many higher-income countries to under 10 per-
cent across much of Sub-Saharan Africa. The age-standardized death rate from household air
pollution decreased from 75 deaths per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 47 per 100,000 in 2013, a
38 percent drop. And yet, despite the reductions in exposure and death rates, the total number
of deaths associated with indoor air pollution has mostly remained constant at about 2.9 mil-
lion per year. Welfare losses due to household air pollution in low- and middle-income coun-
tries in 2013 were on the order of $1.52 trillion, while labor income losses reached
$94 billion.

The very young and older adults remain particularly vulnerable: in 2013 about 5 percent of
deaths of children under 5 and 10 percent of deaths among adults over 50 were attributed to
air pollution, compared with less than 1 percent among young adults. This age pattern of mor-
tality has remained unchanged since 1990. Among all ages and over time, a larger share of men
than women have died prematurely from air pollution–based illnesses.



Recommendations and Way Forward
The fact that global welfare losses from fatal illness attributable to air pollution are in the tril-
lions of dollars, is a call to action. The additional costs of pollution not captured by this report
make reducing exposure all the more urgent for achieving the goals of shared, inclusive, and
sustainable prosperity. Furthermore, the growing challenge of ambient air pollution and per-
sistence of household air pollution impacts despite improvements in health services suggest
that incremental progress to improve air quality will not be sufficient and that achieving real
reductions in the cost of pollution will require more ambitious action.

Meanwhile, by placing air pollution–related health risks in the context of other health risks
that, unlike air pollution, are typically within the purview of health agencies, the Global Bur-
den of Disease approach is emphasizing the need for health agencies to consider this impor-
tant health burden and calling for ministries of environment and health to work together to
deal with this challenge.

1. Introduction
Air Pollution: A Threat to Sustainable Prosperity
Air pollution1 has emerged as one of the world’s leading health risks. Each year, more than
5.5 million people around the world die prematurely from illnesses caused by breathing pol-
luted air. Those illnesses include lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, acute respiratory infec-
tions, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema (GBD
2013 Collaborators 2015). In fact, exposure to air pollution is now the fourth leading fatal
health risk worldwide behind metabolic risks, dietary risks, and tobacco smoke (figure 1.1).
More than six times as many people die from air pollution each year as from malaria, and
more than four times as many die from air pollution as from HIV/AIDS.

Air pollution takes many forms. One of the most damaging pollutants is PM2.5, which is very
fine particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, or
about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. Because of their small size, these particles are
capable of penetrating deep into the lungs. Their chemical makeup varies, depending on their
source. They often consist of carbon, sulfate, and nitrate compounds, but also may include
toxic substances such as heavy metals. Very fine particles may be emitted directly from com-
bustion sources such as motor vehicles or power plants, or they may form when gases such as
ammonium from fertilizers react with other pollutants in the atmosphere. They may also
include concentrations of natural windblown dust.

Air pollution is especially severe in some of the world’s fastest-growing urban regions, where
the combination of more people, more vehicles, energy derived from dirty fuels, construction,

improper management of wastes, and other factors have elevated exposure. Exposure has
increased most quickly in the developing countries of South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific,
reaching 46 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) and 42 µg/m3, respectively, or about three
times the guideline value of 15 µg/m3 recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as the level below which adverse health effects have not yet been observed (Brauer
et al. 2016).2

Air pollution is not just a problem in cities. More than 2.8 billion people around the world
continue to burn solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, coal, and dung in their homes for cooking
and heating (Chafe et al. 2014). Many of these people live in rural areas where they lack access
to modern forms of energy such as electricity.

The health risk posed by air pollution is greatest in developing countries. Low- and middle-
income countries account for 80 percent of the world’s population and for 93 percent of the
deaths and nonfatal illness each year from air pollution.3 Air pollution is the third leading risk
factor in these countries behind metabolic risks and dietary risks (figure  1.2). In upper-
middle-income countries, as is the case globally, it is the fourth greatest risk factor. Children
under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to
air pollution as children in high-income countries, with the majority of these deaths attribut-
able to household air pollution. Death rates attributable to air pollution exposure among people
of all ages are highest in the lower-middle-income countries (GBD 2013 Collaborators 2015).

Air pollution is not just a health risk; it is also an economic burden. By causing illness and
premature death, pollution reduces quality of life. By causing a loss of productive labor, pollu-
tion also reduces output and incomes in these countries. As will be shown in this report, the
annual quality of life or welfare costs of air pollution in low- and middle-income countries are
in the trillions of dollars, and lost income is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The enor-
mity of the costs stems from the widespread nature of exposure to air pollution. Around
87 percent of the world’s population is living in areas where PM2.5 concentrations exceed the
WHO guideline value, and so every day billions of people are breathing polluted air and rais-
ing their risk of succumbing to a pollution-caused illness. The economic costs associated with
this elevated risk are a real drag on development.

Apart from the sheer magnitude of the costs, the disproportionate impacts on the poorest
segments of the population make air pollution a threat to shared and inclusive prosperity. The
poor are more likely to live and work in polluted environments, but they are less able to avoid
exposure or self-protect. In the United States, research dating back to the 1970s has docu-
mented how toxic facilities and sources of air pollution have tended to be sited near poor
minority communities.4 Disparities in exposure continue to exist today in places such as the
South Bronx in New York City, where nearly 40 percent of people live below the poverty line
and where asthma rates are four times higher than the national average (Katz 2012). Similarly,
in China large point sources of pollution such as heavy industry are increasingly moving from
city centers to the suburbs, where migrant workers congregate, and from coastal metropolises
to second- or third-tier cities and rural towns, where land is cheaper and monitoring by envi-
ronmental protection authorities may be more lax (Ma and Schoolman 2011; Schoolman and
Ma 2012; Zhao, Zhang, and Fan 2014; Zheng et al. 2014a, 2014b).

Faced with higher levels of exposure, the poor are also more prone to suffering adverse health
effects. In urban areas of Vietnam, for example, the prevalence of acute respiratory illnesses is
twice as high in low-income households as in high-income ones (World Bank 2006). The dis-
proportionate health burden suffered by poor households is due not only to higher exposure
to air pollution but also to factors such as lower resistance to illness, simultaneous exposure to
other environmental health risks, and inequalities in access to and use of basic services
(PEP 2008).

By damaging people’s health, pollution may have a lasting effect on economic productivity and
perpetuate existing inequalities. Prenatal and early childhood exposure to heavy metals and
other toxic substances in the environment is especially detrimental. Children are highly sensi-
tive to the effects of toxics, and even small traces in a child’s blood of substances such as lead
or the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in polluted air and water can result in
cognitive delays, among other health effects (see Grandjean and Landrigan 2014; Tang et al.
2014; Peterson et al. 2015; Vishnevetsky et al. 2015). These health impacts have long-term
repercussions for productivity and innovation. A slight shift in average IQs from early expo-
sure to toxics may reduce the number of intellectually “gifted” people and lead to marginally
higher rates of crime and societal violence (see Weiss 1988; Wright et al. 2008; GAHP 2013).

Air pollution can have lasting effects on productivity in other ways as well—for example, by
degrading natural ecosystems. Pollutants may settle in the air or mix with precipitation and be
deposited on plants, in soils, or in waterways. Atmospheric deposition of pollutants has acidi-
fied soils and reduced the diversity of plant species and the productivity of grasslands in places
such as Mongolia, where many people rely on pastoral livelihoods (Chen et al. 2013). Similar
declines in the richness of plant species from the atmospheric deposition of pollutants have
been observed in the grasslands of Europe (Duprè et al. 2010). The detrimental effects of air
pollutants on aquatic ecosystems include the loss of biota sensitive to the increased acidity of
surface waters as well as increased phytoplankton and algal growth, which contributes to the
eutrophication of waterways, causing dead zones and harmful algal blooms that hurt fisheries,
water-based recreational activities, and tourism (see Greaver et al. 2012).



The Focus of This Report
The costs of pollution to society are many, and a full accounting is beyond the scope of this
report. Instead, this report will focus on what many studies have shown to be the largest and
most damaging cost of pollution: premature mortality. More specifically, this report evaluates
the costs of premature mortality from exposure to ambient concentrations of PM2.5, indoor
concentrations of PM2.5 in households cooking with solid fuels, and ambient ozone pollution.
The valuation of mortality risks is supported by a well-developed body of economic theory
and empirical evidence. Still, readers should remember that the full costs of air pollution to
society are even greater than what is reported here. Examples of other costs not included in
this report are discussed in box 1.1.

Calculating the costs of premature mortality due to air pollution is intended to strengthen the
business case for governments to act ambitiously in reducing pollution. The number of deaths

  Box 1.1  Air Pollution: Harming Countries’ Economies in Many
  Ways

  Beyond its deadly impact on human health, air pollution affects countries’ economies in many
  other ways, from degrading the functioning of natural ecosystems to harming economic compet-
  itiveness and the ability of growing cities to attract top talent. Although these costs are beyond the
  scope of this study, they deserve mention. Two illustrative examples of studies into the additional
  costs of pollution follow.

  Agriculture. The agriculture sector is both a source and a sufferer of air pollution. In the North
  China Plain, for example, fertilizer use in crop fields is a major contributor to ammonia emissions,
  which react chemically in the atmosphere with other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2),
  nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to form PM2.5 (see Guan and
  Liu 2013). At the same time, pollutants may adhere to plant surfaces and reduce the amount of
  sunlight reaching crops, stunting their growth (see Chen 2014). In China, surface ozone (a major
  component of smog) has reduced yields of summer wheat by an estimated 6–12 percent each
  year and soybeans by an estimated 21–25 percent (Wang and Mauzerall 2004; Avnery et al. 2011).
  The World Bank and the Chinese environmental authority estimate the cost of acid rain and
  SO2 pollution on agricultural output in China at 30 billion yuan a year (2003 prices)—see World
  Bank–SEPA (2007).

  Loss of urban competitiveness. The livability of cities is increasingly believed to affect their eco-
  nomic competitiveness. As the labor force becomes more global, top cities must compete for tal-
  ented, educated workers who are free to migrate to less polluted, more livable places. Anecdotal
  evidence abounds of how pollution is harming the ability of firms to attract talent. For example, in a
  2012 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, around one-third of employ-
  ers said they were having a harder time recruiting overseas candidates because of concerns about
  air quality (Pak 2013). Numerous benchmarking indexes have also been created that compare the
  overall livability or competitiveness of cities, taking into account the severity of air pollution. These
  include the urban livability rating of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU 2014), the City Prosperity
  Index of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT 2012), and the liva-
  bility index constructed for South Asian cities by the World Bank (2016). Although these indexes
  enable urbanites to see how their cities stack up against others, they do not quantify the actual mon-
  etary cost of pollution via its effect on competitiveness, demonstrating a causal link between higher
  levels of pollution and reduced economic competitiveness and quantifying the effect of pollution on
  cities’ competitiveness remain elusive.



each year and the incidence of illness alone make a compelling case for tackling pollution.
Why then assign a dollar value to these impacts? The answer is that governments worldwide
face a wide array of competing challenges every day, and valuing the costs of pollution helps
governments decide how to allocate scarce resources and to measure the results of policies by
providing a common basis of comparison. Economic valuation may also help governments
measure social costs that are not reflected in existing markets and prices but are nonetheless
crucial to people’s well-being. An example of how economic valuation has assisted the govern-
ment of Mongolia in fighting air pollution is provided in box 1.2. And the annual reporting by
the U.S. federal government on the benefits and costs of air pollution control is discussed in
box 1.3. As economic studies by public agencies in the United States and elsewhere have
demonstrated, because large populations are exposed to the health risks of air pollution, these

     Box 1.2  Using an Air Quality Management Study and Economic
     Valuation to Help Ulaanbaatar Forge a Strategy to Combat Air
     Pollution

     Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, is one of the world’s coldest capital cities. In recent years, it has also
     become known as one of the world’s most polluted cities. Most of the city’s air pollution appears
     during the winters, when the 180,000 or so households living in informal settlements marked
     by traditional circular tents known as gers burn raw coal in stoves for heating and cooking. As a
     result, despite having a population of only 1.2 million, Ulaanbaatar has experienced levels of air
     pollution worse than those in much larger cities such as Beijing and Delhi.

     In 2007 efforts to replace the traditional heating stoves in the ger areas met with resistance from
     Ulaanbaatar government officials, who were not certain they wanted to prioritize stove removal,
     particularly given the cost. This led to a full-scale air quality management study, seeking a com-
     plete understanding of the sources, concentration levels, and health impacts of pollution and
     outlining the most cost-effective abatement options for the short, medium, and long term. The
     study revealed that switching out existing stoves with cleaner-burning, more efficient ones would
     yield net health benefits of $1.6 billion. The benefits of pursuing other options, such as mov-
     ing ger households into apartments, would have come later. However, that delay would result in
     health-related losses of up to $3.5 billion if more immediate action was not taken. Delaying stove
     replacement by just three years would lead to health-related losses of about $1.0 billion.

     Armed with the results of this analysis, Ulaanbaatar decided to go ahead with the stove replace-
     ment program as one of the main pillars of its strategy to reduce air pollution. Since 2010, Ulaan-
     baatar has replaced nearly 170,000 stoves, reaching more than 90 percent of households in the ger
     areas. Continued monitoring of PM2.5 has revealed a notable reduction in pollution levels since
     the baseline study; yearly average concentrations declined from over 250 µg/m3 in 2008–09 to
     around 80 µg/m3 in 2014–15. Although a longer period of monitoring will be needed to establish
     definite trends in concentrations, these initial improvements are reason for optimism.

     Box 1.3  Accounting for the Costs and Benefits of Air Pollution
     Control in the United States

     Every year, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports to Congress on the costs
     and benefits of federal regulations. OMB has consistently found that rules issued by the U.S. Envi-
     ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) to improve air quality are the most economically beneficial
     of all federal regulations. Indeed, OMB estimates that EPA regulations issued between 2004 and
     2014 to limit air pollution generated between $157 billion and $777 billion (constant year 2010
     prices) in benefits to the American economy, mainly by reducing the public health risks of expo-
     sure to fine particulate matter (OMB 2015). Implementing these rules costs between $37 billion
     and $44 billion, meaning the benefits have outweighed the costs by a ratio of at least 4 to 1.

populations also reap the benefits of policies to control pollution, making investing in air qual-
ity management highly cost-effective.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 details the 2013 estimates of
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study of air pollution exposure and health impacts,
which form the basis of the valuation exercise. Chapter 3 describes the methods and data for
the economic valuation of premature mortality costs and presents the results. Chapter 4 then
synthesizes the results and discusses the way forward.



The Context for This Report
This report emerged from a collaborative effort between the World Bank and the Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Seattle. IHME has
steered the international scientific effort behind the Global Burden of Disease Study since
publication of the 2010 study (Murray et al. 2012). GBD 2013 marks the latest stage in the
GBD process and represents the state of the art in the evolving science, which will continue to
be updated yearly. The GBD estimates currently offer the most extensive estimates of exposure
and trends in air pollution levels and their associated burden of disease. The partnership
between the World Bank and IHME speaks to the need for the development and scientific
communities to work together in solving environmental health problems.

This report also marks part of a renewed commitment by the World Bank to work with coun-
tries and stakeholders in tackling air pollution. A Bank-wide review published in early 2015
found that air pollution control is still given “low priority” within the Bank and by developing
countries (Awe et al. 2015). Responding to calls for greater action, in April 2015 the Bank
launched a new Pollution Management and Environmental Health (PMEH) program. This
study aims to further the objectives of the PMEH program by strengthening the economic
case for why countries need to take action to reduce air pollution and by raising awareness of
the scale of the problem.

A secondary objective of this report is to further the development of a consistent framework
for valuing the costs of air pollution across World Bank operations. Assessing potential invest-
ments and advising governments on policy are just two of the various activities the Bank
undertakes that require it to estimate the economic costs of pollution. Meanwhile, over the
past decades tremendous progress has been made in understanding both the epidemiology
and economics of health risks from pollution. This report has provided an opportunity to
assess what has been done and to bring more uniformity and consistency to the ways in which
pollution costs are valued across Bank operations. For example, the need for greater consis-
tency was noted in a 2014 review by Resources for the Future (RFF) of the World Bank’s meth-
odology for estimating damages from particulate emissions for the adjusted net savings (ANS)
indicator (Cropper and Khanna 2014). Following the RFF review, the authors of this report
undertook an extensive review of methodologies for valuing health risks from air pollution,
consulting with experts inside and outside the Bank. The findings of this review are detailed
in a technical background paper by Narain and Sall (2016), and its findings are implemented
in this report.

2. Health Impacts of Air Pollution
Introduction
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013 Collaborators 2015) estimates the bur-
den of disease attributable to air pollution in 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The results of
this study are presented in this chapter. The health impacts of air pollution include disease and
illnesses caused by exposure to ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5),
indoor concentrations of PM2.5 in households cooking with solid fuels, and ambient ozone
pollution. The study covers both urban and rural areas and measures changes in the disease
burden of air pollution over the extended study period (1990–2013). Global coverage is
achieved by integrating data from a wide variety of sources.

The first part of this chapter describes the process of estimating the disease burden attribut-
able to air pollution. The process begins by measuring the severity of air pollution and the
extent to which people who live in areas with poor ambient air quality or in households cook-
ing with solid fuels are exposed to this pollution. The study then evaluates how personal expo-
sure raises people’s relative risk of contracting illnesses such as ischemic heart disease (IHD),
stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, acute lower respiratory
infections (LRIs), and pneumonia. Elevated risk among the exposed population translates into
a higher portion of deaths from these conditions each year, which are attributed to air
pollution.

The second part of the chapter discusses trends in exposure to ambient and household air
pollution as well as the resulting health impacts. It reveals that air pollution is ranked fourth in
the risk factors leading to premature death worldwide.



Method for Satellite- and Model-Derived Estimates
of Ambient Air Pollution
Use of Satellite-Based Estimates for a Global Assessment
To make the greatest use of multiple and complementary sources of information in the most
reasonable way possible, the GBD approach to estimating ambient air pollution combines data
from ground monitoring with satellite observations and chemical transport models. In doing
so, the GBD estimates provide a consistent global picture and trend of exposure to ambient
PM2.5, which could not be constructed on the basis of any one source of data.

Although important for country- and city-level air quality planning, public communication,
and regulatory compliance, ground-level measurements alone are not sufficient to provide
global coverage to estimate exposure because of the spatial biases in the availability of ground-
level measurements, the differences in measurement approaches among jurisdictions, and the
absence of details about measurement data in some instances. Ground-level measurements of
air pollution, particularly PM2.5, are unavailable in much of the world, and especially in many


The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                           11
of the low- and middle-income countries. In addition to the inadequate and highly uneven
coverage of ground-level measurements, measurement protocols and techniques are not stan-
dardized globally, with different quality control programs and different numbers of samples to
arrive at annual averages. Even for measurements made by (similar) filter-based approaches,
filters are equilibrated at different relative humidity conditions prior to weighing (for example,
35 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent relative humidity in the United States, Canada, and
European Union, respectively) and therefore are not completely equivalent. In addition, PM10
measurements and PM2.5 /PM10 ratios are commonly used to infer PM2.5 concentrations for
ground-level estimates. Therefore, surface measurements, although a key component of any
global assessment approach, cannot be used solely to derive global exposure estimates.

Satellite-based measurements can help provide estimates for areas with no ground-level mon-
itoring networks. But even in North America, where monitor density is high in populated
areas, studies have indicated that satellite-based estimates do provide additional useful infor-
mation on spatial and temporal patterns of air pollution (Kloog et al. 2011, 2013; Lee et al.
2012). Furthermore, in a large population-based study in Canada the magnitudes of estimated
mortality effects of PM2.5 derived from ground measurements and satellite-based estimates
were identical (Crouse et al. 2012). Satellite-based estimates nonetheless must be used cau-
tiously, as discussed shortly.

Deriving Ambient Air Pollution Concentrations
Long-term average exposure to PM2.5 was estimated at 0.1° 3 0.1° resolution. Satellite-based
estimates that incorporated additional information on temporal trends were applied, as well as
chemical transport model simulations incorporating internally consistent emissions trends
from 1990 to 2013. Available surface measurements of PM2.5 were incorporated to calibrate the
estimates based on satellite retrievals and chemical transport model simulations. Data and
methodologies are summarized here and reported in more detail in Brauer et al. (2016).

A series of satellite-based estimates for PM2.5 were used, which included year-specific estimates
for 1998–2012. Satellite-based PM2.5 estimates used aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals
from multiple satellites to estimate near-surface PM2.5 by applying the relationship of PM2.5 to
AOD simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. These updated PM2.5 esti-
mates used both “unconstrained” and “optimal-estimation” AOD retrievals in combination
with the MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS satellite-borne instruments. These estimates were com-
bined with information on temporal variation based on SeaWiFS and MISR to estimate global
PM2.5 at 0.1° 3 0.1° for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2011.

TM5-FASST (FAst Scenario Screening Tool, a reduced-form version of the TM5 chemical
transport model) simulations for 1990, 2000, and 2010 were included, using an updated set of
emissions inventories and constant meteorological inputs and emissions from dust and sea salt
(see box 2.1 for the current understanding of the health impacts of dust and a discussion of
why these sources were included in exposure estimates). Emissions of windblown mineral
dust and sea salt were estimated in the TM5 model by incorporating information on land
cover and wind speed, combined with emission factors. For simulations, a constant “typical”
meteorologic year with corresponding emissions from windblown mineral dust and sea salt
was used. Year-to-year variations in emissions of windblown mineral dust and sea salt were,

  Box 2.1  Dust and Dust Storm Health Effects

  Because there is no evidence that the dust components of PM2.5 should be excluded when esti-
  mating health impacts, concentrations of windblown mineral dust and sea salt were included in
  estimating the health impacts of exposure to ambient PM2.5 for the GBD 2013 study. The cur-
  rent positions of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), World Health Organization
  (WHO), and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) are that an insufficient basis
  exists for using separate indicators for a specific PM2.5 component or group of components asso-
  ciated with any source category of fine particles. Many constituents of particulate matter can be
  linked with differing health effects, and the evidence is not yet sufficient to allow differentiation
  of those constituents or sources that are more closely related to specific health outcomes (EPA
  2009; IARC 2013; WHO 2014). Concentrations of windblown mineral dust and sea salt were
  therefore included in estimating the health impacts of exposure to ambient PM2.5 for the GBD
  2013 study.

  For windblown mineral dust specifically, there is substantial evidence of its association with mor-
  tality and morbidity during episodes of high concentrations such as Saharan dust storms that
  affect Europe (Perez et al. 2008; Mallone et al. 2011; Karanasiou et al. 2012), Asian dust storms
  (Chen et al. 2004; Bell, Levy, and Lin 2008), or regional episodes in the Middle East (Thalib and
  Al-Taiar 2012; Vodonos et al., 2014, 2015). Most of this evidence points to the coarse fraction of
  particulate matter, or to PM10, and not to the smaller proportion of dust that is in the PM2.5 frac-
  tion. In toxicology, there is no evidence that dust is more benign than other components of PM2.5
  (WHO 2014).




however, incorporated into the overall estimates because these sources are also captured by
remote sensing observations that contribute to the satellite-based estimates. Furthermore,
these sources contribute to ground-level measurements, and their influence is reflected to
some degree in the calibration, as described shortly.

A variety of information sources was used to collect updated ground-level PM2.5 measurement
data for 2010–13. These included national and European Union (EU) measurement databases
as well as new data where available, especially from China and India. Input from an interna-
tional group of GBD collaborators was sought; targeted searches for data were conducted; and
measurements were compiled from a literature search and from the 2014 WHO database on
ambient air pollution in cities. A final database was constructed, including measurement val-
ues, year of annual average (data for 2010–13 were targeted, and other years were used only if
no other data were available), site coordinates (if available, or city centroid coordinates if not
available), site type (if available), International Standard Organization (ISO) 3 country code,
data source, and whether PM2.5 was measured directly or estimated from a PM2.5/PM10 ratio.
The proportion of ground measurements based on direct measurement of PM2.5 versus esti-
mated by PM2.5 /PM10 ratios is presented in appendix table A.1. Although the use of PM10
measurements is a balance between provision of spatial coverage and the uncertainty that may
be introduced because of the use of a ratio to estimate PM2.5 levels, it is important to note that
in regions with either low numbers of measurements or a low percentage of direct PM2.5 mea-
surements, ground measurements will likely be more uncertain.

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                                    13
This combination of data from ground-level monitoring with satellite observations and chem-
ical transport models provides a globally consistent estimate of PM2.5 concentrations. The final
PM2.5 estimates used in the burden of disease estimation were calibrated against observations
from ground-level monitoring from more than 75 countries. The calibration equation was
estimated from 4,073 ground-level measurements of annual average concentrations, including
significant interaction terms for quality and accuracy of location of ground monitors.

All three sources of information incorporate strengths and limitations with different sources of
uncertainty, and so were combined for the exposure estimates. The mean of the TM5-FASST
and satellite-derived estimates was calculated for each grid cell, which inherently captures some
of the uncertainty between these two input sources. Furthermore, the error from the calibration
with ground measurements was used to propagate the uncertainty between the TM5-FASST
and satellite-based estimates and the ground measurements into the burden calculations.

This approach has some shortcomings, however, which should be considered when interpret-
ing the modeling results. For one thing, estimates for regions of elevated windblown mineral
dust have high levels of uncertainty. This uncertainty is partially driven by the TM5-FASST
use of standard dust contributions that do not align with a specific year and the temporally
variable levels of re-suspended mineral dust in affected regions. Even with ground-level mon-
itoring, in dusty areas it is hard to get accurate measurements of the dust contribution to PM2.5
because much of the dust is in larger size fractions; small errors or between-monitor differ-
ences in size fractionation can therefore result in large errors. That said, more surface mea-
surements from such locations will nonetheless be needed to reduce uncertainties related to
windblown mineral dust in the future (see appendix map A.1).

Furthermore, with regard to TM5-FASST, in locations where emissions sources are highly
variable and not well characterized, uncertainty is likely to be larger. This suggests, for exam-
ple, greater uncertainty in rapidly developing regions with high concentration levels. But, as
indicated earlier, these uncertainties are mitigated to some degree by the inclusion of both
satellite-based estimates and ground-level observations, which may better capture the dynamic
nature of emissions sources.

Finally, underestimation of ground measurements has been reported for satellite-based esti-
mates (see box 2.2), which may be more pronounced in locations that experience higher con-
centrations in wintertime and nighttime, when satellite observations are limited, compared
with other seasons in daytime (van Donkelaar et al. 2015). Furthermore, because of the spatial
resolution of TM5-FAAST, and to a lesser degree the satellite-based estimates, localized features
affecting concentrations, including topography and small emissions sources, are unlikely to be
well characterized. For example, underestimation of ground-level measurements in southern
Poland and Ulaanbaatar may stem from higher wintertime (and in Ulaanbaatar also nighttime)
emissions, when satellite retrievals are more limited because of the more frequent winter cloud
cover (or unavailability at night). This underestimation has also been described for the satellite-
based estimates alone by van Donkelaar et al. (2015). A similar phenomenon may also contrib-
ute to underestimation in Chile, where nighttime wood burning during winter contributes to
elevated PM2.5 concentrations. These underestimations of ground measurements in specific
locations were also evident in TM5-FASST simulations, suggesting that both chemical trans-
port model and satellite-based estimates may fail to accurately estimate ground-level PM2.5 in

relatively small areas having very high levels. Improvements in the spatial precision of emis-
sions estimates and satellite retrievals and use of regional models will reduce these uncertainties
in the future.

To estimate chronic long-term exposure to ozone, the TM5-FASST chemical transport model
and the same set of emissions used for PM2.5 were applied to calculate a running three-month
average of (daily one-hour maximum values) ozone concentrations for each grid cell over a
full year from which the maximum of these values was selected. This metric was chosen to
align with epidemiologic studies of chronic exposure, which typically employ a seasonal (sum-
mer) average (Jerrett et al. 2009), and to account for global variation in the timing of the ozone
(summer) season. These estimates were simulated with TM5-FASST at 0.1° 3 0.1° for 1990,
2000, and 2010 using the same emissions and meteorological inputs as for the PM2.5 simula-
tions. Estimates for 1995, 2005, 2011, and 2013 were generated with splines and extrapolations
as described earlier for PM2.5.

Population Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution
Estimates of population exposure to PM2.5 were developed in five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010
and for 2013 with 0.1° 3 0.1° resolution, using estimates from satellites and chemical transport mod-
els, calibrated with surface measurements. Similarly, for ozone, estimates of population exposure for
the same five-year intervals and for 2013 were estimated from the TM5-FASST chemical transport
model. Gridded exposure concentrations were aggregated to national-level, population-weighted
means with the corresponding grid cell population value.1 National-level, population-weighted
means and 95 percent uncertainty interval (UI) concentrations were estimated by sampling 1,000
draws of each grid cell value of the mean of the chemical transport model and satellite-based con-
centration estimates, in combination with the calibration parameters and the uncertainty of the cal-
ibration function. For ozone, population-weighted concentrations and 95  percent UI for each
country were estimated as for PM2.5, but assuming a normal distribution with a UI of ± 6 percent of
the estimated concentration.



Method for Estimating Exposure to Household Air
Pollution from Cooking with Solid Fuels
Exposure to household air pollution is defined as the 24-hour average of exposure to PM2.5
emitted from cooking with solid fuels such as coal, wood, charcoal, dung, and agricultural res-
idues. Estimates of exposure to household air pollution are not provided for high-income coun-
tries. Quantifying exposure to indoor air pollution by the average PM2.5 exposure associated
with household use of solid cooking fuel makes it possible to utilize the integrated exposure-
response (IER) curves needed to calculate the burden of indoor air pollution.

Although solid fuel use is an indirect measure of true exposure, this information is easier to
collect and more frequently reported in epidemiological studies than direct measures of
household air pollution. Therefore, estimation of exposure to household air pollution starts
with data on household use of solid fuels. Such data were extracted from nationally represen-
tative household surveys. Fuels such as coal, wood, charcoal, dung, and agricultural residues
were classified as solid fuels in this analysis. Data were extracted from 148 countries, and data

16	                            The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action
sources included in the database were primarily population-representative surveys such as the
Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Living Standards Mea-
surement Study, and national censuses. Country-specific data sources were also added for
subnational provinces in China and federal states in Mexico.

Next, the methodology requires translating solid fuel use into indoor PM2.5 concentrations.
Few efforts have been made in the past to systematically consolidate existing published evi-
dence on measured household indoor PM2.5 concentrations associated with the use of solid
cooking fuel. In its review of the existing PM2.5 literature, WHO does a commendable job of
consolidating the evidence, but the review is limited in that it only generates pooled regional
estimates for PM2.5 exposure (Balakrishnan et al. 2014). Therefore, the GBD PM2.5 database for
household indoor air pollution concentrations was compiled using extractions from the WHO
global database of household air pollution measurements (Balakrishnan et al. 2013; Forouzan-
far et al. 2015). The WHO PM2.5 database was augmented by conducting a systematic search
using the search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized by the WHO database to
include additional studies that were published between January 2011 and January 2015.

The final PM2.5 mapping data set comprised 66 studies from 16 countries contributing 363 obser-
vations of PM2.5 measurements (see appendix table A.2). Of the observations, 174 (47.9 percent)
were adjusted to ensure that all were as directly comparable as possible—for example, all mea-
sures were equivalent to the PM2.5 level in the kitchen. For this analysis, the optimal observation
measures the PM2.5 concentration of the household’s kitchen area, averaged over a period of
24 hours or longer so that the measures are representative of an individual’s average daily expo-
sure. In the GBD data set, measurements of PM2.5 exposure that were averaged over a period of
less than 24 hours were adjusted to reflect the reference definition of 24-hour average measure-
ments. Similarly, measurements made during times of unusually high exposure—for example,
during meal preparation or any other period of peak concentration—were adjusted to the stated
reference definition so that data points would be representative of the average daily exposure.

For the remaining countries, the 24-hour kitchen PM2.5 concentration was estimated using
models. Modeling the 24-hour kitchen PM2.5 concentration involved exploring covariates that
were selected based on recommendations in the literature. The selection of covariates was
largely limited by data availability. Potential covariates, including household-level cooking-
related variables, proportion of households using open or traditional stoves, and proportion of
households with kitchens located outdoors, were explored but did not show any significant
association. A number of environmental variables were considered at the country level, such
as average latitude by country, precipitation, mean temperature, and proportion of the popu-
lation living above the elevation of 1,500 meters. But none of these covariates showed any
significant association either, and no country covariate was used in the end. In the absence of
a significant predictor, a linear mixed model approach was used to model the average PM2.5
kitchen concentrations in households using solid cooking fuels in log space with random
intercepts by country, GBD analytical region, and GBD analytical super-region. The existing
published data on measured household PM2.5 concentrations were consolidated and then used
to generate systematically pooled average PM2.5 concentrations for all countries in order to
capture to some extent the geographic variation in PM2.5 exposure across the globe. This
approach resulted in a value for the level of PM2.5 for every region. That value was used to
quantify exposure to PM2.5 for residents of every country in the region that uses solid fuel.

Finally, indoor PM2.5 concentrations were translated into personal exposure estimates. Estima-
tion of the ratio of personal to area exposures was based on a subset of seven studies from six
countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas from the larger data set. The level of exposure was
defined at the personal level for 24-hour average kitchen exposure.

To cover all developing countries, exposure was modeled using a spatiotemporal Gaussian
process regression (GPR), a technique that is useful in estimating time series data because of
its ability to maintain correlation with uncertainty over time. This process is used for risk fac-
tors for which there is sufficient data density to estimate a flexible time trend (Forouzan-
far et al. 2015).

The personal exposure to PM2.5 among individuals residing in the same household has been
found to vary. Studies suggest that time-activity profiles of different individuals in the house-
hold differentially influence levels of personal exposure (Balakrishnan et al. 2013). To capture
this variation in personal exposure meaningfully for this analysis the average personal expo-
sure was estimated separately for males and females, and exposure of children under age 5 was
estimated with reference to women. The ratios of personal exposure for males, females, and
children under 5 to the kitchen PM2.5 concentration were calculated from the subset of seven
studies reporting both measures using time-activity recalls. The ratios were pooled using ran-
dom effect meta-analyses. Once the ratios were calculated, the personal exposure for the three
demographic groups was calculated by applying the ratios to the modeled estimates of kitchen
PM2.5 concentrations. One thousand random draws of kitchen PM2.5 concentrations were
applied to 1,000 draws of personal exposure and kitchen PM2.5 ratios to generate 1,000 draws
of average personal PM2.5 exposure levels for men, women, and children separately. Percentiles
at the 2.5th and 97.5th levels were calculated to generate the 95 percent uncertainty intervals
for every country-year.



Method for Estimating Health Outcomes from
Ambient and Household Air Pollution Exposure
The relative risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, lung cancer, and acute lower respiratory infections, as well as pneumonia in
children and adults from exposure to PM2.5 was estimated using cause-specific integrated
exposure-response functions (Burnett et al. 2014; Cohen et al. n.d.). The burden attributable
to ambient ozone was estimated only for COPD. The IER integrates published relative risk
estimates for PM2.5 from different sources of exposure (outdoor air pollution, second-hand
smoke, household air pollution, and active smoking) to estimate the relative risk of mortality
from exposure to PM2.5 over the entire global range (see box 2.3). The IERs were fit using a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and a modified power function.

The effects of household air pollution through PM2.5 were mapped and incorporated, so that
the same outcomes were included across smoking, second-hand smoke, ambient air pollution,
and indoor air pollution. The relative risks applied to cataracts, COPD, and lung cancer were
determined using direct epidemiologic evidence.

  Box 2.3  Integrated Exposure-Response (IER)

  Currently, there are insufficient epidemiologic data on the magnitude of mortality and disability
  associated with exposure to the high levels of ambient particulate air pollution in China, India,
  and other low- and middle-income countries. The IER was designed to allow the relative risk
  of exposure to be estimated over the entire global range of exposure under assumptions consis-
  tent with the most current epidemiologic evidence. The IER estimates appear to predict well the
  results of the limited studies that have been conducted in China (Burnett et al. 2014).

  The IER model uses relative risk estimates from the literature. These estimates allow it to be
  updated based on systematic reviews of the literature without requiring further analysis of pri-
  mary data not in the public domain. The IER integrates published evidence on the relative risks
  associated with cardiovascular disease and the lung cancer burden from four different types of
  PM2.5 exposure—ambient air pollution, second-hand tobacco smoke, active smoking, and house-
  hold air pollution—to help gain a better understanding of the shape of the exposure-response
  relationship of air pollution and adverse health outcomes over a broader range of exposures. This
  model allows estimation of risk over the full range of current human exposure to air pollution in
  places where no studies have been conducted, such as in much of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and
  the Middle East and North Africa.

  The IER model combines information on mortality relative risks from separate types of combus-
  tion, equating all types in terms of equivalent ambient PM2.5 exposures. Although it is assumed
  that the toxicity of PM2.5 exposure changes with the magnitude of exposure, it is also assumed that
  at a given exposure level, toxicity is roughly equivalent among all types and temporal patterns of
  PM2.5 exposure (Burnett et al. 2014).

  The IER model incorporates four levels of uncertainty: (1) in the model parameters; (2) in the
  PM2.5 exposure estimate; (3) in the counterfactual concentration of exposure; and (4) in the popu-
  lation attributable risk (Burnett et al. 2014). Briefly, uncertainty bounds in the IER are constructed
  by simulating 1,000 sets of relative risks and fitting the IER model to these values to capture 1,000
  sets of parameter values. These parameter estimates are then used to generate 1,000 IER functions
  over the range of global PM2.5 concentrations, as well as estimates of uncertainty for the PM2.5 con-
  centrations. Population attributable risk uncertainty is a function of the uncertainty in the model
  predictions and the exposure estimates.




When direct evidence was not available for outcomes such as ischemic heart disease, cardio-
vascular disease, and LRIs, risk ratios generated from the IER were used. To utilize evidence
from integrated exposure curves, PM2.5 mapping values for all country-years were generated
using a meta-analysis of published studies that measured PM2.5 levels associated with house-
hold use of solid cooking fuels. IERs for IHD, stroke, lung cancer and COPD, and LRIs are
provided in figure 2.1, and further details on the IERs can be found in Cohen et al. (n.d.).

In the absence of empirical studies of their joint effects, the effects of exposure to ambient air
pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) are assumed to be independent. There-
fore, although household and outdoor air pollution are related—and sometimes one is the
major source of the other—the two exposures are measured independently (AAP by satellite

and ground-level monitors and HAP by household surveys), and their effects are calculated
independently. If in some areas solid fuel use is the main source of AAP, both risks affect peo-
ple living in these areas through ambient exposure and household exposure. However, the
correlation between AAP and HAP was not included because it was assumed that exposure to
HAP imposes an extra risk on exposure to AAP. Thus assuming there is no interaction between
the two exposures (they happen at different times during a 24-hour period rather than stack-
ing on the IER curve), the overall risk is a product of the two relative risks (see appendix A for
more details). Similarly, risk of respiratory disease from ozone is assumed to be independent
of risk from exposure to PM2.5.

The main sources of uncertainty of the exposure-response functions and burden estimates for
AAP and HAP are sampling error originating from component studies and the uncertainty of
parameters in the IER curve function.



Trends in Exposure and Health Impacts from Ambient
and Household Air Pollution
Total Health Impacts of Air Pollution
Air pollution (comprising household air pollution, ambient PM2.5, and ambient ozone) was the
fourth most important risk in 2013 leading to early death. It was associated with 5.5 million
premature deaths in 2013—that is, 1 in 10 deaths (see figure 1.1). Air pollution accounted for
a larger proportion of total years of life lost (YLLs) than years lived with disability (YLDs); just
over 1 percent of total YLDs in 2013 were attributed to air pollution. As a risk factor, its rank
has remained unchanged since 1990, when it was also the fourth leading risk factor for prema-
ture mortality. Then, air pollution accounted for 4.8 million deaths.

Because of their share in the total population and because of high exposure levels, the major-
ity of deaths attributed to air pollution occurred in East Asia and the Pacific (40 percent)
and South Asia regions (33 percent)—see figure 2.2. As a percentage of total deaths, deaths
attributable to air pollution were significant in other regions as well. In East Asia and the
Pacific and South Asia, about 14 percent of all deaths were attributable to air pollution in
2013; in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the Middle East and North Africa, 7 percent (see fig-
ure 2.3). Furthermore, air pollution was the fourth leading cause of premature death in the
latter two regions.

From 1990 to 2013, East Asia and the Pacific saw a slight decline in the share of air pollution
in total mortality, from 14.9 percent to about 14.4 percent, whereas South Asia saw a signifi-
cant increase, from 10.5 percent to 13.7 percent.

In 2013 South Asia had the most deaths per 100,000 people from air pollution (106 per 100,000
persons), followed by East Asia and the Pacific (99 per 100,000) and Sub-Saharan Africa (64
per 100,000). Latin America and the Caribbean and North America had the lowest deaths per
100,000 people from air pollution in 2013: 28 and 29 per 100,000, respectively. Deaths per
100,000 people from air pollution in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia have dropped

pollution was found in the upper-middle-income countries (12.9 percent)—see figure 2.4. The
share of air pollution in all-cause mortality has increased for low- and lower-middle-income
countries and decreased for all other income levels.

Deaths per 100,000 people were highest for the lower-middle-income countries (88 per 100,000
persons) in 2013, followed by the upper-middle-income countries (85 per 100,000) and low-
income countries (80 per 100,000). On a more disaggregated basis, the health burden of air pol-
lution was particularly heavy for low-income countries (164 deaths per 100,000) and upper-
middle-income countries (116 deaths per 100,000) in East Asia and the Pacific in 2013, followed
by low-income and lower-middle-income countries in South Asia, each of which saw 106 deaths
per 100,000 in 2013.

Male deaths per 100,000 from air pollution (85 per 100,000 persons) were higher than female
deaths (68 per 100,000) in 2013. Although male deaths were also higher in 1990, so were
deaths per 100,000 for both men and women, at 93 per 100,000 for males and 88 per 100,000
for females. In 2013 about 5 percent of deaths of children under 5 were attributed to air pollu-
tion, compared with less than 3 percent among older children and young adults and more than
10 percent for older adults in every age group above 50. The same age patterns of mortality
risks were found in 1990 as well.

Trends in Ambient Air Pollution Exposure
and Health Impacts
Exposure
Based on the grid-cell concentration estimates and corresponding population data for 2013,
about 87 percent of the world’s population lived in areas that exceeded the World Health Orga-
nization’s Air Quality Guideline of an annual average of 10 micrograms per cubic meter
(µg/m3) for PM2.5. Thirty-five percent of the global population resided in areas with concen-
trations above the WHO Interim Target 1 of an annual average of 35 µg/m3 PM2.5, with nearly
all of the most extreme (higher than 65 µg/m3) concentrations experienced by populations in
China and India.

The highest concentrations of PM2.5 in 2013 were in North Africa and the Middle East because
of emissions of windblown mineral dust, and in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific,
especially in northern India and eastern China, because of combustion emissions from multi-
ple sources, including household solid fuel use, coal-fired power plants, agricultural burning,
and industrial and transportation-related sources (see map 2.1). At the country level, the
highest population-weighted mean concentration estimated for 2013 was in Mauritania
(70 µg/m3), followed by China (55 µg/m3) and Saudi Arabia (54 µg/m3). The lowest coun-
try-level population-weighted estimates (at or below 6 µg/m3) were for several Pacific and
Caribbean island nations, Australia, and Norway.

Between 1990 and 2013, decreases in population-weighted mean concentrations of PM2.5 were
reported in most high-income countries, in contrast to the increases estimated in South Asia,
throughout much of Southeast Asia, and in China. There were large relative decreases in con-
centrations in the eastern United States, Europe, and the Russian Federation, and in parts of
East Asia and the Pacific. By contrast, large relative increases were apparent in western Can-
ada, parts of South America, the Middle East, India, and China (map 2.2).

Between 1990 and 2013, population-weighted ozone concentrations increased by 8.9 percent.
Some regions saw an increase; others saw a decline. Increases of 10–20 percent were observed
in China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Brazil, while decreases were observed in the United
States and Indonesia, for example.

Health Impacts
Ambient PM2.5 (APM) pollution was responsible for more than 2.9 million deaths in 2013 (a
30 percent increase from 1990). Of those deaths, 1.7 million were males and 1.2 million were
females.

The strong rising trend in total deaths accelerated after 2000, driven largely by China. In 1990
there were 2.2 million APM-associated deaths, increasing 8 percent, to 2.4 million, in 2000,
followed by a 21 percent increase to 2.9 million deaths in 2013. Four factors played a role in
the upward trend in the number of APM deaths, including increases in PM2.5 exposure in a
number of countries with very large populations (China, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan),
population growth, population aging, and changes in the prevalence of diseases affected by air
pollution. Although the majority of deaths were in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia,
all regions other than Europe and Central Asia and North America saw an increase in the
number of deaths (figure 2.5).

Exposure to ambient PM2.5 was the seventh-ranked risk associated with death in 2013 (see
figure 2.6). More than 5.3 percent of deaths in 2013 worldwide were attributable to exposure
to PM2.5. The PM2.5 risk increased from 4.7 percent of deaths in 1990, when it was the 10th
highest ranked risk factor. The main outcome of PM2.5 risk is cardiovascular disease, including
IHD and stroke, and cancers. In 1990 lower respiratory infections were the second most
important outcome of PM2.5 risk, with about 1 percent of total deaths caused by pneumonia
attributable to PM2.5. Two million cardiovascular disease deaths (3.7 percent of global deaths)
and 387,000 cancer deaths (0.7 percent of global deaths) were attributable to PM2.5 risk in 2013.
Globally in 2013, PM2.5 exposure caused 13.6 percent of IHD deaths, 14.5 percent of stroke
deaths, 23.6 percent of lung cancer deaths, 5.7 percent of COPD deaths, and 12.4 percent of
pneumonia deaths.

Globally, exposure to PM2.5 and the fraction of outcomes attributable to PM2.5 have not
improved over the last 23 years. The trend line for the cause-specific attributable fraction
shows the trend in exposure. The global population attributable fraction for ischemic heart
disease decreased between 1990 and 2000, revealing a brief improvement in air quality and
reduction in exposure (figure 2.7). However, exposure increased from 2000 to 2010, with the

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                                                            29
trend slowing after 2010. The increase is more prominent among younger populations in the
world. The change in the all-age attributable rate is a function of three factors: (1) population
aging, which tends to increase rates because cardiovascular outcome rates are higher in older
ages; (2) changes in the baseline rate unrelated to air pollution—examples are other risk fac-
tors such as smoking or access to care and better survival of patients; and (3) changes in the
exposure to air pollution. It appears that since 2005 the increase in global exposure to air pol-
lution and population aging has outpaced the decrease in the baseline trend that began before
the 1990s, changing the trend to slightly upward. The role of different factors is discussed
further in Cohen et al. (n.d.).

Deaths per 100,000 people for all ages decreased slightly between 1990 and 2000, from 42
deaths per 100,000 persons to 40 per 100,000, but rose slightly to 41 deaths per 100,000 in
2013, revealing that the trend in the 1990s was mainly driven by population growth. All regions
other than Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa saw a decrease in number of
deaths per capita from PM2.5 pollution between 1990 and 2013 (figure 2.8).

Global age-standardized death rates (ASDRs), which are adjusted for population growth and
aging change by time and are suitable for comparing the per capita disease burden for different
years, reveal a somewhat different picture. Since 1990, there has been a monotonic decrease,
from 62 deaths per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 48 per 100,000 in 2013, with an annual decline
of about 1.1 percent. The decline in the ASDR reflects overall improvement in health in these

countries—for example, a decline in the impact of childhood respiratory diseases. The excep-
tions are countries in East Asia and the Pacific (including Cambodia and the Marshall Islands),
Latin America and the Caribbean (including Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay),
and South Asia (including Bangladesh and Pakistan). Bolivia has experienced the greatest rate
of change, with a 6.3 percent increase, followed by Mozambique (4.2 percent) and Zambia
(2.9 percent). The greatest decline from 1990 to 2013 occurred in Norway, with an 8.2 percent
decrease, followed by Australia (–7.4 percent) and Ireland (–6.9 percent). The age-standardized
death rates from PM2.5 are highest in developing countries in South Asia (77 deaths per 100,000),
East Asia and the Pacific (56 per 100,000), and the Middle East and North Africa (52  per
100,000)—see map 2.3. People living in Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Yemen are at the high-
est risk of death from PM2.5 exposure.

The total deaths and deaths per 100,000 people associated with APM increase by age. In 2013
there were just over 120,000 deaths from APM among children under 5 (a figure that declined
to fewer than 10,000 deaths among older children) and substantially higher rates in the mid-
dle-aged and older groups (figure 2.9). The mortality rate in 2013 was 18 deaths per 100,000
persons under age 5 (driven mostly by lower respiratory infections), increasing to 397 per
100,000 in people over age 70 (driven largely by cardiovascular diseases and cancers). The age
pattern in the burden of DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) shifted somewhat, with a higher
peak among young children and then again among adults ages 60–64. For younger children,
this increase in burden is explained by the greater loss of life years from premature death and
more years lived with disabilities.

The level of exposure and adverse health effects of PM2.5 differ greatly among income groups.
In 2013 ambient air pollution exposure was associated with 4.1 percent of all deaths in
high-income countries, where the percentage of deaths has been declining since 1990. In all
other regions, the percentage of total deaths attributable to APM has increased, from
2.3  percent in 1990 to 3.5 percent in 2013 in low-income countries, from 4.0 percent to
5.1  percent in lower-middle-income countries, and from 5.7 percent to 7.4 percent in
upper-middle-income countries (see figure 2.10). In 2013, 75 percent of PM2.5 deaths
occurred in middle-income countries, and the age-standardized attributable death rate was
nearly three times higher in lower-middle-income countries than in high-income countries.
Death rates for lower respiratory infections attributable to PM2.5 among children under 5
were more than 60 times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.

The burdens associated with PM2.5 in high-income countries compared with low- and middle-
income countries have changed in different ways. In high-income countries, the proportion of
PM2.5-attributable IHD deaths decreased from 12.3 percent in 1990 to 9.4 percent in 2013. In
low-income countries, it increased from 13.6 percent to 15.5 percent, and in lower- and
upper-middle-income countries it increased slightly as well, from 15.7 percent to 16.3 percent
and from 13.9 percent to 14.4 percent, respectively.

    For ambient air pollution, health risks tended to be greater for lower-middle-income countries
    and lower for countries at higher income levels (figure 2.11).

    Exposure to ozone contributed to 217,000 premature deaths from COPD in 2013. Although
    the numbers of deaths from ambient ozone pollution are much smaller than those attributable
    to ambient PM2.5, deaths from ambient ozone increased in all regions globally (figure 2.12). As

discussed earlier, deaths from ambient PM2.5 decreased in Europe and Central Asia and North
America, although they increased in the rest of the regions (figure 2.5). The increase in deaths
from ozone exposure reflects both an increase in levels of ozone and increased COPD
mortality.



Trends in Household Air Pollution Exposure
and Health Impacts
Exposure
Based on estimates only for low- and middle-income countries, 42.2 percent of the world’s
population was exposed to household air pollution from solid fuels in 2013. The highest
average levels of population exposure to HAP worldwide were in Sub-Saharan Africa, rang-
ing from 12 percent in Djibouti to 99.5 percent in Rwanda, and East Asia and the Pacific,
ranging from 24.3 percent in the Marshall Islands to 90.9 percent in Myanmar. The lowest
country-level exposure (below 0.05 percent) was in the Republic of Korea, Qatar, Lebanon,
and the United Arab Emirates. Among low-income countries, the lowest exposures were in
Eritrea (61.3 percent) and Zimbabwe (66.2 percent).

Between 1990 and 2013, declines in HAP exposure were evident in most countries, ranging
from nearly 100 percent in many higher-income countries to under 10 percent across much of
Sub-Saharan Africa. At the country level, Korea (–99.3 percent) and the Arab Republic of
Egypt (–94.9 percent) had the largest declines in HAP exposure from 1990 to 2013. Very few
countries saw increases in exposure to HAP, apart from Guinea-Bissau, the Marshall Islands,

and Sierra Leone, which saw slight total growth in exposure (an additional 2–6 percent of their
populations) between 1990 and 2013. Russia also saw a very slight increase, but the total esti-
mated exposure in both time periods was below 1 percent of the population.

Health Impacts
Household air pollution was responsible for 2.9 million deaths in 1990, a number that remained
constant over time, with 2.9 million deaths globally in 2013 (see figure 2.13a). In 2013 among
males, 1.6 million deaths were attributable to HAP; among females, 1.3 million deaths. This
finding is surprising because women are typically exposed to higher concentrations of indoor air
pollution as they are primarily responsible for cooking in the household. This result, however, is
driven by differences in the distribution of the number of deaths from ischemic heart disease by
age of men and women. Age-specific population attributable fractions are lower among men
than among women for all of the health outcomes linked to household air pollution, which is to
be expected by their differing levels of exposure. In other words, at any specific age, a smaller
fraction of premature deaths for men is attributed to exposure to indoor air pollution. However,
the highest number of IHD deaths occurs among men at age 60, while the number is greatest
among women at 80 and up, and the fraction of premature deaths attributable to IHD is higher
at younger ages (figure 2.14). Therefore, although a smaller fraction of premature deaths for men
is attributable to household air pollution at any given age, a greater fraction of premature deaths
is attributable to HAP for both men and women at a younger age. Because more men die at a
younger age, a higher number of deaths is attributable to HAP for males.

Exposure to household air pollution from solid fuels caused a health loss of 101.6 million
DALYs globally in 1990. By 2013 the burden of HAP had decreased by 20.2 percent, to
81.1 million DALYs, accounting for just over 3 percent of global DALYs in 2013.

Exposure to HAP was the eighth-ranked risk associated with death globally in 2013, behind
ambient air pollution and ahead of high cholesterol, alcohol use, and childhood undernutri-
tion. More than 5 percent of all deaths in 2013 were attributable to exposure to household air
pollution. In 1990 HAP was the fourth-leading risk associated with deaths globally. The main
outcomes of HAP exposure are cardiovascular diseases (stroke and IHD), COPD, lower respi-
ratory infections, and lung cancer. In 1990 the most important outcome of HAP risk was car-
diovascular disease, with 1.5 million deaths (or 2.7 percent of total deaths). In 2013, 818,000
COPD deaths (1.5 percent of global deaths), 449,000 LRI deaths (0.8 percent of global deaths),
and 128,000 cancers (0.23 percent of global deaths) were attributable to HAP. Globally in 2013,
HAP was responsible for 12.1 percent of stroke deaths, 8.8 percent of IHD deaths, 27.9 percent
of COPD deaths, 16.9 percent of LRI deaths, and 7.8 percent of lung cancer deaths.

Exposure to household air pollution is also associated with cataracts, a nonfatal outcome.
About 21 percent of the burden of cataracts (measured in terms of DALYs) is attributable to
exposure to HAP, and it primarily affects older women after prolonged exposure. DALYs asso-
ciated with cataracts from exposure to HAP increased by 42.5 percent from 1990 to 2013,
although the proportion of total cataract DALYs decreased slightly (from 23.3 percent in 1990
to 21 percent in 2013). Disability associated with cataracts from exposure to HAP is concen-
trated in Asia—India, China, and Indonesia.

Deaths per 100,000 people for all ages due to HAP exposure decreased steadily from 1990 to
2013, from 54 per 100,000 persons to 40 per 100,000 (figure 2.13b). The age-standardized
death rate from HAP tells a similar story, declining steadily from 1990 (75 per 100,000) to 2013
(47 per 100,000), a 37.5 percent drop. However, there are exceptions in some countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Egypt had the greatest annual percentage decrease from 1990 to 2013 at –17.9
percent, followed by St. Vincent and the Grenadines (–10.7 percent) and the Maldives (–10.1
percent). The largest annualized increases were in the Marshall Islands (1.0 percent), Zambia
(0.9 percent), and Lesotho (0.6 percent). The highest age-standardized death rates from HAP
were in South Asia (123.3 per 100,000), Sub-Saharan Africa (108.9 per 100,000), and East Asia
and the Pacific (53.2 per 100,000). At the country-level, the highest age-standardized death

rates were in Afghanistan (251.8 deaths per 100,000), Madagascar (204.0 per 100,000), and
Guinea-Bissau (178 per 100,000)—see map 2.4.

The main factors playing a role in the HAP burden trends include population growth, popula-
tion aging, changes in individual risk, and decreased population exposure. Population growth
increases the total burden, as does population aging, because the incidence of outcomes
increases with age. Population growth partly explains why the total number of deaths attribut-
able to HAP has remained constant, even as exposure has declined in many places, resulting in
declining death rates over the same period. Although the prevalence of diseases affecting older
people has been increasing—and this, along with population growth, has kept the absolute
numbers steady—the prevalence of lower respiratory infections in young children has been
decreasing. The declining burden among young children to some extent counterbalances the
increasing burden among older people.

The fraction of outcomes attributable to HAP has improved steadily over the last 23 years. The
global population attributable fraction for COPD decreased from 1990 to 2013, revealing a
global reduction in household air pollution and improvement in exposure to cooking fuels.

The decrease is more prominent among females, although the population attributable fraction
has declined substantially for both sexes.

The pattern of declining risk is more nuanced for specific age groups (figure 2.15). Total deaths
are down by almost 60 percent among children under 5. The biggest declines in DALYs are in
the younger age groups, but even among those 70 and older improvements are visible: DALYs
per capita declined 36 percent, from 7,031.4 per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 4,480.6 per 100,000
in 2013. The death rate in 2013 was 33.1 per 100,000 among children under 5 (driven mainly
by lower respiratory infections). Among people over age 70 from 1990 to 2013, the death rate
from HAP decreased from 557 deaths per 100,00 to 368.6 deaths per 100,000 (the difference
in the 2013 under 5 and 70 plus rates is driven in large part by cardiovascular diseases—stroke
and IHD).

The constant trend in total number of deaths from indoor air pollution between 1990 and
2013 hides important regional variations. Although the total number of deaths fell in East Asia
and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle
East and North Africa, the number of deaths increased substantially in South Asia (26 per-
cent) and Sub-Saharan Africa (21 percent)—see figure 2.16.

Trends in the health effects of household air pollution also differ across income groups (fig-
ure 2.17). In 2013 household air pollution exposure was associated with 5.7 percent of all deaths
in upper-middle-income countries, and the percentage of deaths attributable to HAP has been

income countries, the proportion of deaths from HAP hovered at around 7 percent from 1990
to 2013. Two-thirds of HAP deaths occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries in
2013, a change from 1990 when nearly half of HAP deaths occurred in upper-middle-income
countries.

Because access to nonsolid fuels tends to improve for countries with higher incomes, death
rates are lower (figure 2.18).

The Evolution of GBD Estimates

The results of the GBD 2010 study, which estimated air pollution exposure and health out-
comes across the globe, both established air pollution as a major risk factor for mortality and
significantly advanced the methodology for making such estimates. Because the GBD collab-
oration is committed to continually updating estimates using improved data and methods,
changes were made to the estimation process between GBD 2010 and GBD 2013, which led to
some differences in the findings.

For ambient air pollution, improvements since GBD 2010 include expansion of the available
ground-level data, which have been augmented by means of a literature review, web scraping,
and contact with experts worldwide (Forouzanfar et al. 2015). In addition, the satellite-based

estimates were enhanced to more accurately reflect ground concentrations and to characterize
trends over time (from 1990 to 2013), and methodological advancements allowed calibration
of estimates across the full range of particulate matter concentrations (Brauer et al. 2016). The
IERs were updated with the results of new epidemiologic studies and were fit to the data using
a Bayesian approach. The GBD 2013 IERs estimate lower relative risks for LRIs, IHD, stroke,
and COPD and higher relative risks for lung cancer than the GBD 2010 IERs (Forouzan-
far  et  al. 2015). Pneumonia was added as an outcome of tobacco smoking, and PM2.5 was
expanded to cover adult lower respiratory infections (Forouzanfar et al. 2015).

For household air pollution, the main improvement in methodology since 2010 was in the
exposure modeling step. In GBD 2010, a mixed-effect linear model was used to generate the
time series for all country-years included in the analysis, but for GBD 2013 the decision was
made to utilize instead the spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (Forouzanfar et al.
2015). In addition, the mapping of proxy measures of exposure to what is actually experienced
(in order to estimate IER relative risks) is now based on 67 studies from eight regions (rather
than one study from India), and uncertainty is now propagated from the mapping to the final
results. This change has led to a widening of uncertainty and captures regional variation in the
level of household PM2.5 exposure (Forouzanfar et al. 2015).

GBD 2010 relied on the most directly available data on average PM2.5 exposure among house-
holds using solid cooking fuels. Average PM2.5 exposure for households reporting the use of
solid cooking fuel was first derived from measurements in rural households of multiple Indian
states and nationally representative Indian data on covariates associated with cooking prac-
tices (Balakrishnan et al. 2013). These estimates for India were applied across the globe. For

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                                                           43
GBD 2013, the WHO PM2.5 database was augmented to include additional studies published
between January 2011 and January 2015, expanding the pool of observations included in the
latter study.

The GBD 2013 PM2.5 air pollution burden estimates also added mortality estimates for pneu-
monia in adults to the outcomes previously included in GBD 2010. The relative risk of mortal-
ity from pneumonia in adults was estimated by adding relative risk estimates for pneumonia
mortality from a study of adult tobacco smoking to the previous IER for acute lower respira-
tory infection (ALRI) mortality, and this updated IER was used to estimate the ALRI and
pneumonia burden attributable to PM2.5 in both children and adults.

The use of IER curves in estimating the burden of household air pollution has been an impor-
tant advance in terms of increasing consistency in estimates generated for different sources of
particulate matter, including active smoking, second-hand smoke, ambient air pollution, and
household air pollution. For example, the IER allows an estimate to be made of the burden of
disease from heart disease and stroke attributable to household air pollution in the absence of
direct epidemiologic evidence, thereby avoiding the untenable alternative that such high expo-
sures to particulate air pollution pose no risk. That said, the absence of empirical research on
exposure to household air pollution and mortality from cardiovascular disease is an important
source of uncertainty about the true magnitude of the HAP-attributable burden of disease.

The GBD 2013 exposure estimates used the ground measurements of PM2.5 in an advanced
regression calibration model, with additional site parameters (whether the PM2.5 concentra-
tion was directly measured, whether the exact site location was known, and whether the mon-
itoring site classification was known), which were further evaluated by a cross-validation
procedure in which 10 percent of the measurement sites were randomly selected for model
evaluation. In cross-validation, our estimates explain 64 percent of the variability in measure-
ments. Additional changes were further elaborated by Brauer et al. (2016).

The global number of deaths attributable to household air pollution in 2010, estimated by
GBD 2010, was just under 3.5 million. GBD 2013 revised that number down to just over
2.9 million deaths in 2010. Similarly, GBD 2010 estimated about 3.2 million deaths from ambi-
ent PM2.5 pollution in 2010, which GBD 2013 re-estimated at just under 2.8 million. Likewise,
the re-estimated global burden for both AAP and HAP moved both numbers downward. Dif-
ferences in the estimated burden are a result of improvements in the methodology and avail-

3. Economic Impacts of Air Pollution
Introduction
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates of air pollution exposure and health impacts
provide a truly global view of the health toll of air pollution, and they are the basis for assessing
the economic costs of pollution for the world’s economies. The costs of pollution are myriad.
From reducing crop yields to lowering property values to steering talented workers away from
polluted places, many of these costs are beyond the scope of this study. Instead, this chapter
focuses on what previous studies have found is by far and away the most damaging of eco-
nomic cost of pollution—the cost of premature mortality.



Methods and Data
Using the GBD data on the health impacts of air pollution, this chapter estimates the costs of
premature mortality for more than 180 countries. The technical details of the methodology for
valuing these costs are provided in the background paper prepared for this report by Narain
and Sall (2016). A brief summary of that methodology follows.

GBD 2013 provides estimates for a range of health metrics associated with air pollution,
whereas this report looks specifically at the monetary costs of premature mortality as mea-
sured in terms of premature deaths. Nonfatal health outcomes are excluded from the scope of
analysis for two reasons. First, morbidity makes up a very small share of the total health
impacts of air pollution as estimated for GBD 2013, and regulatory analyses of air pollution
control policies in the United States and elsewhere have consistently found that the majority of
economic benefits accrued by improving air quality take the form of avoided premature deaths.
By focusing on premature mortality, this global assessment aims to account for the largest
component of the economic costs arising from the health impacts of pollution. Excluding
morbidity costs does not significantly influence the overall magnitude of the cost estimates,
although nonfatal outcomes may represent at least another 10 percent of total costs (Hunt
et al. 2016). Second, unlike for morbidity costs, a standard framework exists for valuing fatality
risks that is supported by a well-developed body of economic theory and empirical studies
(Narain and Sall (2016)).

                                                                                    ­ elfare-based
This report takes two approaches to valuing the costs of premature mortality: (1) a w
approach that monetizes the increased fatality risk from air pollution according to individuals’
willingness to pay (WTP); and (2) an income-based approach that equates the financial cost of
premature mortality with the present value of forgone lifetime earnings. Each of these
approaches is given equal weight, although they are tailored to different purposes.

The income-based approach is more suited to financial analysis and measuring pollution costs
within the extended boundaries of the national accounts—for example, as a component of the
World Bank’s adjusted net savings (ANS) measure. ANS, or “genuine savings,” is a measure of
the change in the value of a nation’s assets, including manufactured capital as well as natural
and human capital (see Hamilton and Clemens 1999; World Bank 2005, 2011). Positive

savings represents an investment in future well-being as a nation accumulates the assets
needed to drive economic growth and at least sustain current levels of consumption. Within
the ANS framework, premature mortality due to pollution represents a dis-investment in a
nation’s human capital stock. As with the degradation of other forms of capital, this dis-invest-
ment is valued according to the expected loss of income over the lifetime of the asset. The
Ministry of Social Development in Chile, for example, has adopted this approach for valuing
premature mortality (Chile MDS 2014). A common criticism of this approach is that it excludes
losses suffered by individuals outside the labor force, including retirees. The income-based
approach also raises questions about how unpaid work that contributes to the economy, such
as subsistence farming and domestic activities, should be valued.

The welfare-based approach is more appropriate for evaluating the full economic costs of
premature mortality, which encompass the loss of many other things that individuals value
apart from their paychecks, including consumption, leisure, good health, and simply being
alive. This value is reflected in the WTP, which captures the marginal trade-offs that individ-
uals are willing to make to reduce their chances of dying. The value of statistical life (VSL)
represents the sum of many individuals’ WTP for marginal reductions in their mortality
risks. It is not the value of any single person’s life or death, nor does it represent a society’s
judgment as to what that value should be. The WTP-based approach is best suited for analy-
ses of economic welfare, and it has become the standard approach in high-income countries
for valuing mortality risks associated with pollution (see Viscusi 1993; Cropper 2000;
OECD 2012).

Because WTP studies are still lacking in many of the world’s countries, the only practical way
to implement a welfare-based approach in a global cost assessment is to come up with a strat-
egy for adjusting some “base VSL” from the original context in which it was studied (such as
the United States) to the context of other countries. The adjustments need to account for char-
acteristics that are likely to influence how individuals under different circumstances value
mortality risks. One of the most salient characteristics is income. Both theory and the empir-
ical evidence have consistently shown that the willingness to pay for mortality risk reductions
increases for individuals with higher incomes. Because a number of studies have quantified
the income elasticity of the VSL (that is, the percent change in the WTP per percent change in
income), these studies can provide a basis for adjusting to different circumstances—see Narain
and Sall (2016) for a literature review of studies of the VSL.

Country-specific VSLs are determined using a benefit-transfer approach that first assumes a
base VSL of $3.83 million.1 This base VSL estimate represents the mean VSL estimate from a
database of quality-screened WTP studies conducted in high-income member countries of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).2 The countries
included in this collection of studies have an average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
of about $37,000. The base VSL estimate is then transferred to other countries and years using
                                                               e
                                                        Y 
	                                VSLc ,n   = VSLOECD 3  c ,n  	(3.1)
                                                        YOECD 




48	                           The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action
where VSLc,n is the VSL for country c in year n; VSLOECD is the average base VSL estimate from
the sample of WTP studies in OECD countries (in 2011 U.S. dollars at purchasing power par-
ity, PPP, rates); Yc,n is GDP per capita for country c in year n (adjusted for price inflation and
converted to 2011 U.S. dollars at PPP rates); YOECD is the average GDP per capita for the base
sample of OECD countries; and e is the income elasticity of the VSL. For this study, differenti-
ated elasticity values are assumed for low- and middle-income countries versus high-income
countries. For low- and middle-income countries, a central value of 1.2 is assumed, with a
range from 1.0 to 1.4 for sensitivity analysis. For high-income countries, a central value of 0.8
is assumed, with a range from 0.6 to 1.0 for sensitivity analysis—see Narain and Sall (2016) for
detailed discussion on choice of elasticity.

As for the income-based approach, forgone labor output per premature death is obtained by
first calculating the present value (PV) of the expected stream of future per capita labor
income as


                                 PV ( I ) = ∑ i = 0 I 0 (1 + g )i /(1 + r )i 	(3.2)
                                              T
	


where I0 is average labor income per capita in the present year; T is the expected number of
working years for the average person in a particular age group; g is the annual rate of income
growth; and r is the social discount rate. In keeping with recent guidance by the World Bank
on estimating long-term rates of growth and setting social discount rates for project economic
analysis, the discount rate (r) is set at 6 percent for low- and middle-income countries3 and at
4 percent for high-income countries, and the annual growth rate for real income per capita (g)
is set at 3 percent for low- and middle-income countries and at 2 percent for high-income
countries.

Ideally, I would be differentiated by age group because people of different ages may have vary-
ing levels of education, experience, and other characteristics that affect their earning potential.
However, the lack of detailed wage data in many countries does not allow for this level of dis-
aggregation in a global assessment. Instead, average per capita labor income is estimated from
the labor share of GDP (s) for each country as


	                                         I = (GDP  s )/ w 	(3.3)


so that average income is equal to the total wage bill divided by the total number of employed
workers (w). Data on s are drawn from the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and Tim-
mer 2015), Conference Board Total Economy Database, International Labour Organization
(ILO 2014), Lenzen et al. (2012, 2013), OECD aggregate national accounts, and United
Nations national accounts.4 Estimates of w are obtained from the World Bank’s World Devel-
opment Indicators database. Because of the year-on-year volatility in GDP and wages, aver-
age labor income per worker is taken as a five-year running average.

Working life expectancy, T, is calculated by weighting life expectancy to maximum working
age by the probability that an individual will survive and be active in the labor force. It is
expressed as

                                                 ∑
                                                     79
	                                         Tj =       t= j
                                                            s j ,t  l t 	(3.4)


where sj,t is the probability that a person of age j will survive to the end of age t, and l is the labor
force participation rate.5 ILO estimates of l are available by five-year age group for ages 15–64
and for the open-ended 65 and up age group.6 The probability of being economically active in
any given year is assumed to be independent of whether an individual was active in previous
years, so individuals may move in and out of the workforce freely. Although the ILO estimates
of workforce activity do not set a maximum working age for the 65 and up group, for this study
we assume that no person above the age of 79 works. The average l for the 65 and up group is
applied to the 65–69, 70–74, and 75–79 groups. As for the younger age groups, working life is
assumed to begin at age 15, and so the present value of future lifetime earnings among children
must be discounted further into the future. Of course, not everyone will enter the workforce
upon turning 15, and not everyone will work until the age of 79. Adjusting T for l is one way of
capturing when people tend to enter and retire from the workforce in different countries.
Because of the likelihood of gender bias in the labor force statistics from which l is derived, the
average l for males is applied to both males and females in calculating T.

Finally, survival probabilities, s, are calculated from mean death rates, d, so that s 5 1 2 d.
GBD 2013 provides estimates of mean death rates by age group for ages ,1 year, 1–4 years,
5–9 years, 10–14 years, and so on up to the open-ended 80 and up age group. Average working
life expectancy for 15- and 40-year-olds in different regions and income groups is shown in
tables 3.1 and 3.2.



Results: Welfare Losses and Forgone Labor Output
One of the top risks leading to early death worldwide, air pollution is responsible for more
than $5.11 trillion in welfare losses each year (see table 3.3).7 These losses represent the cost
stemming from premature mortality caused by exposure to ambient fine particulate matter
(PM2.5), household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels, and ambient ozone. The mag-
nitude of losses is greatest in East Asia and the Pacific, where premature mortality costs
reached the equivalent of 7.5 percent of GDP in 2013, closely followed by South Asia, where
costs were on the order of 7.4 percent of GDP equivalent (figure 3.1).8 By comparison, in
North America welfare losses were 3 percent of GDP equivalent in 2013. Losses were even
lower in Latin America and the Caribbean and in the Middle East and North Africa. Although
the majority of welfare losses in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were caused by indoor air
pollution, in all other regions losses were driven by ambient air pollution, mainly PM2.5. Losses
from ambient ozone represent the smallest share of the premature mortality costs of air pollu-
tion. As a percentage of GDP equivalent, ozone-associated losses in South Asia were roughly
equivalent to those in North America.

Annual labor income losses from premature mortality—$225 billion in 2013 (see table 3.6,
which appears later in this chapter)—are lower than total welfare losses, as expected,
although still substantial in some regions.9 Lost income for countries in South Asia from air
pollution totaled more than $66 billion in 2013, the equivalent of nearly 1 percent of GDP
(figure 3.2). Pollution-related income losses are higher for countries with younger popula-
tions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, 30 percent of early deaths from air pollution were
suffered by children under 5, and 10 percent of deaths were among the elderly ages 80 and
above. By contrast, in Europe and Central Asia less than 1 percent of air pollution deaths
were among children under 5, and more than 40 percent were among people over the age of
80 (figure 3.3). Because children have more years remaining in their lifetimes in which they

are likely to work, the expected loss of income per child’s death is usually greater,10 driving
up total losses. Consequently, whereas under-5 mortality represented more than 40 percent
of forgone income in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, in Europe and Central Asia it was about
2 percent (figure 3.4). Outside North America, after Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and
the Pacific experienced the highest share (about 30 percent) of mortality—and welfare
losses—suffered by people 80 years or older. Thus, although the relative magnitude of wel-
fare losses (which value mortality risks for people of all age groups equally) was similar for
South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific, the labor income losses for South Asia were pro-
portionally higher.

As noted in chapter 2, between 1990 and 2013 more of the health burden of pollution shifted
from the younger to the older generations. In every region, the share of deaths among children
under the age of 5 declined between 1990 and 2013. In most regions, the share of deaths of
older children (5–14) and young adults (15–39) also declined. By contrast, the share of deaths
of older generations—above the age of 70—increased. And yet in Sub-Saharan African coun-
tries the burden on young children is still very high, accounting for over 30 percent of all air
pollution–related deaths.

Premature mortality risks and GDP equivalent welfare losses from air pollution are high-

from ambient air pollution are highest in high-income non-OECD countries, followed by
upper middle income, while those driven by household air pollution are the highest in
lower-middle-income countries followed by low-income countries. In 2013 welfare losses
in low- and middle-income countries accounted for 59 percent of the global total. Higher
overall exposure, risks, and losses among middle-income countries are driven in large
part by trends in India and China.

The economic costs of air pollution have increased significantly over time, a reflection of the
growing challenge of pollution. Between 1990 and 2013, total welfare losses due to premature
mortality from exposure to air pollution increased by 94 percent (see table 3.3).11 Damages
from exposure to ambient PM2.5 air pollution rose by 63 percent between 1990 and 2013, to
$3.552 trillion, while damages from household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels rose
by 287 percent, to $1.516 trillion (tables 3.4 and 3.5). Welfare losses in East Asia and the Pacific
countries more than quintupled between 1990 and 2013, climbing to $2.306 trillion (see
table 3.3). Losses in South Asia reached $604 billion, an increase of 347 percent. North Amer-
ica and Europe and Central Asia were the only regions to see declines in welfare losses from

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                                                   55
air pollution since 1990, although the Middle East and North Africa saw a decline in the wel-
fare losses from household air pollution over this period. The burden of largest loss also shifted
between 1990 and 2013, from Europe and Central Asia to the East Asia and the Pacific region.

Over time, more of the health burden and costs of air pollution have shifted from the high-
income countries to the middle-income countries. From 1990 to 2013, welfare losses increased
for countries at all income levels other than the OECD countries, which saw a small decline.
These losses increased by 130 percent and 133 percent for lower- and upper-middle-income
countries, respectively, excluding India and China, which saw even greater increases. The
countries that experienced the greatest increases in welfare losses from ambient air pollution
include many of the fastest-growing, fastest-urbanizing ones.

As shown in figure 3.6, in low-income countries increases in exposure and health impacts and
increases in the value that individuals place on reducing their risk of mortality were equally
responsible for driving up welfare losses. In the low-income countries, the declines in death
rates due to air pollution were more than offset by population growth and greater total expo-
sure to polluted air. In the middle-income countries, total exposure also increased. However,
most of the estimated increase in welfare losses for middle-income countries stemmed from
economic factors—namely, an increased value placed on reducing fatality risks. Even in
high-income countries, the higher value placed on reducing fatality risks substantially coun-
tered the improvements in welfare from reduced exposure and health impacts.

There is much variation within income categories, however. Between 1990 and 2013, per capita
welfare losses from ambient air pollution increased in about two-thirds of all countries, and
one-third of countries saw a decrease (figure 3.7). Improvements in health risks and welfare
losses from household air pollution were more widespread. Overall, per capita welfare losses
declined for more than half of all countries (figure 3.8). South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific
were the only two regions in which average losses from household air pollution increased,
stemming mainly from the higher per capita losses in China and India. Some of the greatest
reductions in health risks from household air pollution occurred in the low-income countries
of Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the lower-middle-income countries of Central Asia.

Demographic and economic factors have also played an influential role in shaping trends in
forgone labor output. Forgone labor income due to air pollution rose from $162 billion in 1990
to $225 billion in 2013 (table 3.6). Labor income losses increased in all regions outside of
Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, although increases in forgone
labor income for North America and the Middle East and North Africa were negligible. As
with welfare losses, labor income losses in North America were almost entirely from ambient
PM2.5 (table 3.7), while household air pollution was the dominant cause of income losses for
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (table 3.8). To understand the dynamics behind these
trends, figure 3.9 dissects the overall change in forgone labor output into the parts attributable
to changes in health risks, labor income, and working life expectancy. Since 1990, average
wages have increased in real terms in all but the high-income non-OECD countries, causing
forgone labor income per death to be higher. Yet across countries in all income groups the age
profile of people affected by pollution has shifted, so that a higher proportion of deaths has
occurred among people later in their working life (see figure 3.3). This drop in the average
remaining working life among people who die from pollution exposure has had a counter­

vailing effect on total forgone labor output. The exception is Sub-Saharan Africa, where the
persistently large share of children who have died from pollution-related causes has driven up
income losses.

Decomposing the changes in losses reveals that even though death rates related to air pollution
are gradually declining, incremental improvement is not enough. Marginal decreases in expo-
sure and health risks are counteracted by a growing and aging population in many regions. As
incomes continue to rise, the marginal costs of health risks are also rising because of higher
levels of labor productivity and the increasing monetary value that individuals attach to

reducing their risk of death. Achieving real reductions in the costs of air pollution thus
demands more ambitious action.

Estimates of welfare losses and forgone output for individual countries are presented in appendix B.
In dollar terms, welfare losses from air pollution have increased the most on an annual basis in Equa-
torial Guinea (13.8 percent),12 China (10.9 percent), Sri Lanka (7.5 percent), Lao People’s Demo-
cratic Republic (7.2 percent), and India (7.0 percent). Welfare losses have declined the most on an
annual basis in western and northern Europe, including in Norway (4.5 percent), Sweden (3.3 per-
cent), Denmark (3.1 percent), Finland (2.6 percent), and the United Kingdom (2.5 percent).

Alternative Scenarios and Sensitivity Analysis
of Uncertain Parameters
The theoretical literature and body of empirical evidence behind the monetization of fatal
health risks is well developed. However, a number of issues remain for which definitive guid-
ance is still lacking, even though choices related to these issues may materially influence the
results of the analysis. For welfare losses, key issues include the choice of a base VSL, the valu-
ation of deaths instead of lost life expectancy, and assumptions about the income elasticity of
the VSL. For forgone labor output, issues include assumptions about the discount rate, future
income growth, and working life expectancy. To gauge the effect of different assumptions on
the results, this section compares estimated damages in the base case with alternative scenar-
ios. Sensitivity analysis is then conducted to test the effect of various uncertain parameters in
the damage equations. Finally, confidence intervals are estimated that capture the combined
uncertainty of different parameters.

Alternative Scenarios—Welfare Losses
For the alternative analysis of welfare losses, three scenarios are considered. First, to test the
effect of weighting health impacts suffered by the young more heavily than those suffered by
the elderly, health impacts are monetized by applying a value per statistical life year (VSLY)
rather than valuing all deaths equally using the value of statistical life. The second and third
scenarios explore the effect of choosing a different base VSL. In the second scenario, health

impacts in middle-income countries are valued using the base VSL from the sample of willing-
ness to pay studies from middle-income countries rather than the base VSL from OECD coun-
tries. This scenario is to test whether the use of a base VSL derived from a more similar context
significantly influences the results for those middle-income countries. Third, a higher base
VSL in line with the value assumed by U.S. agencies for regulatory purposes is tested.


VSLY versus VSL
The choice between using VSL and VSLY depends in part on the metric of health impacts
being used. The VSL is used for valuing the number of deaths and the VSLY for years of life
lost or reduced life expectancy. Both deaths and years of life lost are common in the medical
literature, and the choice between valuing deaths or reduced life expectancy in assessing the
burden of disease from air pollution hinges on whether impacts among children or older peo-
ple should be weighted more heavily. According to the GBD 2013 estimates, in 2013 the over-
65 population accounted for 62 percent of deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 and 59 percent
of deaths from household air pollution. Meanwhile, children under the age of 15 accounted for
only 4 percent of deaths from ambient PM2.5 and 8 percent of deaths from household air pol-
lution in 2013. Because remaining life expectancy for the over-65 population is less than that
of children, valuing premature mortality using a VSLY instead of the VSL would put greater
weight on losses suffered by children.

The empirical basis for estimating the VSLY from willingness to pay for gains in life expec-
tancy is less developed, and there are fewer studies from which to derive a base value for the
VSLY than there are for the VSL. Although it is common practice to derive the VSLY from the
VSL by dividing the VSL by average remaining life expectancy, this practice is not really con-
sistent with the empirical literature on mortality risks and how adults of different ages value
risk reductions.

As for analysis of the welfare losses using the VSLY, only a few studies have been conducted to
determine empirically the VSLY from the willingness to pay for gains in life expectancy, and
so it is not possible to derive a base VSLY in the same way as the VSL, drawing from a large
body of WTP studies conducted across countries and over time. One of the few examples of
an empirical VSLY study is the nine-country study conducted in Europe by Desaigues et al.
(2007, 2011). The authors of this study recommend a VSLY of $56,384 for the EU-25 coun-
tries. By comparison, analyses of the Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Programme and the EU
Clean Air Package have applied a base VSLY of $78,111–$222,316 (Hurley et al. 2005; Holland
2014). The lower and upper values of this range correspond to the median and mean VSLYs
from a study of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom by Alberini, Hunt, and Markandya
(2004, 2006). In the Alberini et al. study, respondents were asked about their willingness to pay
for reduced fatality risks over the next 10 years. The authors imputed the VSLY by dividing
respondents’ WTP by the implied gain in life expectancy, assuming an annual risk reduction
of 5 in 10,000.

To explore the effect of valuing lost life expectancy instead of number of deaths, in this alter-
native scenario 3 different VSLYs are tested: (1) the base VSLY estimates recommended by the
Desaigues et al. study (2007, 2011); (2) the range of VSLY estimates from the Alberini et al.


62	                           The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action
study (2004, 2006); and (3) a VSLY that is derived indirectly from the base VSL. The VSLY is
derived from the VSL by dividing the VSL by discounted remaining life expectancy:13

                                          VSLYj = VSL j / ∑ j = t s j ,t (1 + r ) j − t 	(3.5)
                                                                    T
	


where VSLYj and VSLj are the VSLY and VSL for a person of age j; term sj,t is the probability
of that person surviving to age t; and r is the discount rate. To derive the VSLY, the average
VSL is first estimated for those WTP studies in the OECD’s VSL database for which the
average age of respondents is reported. The same quality screening criteria used to select
studies for the base VSL are applied. The mean VSL for the screened sample of studies is
$3.5 million. Associated GDP per capita for the surveys and countries included in the sub-
sample of OECD country studies is $37,350. Respondents in this subsample are 50 years
old on average, with a remaining life expectancy of 33 years. Discounting remaining life
expectancy by an annual rate of 4 percent would imply that the average VSLY for this sub-
sample of studies is $189,706.

Deriving the VSLY from the VSL in this way suggests that the WTP for reducing mortality
risks varies proportionally with age. This suggestion is not supported by empirical evidence.
Still, it is common international practice, and a constant VSLY is often used to monetize lost
life expectancy or YLLs suffered by people of various ages (Cropper and Khanna 2014). The
base VSLY from the OECD subsample is transferred to other countries using the same method
as for the VSL and assuming the same income elasticities. In estimating damages using the
transferred VSLY, remaining life expectancy is then discounted at 4 percent for high-income
countries and 6 percent for low- and middle-income countries.

The spread of welfare losses estimated for 2013 assuming the different base VSLYs and dis-
count rates is shown in tables 3.9 and 3.10. As revealed in the tables, using a VSLY to mone-
tize reduced life expectancy results in significantly lower damages overall. If the VSLY is

used, global welfare losses in 2013 are an estimated $2.56 trillion compared with $5.06 tril-
lion using the VSL.14 The large difference stems from the fact that the use of lost life years
shifts the age distribution of costs and puts less weight on premature deaths of the elderly
(figure 3.10). Mortality costs among the 65 and over population account for 71 percent of
total costs as valued using the VSL. If premature deaths are monetized using the VSLY, mor-
tality costs among the 65 and over population are about 60 percent lower than using the VSL.
Most notably, unit damages per excess death among the 80 and over population drop to less

than one-quarter in the VSLY scenario versus when the VSL is used. By contrast, mortality
costs among the under-45 population are only 16 percent lower when valued using the VSLY
instead of the VSL.

VSL from Middle-Income Countries
To compare mortality costs in middle-income countries as estimated using a base VSL from
middle-income countries instead of the transferred OECD value, the mean and median VSL
estimates from the overall sample of middle-income countries are used: $383,440, with an
associated GDP per capita of $7,007, and $481,347, corresponding to a GDP per capita of
$6,360. For this analysis, the middle-income VSL is applied only to low- and middle-income
countries. The same range of income elasticity values is assumed as in the base case (1.0–1.4,
with a central value of 1.2). Although differences in GDP per capita are smaller for this sample
of countries than for the overall sample, meta-regression analysis of the middle-income coun-
try VSL estimates suggests that the income elasticity is still above 1.

The results in table 3.11 demonstrate that the base case estimates of welfare losses using the
OECD base value for the VSL are quite similar to the losses estimated using the median VSL
estimate from the sample of middle-income countries as the base value. However, the range of
estimates produced by assuming different elasticity values in the base case is much larger than
if the VSL is derived from the middle-income country context, especially for regions with
lower GDP per capita, including South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. This finding reinforces
how using a base VSL from a study context that is more similar to the policy context can help
reduce the sensitivity of the results to different assumptions about income elasticity.

VSL from U.S. Regulatory Agencies
The final scenario for welfare losses compares the base case with damages estimated using a
VSL in line with that now assumed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The base VSL for 2013 for this
scenario is $9.0 million, which represents an average of the values recommended by the U.S.

Department of Transportation (DOT 2015), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(Robinson and Hammitt 2015), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 2016). GDP
per capita in the United States in 2013 was about $51,000. The VSL is transferred assuming the
same range of income elasticities as for the other scenarios. The resulting damages for this
alternate scenario are shown in table 3.12.

As shown in table 3.12, applying the higher VSL that is used for regulatory purposes in the
United States leads to much higher estimates of welfare losses. Central estimates of welfare losses
in the base case range from the equivalent of 3.7 percent of GDP in the high-income OECD
countries to 6.7 percent of GDP in the upper-middle-income countries versus 6.6 percent of
GDP in the high-income OECD countries and 10.6 percent of GDP in the upper-middle-income
countries in the alternate scenario. Assuming that income elasticity of the VSL is 1 for all coun-
tries in the alternate scenario would result in even higher losses, equivalent to 14.0 percent of
GDP in the upper-middle-income countries and 7.0 percent of GDP in the high-income OECD
countries. Differences between the alternate scenario and base case are most pronounced for the
high-income countries. The average VSL for high-income countries in the alternate scenario is
$6.1 million for non-OECD countries and $7.4 million for OECD countries, implying a VSL to
GDP per capita ratio of 180:1 to 190:1 as opposed to 100:1 in the base case. The average VSLs in
the alternate scenario for lower- and upper-middle-income countries is, respectively, $0.6 mil-
lion and $1.8 million, implying VSL to GDP per capita ratios of 110:1 and 130:1, respectively,
versus 70:1 and 90:1 in the base case. The VSLs and VSL to income ratios in the alternate sce-
nario are higher than those suggested by empirical studies in middle-income countries to date
(Narain and Sall 2016).

Alternative Scenarios—Forgone Labor Output
The alternative scenarios of forgone labor output look at the effect of specifying working life
expectancy in different ways. First, working life expectancy is adjusted for gender-specific
labor force participation rates (LFPRs) instead of applying the male rate to both sexes. Second,
working life expectancy is weighted only by survival probabilities. In this case, the maximum
working age is reduced from 79 to 69. Lowering the maximum working age is important
because rates of economic activity decline significantly for people in their late 60s. Without

discounting for labor force participation, assuming that all people who survive to age 79 will
continue to work is unrealistic and would overestimate income losses.

Discounting working life expectancy using gender-specific labor force participation rates
greatly reduces the estimates of forgone labor output for those regions where female labor
force participation is lowest, South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa (table 3.13).
Differences in losses are less pronounced in other regions where labor force participation rates
are more equal, particularly Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
North America. Removing labor force participation from the calculation of working life
expectancy entirely and lowering the maximum working age to 69 yields about the same
results as the base case (table 3.13). Differences are greater for regions with lower rates of eco-
nomic activity among the elderly, especially Europe and Central Asia.

Sensitivity Analysis—Welfare Losses
Next, the sensitivity of the overall results to individual parameters in the calculation of welfare
losses is tested. Uncertainty in each component of the damage equation is considered, includ-
ing (1) the GBD estimates of health impacts due to exposure; (2) the base VSL; and (3) the
assumed income elasticity of the VSL. Uncertainty in the estimated number of deaths due to
air pollution is bounded by the confidence intervals reported in GBD 2013.15 The range of
uncertainty in the base VSL is equal to plus or minus one standard deviation in the lognormal
distribution of VSL estimates in the database of candidate studies from the OECD countries
($1.38–$10.64 million). The corresponding range of base values for GDP per capita is $28,944–
$46,886. Income elasticities ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 and 0.6 to 1.0 are tested for middle- and
high-income countries, respectively.

The combined uncertainty of the parameters in the calculation of welfare losses is simulated
by Monte Carlo analysis. For each country and year, a 95 percent confidence interval was
generated from 5,000 random draws of varying estimates for health impacts, base VSL, and
income elasticity. The estimated number of deaths for each country and year was assumed to

follow a lognormal distribution, with the lower and upper values reported in GBD 2013 rep-
resenting the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. Estimates of the base VSL were
drawn at random from the database of WTP studies in OECD countries. The income elastic-
ity was assumed to follow a triangular distribution, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 for low- and
middle-income countries, with a median of 1.2, and from 0.6 to 1.0 for high-income coun-
tries, with a mode of 0.8.

Figures 3.11 to 3.15 illustrate the overall uncertainty in the estimates of total welfare losses
from air pollution as well as the effect of uncertainty on each of the individual parameters. The
red line represents the central estimate of welfare losses in the base case. The figures reveal that
the base VSL is the most important source of uncertainty in the calculation of losses. Also, the
relative importance of the assumed income elasticity varies greatly for countries of different
income levels. As noted earlier, the lower a country’s per capita income, the more important is
the elasticity value. For high-income countries, the assumed income elasticity of the VSL
makes little difference in the overall results.

Despite the large uncertainty—and even under highly conservative or extreme assumptions—
the results of the analysis show that welfare losses are significant and warrant greater action from
the world’s governments to reduce air pollution. Under the wide range of assumptions tested,
global welfare losses in 2013 were at least $1.448 trillion and as much as $13.210 trillion. The
upper end of this range is equally as likely as the lower range. Uncertainty intervals for individual
countries are presented in the data table in appendix B.

The uncertainty analysis also reveals that the main sources of uncertainty vary for countries of
different income levels. For high-income countries, the choice of the base VSL is far more

influential than assumptions about the income elasticity of the VSL. For low- and middle-­
income countries, the choice of the base VSL is also the main source of uncertainty, though the
income elasticity also plays a significant role. These results speak to the critical need for more
empirical studies in low- and middle-income countries of willingness to pay for reduced mor-
tality risks in order to understand the economic costs of pollution in those countries.

Sensitivity Analysis—Forgone Labor Output
In sensitivity tests carried out for the parameters in the estimates of forgone labor output,
uncertainty resulting from the estimates of health impacts is compared with the uncertainty
associated with the assumed rates of income growth and the social discount rates. As with the
welfare loss estimates, the overall spread of uncertainty is then simulated using Monte Carlo
analysis.

To test the uncertainty associated with income growth and social discount rates, the constant
rates in the base case are compared with a range of country-specific rates, which are calculated
according to observed rates of wage growth and growth in per capita consumption from 1990
to 2010. The social discount rate, r, is specified using Ramsey’s formula as

	                                          r 5 d 1  · c	(3.6)


where δ is the pure rate of time preference; η is the (negative) marginal utility of consumption;
and c is average annual growth in final consumption expenditure per capita. On ethical
grounds, ρ is set at 0 from the perspective that the social planner would value the utility of
future generations equally with that of the current generation (see Arrow et al. 2013). Term η
is assumed here to be second in line with recent guidance by the World Bank.16 Country data
on real wage growth and final consumption expenditure per capita from 1990 to 2010 are from
the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database. Based on these data, the effective
discount rate is given by the ratio of wage growth, g, to the social discount rate so that

                                                  1+ g
	                                            R=        	(3.7)
                                                  1+ r

For the one-way sensitivity tests, uncertainty in the country-specific income growth and dis-
count rates is represented by the 5th and 95th percentiles of R.

The results in figures 3.16 to 3.20 demonstrate that assumptions about future income growth
and the discount rate introduce considerable uncertainty into the calculation of forgone out-
put. The magnitude of this uncertainty is about the same as that from the estimates of expo-
sure and health impacts. Relative uncertainty in the parameters is greatest for the low-income
countries.

In constructing 95 percent confidence intervals to represent the combined uncertainty in the
forgone labor output estimates, 5,000 random draws were obtained from a lognormal distri-
bution of health impact estimates for each country, year, and age group. Five thousand random

draws were then taken from the distribution of the effective discount rate (R), obtained from
historic rates of growth in wages and per capita consumption. Measurement error in estimates
of average wage income derived from the labor share of GDP was represented by a uniform
distribution of ±5 percent of the central estimate, and 1,000 random draws were then taken
from this distribution. The relative magnitude of uncertainty in the estimates of forgone labor
output was much smaller than in the welfare loss estimates.

Compared with welfare losses, the relative magnitude of uncertainty in the estimates of for-
gone labor output is much smaller. Within the range of varying parameters tested, global labor
income losses in 2013 were anywhere from $165 billion to $305 billion. Uncertainty from
assumptions about future income growth and the discount rate is about as great as the uncer-
tainty from the range of estimates of health impacts. This finding speaks to the importance of
testing a range of discount and growth rates in estimating income losses, especially for the
purposes of cost-benefit or project analysis.

4. A Synthesis and the Way Forward
Air Pollution: A Costly and Persistent Challenge
Air pollution is a major health risk and an economic burden, especially on low- and middle-
income countries. It has been the fourth most important health risk in terms of attributable
deaths and premature mortality since 1990, despite the fact that nearly all countries have
reduced the number of deaths per 100,000 persons caused by air pollution through many devel-
opments, including improvements in health services. In 2013 air pollution was associated with
5.5 million deaths—that is, 1 in 10 deaths globally, an increase from 4.8 million in 1990.

Low- and middle-income countries bear a bigger share of the burden. Air pollution is the third
most important health risk leading to early death in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
The proportion of deaths attributable to air pollution has increased in both income groups
since 1990, although this share is highest in upper-middle-income countries.

The very young and older adults are particularly vulnerable: in 2013 about 5 percent of deaths of
children under 5 was attributed to air pollution, compared with less than 1 percent among older
children and young adults and more than 10 percent for older adults in every age group above 50.
This age pattern of mortality has remained unchanged since 1990. Among all ages and over time,
a larger share of men than women have died prematurely from air pollution–based illnesses.

These health impacts have put a real drag on development. In 2013 exposure to ambient and
household air pollution cost the world’s economy some $5.11 trillion in welfare losses, amount-
ing to as much as 7.5 percent and 7.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) equivalent in
East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia, respectively, and, at the lowest end, 2.2 percent in the
Middle East and North Africa. Indoor air pollution was the biggest cause of losses in South Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa. In all other regions, losses were largely caused by ambient air pollution
from fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Losses were highest for middle-income countries, and
low- and middle-income countries together accounted for 59 percent of the total global losses.

Labor income losses, while expectedly lower than welfare losses, were nonetheless substantial
in regions with younger populations. Lost income for countries in South Asia totaled more
than $66 billion in 2013, the equivalent of nearly 1 percent of GDP. Globally, the labor income
losses totaled $225 billion in 2013.

Moreover, air pollution costs have grown since 1990. From 1990 to 2013, welfare losses nearly
doubled and labor income losses increased by 40 percent, despite countries having made great
gains in economic development and health outcomes. In low-income countries, declines in
death rates were more than offset by population growth and greater total exposure to polluted
air. In middle-income countries, total exposure also increased. However, most of the estimated
increase in welfare losses stemmed from people placing a greater value on reducing fatality
risks. Similarly, from 1990 to 2013 average wages increased in real terms in all but the high-
income countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), causing forgone labor income losses per premature death to be higher.
Across countries in all income groups, the age profile of people affected by pollution shifted,

78	                           The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action
so that a higher proportion of deaths occurred among people later in their working life, having
a countervailing, but not equal or greater, effect on income losses. These effects suggest that
incremental progress to improve air quality will not be sufficient and that achieving real reduc-
tions in the cost of pollution will require more ambitious action.



Ambient Air Pollution: A Growing Challenge
As noted, in 2013 about 87 percent of the world’s population lived in areas that exceeded the Air
Quality Guideline of the World Health Organization (WHO), which is an annual average of
10 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) PM2.5. Thirty-five percent of the global population
resided in areas with concentrations above the WHO Interim Target 1 of an annual average of
35 µg/m3 PM2.5, with nearly all of the most extreme (>65 µg/m3) concentrations experienced by
populations in China and India. Since the 1990s, exposure to ambient air pollution has grown in
most countries (other than high-income countries), with some of the greatest increases in the
heavily populated, fastest-growing regions, including South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific.

Exposure to ambient air pollution was the seventh most important risk factor leading to early
death in 2013, resulting in 2.9 million deaths in 2013—1.7 million among men and 1.2 million
among women. Of these deaths, 75 percent occurred in middle-income countries. Children and
the elderly faced higher risks, particularly in low-income countries. Death rates for lower respira-
tory infections attributable to PM2.5 among children under 5 were more than 60 times higher in
low-income countries (31.9 per 100,000 persons) than in high-income countries (0.5 per 100,000).

Although the age-standardized death rate due to ambient PM2.5 exposure has decreased in most
countries since 1990 because of overall improvements of health, population growth and increased
exposure have nonetheless increased the number of premature deaths. From 1990 to 2013, prema-
ture mortality attributable to ambient pollution increased by 30 percent, from 2.2  million to
2.9 million. In 1990 the outcome was largely attributable to pneumonia, whereas in 2013 the cause
shifted to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. All regions other than Europe and Central Asia
and North America saw an increase in the number of deaths. With the exception of high-income
countries, the percentage of total deaths attributable to ambient air pollution also increased.

The development burden has also increased over time. Welfare losses from ambient air pollu-
tion increased by nearly 300 percent between 1990 and 2013, growing from $2.18 trillion to
$3.55 trillion. Welfare losses increased in about two-thirds of all countries. Europe and Central
Asia and North America were the only regions in which losses from ambient air pollution
steadily and consistently declined.



Indoor Air Pollution: A Remaining Challenge Despite
Some Gains
Although two-fifths of the world’s population was exposed to household air pollution (HAP)
from solid fuels in 2013, between 1990 and 2013 declines in HAP exposure, ranging from
nearly 100 percent in many higher-income countries to under 10 percent across much of
Sub-Saharan Africa, were evident in most countries.

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                           79
The age-standardized death rate from household air pollution declined steadily from 1990
(75.3 per 100,000 persons) to 2013 (47.1 per 100,000), a 37.5 percent drop. Total deaths were
down by almost 60 percent among children under 5, but even among adults 70 and older
improvements were visible.

And yet despite the reductions in exposure to household air pollution and declines in death
rates, the number of deaths associated with indoor air pollution has mostly remained constant.
Approximately 2.9 million deaths were attributed to indoor air pollution in 1990 and also in
2013, with increases in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa but decreases in other regions.
Two-thirds of HAP deaths occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

Meanwhile, welfare losses grew 63 percent between 1990 and 2013. Declines in the share of
households that rely on solid fuels for cooking have not kept pace with factors such as popula-
tion growth, aging, and rising incomes, which have led to more deaths and higher costs.



The Way Forward
Supporting Policy
This report has presented evidence on the health impacts of exposure to ambient and indoor
air pollution and estimated the cost of these impacts on the global economy. It has highlighted
the severity of the issues to make the case that countries should take action to reduce air pol-
lution. The fact that global welfare losses from fatal illness attributable to air pollution are in
the trillions of dollars—even under the most conservative assumptions—is a call to action.
The additional costs of pollution not captured by this report make reducing exposure all the
more urgent for achieving the goals of shared, inclusive, and sustainable prosperity. At the very
least, these numbers give policy makers an appreciation of the magnitude of the benefits that
air pollution management will bring to their economies and a credible basis against which to
compare the costs of such policies.

Meanwhile, by placing air pollution–related health risks in the context of other health risks
that, unlike air pollution, are typically within the purview of health agencies, the Global Bur-
den of Disease (GBD) approach has also emphasized the need for health agencies to consider
this important health burden and called for ministries of environment and health to work
together to deal with this challenge.

The methodology and the data presented in this report also support other policy discussions
such as those in energy and transport project–related cost-benefit analysis (see box 4.1). Such
projects can be a source of ambient air pollution. But by encouraging a modal shift toward
cleaner transport or promoting cleaner sources of energy, such projects can also help reduce
pollution. In either case, air pollution–related economic impacts, especially health impacts,
need to be incorporated into project cost-benefit analysis. Although the methodology to esti-
mate exposure to project-related emissions differs from the approach used in the Global Bur-
den of Disease Study, the same methodologies can be applied to estimate the economic costs
and benefits of project-related health impacts.

  Box 4.1  Transport: Valuing the Health Impacts of Air Pollution
  in Transport Project Cost-Benefit Analyses

  Emissions from transport can be an important source of ambient air pollution, and health impacts
  related to transport emissions can be substantial. Hill et al. (2009) have estimated that the health
  costs of gasoline produced and consumed in the United States are on the order of $0.36 per gallon
  ($.09 per liter)—more than twice the cost associated with greenhouse gas emissions per gallon.1

  Transport projects change demand for transport services and their modal composition, mainly
  through changes in the monetary costs of travel, travel times, and comfort of one or more modes.
  New road infrastructure, for example, shortens distances or relieves congestion, thereby reducing
  travel times. Road rehabilitation has the same effect by improving road quality. Both have effects
  on fuel use and emissions, depending on the density of traffic:

  •	 Lower transport costs generate more traffic, leading to more fuel use and emissions.
  •	 If initial speeds are low, an increase in infrastructure capacity can increase speeds and reduce
     fuel consumption per vehicle-km traveled, thereby reducing emissions. If initial speeds are
     already high, more road capacity will increase fuel use and emissions, instead.
  •	 Improving traffic flows in congested parts of the road network can reduce emissions.

  Public transport projects reduce modal travel times, increase comfort, and make it more attrac-
  tive to switch from other modes. Such changes in general reduce fuel use and emissions.

  The health impacts of transport emissions must therefore be incorporated into project cost-benefit
  analyses. Although methodologies to estimate exposure at the project level differ from those used
  to estimate exposure at the country level in GBD 2013, the same methodologies are applied to
  estimating health impacts and economic costs.

  The health cost savings from reducing emissions depends on exposure—that is, how emissions
  disperse and how many people are affected. Because of the low height of emissions, a high share
  of the intake fraction occurs at short distances from the emissions source. More than 50 percent of
  the health impacts is incurred within a distance of 5 kilometers from the sources of the emissions,
  whether a road, a bus terminal, or an airport.

  Dose-response parameters (health cases per µg/m3 additional pollutants) determine how the
  changes in pollutants (mainly particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfates) change the fre-
  quency of premature death, chronic bronchitis, hospital admissions, or work day losses as the

As the report shows, satellite-based observations combined with data from ground-level mon-
itors are necessary for global assessments of air pollution burden. This methodology can also
potentially be used for country-level assessments and air quality planning, especially when
ground-level monitor-based and satellite-based estimates are well aligned. Ground-level mon-
itors are a critical component of any air pollution management approach, particularly at the
city level, and countries need to enhance ground-level monitoring networks to fight the chal-
lenge of air pollution. Moreover, satellite-based observations must be calibrated and validated
using data from ground-level monitoring networks. At the same time, however, satellite-based
observations can provide spatial coverage that is often hard to achieve with ground-level mon-
itors alone. As is the practice in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow program,
where satellite-based observations are consistent with ground-level observations, satellite-
based observations can be used to enhance the spatial and temporal coverage of air quality
data (see box 4.2).



Improving Estimates
It would be remiss to end this report without discussing how measurement of the disease bur-
den and the economic costs associated with air pollution can be improved and made more
useful for policy applications. Efforts are already under way to link exposure and health
impacts to pollution sources to support policy actions (see box 4.3) and to provide subnational
estimates to help prioritize areas within countries (see box 4.4). Further work is needed in
both of these areas.

Measurement of the disease burden of pollution will continue to evolve as the state of the art
evolves in the science of epidemiology. Estimates for the Global Burden of Disease Study, led
by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), are updated yearly with new data
and improved methods for integrating different data sources. The next iteration of the GBD
will benefit from improvements in merging satellite-based estimates with ground measure-
ments, which will lead to improved accuracy and representation of spatial patterns in ambient
air pollution. Few studies currently allow estimation of the quantitative contribution of house-
hold air pollution to ambient air pollution, or vice versa. Improved global exposure estimates,
and more studies allowing for this kind of estimation, will improve GBD estimates for both the
combined burden of air pollution as well as the individual risk factors. There is growing evi-
dence that other diseases may be affected by air pollution, including diabetes, preterm birth
complications, low birth weight, and incident asthma. In addition, GBD air pollution esti-
mates do not capture near-roadway pollution impacts, which are characterized by other pol-
lutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and are likely to be at least partially independent of the
effects that are characterized by the IERs used for the GBD 2013. More research is also needed
on the health impacts of natural dust versus other components of particulate matter and how
to accurately measure concentrations in dusty places, especially for populations in environ-
ments where a large share of pollution is from windblown dust, such as North Africa.

  Box 4.2  Morocco: Using Ground-Level and Satellite Data
  to Estimate the Cost of Air Pollution

  In 2000 the World Bank estimated for the first time the cost of environmental degradation
  (COED) in Morocco (World Bank 2003). It showed that environmental degradation cost society
  3.7 percent of GDP, of which air pollution was the second most important component. These
  results raised awareness about the monetary damage that can result from environmental degra-
  dation. Most important, they positively influenced policies, investments, and strategies to achieve
  more sustainable and greener development in Morocco. In 2014 the government of Morocco
  asked the World Bank to update the original COED study.

  As part of the update (World Bank, 2016), the study looked at the impact of ambient air pollu-
  tion on people’s health. It relied on PM10 concentrations measured by a well-developed network
  of air quality monitoring stations in Morocco, consisting of 29 fixed stations and three mobile
  stations located in major cities. The authors converted PM10 into PM2.5 concentrations using the
  latest available information on PM composition in Morocco. Of the 13 cities equipped with air
  quality stations, eight had estimated annual PM2.5 concentrations above 10 μg/m3 (WHO Guide-
  line value)—see table B4.2.1. The population exposed to pollution monitored at each station was
  assessed using a geographic information system (GIS). Based on population exposure and cor-
  relations between exposure and health impacts (Apte et al. 2015), the number of premature deaths
  for these eight cities was estimated at 2,200.

  By contrast, using satellite-based exposure estimates, the present study estimated that exposure to
  ambient air pollution resulted in 6,014 premature deaths in Morocco as a whole in 2013, thereby
  raising the question as to whether the two estimates—one from ground-level monitoring data for
  eight cities and the other from satellite observations for the whole country—are consistent.

  Note: GBD 5 Global Burden of Disease.


  A city-by-city comparison of PM2.5 concentration estimates from ground-level monitored and
  satellite-based observations shows that the concentration estimates are well aligned for all eight
  cities, with the exception of Tanger (see table B4.2.1). Furthermore, these eight cities, the largest
  in the country, account for about 23 percent or one-fifth of Morocco’s total population. A compar-
  ison with the national estimates suggests that these cities account for one-third of total premature
  deaths. Because cities are likely to bear the highest health burden from ambient air pollution, the
  burden of disease estimates from the two approaches appear to be consistent. Even though a more
  detailed analysis is needed to determine conclusively the consistency between the estimates from
  the two approaches, the analysis presented here points in that direction.

  Box 4.3  China: Estimating the Impact of Pollution Sources
  on Disease Burden

  Although cause-attributable burden estimates are important to help governments prioritize
  actions across risk factors, policy makers need information on sources of pollution to imple-
  ment actions to reduce air pollution. Detailed information needed for policy action on sources
  of pollution can only be obtained from city-level and regional source apportionment studies, but
  the GBD framework is suited to indicating the sources of pollution as well. GBD MAPS (Global
  Burden of Disease from Major Air Pollution Sources) has been established to estimate the dis-
  ease burden attributable to ambient air pollution from major PM2.5 sources in China, India, and
  eastern Europe. Specifically, the fractional contributions to ambient PM2.5 from major sources of
  ambient air pollution are estimated using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model for 2013.
  When combined with exposure and health impacts, this allows disease burdens to be attributed
  to different sources of pollution.

  A recently completed study—“Burden of Disease Attributable to Coal-Burning and Other Major
  Sources in China”—provides such estimates for China (see figure B4.3.1). (GBD MAPS Working
  Group 2016).

  Box 4.4  Mexico: Subnational Estimates Matter

  GBD 2013, like GBD 2010, provides ambient exposure estimates at 0.1o 3 0.1o resolution. Begin-
  ning with GBD 2013, health burdens attributable to PM2.5 exposure are now available at the
  subnational level for China, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. GBD 2010 only provided health
  impacts at the national level, but health impacts can vary widely within countries. Although the
  attributable rates per 100,000 persons varied twofold in the United Kingdom, they varied 24-fold
  in China and 74-fold in Mexico. Rates were highest in the Districto Federal, which includes Mex-
  ico City—22.9 deaths per 100,000 persons—and the lowest in Yucatan—0.3 deaths per 100,000
  (Cohen et al. n.d.).

  Map B4.4.1 shows the variation in all deaths attributable to air pollution across Mexico. When
  household air pollution and ozone-related risks are added, the highest rates were found in
  Guerrero at 39.6 deaths per 100,000 persons and the lowest in Quintana Roo and Baja Califor-
  nia Sur at 7.5 deaths per 100,000.

The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action	                               85
On the economics side, one of the principal sources of uncertainty in the estimates of lost
welfare from air pollution is the value of statistical life. According to the analysis in this report,
the uncertainty associated with the VSL far outweighs the uncertainty in the estimates of
health impacts. Thus the lack of data on willingness to pay for reduced mortality risks in many
countries, particularly in low- and middle-income ones, represents a critical knowledge gap in
understanding the costs of pollution. On-the-ground empirical studies are the best way to fill
this gap and will require facilitating greater comparability in measuring willingness to pay
across diverse country settings.

One area that has continued to lag behind in the economics of environmental health is the
monetary valuation of nonfatal outcomes—that is, morbidity. As already noted, the decision
to exclude morbidity from the cost estimates in this report stemmed in large part from the lack
of a standard, agreed-on framework for valuing these costs. Morbidity costs are more compli-
cated to value and involve a plurality of health endpoints (lost work days, hospital admissions,
expenditures for long-term medical treatment, etc.) suffered by a plurality of agents (the
patient as well as the patient’s friends, family, coworkers, etc.). These complications raise the
possibility of double counting or inconsistency in cost estimation methods for different out-
comes. Data may be missing on health expenditures and medical treatment costs for a wide
array of countries. Differences among countries in health care systems—and how health care
costs are allocated to patients, care providers, and the public treasury—are also a problem.
Finally, there are fewer studies of willingness to pay to avoid different kinds of illnesses and
other medical conditions associated with pollution exposure than there are of willingness to
pay to avoid mortality risk, and so measuring disutility costs is more difficult. Recent work by
the OECD attempting to establish a common set of endpoints and unit costs for morbidity is
a welcome improvement (Hunt et al. 2016), but more work is still needed.

Greater action on air pollution will also require greater uptake by decision makers of the sci-
entific and economic findings on the impacts of pollution. Part of improving uptake is com-
municating policy-relevant findings in a clear, effective, and credible way. This includes
••    Being clear about exactly which costs are included, which are excluded, and why
••    Following the existing guidance in countries, if any, about monetizing the costs of health
      impacts, including VSLs used by public agencies for previous analyses
••    Making greater use of context- or country-specific research on the willingness to pay to
      reduce mortality risks among the population most affected, if available
••    Being up-front about the sources and magnitude of uncertainty and showing how the
      range of cost estimates depends on methodological choices. Providing a single, determin-
      istic cost value based on a core set of assumptions without testing the robustness of this
      result for alternate scenarios and assumptions is misleading and should be avoided.


Finally, although they are significant, the damages from air pollution estimated in this report
represent only a partial accounting of the full costs of air pollution to the global economy.
Beyond the costs of fatal illness, air pollution hurts the economy in many other ways that can
have lasting effects on future productivity by, for example, degrading natural ecosystems. Fur-
ther work is needed to value the full cost of air pollution.

Method for Estimating the Combined Effects of
Exposure to Ambient and Household Air Pollution
Solid fuel is a major source of ambient air pollution (AAP) in many regions, including Sub-
Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America (Chafe et al. 2014). There is a concern
that the burden of exposure to AAP is already included in the burden of the other risk, house-
hold air pollution (HAP), and so the total risk might overestimate the total burden, or the
burdens should be adjusted. Although AAP can penetrate a house and be a risk, in settings
with indoor use of solid fuels AAP exposure is much lower compared with exposure from
indoor emissions from solid fuel use. If exposure to AAP causes a relative risk (RR) of RRAP
and HAP a relative risk of RRHP, assuming time-exclusive exposure, the assumptions of no
interaction between risks and also no overhaul effect of the integrated exposure-response
(IER) curve (where the IER curve flattens with increasing particulate matter (PM2.5), indicat-
ing a smaller increase in RR in higher levels of PM2.5) are plausible. Standard approaches can
then be applied to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of both risks:

	                      RRtotal = RRAP ∗ RRHP , 	(A.1)

	                       1             = 1                 = 1          ∗ 1          , 	(A.2)
                            RRtotal         RRAP ∗ RRHP         RRAP         RRHP
	                      1 − PAFtotal = (1 − PAFAP ) ∗ (1 − PAFHP ), 	(A.3)
	                      PAFtotal = 1 − (1 − PAFAP ) ∗ (1 − PAFHP ) . 	(A.4)


The total PAF in the GBD was calculated for combinations of risks in this way.

The second concern of exposure to both risks is a shared outcome between risks, so the out-
come should not be counted twice during aggregation. This issue is also handled by the for-
mulas shown in (A.1)–(A.4).

For an individual with exposure to both risks, the PAF is the probability of an outcome caused
by the risk, so the total probability of an outcome caused by either of the risks (assuming no
interaction at the individual level) is expressed as

	               PAFtotal = PAFAP ∪ PAFHP = PAFAP + PAFHP − PAFAP ∗ PAFHP , 	(A.5)
	               PAFtotal = 1 − (1 − PAFAP ) + PAFHP − PAFAP ∗ PAFHP , 	(A.6)
	               PAFtotal = 1 − (1 − PAFAP ) + PAFHP ∗ (1 − PAFAP ) ∗ PAFHP , 	(A.7)
	               PAFtotal = 1 − (1 − PAFAP ) ∗ (1 − PAFHP ) . 	(A.8)


In this way, the multiplicative method of aggregating PAF for multiple risks can address the
two concerns, taking into account the assumptions such as lack of interaction of the risks.




90	                             The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action
The total burden of AAP, HAP, and ozone for a common outcome was calculated by expand-
ing equation (A.8) for n risks as

                                PAFtotal n risks = 1 − ∏ i =1 (1 − PAFi ) . 	(A.9)
                                                      n
	


For risks with distinct outcomes, the total burden is the sum of the burden from each risk
because the outcomes were estimated independently and no overlap is assumed for causes in
the GBD study (a categorical attribution approach in which each outcome, such as death, is
attributed to only one cause, such as ischemic heart disease).
