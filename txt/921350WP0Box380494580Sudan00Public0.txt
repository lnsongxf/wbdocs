THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      Construction activities are governed by the State of Khartoum
      Organization of Construction Act of 1997. Article 5 prescribes the
      process of obtaining a building permit. Article 6 stipulates that a
      response to an application should be made within 15 days from the
      date of receipt of that application. Article 8 states that the land must be
      owned by the applicant.

      The documents to be submitted along with the application are the
      following:
      • Specification of the full name and address of the owner
      • Specification of the number of the plot and the zone in which the plot
      is located                                                                    40 days       no charge

      • Specification of the area of the land and its class
      • A sketch of the site to be prepared by a surveyor from the surveying
      department, to determine the area available for proposed work
      • Title certificate to be issued by Land Registry Department. The
      certificate of title must show whether the land is freehold or leasehold.
      If it is leasehold, the latest renewal, if any, would be submitted

      The engineering documents required are indicated in the Khartoum
      State Building Organization Regulations of 1997. However, in practice
      the following documents are required:
