is that the findings from this study will provide useful lessons to other
cities that are interested in improving the efficiency of energy use. Both
the methodology and specific energy efficiency measures identified here
are likely to be illustrative of the potential in other cities in Mexico. The

Matrix with EE priorities and proposed programs

The matrix below presents the public sectors identified by the TRACE tool as
having the highest energy-saving potential and some of the measures the
city could consider to reduce consumption and improve overall efficiency.
The maximum energy saving potential is calculated by the TRACE tool
considering the total energy spending in the sector1 and other parameters
such as the city authority control and the relative energy intensity of the
TRACE tool as is explained in the Summary of Section Priorization in the
Recommendation section.
   The energy saving recommendations in the matrix were presented,
discussed and agreed with the city authorities and key stakeholders,
and represent only some of the possible measures to achieve maximum
potential savings. These are classified by cost, energy saving potential
and time of implementation, which are an estimation based on previous
experiences however further assessments should be conducted to get the
real cost of implementing the measures in Leon.                                           Notes for the Matrix of EE Priorities

power/heat. It consists of three components: (1) an energy benchmarking
module that compares key performance indicators (KPIs) in similar cities;
(2) a prioritization model that identifies areas which offer the greatest
potential for energy cost-savings; and (3) an activity model that functions
like a ‘playbook’ of tried-and-tested EE measures. The three are part of
a user-friendly software application that takes the city through a series
of sequential steps from initial data gathering to a report with a matrix
of EE recommendations based on the city’s particular context, to a list of
implementation and financing options. These are the steps:


1.	 Collecting City Energy Use Data

is launched, the collection grows as new, reliable data become available.       3.	 Ranking EE Recommendations

2.	 Analyzing City Energy Use Against Similar Cities                            TRACE contains a list of over 60 tried-and-tested EE recommendations in

service areas for which the city is responsible, the tool cannot factor in the
institutional/legislative mechanisms that may be needed to launch specific
EE actions.
   While TRACE seems to apply well in Eastern European cities and
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, where most public
utilities are under the city governments (which gives them substantial
control over the TRACE areas), elsewhere, as in Latin America, cities have
less control over them, either because they are managed at a state or
federal level or because the service is provided by a contractor. For example,
in 2013, TRACE was applied in Romania’s seven largest cities where
important services such as public transport, district heating, streetlights,
and municipal buildings were under local control. In some, even where
operation and maintenance (O&M) is outsourced to a contractor (as
with streetlights), the city owns the infrastructure and can make the final
decisions. Thus, in Romania, the TRACE studies helped local and national
authorities prepare local EE measures that were supported with funds from
the European Union (EU), whose Europe 2025 Strategy aimed to reduce
GHG emissions by 20 percent over the next few years.

The water sector is regulated by CONAGUA and all water sources are
considered state property. Cities pay levies to CONAGUA for extracting
water from wells. A service agency under the local government typically
manages the distribution of potable water, wastewater treatment, sewage,
and drains.


4. Power and Heat

The power sector is under CFE, which is responsible for the overall production,
transmission, and distribution of electricity. However, municipalities can
partner with private companies for self-supply electricity projects. Given
the climate, most cities do not require heating.


5. Municipal Buildings

The municipal building stock managed by cities consists mainly of public
administration offices. Schools and hospitals are usually under federal and
state authorities.


6. Streetlights

Power for streetlights is usually provided by CFE while the assets are
operated, maintained, and owned by local authorities. In some cities,
private contractors maintain the systems. Most municipalities charge
a public lighting tax known as Derecho sobre Alumbrado Publico (DAP).
Under DAP, all electricity users (including residential clients and private
companies) are required to pay for public streetlights through a levy that

In León, streetlights are managed by the Public Works Directorate. Léon
was one of the first cities in México to have electric streetlights, beginning
in 1884. In the mid-1950s, it introduced a mercury-based lighting system,
which was extended throughout the city by 1960.
   León owns the infrastructure (except for part of concrete light poles
that belong to CFE) and is responsible for maintaining it. Through DAP,
a local tax is charged to consumers and collected by CFE. The amount
collected is compared to municipal consumption, and if any surplus remains
at the end of the fiscal year, CFE returns the funds to the city. The León

DAP for residences and small users was 8 percent of monthly electricity
consumption and 5 percent for industries. However, the Supreme Court             León and CFE do not agree on the number of the city’s light poles. León

   About 65 percent of the light poles have meters, which is high by

on several factors, including having the necessary funds, either from the
money saved from earlier energy measures, external resources (multilateral

install LEDs (most are now installed through third parties, such as housing

León’s solid waste sector is managed by public and private institutions. It
is collected by several private companies that are overseen by SIAP, a city
agency. These companies cover 118 collection routes (91 percent of the
total), while SIAP collects solid waste from households on 11 routes (six
rural and five peri-urban) using 30 trucks. Private companies also collect
waste from businesses and industries.

over 60 ha and has two large cells, each divided into five smaller cells of
five ha. It has a leachate plant where wastewater from the landfill is treated

Based on the TRACE analysis, León has the most energy efficient transport
among cities with similar climates. With an energy consumption of 0.77 MJ            Private transport energy consumption - MJ/passenger-km
per passenger-km, León performs far better than similar cities recorded in
the TRACE database, including México City, Budapest, and Paris. However,
the high number of vehicles translates into high use of gasoline. In 2012,
fuel used by private transport cost over 1.5 billion pesos (about US$117
million).
   Like many Mexican cities, León is struggling with traffic, especially
during peak hours. In recent years, overpasses were built to help ease the
traffic. Also, a second beltway on the city’s north end is being constructed
and expected to reduce congestion. Traffic is monitored by a city system.      León is one of the most bike-friendly large cities in Latin America. It has

since roughly 7 percent of residents use bikes for their daily commute.
However, if the infrastructure was improved, the number of bikers would
increase. Around 27 km of bike lanes need major repairs and some are
not connected to others. Thus, the city plans to build 30 km more of bike
lanes in the near future and better connect them to the public transport
system. According to the Biking Master Plan, León should have 540 km
of bike lanes by 2020. Meanwhile, the city plans to install a few docking
stations in the most popular spots, from where people can rent bikes. Also,
new docking stations should be included in the Optibús system. People
renting bikes at the docking stations should be able to transfer with no
charge to the SIT network.

Since 2009, León has a plant that treats the highly polluted water from
the city’s leather industry, with a capacity of 150 L/s. Most of the plants
have small treatment capacities, from 1.3 L/s (Ciudad Industrial) to 70
L/s (Las Joyas). Two of the treatment facilities provide service to rural
communities.

More than a third of the wastewater treated in León is reused. In 2012,
nearly 19 million m3 was used for different purposes. About 336,000 m3
was used by local industry (especially for leather tanning), nearly 120,000
m3 was to irrigate the city’s green areas, and the rest went to agriculture.

TRACE sector prioritization is based on the energy savings potential of
the city being evaluated. These savings are estimated by considering three
factors: the city authority control (CA), the relative energy intensity (REI)
and the total amount of the city’s energy spending (in US$ dollars).
   City Authority Control (CA): is the measure of control the city
government exerts over the relevant sector, measured by six factors:
finance; human resources; data and information; policies; regulations and
enforcement; and assets and infrastructure. CA is measured between
0 and 1, where 0 is non control and 1 is total control. City government
representatives agreed to the level of control of each sector, as per the
figure below.

can be improved. In recent years, the city replaced old, inefficient bulbs with
more efficient sodium vapor lamps and is now launching a pilot with LED
bulbs. However, before going further, the city should consider performing
an audit of the lighting system and carry out upgrades where appropriate.
   The upgrade program could help the city reduce the annual amount of
electricity used for public lights since the new bulbs can deliver the same
lighting levels using less energy and reduce carbon emissions and operating
costs. Also, maintenance costs and service interruptions for CFLs and LEDs
are lower and make the system more efficient.

Street Lighting Timing Program

A second TRACE recommendation is a light timing program that reduces
the light intensity according to the needs of a particular area. This is an
inexpensive method in which electricity for streetlights can be substantially
reduced. With initial investments of a minimum of US$100,000, the annual
electricity consumption for León’s streetlights could be reduced by at
                                                                                                              Source: ledoes.com

pole and uses wireless technology to monitor and dim the lights to different
levels throughout the day. The upgrading process simply required adding
a small antenna to the lamp heads, which is plugged into the electronic
ballast, with no need for more wiring. The lights are switched on at 100
percent at 7 p.m., dimmed to 75 percent at 10 p.m., and to 50 percent
at midnight. If the lights are still on at 5 p.m., they are increased to 100
percent. Light dimming programs are very efficient because they save both
energy and money, reduce the brightness of bulbs at times of low road
or street use, and change brightness at different times. TRACE made this
recommendation to many Eastern European cities which are now taking
steps to adopt it.
   This system could be employed in some areas in León, such as
neighborhoods with reduced pedestrian traffic (such as parking lots).
Through a motion sensor, the lights are switched on only when someone is
walking in the area and remain off when the area is empty. These automatic
systems were introduced in some Bucharest (Romania) neighborhoods

Besides improving the vehicles, León is evaluating the building of transfer
stations. At present, trucks must carry solid waste from the collection
points to the landfill that is 30 km away. Transfer stations would significantly
reduce the time traveled, decrease fuel consumption, and improve overall
efficiency. It is estimated that transfer stations would reduce the fuel used
by 2.5 million L (94.2 million MJ). This would result in 39 million MJ or
10.8 million kWh in energy savings, which would save about US$200,000
a year.

This recommendation suggests that cities can improve the fuel efficiency
of their fleets so as to reduce fuel consumption and related expenditures.
León has about 2,500 vehicles in its fleet, including 1,700 cars (mainly for
the police) and a few dozen large trucks that require a great deal of fuel.
In 2012, city data indicate the fleet used 7.8 million L of diesel, for a city
budget outlay of 78.8 million pesos (almost US$6 million).                                                Source: unionguanajuato.mx.

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of the recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define the targets that indicate the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, and monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece
of the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 US$ per km - Determine annual energy costs on a per km basis.

   •	 Lumens per watt - Determine the average effectiveness of illumination provided by current streetlights.

 Performance Contracting for Street lighting Energy Efficiency.”


 Akola contracted with an ESCO to replace over 11,500 streetlights (standard fluorescent, mercury vapor, and sodium vapor) with T5 fluorescent lamps.
 The contractor, AEL, financed 100 percent of the investments, launched the project, maintained the new lights, and received part of the verified energy
 savings to recover its investment. Under the contract, the city paid the ESCO 95 percent of the verified energy bill savings over the six-year period it was
 in effect. It also paid AEL an annual fee to maintain the lamps and fixtures. Initial investments were about US$120,000 and the upgrade was completed
 in three months. The project saved 56 percent in energy costs a year, which meant a total savings of US$133,000—a payback in less than 11 months!

 In 2000, Dobrich audited its entire streetlight system, which resulted in a project the next year to modernize it. Mercury bulbs were replaced with HPS
 lamps and compact fluorescent lamps (a total of 6,450 EE lamps). The control system was also upgraded, and two electric meters were installed. These
 measures delivered an illumination level of 95 percent and saved 2,819,640 kWh a year (€91,400 a year).

 This project, which involved a partnership between the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) and the city of Los Angeles, is the largest streetlight upgrade by
 a city to date, replacing traditional lights with environmentally friend LEDs. It will reduce CO2 emissions by 40,500 tons and save US$10 million annually
 through reduced maintenance costs and 40 percent reduced energy consumption.
    The mayor and Bureau of Street Lighting collaborated with the CCI’s Outdoor Lighting Program to review the latest technology, financing strategies,
 and public-private implementation models for LED upgrades. CCI’s analysis of models and technology, and its financial advice, were key sources for
 developing this comprehensive plan.

 be upgraded. It also capitalized on its status to attract financial institutions that would offer favorable loans and funding mechanisms since they wanted
 to create positive relationships with the city. Thus, the city was able to create a well-developed business case for the project.

 Oslo formed a joint venture with Hafslund ASA, the largest electricity distribution company in Norway. Old fixtures containing PCB and mercury were
 replaced with high performance, HPS lights and an advanced data communication system was installed using power-line transmissions that reduced the
 maintenance. They also installed ‘intelligent communication systems’ that dim lights when climate conditions and usage patterns permit, which reduced
 energy use and increased the bulbs’ life, which also reduced maintenance (and related costs).
    The system is fully equipped with all its components and is calibrated to correct some minor problems related to the communication units. Overall,
 the system has performed well under normal operating conditions.

 Control system for public lighting, Kirklees, UK
 Source: http://www.kirklees.gov.uk/community/environment/green/greencouncil/LightingStoryboard.pdf.


 Instead of turning streetlights off at certain times of the day, as is done in other cities, Kirklees chose to dim lights to varying levels. It adopted this course
 (not turning the lights off completely) so as to prevent crime. Dimming equipment that used wireless technology was installed on each light pole. This
 required only adding a small antenna to the lamp heads, which was plugged into the electronic ballast with no need for more wiring. Generally the lights
 are switched on 100 percent at 7 p.m., dimmed to 75 percent at 10 p.m., and to 50 percent at midnight. At 5 a.m., they are increased again to 100
 percent. By dimming the lights gradually, people can adjust to lower lighting levels, and the dimming is barely noticed. The remote monitoring system
 also provides accurate information and allows streetlight engineers to identify failed lamps quickly. This reduces the need for engineers to carry out night
 inspections and also other on-site maintenance costs. The dimming can save up to 30 percent of the electricity used annually. By installing dimmers on
 1,200 lights, Kirklees estimates savings of about US$3 million in energy costs a year


 Intelligent outdoor city lighting system, Oslo, Norway
 Source: http://www.echelon.com/solutions/unique/appstories/oslo.pdf.


 An ‘intelligent’ outdoor lighting system replaced fixtures containing PCB and mercury with high-performance HPS lights. These are monitored and
 controlled by an advanced data communication system which operates over the existing 230 V power lines, using special technology. An operations
 center remotely monitors and logs the streetlights’ energy use and running time. It collects information from traffic and weather sensors and uses an
 internal astronomical clock to calculate the availability of natural light from the sun and moon. This data is then used to automatically dim some or all
 the lights. Controlling light levels this way not only saved a significant amount of energy (estimated at 62 percent) but extended lamp life, thus reducing
 replacement costs. The city used the monitoring system to identify lamp failures, often fixing them before being notified by residents. By predicting
 the lights’ failure based on a comparison of actual running hours against expected lamp life, the repair crews have become more efficient. The city paid
 about US$12 million to replace 10,000 lights and saves about US$450,000 in operating costs a year. However, it is estimated that if the program was
 expanded through the entire city, the greater economies of scale would yield a payback in less than five years.

 Motorway intelligent lights upgrade, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
 Source: http://www.lighting.philips.com.my/v2/knowledge/case_studies-detail.jsp?id=159544.


 The project introduced a lighting project for the highways leading to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which cover 66 km. The main requirement
 was that each lamp should be dimmed independently from the others. This called for a network linking all 3,300 posts to a central control facility. Further,
 maintenance needed to be more efficient and visibility needed to be set at levels that did not compromise vision. The project used tele-management
 controls which made it possible to switch or control each light from a central point. It also allows the system to dim specific lights to levels that are
 appropriate for road conditions, receive instant messages when lights fail, and create a database where all information is stored. The project significantly
 reduced energy consumption besides the 45 percent saved due to the dimming circuits.

ANNEX 3: FUEL-EFFICIENT WASTE VEHICLE OPERATIONS
 Description                                                                                               ATTRIBUTES
 When the working practices of waste vehicles and their crews are changed, this can reduce fuel use per    Energy-saving Potential
 ton of waste collected/transported. An assessment of current waste collection systems is needed to        >200,000 kWh/year
 identify what alterations can be made. Upgrades can include improved driver training, route planning,     First Cost
 and/or management of services.                                                                            <US$100,000

 Activity                                         Method

                                                 Encourage waste operators to plot and digitize all collection points and routes on a map, which is done
                                                 best with a GIS. It is important to improve the routes, for example, to ensure that waste vehicles are full
                                                 at the points where they dispose of their loads, eliminate vehicles having to back track, and minimize

                                                 as waterways, to save energy and reduce heavy road traffic. The city fleet manager should regularly
                                                 review routes with operators to ensure they are efficient.
                                                    See the Trabzon, Daventry, Oeiras, and Paris case studies for details.


                                                 The city requires waste operators to provide driver training and improvement programs in conjunction
                                                 with the human resources team and fleet manager. A staff training team can be used to create and
                                                 manage an accredited training program after an initial assessment.
Continue driver training and improvement            The city could also appoint a third party to install vehicle trackers and monitor drivers after the
                                                 training. Further, it should encourage operators to reward good driving, for example, by giving drivers a
                                                 share of the fuel cost savings.
                                                    This activity works well with educating operators about the benefits of efficient operations.

                                                 The city raises operators’ awareness about the benefits of fuel-efficient practices. This can be done by
                                                 one-to-one sessions or conferences for the major operators where the city describes the benefits of

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of the recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define the targets that indicate the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece of
the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Calculate the original fuel use per ton of waste collected and transferred and per km travelled.

   •	 Calculate the improved fuel use per ton of waste collected and transferred.

   •	 Measure current performance using data from the maintenance department. If this information is not available, the city should measure current fleet performance over a

     reasonable period, for example, reviewing performance annually, over five years.

   •	 Produce monthly management targets and schedules to identify how the program is performing and the magnitude of effort that will be required to achieve the KPI.

 nr263.pdf.


 Oeiras partnered with the Technical University of Lisbon (IST) on a project to review the municipal fleet’s performance, which included waste collection
 trucks. The objectives were to assess the fuel consumption by vehicle type, establish performance indicators (km/L), propose simple measures to
 improve efficiency (eco-driving training), study the potential to switch fuels (biodiesel and natural gas), and perform an environmental assessment.
 Lacking complete data, the project used refueling data and mileage records to estimate the fuel consumption of waste trucks and its impact on the city
 budget. A more advanced fleet management system was planned for the later phases, using technologies supported by GPS to allow for better control
 over fleet operations and improve the data. The project cost of US$45,384 was funded by the city budget.
    By the end of 2006, OEINERGE (the project coordinator) estimated that processing used frying oils into biodiesel and utilizing it to fuel some of the
 fleet’s waste trucks could reduce about 10 percent of the fossil fuel consumed. The project also informed the city about areas that could be better
 managed and had an important role in disseminating best practices, stressing the importance of keeping accurate records and monitoring operations to
 achieve fuel and cost savings.

 As part of the municipal solid waste management system, a study was undertaken to determine if collection costs could be decreased by streamlining
 the routes in Trabzon. Data related to present spending, truck type and capacity, solid waste production, and number of inhabitants and GPS receivers for
 each route were collected and recorded (using GIS software) over 777 container location points. The collection/hauling processes were improved using
 a shortest-path model with ‘Route View Pro’ software. Thus, fuel savings amounted to 24.7 percent in distance and 44.3 percent in time for collection
 and hauling. Total costs were cut by 24.7 percent.

Daventry local authority worked with the Northamptonshire Waste Partnership (NWP) to rationalize the number of domestic waste collection routes
from nine to eight, reducing diesel costs by 12 percent and increasing spare capacity by 14 percent without increasing labor hours. The project was
carried out by an external environmental advisory and management company using the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network (ITN) Layer with
Road Routing Information (RRI), which includes detailed road routing and driving information such as width, height, and weight restrictions, taking into
account the delays caused by left and right turns and intersections. This allowed each waste vehicle route to be improved and balanced the workload
between routes on a daily or on a weekly basis.
   The system streamlined the waste collection procedures, which increased spare capacity that could be used later for areas experiencing new housing
growth. This, in turn, reduced the need for new routes. The project saved over US$154,136 a year for Daventry alone (which did not include savings by
nearby local authorities). Since the project was financed by regional public funds, the overall savings greatly exceed the cost of the contract and city
staff time.

Maribor’s public waste collection, management, and transport company (Snaga) conducted a comprehensive 3-month training program for drivers to
adopt eco-driving. As part of the EU-wide ‘Rewarding and Recognition Schemes for Energy Conserving Driving, Vehicle Procurement and Maintenance’
(RECODRIVE) project, it reduced fuel consumption by an average of 4.27 percent over eight months. The savings were used to provide bonuses to fuel-
efficient drivers. Also, by changing its routes, Snaga collected the same amount of waste in the same area with one less vehicle.
   The RECODRIVE project also involved disseminating information about fuel savings of over 10 percent in municipal fleets across Europe. Fleet owners
promoted the concept by inviting other firms to workshops and conferences on eco-driving and fuel-efficient vehicle operations. The scheme can be
adopted at the city level by waste management operators.

General Santos City Solid Waste Management Council organized workshops to create ways to make collection systems and management of dumpsites
more efficient. Formerly, collection was concentrated only in the central business district with no regular routes or schedules. With the help of
stakeholders, the city created schedules and routes and identified pre- and post-collection measures. Routes were modified to reduce the number of left
turns and U-turns to increase the speed of collection and reduce accidents. Also, the number of staff on each compactor truck was reduced from five
to a maximum of three, and waste collection trips were reduced from six to two or three a day. The new, efficient scheme allowed the trucks to cover a
wider area without increasing the number of trips, accelerated waste collection, and provided more time for vehicles to be maintained and allowed the
crews to rest. The scheme succeeded, given the high levels of community participation and coordination of working groups.
    At the same time, campaigns were launched to promote recycling, the city improved the management of the dumpsite, and a new landfill is being
built.

In 2008, the Isseane Energy from Waste (EfW) and Materials Recycling Facility was opened on the banks of the Seine by the Intercommunal Syndicate
for Treatment of Municipal Waste (SYCTOM) to replace an existing incinerator that had operated for over 40 years. The project was approved by the
municipal council of Issy-les-Moulineaux in July 2000 with an investment of US$686 million to be financed over seven years by a type of prudential
borrowing, based upon gate fee revenues from the communities.
    Isseane was designed on the principle that waste should not need to be hauled more than six miles to be treated. The facility’s design also considered
traffic issues and approved a scheme where waste deliveries to the facility occur below ground, to control dust, noise, and odors. Also, its location makes
use of the Seine, with barges hauling away inert bottom ash from the incineration process for use in ancillary projects.

 Italy’s waste services are delivered through public bodies known as ‘ATOs’, which are funded by local authorities that are responsible for determining the
 services needed to manage waste. While the infrastructure is often funded locally, for large facilities there may also be some private finance, through
 a form of prudential borrowing. In some cases, the facilities or services may be procured through a tendering process from private companies, with
 contracts either with a local authority or the ATO. An ATO can also partly or fully fund a waste infrastructure project through eco-taxes. For example,
 the CONAI scheme raises US$324 million a year from an eco-tax on all packaging that sets aside funds for new infrastructure.

 This recommendation is to develop a municipal building energy benchmarking program that collects                Energy-saving Potential
 and reports annually on the energy use and costs, water use and costs, floor areas, and names of                100,000–200,000 kWh/year
 building managers (if any). The goal is to identify the city’s most energy-intensive buildings so as to         First Cost
 develop the best EE opportunities. Also, it is to use the EE program resources most effectively and             < US$100,000
 spend time/money on the areas where EE can be most easily achieved. The program collects annual                 Speed of Implementation
 data to measure the energy/carbon footprint for municipal operations.                                           1–2 years
    This recommendation is best suited to larger cities with the size/capacity to conduct such a                 Co-Benefits
 program. A starting point is to routinely monitor and analyze building energy consumption and identify          Reduced carbon emissions
 ways to improve EE. However, good benchmarks require detailed analyses because similar buildings                Efficient water use

                                                       This benchmarking is usually done in order to label buildings. See the Singapore case study for
                                                   details.


                                                    One of the most important ways to promote EE in building operations is peer pressure since no building

                                                   building energy intensity with other departments/operators will reduce energy use and encourage
                                                   them to share their experiences with others, city-wide.


                                                   The boldest action is to present energy performance data to the public, press, voters, and potential

                                                   their properties and publish their findings.



Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. Where the city authority (CA) adopts a
recommendation, it should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need
to be complicated or time consuming but should, at least (a) identify information sources; (b) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate
equipment/processes; (c) set protocols for keeping records; (d) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (e) assign responsibilities for
each piece of the process; (f) create a way to audit and review performance; and (g) create reporting and review cycles.

 www.esmap.org/esmap/node/656.


 Under the Kiev Public Buildings Energy Efficiency Project, 1,270 public buildings—including health facilities, schools, and cultural facilities—were
 upgraded with cost-effective EE systems and equipment. The project focused on the supply side, such as automation and control systems, as well as the
 demand side, by installing meters and weatherization, along with creating appropriate heating rates. The project was conducted by the Kiev City State
 Administration (KCSA). Savings were estimated at 333,423 Gigacalories (Gcal) per year by 2006—normalized by degree/days in the baseline year—or
 about a 26 percent savings compared to the buildings’ heat consumption before the project. These upgrades also improved the buildings’ comfort levels,
 helped foster an EE services industry, and raised public awareness about the issues.
    The project cost US$27.4 million and was financed through a World Bank loan, Swedish Government grant, and KCSA funds. Based on the project’s
 success, many other Ukrainian cities have requested information and shown interest in launching similar programs.

the BCA to adopt the recommendations. The plan contains measures that span the whole life cycle of a building. It begins with a set of EE standards to
ensure buildings are designed right and continues with an energy management program to ensure they are operated efficiently throughout their life-
span. The BEEMP consists of the following programs:
   •	 Review and update energy standards.

   •	 Audit the energy use in selected buildings.

   •	 Create energy efficiency indices (EEI) and performance benchmarks.

   •	 Develop ways to better manage the energy use of public buildings.

   •	 Insist on performance-based contracts.

   •	 Conduct research and development.

The Energy Smart Building Labeling Program, developed by the Energy Sustainability Unit (ESU) of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the
National Environment Agency (NEA), aims to promote EE and conservation by awarding owners of EE buildings with a label that recognizes this fact.
Authorities use the ‘Energy Smart Tool’, an online benchmarking system, to evaluate the energy performance of office buildings and hotels. The program
allows building owners to review their energy consumption patterns and compare them against industry norms. The Energy Smart Building Label is
reviewed every three years and is given at an annual awards ceremony. Besides reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in the buildings
sector, the program does the following:
   •	 Saves energy through enlightened energy management

   •	 Brings higher satisfaction to occupants

   •	 Enhances a company’s corporate image

Thirty-five Bulgarian cities created the Municipal Energy Efficiency Network (MEEN). ‘EnEffect’ is the Secretariat of the Network. Since April 2001, MEEN
has enrolled four municipal associations as members. To create a successful municipal energy plan, MEEN created an energy database and training
program for municipal officials. Information is collected and stored in municipal ‘passports’ through surveys of organizations and entered into a database,
or EE information system (EEIS), which includes an analysis. The database, a Microsoft Access application, contains objective, technical information,
and the analysis includes non-technical information, such as financial, institutional, and regulatory documents generated at the national level. This
information is organized into three categories: city-wide consumption, site-specific consumption, and city-wide production.

Lviv reduced its annual energy consumption in its public buildings by about 10 percent and tap water consumption by about 12 percent through a
monitoring and targeting (M&T) program. The program was launched in December 2006 and was operating fully by May 2007. By 2010, it produced
net savings of UAH 9.5 million (US$1.2 million). It provided the city with monthly consumption data for district heating, natural gas, electricity, and
water in all of the city’s 530 public buildings. Utility use is reported and analyzed each month and the targets for monthly consumption are determined
annually, based on historical patterns and negotiated when these are expected to change. Actual consumption is reviewed monthly against the target,
with deviations spotted and acted upon immediately and the buildings’ performance is presented to the public.
   The M&T program was able to reap significant savings with minimal investment and recurring costs. The utility bill reductions were very helpful, given
fiscal constraints and rising energy prices. The program was helped by the fact that most of the public buildings already had water and energy meters
and the city had been collaborating with international aid programs in municipal energy since the late 1990s. Also, it was due to a strong, committed
city government: The city created an energy management unit (EMU) and provided resources to train all personnel responsible for building utility use.
The M&T system established responsibility, created transparency, and laid the groundwork for sustained improvements in energy and water efficiency.

                                           normal renovations, this is the best use of limited financing. For example, if a new roof is required, it is a

                                           contracts may be signed with ESCOs that will pay for the up-front cost of the upgrades and then share

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation, it
should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time consuming but should, at least (a) identify information sources; (b) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (c) set protocols for keeping records; (d) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (e) assign responsibilities for each piece of
the process; (f) create a way to audit and review performance; and (g) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 US$/m2 - Determine annual energy costs on a per-m2 basis for all municipal office buildings.

   •	 kWhe/m2 - Determine annual electrical energy consumption on a per-m2 basis for all municipal office buildings.

   •	 kWht/m2 - Determine annual heating energy consumption on a per-m2 basis for all municipal office buildings.

   •	 US$/year saved - Aggregate total energy savings generated through the life of the program.

  Berlin, in partnership with the Berlin Energy Agency (BEA), pioneered an excellent model to improve EE in its buildings. Together they managed the
  upgrade of public and private buildings, preparing tenders for work that is guaranteed to reduce emissions. The tenders require the ESCOs that win the
  contracts to reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 26 percent. To date, 1,400 buildings have been upgraded, reducing CO2 emissions by 60,400 tons a
  year. These upgrades cost the building owners nothing and savings were almost immediate.

 Stuttgart reduces its CO2 emissions each year by about 7,200 tons through an innovative form of internal contracting, making use of a revolving fund
 to finance energy- and water-saving measures. The city then reinvests the savings into new activities, creating a cycle of environmental improvements
 and reduced emissions.

 The European Display Campaign is a voluntary scheme designed by energy experts from European towns and cities. When it began in 2003, it aimed
 to encourage local authorities to publicly display the energy and environmental performances of city buildings—adopting the same energy label that is
 used for household appliances. Since 2008, private companies have also been encouraged to use the ‘display’ for their corporate social responsibilities.

                                            The city produces a procurement requirement linked to international engine performance standards, for
                                            example, EURO series (others include the United States Environmental Protection Agency [US EPA] or
                                            Japan’s Heisei Standards), that have already been adopted by various countries outside the EU, such as India
                                            and China. The more stringent the air emission standard, the more efficient the engine technology is likely

                                       The city should define a maintenance program that suits their fleet profile and ensure that city-owned
                                       vehicles are operating at desired performance levels. Maintenance requirements can be extended to taxis
                                       and buses, although these can be voluntary where the vehicles are not city-owned. Municipal compliance
                                       with the objective should be made public to demonstrate leadership by example.

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. Where the CA adopts a recommendation, it
should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time consuming but should, at least (a) identify information sources; (b) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/

the process; (f) create a way to audit and review performance; and (g) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Determine KPIs: Check vehicle fleet fuel consumption records, emission test records, and number of maintenance checks undertaken.

   •	 Survey baseline performance (fuel consumption).

   •	 Survey ongoing performance on fuel consumed per vehicle-mile.

  The mayor introduced hybrid autos for the fleet of police cars. Each vehicle produces 25–30 percent lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional
  fuel-powered models and averages twice the distance per gallon for city driving. At a cost of US$25,391 per vehicle, the payback period for the capital
  investment was just over one year. To maximize their economic and environmental benefits, the vehicles were assigned to precincts that cover large

Bus inspection and maintenance program, Jakarta, Indonesia
Source: http://www.unep.org/pcfv/pcfvnewsletter/2009Issue2/Retrofit.pdf.


To reduce emissions from the city bus fleet, nine bus companies developed their own internal inspection and maintenance programs that checked for
engine malfunctions and excessive smoke and measured the exhaust. They were successful because they introduced an extensive education program to
raise technicians’ and drivers’ awareness about the environment and safe and fuel-saving driving practices. Also, they offered technical training on how
to conduct a proper inspection and maintenance program.
   Altogether, over 13,000 buses were tested in 2001–2002, and 89 technicians and 1,372 drivers were trained. Through the inspections, the companies
learned that certain problems could be easily fixed: cleaning air filters, adjusting fuel injection timing and injection nozzle pressure, and calibrating the
fuel injection pump. In some cases, air filters and fuel injection nozzles had to be replaced.
   The regular maintenance reduced diesel soot by 30 percent and fuel consumption by 5 percent. The improved driving methods reduced consumption
by another 10 percent. About a third of the vehicles failed the inspection but over 80 percent could be repaired with minor costs. The inspection test
in Jakarta, which was free, checked acceleration emissions to measure the smoke produced, which is a simple procedure that indicates gross engine
malfunction.
   The Jakarta program started with just two bus companies on a voluntary basis but, by the end of the program, grew to nine, as the economic benefits
of inspection and maintenance became more apparent.

national government funds available until 2012 to pilot test various energy efficient transport solutions (including improving the buses’ EE). The CCA
sought cooperation with neighboring cities to launch a trial project that involved energy efficient buses.

Monitoring

Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. Where the CA adopts a recommendation, it
should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time consuming but should, at least (a) identify information sources; (b) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes,; (c) set protocols for keeping records; (d) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (e) assign responsibilities for each piece of
the process; (f) create a way to audit and review performance; and (g) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Determine the city’s total energy use, savings achieved from EE initiatives; and the percentage of these initiatives for which data is collected yearly.

   •	 Set targets for the city for each KPI, for example, improve KPI performance by 20 percent in five years. Produce annual reports on progress toward the targets.

   •	 Monitor and update the action plan regularly.

In 2008, the mayor issued an executive order that established a goal for the city to reduce its annual GHG emissions from a 1990 baseline by 7 percent by
2012 and 20 percent by 2020, according to its Plan of Conservation and Development. To meet this goal, the order required the city to obtain at least 25
percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2012 and for all new major city construction and renovation projects to earn at least a silver rating
under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program, or its equivalent under similar rating systems.
    The order established a Sustainability Community Advisory Committee charged with
    •	 Overseeing the completion of a city-wide and municipal government GHG inventory;

    •	 Recommending actions to the city for meeting its sustainability goals;

    •	 Preparing educational materials for households and businesses that describe climate change and actions they can take to promote sustainability; and

    •	 Identifying economic and workforce development opportunities associated with green jobs.

   Collaborating with the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, the city developed a program to promote sustainability. It includes measures for auditing
energy use, reducing total building footprints, using advanced waste treatment techniques, and analyzing the feasibility of installing renewable energy
systems in public and private buildings.
   Since the order was issued, the city and Regional Business Council also developed a comprehensive sustainability plan, BGreen 2020. It was developed
following an 18-month planning process with a Community Advisory Committee and five technical subcommittees. The process involved over 200
participants from city, state, and federal governments; businesses; and civic and neighborhood groups. The plan is a comprehensive strategy to improve
the quality of life, social equity, and economic competitiveness while reducing GHG emissions and increasing the community’s resilience to the impacts of
climate change.

Spain’s Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency Strategy 2008–2012 (E4), which constitutes its National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), aims to
achieve security of supply in terms of quantity and price with some basic levels of self-sufficiency, taking into consideration the environmental impact and
economic competitiveness.
   The plan identifies seven sectors including agriculture, buildings, domestic and office equipment, industry, public services, transport, and energy
transformation. In each, it presents strategic objectives as well as the course the energy policy should take to achieve them. The plan establishes a primary
energy saving of 24,776 ktoe in 2012 as a quantified energy objective as opposed to the scenario used as the base for the initial Plan 2004–2012,
involving 13.7 percent. The plan also monitors progress against previous action plans, identifies investments and the potential for improving each sector,
and sets targets for the immediate future.
   The financing is done through investments in the private sector and public services, the costs of which are passed on to consumers and employers, who
make investments that improve the processes or equipment they produce (using less energy).

Brisbane’s population is expected to continue to grow over the next two decades. In 2007, the City Council issued Brisbane’s Plan for Action on Climate
Change and Energy, which described the actions for the short term (about 18 months) and long term (over five years). Brisbane has three major challenges:
climate change, high peak oil demand, and GHG emissions. Analysts suggest that if Brisbane responds well to these issues, it may generate significant
economic benefits by developing sustainable industries while saving resources. Brisbane is introducing various approaches to sustainable development. Also,
in the city’s ‘Our Shared Vision: Living in Brisbane 2026’ policy document, authorities committed to cutting GHG emissions in half, reusing all wastewater,
and restoring 40 percent of the natural habitat by 2026.


Integrated resource planning and management, Stockholm, Sweden

Stockholm has pursued integrated city planning and management to become a sustainable city. It has a comprehensive urban vision, environmental
programs, and concrete action plans to reduce GHG emissions and tackle climate change. It implements integrated urban planning approaches that
consider ecological benefits and efficient resource use.
   The ongoing redevelopment in the city’s southern district, Hammarby Sjöstad, is a good model for understanding integrated approaches. The area aims
to be twice as sustainable as Sweden was in 1995. It launched integrated resource management (waste, energy, water, and sewage) through systematic
stakeholder collaboration and has transformed the linear urban metabolism into a cyclical one known as the Hammarby Model.
   According to Grontmij AB, a private consultant firm in Stockholm, primary assessments of Hammarby Sjöstad development show that the area has
reduced nonrenewable energy use by 28–42 percent and global warming potential by 29 to 37 percent.

hope is that the findings from this study will provide useful lessons to other
cities that are interested in improving the efficiency of energy use. Both
the methodology and specific energy efficiency measures identified here
are likely to be illustrative of the potential in other cities in Mexico. The
World Bank intends to draw on the findings from Puebla and other Mexican

The analysis consists of three components: (1) an energy benchmarking
module that compares key performance indicators (KPIs) in similar cities;      During the TRACE team’s initial visit, it interviews staff in various agencies
(2) a prioritization model that identifies areas which offer the greatest      to collect data, augmenting benchmarking results with city-specific

1.	 Collecting City Energy Use Data

The TRACE database has 28 KPIs from 80 cities. Each of the data points
in the KPIs is collected for the city before the tool is applied; once TRACE
is launched, the collection grows as new, reliable data become available.


2.	 Analyzing City Energy Use Against Similar Cities

The city’s performance is compared with others with similar population,
climate, and human development in each of the six areas (3–6 KPIs per
area). The benchmarking provides an overview of energy performance so
the city can assess its rankings against the others. The relative energy
intensity (REI)—the percentage by which energy use in one area can                                           Source: TRACE Tool

TRACE limitations

Because TRACE is relatively simple and easy to implement, it also means
that its analyses are somewhat limited. For example, it may identify
streetlights as a priority in terms of potential energy savings, but it does
not detail the costs to carry out rehabilitation projects. Thus, even if the
energy-saving potential is considered high, the costs may be even higher,
and investments may not be viable. Also, although TRACE focuses on the
service areas for which the city is responsible, the tool cannot factor in the
institutional/legislative mechanisms that may be needed to launch specific
EE actions.
   While TRACE can be applied well in Eastern European cities and
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, where most public
utilities are under the city governments (which gives them substantial
control over the TRACE areas), elsewhere, as in Latin America, cities have
less control over them, either because they are managed at the state
or federal level, or because the service is provided by a contractor. For
example, in 2013, TRACE was applied in Romania’s seven largest cities
where important services, such as public transport, district heating,
streetlights, and municipal buildings were under local control. In some,
even where operations and maintenance (O&M) are outsourced to a
contractor (as with streetlights), the city owns the infrastructure and can
make the final decisions. Thus, in Romania, the TRACE studies helped local
and national authorities prepare local EE measures that were supported
with funds from the European Union (EU), whose Europe 2020 Strategy
aimed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 percent over the
next few years.

Street lighting is coordinated by the local Ministry of Environment and
Public Services through its Public Lighting Department. The city maintains
the infrastructure through, Citelum, a private contractor. Currently, there
are about 98,000 lamps spread across the city, of which nearly 80 percent
are sodium vapor bulbs, 10 percent are induction lamps, and 2.4 percent
are metal halide. Only 15 percent of the streetlights are metered.
   The lights only cover 69 percent of the 3,588 km of city roads; when
compared to cities with a similar HDI, this is the second lowest figure in the
TRACE database after Belgrade.

The cost of energy for streetlights is over 167 million pesos or US$12.5
million.9 About 75–85 percent is paid for by the DAP, under which each
electricity user pays a levy to cover this service.
   Citelum’s contract, which expires in 2014, requires it to carry out the
streetlight maintenance plan the city approves each year. It is paid 1,970
pesos per light pole for 30 months (about US$150). Residents can report
problems through a call center and Citelum must fix them within 24
hours. The company also must determine the life-span of the bulbs and
replace them before they stop working. Also, under the ‘Colonies 100%
Illuminated’ program (Colonias 100% iluminadas), Citelum must ensure
that at least 95 percent of the city’s lamps work at any given time. A key
issue for public lighting is the light fixture. Many cannot incorporate newer
technologies, which hampers the city’s plans to increase or replace existing
lamps with more efficient technologies.

are dimmed from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m., depending on traffic. In the near future,
the city also plans to expand coverage by 10,000 lamps in areas that are
still not lit or where service is deficient.
   Also, the city intends to replace sodium vapor bulbs with LEDs with
money from its budget and a credit line from the federal government. This
program will help municipalities upgrade/improve their lighting systems,
thus significantly reducing electricity consumption.
   A pre-feasibility study is underway to assess the potential energy
savings if LEDs were installed. Some technical problems that might arise
with a widespread switch to LEDs are the fluctuations in electricity voltage,
lack of meters, and incompatibility of existing technologies and fixtures.

beautiful building (Palacio Municipal) built at the turn of the 20th century,
in Spanish renaissance style, with neo-classical and Italian influences. The
building is in the historic center, where several impressive old monuments
are located. In 1977, the federal government designated the city a Zone
of Historic Monuments. Ten years later, Puebla’s downtown area became a
UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.

A state initiative to help the city offices become more efficient was approved
in 2011. The program supports measures with regard to energy, water,
and solid waste, including building maintenance and refurbishing plans. So
far, the program has lowered energy consumption in three buildings.12
   Local authorities are encouraging city residents and building owners to
develop solar energy facilities, since the region has great solar potential.
Moreover, solar energy investments are becoming increasingly attractive
in México as technology costs have dropped and electricity tariffs have
increased.

Recently, the city and private sector launched a joint program, Basura por
Seguridad (Trash for Safety), to increase the amount of recycled trash.
The city sells the plastic, paper, and metal collected by residents to private
entities, and the proceeds go to a fund to increase public safety.
   The increased waste at the landfill is a growing concern. Initially, a waste
treatment plant to convert solid waste into energy was proposed, but the
plan was dropped due to laws that reduced its economic attractiveness to
independent energy producers of waste-to-energy schemes. Thus, the city
is exploring the option of producing biofuel through thermal treatment,
and selling it to the local petrochemical industry.

Public Transport

As in most Mexican cities, public transport is mainly coordinated by state
authorities. Usually, the local government engages with state and federal
entities to support initiatives such as expanding bike lanes and pedestrian
walkways or building new infrastructure.
   At present, 42.6 percent of city residents use public transport, 21
percent use their own cars, and 36.3 percent walk or bike. Public transport
use is similar to that in comparable TRACE cities, including Paris and
Bangkok. According to INEGI 2010, city residents travel 3.5 million trips a
day by all transport means. The average trip on public transport is 25 km,
5 km shorter that those made by private cars.                                 Puebla’s public transport consists of 284 routes, including the BRT system

Puebla’s water sector is managed by a decentralized public entity,
(Sistema Operador de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de
Puebla [SOAPAP]). The company provides water to 441,838 households,
covering 33.9 percent of the municipal area over a distribution network of
3,136 km. Due to the lack of infrastructure, the company cannot reach
all neighborhoods. Thus, several private water systems serve some city
districts.
   Puebla uses groundwater sources from two rivers (Atoyac and Alseca),
but most of the water comes from the Alto Atoyac aquifer (spread over          Some of the water sources have high levels of salt and sulfur and must be

In 2012, SOAPAP used 66.2 million kWh of electricity to process 116.8

(US$12.2 million). Together, energy used for potable and wastewater was
15.3 percent of SOAPAP’s expenditures.
   Water fees are linked to consumption. Residential customers pay 6.67
pesos (US$0.52) per m3 if they use under 30 m3 a month, 10.6 pesos
(US$0.83) for 30–50 m3 and 10.7 pesos for anything over that. Industries
and businesses pay 9.99 pesos (US$0.78) per m3 for under 20 m3 a

Rivers without any treatment, increasing water pollution.
   In 2012, 54.6 million m3 of wastewater was treated, which required
7,784,263 kWh of electricity. With an energy consumption of 0.142 kWh/
m3, the city is in the lower end of the TRACE database. Puebla performs
better than Toronto and Sydney but uses more energy to treat one m3

TRACE sector prioritization is based on the energy savings potential of
the city being evaluated. These savings are estimated by considering three
factors: the city authority control (CA), the relative energy intensity (REI)
and the total amount of the city’s energy spending (in US$ dollars).
   City Authority Control (CA): is the measure of control the city
government exerts over the relevant sector, measured by six factors:
finance; human resources; data and information; policies; regulations and
enforcement; and assets and infrastructure. CA is measured between
0 and 1, where 0 is non control and 1 is total control. City government
representatives agreed to the level of control of each sector, as per the
figure below.

Streetlight Audit and Upgrade

One important TRACE recommendation is to improve the city’s
streetlights, as they consume considerable energy and have significant
potential for savings. The city is exploring options to replace sodium vapor
lights with more efficient LED bulbs. Thus, with an up-front investment of
up to US$1 million, and an implementation period of 6–18 months, the
local government could audit the existing system and upgrade the lights.
This would deliver the same lighting levels but reduce energy consumption
by around 200,000 kWh per year. Upgrading the lights would also reduce
carbon emissions and operating costs. Further, maintenance costs of
                                                                                                               Source: telenor.com.

Procurement Guide for New Streetlights

A second TRACE recommendation is for Puebla to produce new
procurement guidelines for streetlights, which could produce a more
efficient system. The city would set strict rules about what the streetlight
provider or company responsible for maintaining the infrastructure must
provide, which would also reduce costs. City authorities could consider
a manual for street lighting design similar to the one prepared by IESNA
(Illuminating Engineering Society of North America), which specified best
practices for visibility and safety guidelines. The manual should establish     The Midlands region in the United Kingdom provides a good example

effective. Similarly, Puebla does not have a reliable database on the floor
area and does not track the energy/electricity consumed and its costs. If
it were improved, it could help the city monitor energy consumption and
costs in public buildings and better implement EE programs.

Puebla can improve its solid waste sector by identifying opportunities to
reduce energy consumption in the collection, transport, and disposal of
solid waste. Since the city does not have good data for this sector, an audit
could determine the amount of energy used for waste management and
identify opportunities to save energy. An annual environmental report
(AER) would assess all the solid waste infrastructure, for example, trucks,
trash bins, the landfill and leachate plant. The report would monitor energy
consumption per ton of waste collected, transported, and treated.
   The solid waste operators should be required to submit data annually
on the solid waste collected, the fuel used for collection/transportation
activities, and waste management at the landfill. The city could also meet
with informal sector collectors to identify potential recycling activities.
   The report should lay the foundation for a short- to medium-term

education/training campaigns to increase general awareness of energy
conservation and change people’s behavior. The city can do this by
providing easily accessed information related to EE. An initial investment
of up to US$1 million for such campaigns could save from 100,000 to
200,000 kWh in energy a year.
   EE can be promoted through advertising campaigns, public events,
features in the local media, dedicated websites, training programs in
schools and community centers, and through an advocacy program.
Besides changing behavior, the benefits would also translate into lower                                Source: factreports.revues.org.

the new recycling initiative Basura por Seguridad (waste for safety), a joint
initiative between the city and the private sector.
   Public campaigns can also target water and transport. For example, the
city could encourage citizens to bike and walk, and rely less on private cars.

The County of Meath, Ireland is a good example of a successful public
campaign. Local authorities extended an energy awareness week to
all county residents through visits to schools, information displays,
widespread media coverage, a ‘car-free day’, and offers of CFL light bulbs.
The campaign significantly increased interest in EE and also encouraged
residents to use sustainable energy and transport options. It cost under
US$5,000, although this did not include prizes and sponsorships provided
by local companies and other energy-related entities.
   In 2000, the European Commission created the “Car-free Day” as a
Europea-wide initiative to encourage people to abandon their cars for one
day. Many cities mark September 22 as the day when they walk, bike, and
leave their vehicles at home.

                                                     The main costs related to upgrading streetlights are to replace the bulbs, the control system, and
 Self-implementation                                 labor to install the items. These expenses, along with consulting fees, are funded by the city, which
                                                     means it receives all the financial benefits but bears the financial risks.


                                                     The city engages an ESCO to carry out the project, which can involve part- and full-ownership of the

                                                         These free the city from financing pressures, but the financial savings achieved through EE are passed
  Long-term contracts                                    on to the company conducting the upgrade. This strategy can benefit cities that do not have the

                                                         Joint ventures allow a city to maintain a significant degree of control over upgrade projects while

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of the recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define the targets that indicate the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece of
the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   A measure related to this recommendation is
   •	 Lumens/watt – Determine the average effectiveness of illumination provided by current streetlights.

 Performance Contracting for Street Lighting Energy Efficiency.”


 Akola contracted with an ESCO to replace over 11,500 streetlights (standard fluorescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor) with T5 fluorescent lamps. The
 contractor (called AEL) financed 100 percent of the investments, launched the project, maintained the new lights, and received part of the verified energy
 savings to recover its investment. Under the contract, the city paid the ESCO 95 percent of the verified energy bill savings over the 6-year period it was
 in effect. It also paid AEL an annual fee to maintain the lamps and fixtures. Initial investments were about US$120,000 and the upgrade was completed
 in three months. The project saved 56 percent in energy costs a year, which meant total savings of US$133,000—a payback in less than 11 months!

 In 2000, Dobrich audited its entire streetlight system, which resulted in a project the next year to modernize it. Mercury bulbs were replaced with high
 pressure sodium lamps and compact fluorescent lamps (a total of 6,450 EE lamps). The control system was also upgraded, and two electric meters were
 installed. These measures raised the illuminated area of the city to 95 percent and resulted in savings of 2,819,640 kWh a year (€91,400 a year).

 This project, which involved a partnership between the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) and the city of Los Angeles, is the largest streetlight upgrade by a
 city to date, replacing traditional lights with environmentally friendly LEDs. It will reduce CO2 emissions by 40,500 tons and save US$10 million annually
 through reduced maintenance costs and 40 percent reduced energy consumption.
    The mayor and Bureau of Street Lighting collaborated with CCI’s Outdoor Lighting Program to review the latest technology, financing strategies,
 and public-private implementation models for LED upgrades. CCI’s analysis of models and technology, and its financial advice, were key sources for
 developing this comprehensive plan.

    The project’s phased nature allowed the city to evaluate its approach each year which gave it flexibility when selecting contractors and the lights to
 be upgraded. It also capitalized on its status to attract financial institutions that would offer favorable loans and funding mechanisms since they wanted
 to create positive relationships with the city. Thus, the city was able to create a well-developed business case for the project.


 Lighting Retrofit, City of Oslo

 Oslo formed a joint venture with Hafslund ASA, the largest electricity distribution company in Norway. Old fixtures containing PCB and mercury were
 replaced with high performance-high pressure sodium lights, and an advanced data communication system was installed using power-line transmissions
 that reduced the maintenance. They also installed ‘intelligent communication systems’ that dim lights when climate conditions and usage patterns
 permit, which reduced energy use and increased the bulbs’ life, which also reduced maintenance (and related costs).
    The system is fully equipped with all its components and is calibrated to correct some minor problems related to the communication units. Overall,
 the system has performed well under normal operating conditions.

  Under the East Midlands Improvement and Efficiency Partnership (EMIEP), the Midlands Highways Alliance (MHA) will save the region GBP 11 million in
  highway maintenance and improvements by 2011.
     Supported by Constructing Excellence, the nine councils in the region and the highway agency became more efficient and reduced costs by using
  best practice procurement plans for major and medium-sized highways. The professional civil engineering services shared best practice maintenance

 Committed to reducing the growth of GHG emissions, Australia has launched initiatives at all government levels to improve the efficiency of public lights,
 which has involved trials of more efficient bulbs. Further, lights on minor roads are a major source of GHG emissions and many opportunities exist to
 improve their quality and reduce costs/GHG emissions. Thus, stakeholders produced a procurement guide, ‘Lighting the Way’, which provides information
 to help local governments (1) improve the lights on minor roads while reducing their GHG emissions, (2) lower costs, and (3) decrease liability and risks.
 These outcomes can be achieved through EE solutions that provide better streetlight services and comply with Australian standards (AS/NZS 1158).
    The document describes technical and other issues related to EE lights, and guides cities on techniques to improve their negotiations about public
 lighting issues with distribution companies. Several types of lamps offer considerable advantages over the standard 80 watt mercury vapor lamps with
 regard to energy use, lumen depreciation, light output, maintenance, lifespan, aesthetics, and performance in various temperatures.

ANEXO 3: BENCHMARKING DE EDIFICOS MUNICIPALES
 DESCRIPTION                                                                                                         ATTRIBUTES
 This recommendation is to develop a municipal building energy benchmarking program that collects                    Energy-saving Potential
 and reports annually on the energy use and costs, water use and costs, floor areas, and names of                    100,000–200,000 kWh/year
 building managers (if any). The goal is to identify the city’s most energy-intensive buildings so as to             Initial Costs
 develop the best EE opportunities; also, it is to use the EE program resources most effectively and                 <US$100,000
 spend time/money on the areas where EE can be most easily achieved. The program collects annual                     Speed of Implementation
 data to measure the energy/carbon footprint for municipal operations.                                               1–2 years
    This recommendation is best-suited to larger cities with the size/capacity to conduct such a                     Wider Benefits
 program. A starting point is to routinely monitor and analyze building energy consumption and identify              Reduced carbon emissions
 ways to improve EE. However, good benchmarks require detailed analyses because similar buildings                    Efficient water use
 can actually be very different, regarding types of tenants and occupancy density (people per m ).         2

Set data collection strategy        are likely to have access to this information. Define which data should be collected yearly and create a method

Begin collecting data               an RFP and award a contract to gather energy benchmarking data for all municipal buildings, which can then be
                                    stored in spreadsheets or dedicated energy software tools. The quality of the data must be checked to ensure
                                    its level of detail and accuracy.


                                    Once it is determined that the data is accurate, the analyses should begin. These include the following:
                                       •	 Compare kWh/m2/year electricity consumption by building type.

Analyze and interpret data             •	 Compare total US$/m2/year energy consumption by building type.

                                       Starting with buildings with the highest and lowest performance, verify the floor areas where utility meters
                                    are located and note special conditions that may raise or lower energy use (server rooms, unoccupied space,

  Activity                                     Method

                                               The results of the analyses must be used to create a benchmark that considers the factors affecting the city’s
                                               energy use. These factors may vary significantly from city to city and among different buildings. They include:
                                                   •	 Types of tenants
  Create a benchmark                               •	 Occupancy density (persons/m2)

                                                   •	 Building energy management

                                                   This benchmarking is usually done in order to rate and label buildings according to their energy usage. See
                                               the Singapore case study for details.


                                               One of the most important ways to promote EE in building operations is peer pressure since no building
  Publicize benchmarking findings              owners/operators want to be seen as having the worst performing buildings. Thus, sharing data on building
  internally                                   energy intensity with other departments/operators will reduce energy use and encourage them to share their
                                               experiences with others, city-wide.


                                               The boldest action is to present energy performance data to the public, press, voters, and potential political
  Publish benchmarking publically              opponents. This last stage of the program may occur many years after it begins, when the data shows that
                                               progress has been made to achieve efficient government operations. The city can then challenge (or require, as
                                               some cities have begun to do) private building owners to benchmark their properties and publish their findings.



Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. Where the city administration adopts a
recommendation, it should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need
to be complicated or time consuming but should, at least (a) identify information sources; (b) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate
equipment/processes; (c) set protocols for keeping records; (d) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (e) assign responsibilities for
each piece of the process; (f) create a way to audit and review performance; and (g) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are
   •	 kWhe/m2 - Determine annual electrical energy intensity by type of building (schools, offices, residences, or hospitals)

 Under the Kiev Public Buildings Energy Efficiency Project, 1,270 public buildings—including health facilities, schools, and cultural facilities—were upgraded
 with cost-effective EE systems and equipment. The project focused on the supply side, such as automation and control systems, as well as the demand side,
 by installing meters, and weatherization, along with creating appropriate heating rates. The project was conducted by the Kiev City State Administration
 (KCSA). Savings were estimated at 333,423 Gigacalories (Gcal)/year by 2006—normalized by degree/days in the baseline year—or about a 26 percent
 savings compared to the buildings’ heat consumption before the project. These upgrades also improved the buildings’ comfort levels, helped foster an EE
 services industry, and raised public awareness about the issues.
    The project cost US$27.4 million and was financed through a World Bank loan, Swedish Government grant, and KCSA funds. Based on the project’s
 success, many other Ukrainian cities have requested information and shown interest in launching similar programs.

Building Energy Efficiency Master Plan (BEEMP), Singapore


The Inter-Agency Committee on Energy Efficiency (IACEE) report presented key measures to improve the EE of buildings, industries, and transport
sectors. The Building Energy Efficiency Master Plan (BEEMP), created by the Building & Construction Authority (BCA), describes the initiatives taken by
the BCA to adopt the recommendations. The plan contains measures that span the whole life cycle of a building. It begins with a set of EE standards to
ensure buildings are designed right and continues with an energy management program to ensure they are operated efficiently throughout their life-
span. The BEEMP consists of the following programs:
   •	 Review and update energy standards.

   •	 Audit the energy use in selected buildings.

   •	 Create energy efficiency indices (EEI) and performance benchmarks.

   •	 Develop ways to better manage the energy use of public buildings.

   •	 Insist on performance-based contracts.

   •	 Conduct research and development.

The Energy Smart Building Labeling Program, developed by the Energy Sustainability Unit (ESU) of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the
National Environment Agency (NEA), aims to promote EE and conservation by awarding owners of EE buildings with a label that recognizes this fact.
Authorities use the ‘Energy Smart Tool’, an online benchmarking system, to evaluate the energy performance of office buildings and hotels. The program
allows building owners to review their energy consumption patterns and compare them against industry norms. The Energy Smart Building Label is
reviewed every three years and is given at an annual awards ceremony. Besides reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in the buildings
sector, the program does the following:
   •	 Saves energy through enlightened energy management

   •	 Brings greater comfort to building occupants

   •	 Enhances a company’s corporate image

Thirty-five Bulgarian cities created the Municipal Energy Efficiency Network (MEEN). ‘EnEffect’ is the Secretariat of the Network. Since April 2001, MEEN
has enrolled four municipal associations as members. To create a successful municipal energy plan, MEEN created an energy database and training
program for municipal officials. Information is collected and stored in municipal ‘passports’ through surveys of organizations and entered into a database,
or EE information system (EEIS), which includes an analysis. The database, a Microsoft Access application, contains objective, technical information,
and the analysis includes non-technical information, such as financial, institutional, and regulatory documents generated at the national level. This
information is organized into three categories: city-wide consumption, site-specific consumption, and city-wide production.

Lviv reduced its annual energy consumption in its public buildings by about 10 percent and tap water consumption by about 12 percent through a
monitoring and targeting (M&T) program. The program was launched in December 2006 and was operating fully by May 2007. By 2010, it produced
net savings of UAH 9.5 million (US$1.2 million). It provided the city with monthly consumption data for district heating, natural gas, electricity, and
water in all of the city’s 530 public buildings. Utility use is reported and analyzed each month and the targets for monthly consumption are determined
annually, based on historical patterns and negotiated when these are expected to change. Actual consumption is reviewed monthly against the target,
with deviations spotted and acted upon immediately and the buildings’ performance is presented to the public.
   The M&T program was able to reap significant savings with minimal investment and recurring costs. The utility bill reductions were very helpful given
fiscal constraints and rising energy prices. The program was helped by the fact that most of the public buildings already had water and energy meters
and the city had been collaborating with international aid programs in municipal energy since the late 1990s. Also, it was due to a strong, committed
city government. The city created an EMU and provided resources to train all personnel responsible for building utility use. The M&T system established
responsibility, created transparency, and laid the groundwork for sustained improvements in energy and water efficiency.

 The SMEU software was created to set priorities for municipal energy action plans and assess global energy costs and consumption. The software is
 applied to gather energy data so decision-makers can analyze consumers’ energy use and predict the energy budget for the following period.
 The software divides data into individual and interrelated modules. The city collects information on an annual basis, which lists the area being studied,
 population, average temperatures, number of buildings, and number of dwellings in each area.

 Model for Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings, Berlin, Germany
 Source: http://www.c40cities.org/bestpractices/buildings/berlin_efficiency.jsp.


 Berlin, in partnership with the BEA, pioneered an excellent model to improve EE in its buildings. Together they managed the upgrade of public and private
 buildings, preparing tenders for work that is guaranteed to reduce emissions. The tenders require the ESCOs that win the contracts to reduce CO2
 emissions by an average of 26 percent. To date, 1,400 buildings have been upgraded, reducing CO2 emissions by 60,400 tons a year. With the ESCO
 paying for the investments, these upgrades cost the building owners nothing and the energy savings were almost immediate.

 Stuttgart reduces its CO2 emissions each year by about 7,200 tons through an innovative form of internal contracting, making use of a revolving fund
 to finance energy and water-saving measures. The city then reinvests the savings into new activities, creating a cycle of environmental improvements
 and reduced emissions.

 The European Display Campaign is a voluntary scheme designed by energy experts from European towns and cities. When it began in 2003, it aimed
 to encourage local authorities to publicly display the energy and environmental performances of city buildings—adopting the same energy label that is
 used for household appliances. Since 2008, private companies have also been encouraged to use the ‘display’ for their corporate social responsibilities.

 Energy Efficiency Codes in Residential Buildings, Tianjin, China.
 Source: ESMAP (2011). “Good Practices in City Energy Efficiency: Tianjin, China -Enforcement of Residential Building Energy Efficiency Codes.” Available
 online from http://www.esmap.org/esmap/node/1280.


 Tianjin is one of the Chinese cities that has complied with building EE codes (BEECs). In its recent annual national inspections, the Ministry of Housing
 and Urban and Rural Development (MoHURD) found that BEEC compliance in Tianjin’s new residential and commercial buildings was nearly 100 percent,
 compared to the 80 percent average across nearly three dozen other large cities it inspected in 2008. Even more impressive, the residential code for the
 buildings’ thermal integrity (DB29-1-2007) was 30 percent more stringent than the national BEEC (JGJ 26-95).
    In 1997, Tianjin introduced its first mandatory residential EE code (DB29-1-97), which was similar to the 1995 national code developed for Chinese
 cities in cold regions (JGJ 26-95), DB29-1-97 was enforced from 1998 to 2004. Enforcement actually began on January 1, 2005. It was based on an
 earlier version which was updated and passed in June 2007. The case study covered the five years that DB29-1-2007 was enforced—from 2005 to
 2009.
    Tianjin’s efforts to go beyond the national BEEC were a departure from the norm, when cities usually follow central government regulations. Tianjin
 began piloting residential BEECs in the late 1980s, although it took the city about 15 years to achieve a high degree of compliance. The city met and
 surpassed the requirements because of the following: (1) a well-established building construction management system; (2) standard procedures for
 enforcing compliance; (3) broad capacity of the construction sector to comply with the codes, with respect to technical skills and the availability of parts
 and materials; (4) consumers’ ability and willingness to pay for the costs of compliance; and (5) local government resources, support, and commitment
 to enforcing increasingly stringent BEECs.

In 1991, the Austin Energy Green Building (AE/GB) program developed the first city-wide tool to evaluate the sustainability of U.S. buildings; it covers
single and multi-family homes, commercial, and government or utilities’ buildings. The program provides technical support to homeowners, architects,
designers, and builders, helping them design/construct sustainable buildings. Using tools developed to rate green buildings, specifically prepared for
Austin, along with the LEED and Green Globes national rating tools, the program’s staff help the design teams create goals, review plans and specifications,
recommend improvements, and rate the final products regarding effects on the environment and community.
   AE/GB has saved US$2.2 million a year by reducing consumers’ energy costs. The initial program investment of US$1.2 million came from an annual
budget (including a US$50,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy). The AE/GB also reduced energy consumption by 142,427 MWh and reduced
demand on the utility’s generation resources by 82.8 MW. These savings have reduced the power plant’s CO2 emissions by 90,831 tons, NOx by 87.6
tons, and SOx by 17.4 tons.


Sustainable Building Action Plan, Seattle, U.S.A.
Source: http://www.c40cities.org/docs/casestudies/buildings/seattle_green.pdf


Under the Sustainable Building Policy, Seattle requires all new city buildings over 5,000 sq ft to meet new state LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) ratings, which measure the buildings’ sustainability. The city provided incentives to private developers if they meet the standards:
For example, Seattle introduced (1) the Sustainable Building Action Plan which contained strategies to promote green buildings; (2) a density ‘bonus’
that offered downtown commercial, residential, and mixed use developments greater height and/or floor space if a green building standard of LEED silver
or higher was met; and (3) the City LEED Incentive Program which provided financial help for energy conservation, natural drainage/water conservation,
and design and consulting fees for LEED projects.
   From 2001 to 2005, the city’s incentives were over US$4.3 million for projects complying with LEED standards, which reduced energy by an average
of 35 percent and 6.9 million KWh/year for LEED municipal buildings. Other benefits included an average reduction of 1,067 CO2e tons per LEED building
and an annual average financial saving of US$43,000.

 Guidelines.pdf.


 Cape Town plans to enact a law by 2012 calling for environmentally friendly building methods. The Draft Green Buildings Guidelines form the core of
 the law, which promotes resource-efficient construction on new or renovated buildings to minimize the negative environmental impacts on the built
 environment, and maximize positive social and economic impacts. In the long term, Cape Town will produce design manuals and other laws to ensure
 that green buildings have a permanent place in the urban landscape.
    The Green Building Guidelines are consistent with the Green Building Council of South Africa, which incorporated the Green Star Rating System of
 Australia’s Green Building Council. It is expected that Cape Town will incorporate the Green Star Rating System in the future.
    Cape Town’s guidelines for green buildings are city-specific, including advice on site selection, design and construction phases, sustainable resource
 management, waste management, urban landscaping, human health and safety, and visual mitigation measures.

Monitoring
See rationale for monitoring, above.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are as follows:
   •	 Determine the energy use per ton of waste to be collected, transported, and disposed of (MWh).

   •	 Determine the energy used by a city to transport waste, by per ton of waste (MWh/t).

   •	 Determine total annual mileage to transport waste (km).

   •	 Determiner the kilometers travelled per ton of waste (km/t).

   Assess the number and location of municipal waste transfer stations and map these against waste catchment areas. These can be based on the length
of the daily collection route, districts, or capability of the waste collection fleet.
   Track city development and create maps of existing and potential waste transfer stations against expanding municipality catchment areas.
   Ensure that distances from collection points to treatment facilities do not exceed the miles recommended by vehicle manufacturers.
   Compare fuel use per volume or mass of waste transferred before and after the waste stations are built and operating.

 Solid Waste Management Plan, New York City
 Source: http://www.plannyc.org/taxonomy/term/762.


 New York’s mayor launched an SWMP in 2006 as a way to dramatically reduce the energy used for waste disposal, along with a cost-effective and
 environmentally sound system for managing the city’s waste. The plan involved assessing existing transfer stations to maximize waste management
 efficiency and create a more equitable distribution of waste storage, transfer, and disposal throughout the five boroughs.
    By exporting 90 percent of the city’s residential waste by barge or rail (rather than by truck), the program will reduce waste truck miles by 2.7 million
 a year and tractor-trailer miles by 3 million. This means using transfer stations in every borough, reopening eight transfer stations that were closed, and
 building seven new marine transfer stations. The latter, which should be completed in 2013, are expected to reduce waste truck travel by 3.5 million
 miles. However, some claim the marine transfer stations will increase the cost of waste disposal from US$77 per ton to US$107.
    The city has had problems building the new transfer stations, which have been delayed by lawsuits and community organizations concerned about
 increased truck traffic, air and noise pollution, and water dredging that may harm nearby wildlife. Thus, only two of the seven marine transfer stations
 were being constructed by May 2010 and none of the barges were being used. In March 2009, the mayor signed a 30-year contract with a private waste
 management company to oversee a program for moving waste from Brooklyn’s transfer stations to out-of-state landfills by train.


 Municipal Solid Waste Guidelines, Victoria, Canada

 The regional authority (Ministry of Environment) funded a project to prepare guidelines for creating transfer stations for municipal solid waste. It
 hired an engineering consultant in Victoria to produce the report on transfer station methodologies, using examples to recommend siting, design, and
 operating guidelines. These include cost models that compare direct hauls in collection trucks with transfer hauls to a landfill, and rural landfills with
 rural transfer stations. Such models can be used to decide if a transfer station is justified under particular conditions, as they detail operating and capital
 costs based on case studies. The report covers issues that can arise and examples of transfer station operating/capital costs that apply to cities during
 the implementation of their SWMPs.

 The Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 is the city’s strategic spatial development plan which includes guidelines on improving the quality of its
 infrastructure and utility services. Solid waste collection/disposal services are integrated in the plan, which describes the coordination of existing landfill
 sites and capacities, supported by new transfer stations. The plan noted the limited capacity of the Taman Beringin landfill, which led to the transfer of
 waste to a private landfill outside the city in Air Hitam. A new transfer station at Taman Beringin is to be built to sort the waste that can be recycled and
 compact the remaining waste before it is transported to Air Hitam. The plan also includes maps of the existing solid waste disposal sites and as well as
 transfer stations that are to be built.


 Veolia Environmental Services Waste Transfer, Birmingham, UK
 Source: http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/Birmingham/.


 Veolia Environmental Services, a private waste management company, operates two major waste transfer stations in the north and south of Birmingham.
 These play a key role in managing the city’s waste and are focal points for recycling. The transfer stations accept curbside collected waste from
 Birmingham City Council refuse vehicles that is then consolidated into bulk loads and transported either to the recycling re-processor, the Energy
 Recovery Facility (ERF) at Tyseley, or to a landfill.
    A standard-size trash truck holds about eight tons of waste, while bulk vehicles hold up to 25 tons. This means that, with the transfer stations, vehicle
 trips are reduced by a third; also, that trash collection vehicles do not have to travel across the city to deposit their loads but rather go to the nearest
 transfer station. A considerable part of the trash at the ERF is moved at night to reduce traffic and improve the operation’s efficiency. Further, the transfer
 stations act as bulk stations for the recyclable materials collected either from the curbside pick-up or from the household recycling centers. This reduces
 vehicle movements, eases traffic, and lowers the environmental impact of transporting the recyclable materials.

                                           The city should assess energy use for all waste infrastructure by monitoring how much fuel and energy
                                        are used per ton (or m3) of waste collected, transported, and treated. To accomplish this, it should require

   •	 Monitor fuel and energy use per ton or m3 of waste treated in the city, including energy used to collect, transport, and treat/monitor (separately, where possible).

   •	 Require all plants to submit data on energy use in an AER (this is also an opportunity to determine waste tonnage data). Assess changes in energy use each year.

   •	 Create a city waste management strategy (or assess and improve the current strategy), detailing the allocation of city-wide waste infrastructure.

   •	 Reduce the energy used to pre-treat waste.

   •	 Create a 5-year schedule to review the waste management strategy.

   •	 Assess any involvement of third party waste operators collecting commercial or community waste in the municipality. Seek coordinated activities for mutual gains, for

     example, increasing the volumes of waste to maximize EE in plants.

 The Metropolitan Waste Management Group (MWMG), a state statutory body, produced the metropolitan infrastructure schedule as part of the wider
 Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Strategic Plan. Its aim was to examine and assess Melbourne’s waste infrastructure in order to identify
 improvements that will allow MWMG to recover more waste in the future.
    In creating the schedule, MWMG conducted studies of infrastructure needs, existing infrastructure, future recovery opportunities, and issues related
 to upgrades or new infrastructure. Models were created to assess environmental, social, and economic impacts. Also, a private engineering consultant
 was hired to analyze the options and identify opportunities to recover materials sent to the landfill, including municipal waste clustering opportunities.
 The studies analyzed economic costs/benefits, life-cycle assessments (GHG emissions, energy and water consumption, air emissions, and waste to
 landfill) and assessed transport options and impacts.
    It was found that existing composting facilities, transfer stations, and Material Recovery Facilities were the main areas that could be improved. For
 example, the options with the best results for ‘energy from fossil fuel use’ were two types of three-bin systems, one which included separate bins for
 recyclables, garden waste and food (for anaerobic digestion), and remaining items (for landfill) or a system with separate bins for recyclables, garden
 waste (for aerobic composting) and residuals (containing food, for thermal treatment). These options will be financed from household collection fees,
 from US$137 to –US$158 per household each year.
    The schedule (and the broad strategic plan) was supported by US$9 million in state funds. Also, a landfill levy of up to US$13.50 a ton helps fund the
 waste infrastructure, innovation, development, and other improvements in efficiencies for the city’s waste management system.

waste in the city, and focusing on new low-carbon technologies in waste management (for example, moving away from bulking and transfer facilities to
resource recovery parks). The Greater London Authority (GLA) is developing a London-wide scheme in partnership with waste authorities to collect data
on current, planned, and potential waste sites at the local and regional level to help the London Waste and Recycling Board determine the type, number,
and location of the facilities needed over a particular period. Financial assistance from the board (US$114 million) was provided to develop new facilities
for collecting, treating, and disposing of waste, supported by external funds from partners (joint ventures, private investors, and EU matching funds).
The mayor also works with waste authorities to promote more sustainable ways to transport waste, by maximizing the potential use of rail and water
transport.
   The GLA combines its efforts with national organizations, local authorities, and private waste operators to achieve results. For example,
   •	 GLA works with the national Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Environmental Agency, and London councils on the annual collection

     and dissemination of London waste statistics. WasteDataFlow is a web-based reporting system used by all UK local authorities, which provides information that can

     be used nationally, regionally and by boroughs to inform best practices and strategy.

   •	 Cory Environmental (CE) has a 30-year waste management contract from four London boroughs to handle household and business waste. To support and safeguard

     its waste operations, CE is building the Riverside Resource Recovery Facility (RRR), claimed to be one of the UK’s most efficient energy-from-waste plants with an

     annual throughput of 670,000 tons. The new operation will help remove more than 100,000 heavy vehicle trips from the roads each year. The project is financed by

     a term facility of up to US$728 million from private banks, with US$124 million of equity finance provided by CE.

   •	 The East London Waste Authority (EWLA) uses a private company to transport its solid household waste. The contract is through a private finance initiative (PFI)

     for integrated waste management agreement, which provides US$204 million to construct the waste-by-rail transfer service from an upgraded railhead as well as

     innovative technologies to improve ELWA’s waste treatment facilities.

Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), which is responsible for the city’s solid waste management, encouraged private and non-profit groups to organize
community waste management programs that are consistent with the strategies in the city-wide SWMP. The Dhanmondi Solid Waste Management
pilot was the first DCC-approved project. It was carried out by SCPL, a local private consulting firm, with help from DCC. The main goals were to upgrade
waste infrastructure (household and municipal garbage containers) and to provide door-to-door garbage collection services. After an initial assessment,
SCPL supplied two waste bins (one red and one blue) to every household for separating trash into inorganic and organic waste. The collected waste
was disposed of at central dumping sites in each block, where the containers were monitored by SCPL workers. DCC then transferred the waste to the
central dumping sites. SCPL collects a monthly charge from each household, which covers the program and workers’ salaries. The project has significantly
reduced air, water and soil pollution in the area and the separation of wastes has made it easier for the city to sell inorganic materials to recycling
companies. This has reduced the volume of waste, since DCC trucks only carry organic materials to secondary dumping sites. The project has also helped
generate positive behavioral changes in the community.

Italy’s waste services are delivered through public bodies known as ‘ATOs’ that are normally funded by local authorities and are responsible for determining
the services needed. New waste infrastructure is often funded from local resources, although private finance is also obtained for some large facilities
through a form of ‘prudential’ borrowing. Some waste facilities or services are procured through a bidding process (involving private waste management
companies), with contracts either made directly with a local authority or the ATO. The latter can also fund part or all of waste infrastructure projects
through eco-taxes. For example, the CONAI packaging management scheme, which sets an eco-tax on all packaging used for the sale of goods on the
Italian market, generates annual revenue of $324 million, part of which is used to finance new waste infrastructure.

  Activity                                        Method

                                                  The city recruits local EE advocates and trains them to promote the issues. They can be drawn from those who
                                                  are interested in spreading the message about EE, such as local authorities, businesses, community groups,
                                                  NGOs, health trusts, school children, and others. This can be accomplished in several ways.
  Recruit EE advocates                                •	 Advocates can be asked to train the trainers and provide them with support to run sessions in their communities.

                                                        They teach simple ways to save energy and provide leaflets to distribute locally. The trainers inform the communities

                                                        that they are the local contacts for EE information.

                                                      Since the advocates are often volunteers, an official should be appointed to provide support and
                                                  encouragement, conduct regular follow-ups and monitor progress of each EE advocacy program.



Monitoring
See the rationale for monitoring, above.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are as follows:
   •	 Determine the number of people participating in training programs annually.

   •	 Determine the number of hits to city’s EE website monthly (if developed) or number of requests for EE measures.

   •	 Determine the number of articles in the press about the city’s EE.

   •	 Determine the number of EE advocates who are trained (if this is done)

   •	 Raising staff awareness of energy issues through presentations to senior city managers, building and school managers, and various council general staff: 226 staff

     were trained in this round using presentations developed by the Carbon Trust and adapted, with some environmental advocates, to reflect Walsall Council’s needs.

   The aim of the CMEE program is to identify and achieve significant carbon savings throughout the council and thus, financial savings. By reducing its
energy use, the council will also reduce the number of carbon credits it must buy under the Carbon Reduction Commitment, which was introduced in
2010.

 In 2004, the Meath Energy Management Agency’s (MEMA) extended its Energy Awareness Week to everyone who lived or worked in the county of
 Meath, Ireland, using media campaigns to raise consumers’ understanding energy issues. This included visits to schools, information displays, widespread
 media coverage, competitions, a ‘Car-free Day’ and an offer of free CFL light bulbs, which encouraged participation at all levels. The campaign dramatically
 increased requests for information from the energy agency. The competitions and promotions also improved local knowledge of EE and encouraged
 people to choose sustainable energy and transport options.
    Energy Awareness Week activities were coordinated and carried out by MEMA with support from the Environment Department of Meath County
 Council. The campaign cost US$4,470, which covered printing and copying promotional materials, prizes, and providing bright jackets for walking bus
 participants. Local companies and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) contributed sponsors and prizes.

   Due to the mild climate, buildings do not need to be heated or cooled.

Recommendations are based on six factors: finance, human resources, data
and information, policies, regulations and enforcement, and assets and
infrastructure. This step helps cities better assess the measures they have
the capacity to introduce effectively. TRACE then plots recommendations
based on two features of a 3x3 matrix (energy-saving potential and
initial costs) along with another feature that helps the user compare
recommendations based on the speed of implementation.
   Recommendations in each area are quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluated based on data, including institutional requirements, energy-
saving potential, and wider benefits. The recommendations are supported
by implementation options, case studies, and references to tools and best
practices.

TRACE Limitations

Because TRACE is relatively simple and easy to implement, its analyses are
somewhat limited. For example, it may identify streetlights as a priority
in terms of potential energy savings, but it does not detail the costs to
carry out rehabilitation projects. Thus, even if the energy-saving potential
is considered high, the costs may be even higher and investments may not
be viable. Also, although TRACE focuses on the service areas for which
the city is responsible, the tool cannot factor in the institutional/legislative
mechanisms that may be needed to launch specific EE actions.
   While TRACE seems to apply well in Eastern European cities and
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), where
most public utilities are under the city governments (which gives them
substantial control over the TRACE areas), elsewhere, as in Latin America,
cities have less control over public utilities, either because they are
managed at a state or federal level or because the service is provided by a
contractor. For example, in 2013, TRACE was applied in Romania’s seven
largest cities where important services, such as public transport, district
heating, streetlights, and municipal buildings, were under local control. In
some, even where operation and maintenance (O&M) is outsourced to a
contractor (as with streetlights), the city owns the infrastructure and can
make the final decisions. Thus, in Romania, the TRACE studies helped local
and national authorities prepare local EE measures that were supported
with funds from the European Union, whose Europe 2020 Strategy aimed
to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 percent over the next
few years.

Besides the BRT, the TransMilenio runs ‘feeder’ buses that connect residential
areas to BRT bus stops. There are about 500 feeders on 90 routes connected
to BRTs. Overall, the TransMilenio network covers 663 km.

   During the 2000s, people were very satisfied with the BRT service.
However, in recent years, the quality of service has declined. As traffic
increases, especially in the evening, people must spend long hours on the
bus to get home. Even though there are dedicated bus lanes, bottlenecks
develop at intersections where lanes cross. Traffic has decreased the
average travel speed from 27 km/hour to 19.3 km/hour for public
transport and from 31 km/hour to 23 km/hour for private cars. The
average travel time also increased, from 51 minutes per trip in 2002 to 65
minutes in 2011. However, BRT buses operate with an average speed of 26
km/hour, which is higher than other buses.
   Local studies reveal that public transport is used more by low-income
groups, while taxis and private cars are used more by high-income ones.                              Source: TransMilenio website.

   The number of daily bicycle trips increased 37 percent from 2005 to

income groups, biking has become more popular among middle- and
upper-income groups for short trips. With more people turning to biking,
local estimates are that CO2 emissions dropped by about 3,800 tons from
2000 to 2007.

While some proposals were welcomed by city residents (such as the car-
free days), others were less popular—such as the one to restrict access to
the city center for cars with only one passenger. National authorities are
discussing the possibility of introducing congestion pricing in cities with
over 400,000 people.
   Although local statistics indicate that Bogotá’s air quality has improved
slightly over the past decade, pollution remains a concern. Recently, the
city approved a plan requiring cars to undergo periodic inspection and
maintenance to control emissions. The plan also requires SITP buses to
be equipped with catalytic converters. In addition, the city is seeking
to adopt other measures to further reduce pollution. (1) freight, self-

City streetlights are operated by the electricity provider, Codensa, which
is supervised by the local government through the city’s Special Unit for
Public Services (Unidad Administrativa Especial de Servicios Públicos,
UAESP). The street lighting infrastructure belongs to Codensa.15 The city
pays Codensa for electricity, O&M costs, and the use of light poles. The
electricity provider outsources the maintenance to two contractors. The
UAESP audits the streetlight service through an independent company to
ensure that it meets standards. Inspections conducted at night identify
lamps that are not working or do not work properly. The flaws are
discounted from the electricity bill.
   There are approximately 330,000 lamps in Bogotá. In the 2000s, the
city replaced energy-intensive mercury bulbs with more energy efficient,
modern sodium vapor lamps. Today, 99 percent of the lamps are the                                         Source: www.comteq-ltda.com.

reduce energy consumption. For example, under a pilot, the light poles at
the National University of Colombia were equipped with devices to monitor
the lamps by a remote-controlled system. Also, the city upgraded the poles
on the main roads to include meters and improve efficiency. Further, a new
system was installed in the Plaza de Bolivar historical center.
   Codensa carried out a 400 million pesos (US$200,000) upgrade of
streetlights with 33 LEDs near the company’s headquarters on Carrera 13.
The pilot involved replacing the entire infrastructure, including new poles,
LEDs, and underground cables. In the immediate future, the company
will install 100 more LEDs at the National Museum. In 2014, Bogotá will
conduct an ambitious project to replace about 33,000 sodium vapor
bulbs with LEDs, which is estimated at US$32.8 million. The first batch
of 11,000 lamps should be replaced by 2015 and will cost about US$9.5
million. The first LEDs will be installed on the pedestrian walkways in the
historical center (La Candelaria); this will reduce electricity consumption in
the replaced units by 30 percent and improve the quality of public lighting.     Codensa will organize a tender to buy the LED bulbs based on pre-agreed

The expansion of the Salitre wastewater treatment plant should be
completed in 2018, at a cost of US$390 million. After this, the treatment
capacity would rise from 4 m3/s to 8 m3/s. The treatment will also be
upgraded, from primary to secondary levels with activated sludge, which
will require more energy. Further, construction of a new treatment facility,
Canoas PTAR, is expected to begin in 2015. When the projects are
complete, the wastewater treated should increase from 25–30 percent
to 100 percent and the quality should improve. Salitre will treat about
one-third of the raw wastewater, and the new Canoas facility based on
activated sludge, will treat the remaining two-thirds.

Because the city was unable to provide fuel consumption data for its solid
waste collection and management, the TRACE analysis is based on limited
information about waste generation and recycling. Thus, the potential
energy savings are based on estimates from similar cities in the region and
globally.
   The solid waste sector is run by both private and public operators and
overseen by the city through UAESP (Bogotá), a special unit in charge of
public services. More than 53 percent of the solid waste is collected by
Agua, a public company, while 47 percent is handled by private operators.
The city owns the landfill which is operated by a private contractor.           Nearly 100 percent of Bogotá’s solid waste is collected, with 96 percent

about 90,000 pesos (US$47) per ton. Most recycled items are aluminum,
paper, and cardboard, some of which is sold abroad. According to the
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Colombian
Department of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), Colombia’s exports of recycled
waste increased 35 percent from 2000 to 2011.
   The amount of industrial waste has declined recently because
some factories moved out of the city. A few collection companies deal
exclusively with hazardous and construction waste; some of the latter
and demolition waste are dumped at mining facilities. Recently, the city
launched the Basura Cero program, with an ambitious target of reducing
the amount of landfilled solid waste by 2025.19 The program encourages
people and private entities to increase collection and recycling activities.       The Doña Juana landfill, located in Usme, around 20 km south of Bogotá,

   Those with high incomes subsidize the waste collection for poor
communities.    For   example,   in   2012,   residents   in   upper-income
neighborhoods paid up to 32,484 pesos (US$18) a month while low-

the solid waste fees, which cover solid waste collection and management
costs.

   Although the city could not provide data on fuel consumption for
solid waste collection/management, the TRACE team identified potential
savings. For example, Bogotá could save substantial amounts of money
by insisting that the companies hauling solid waste use alternative routes
that would lower fuel use per ton of waste collected and transported.
   The city plans to review the current solid waste collection system and is
considering three options: (1) keep the status quo (with public and private
operators); (2) organize the collection system under a public company; or
(3) open the process to competition between private and public entities.
Also, the city wants to formalize the collection of waste to be recycled
(with ‘informal’ scavengers) and is evaluating options for making the
separation of types of waste mandatory for households. It is also thinking
of developing a pilot to establish a composting facility together with the
farmers’ market.

SUMMARY OF SECTOR PRIORITIZATION                                                                Bogota’s Agreed City Authority Control

TRACE sector prioritization is based on the energy savings potential of
the city being evaluated. These savings are estimated by considering three
factors: the city authority control (CA), the relative energy intensity (REI)
and the total amount of the city’s energy spending (in US$ dollars).
   City Authority Control (CA): is the measure of control the city
government exerts over the relevant sector, measured by six factors:
finance; human resources; data and information; policies; regulations and
enforcement; and assets and infrastructure. CA is measured between
0 and 1, where 0 is non control and 1 is total control. City government
representatives agreed to the level of control of each sector, as per the
figure below.




                                                                                Relative Energy Intensity (REI): is the percentage by which energy use

The recommendations reflect ways to improve a city’s energy performance
and reduce related costs. However, the decision to act on a recommendation
should only be made after a feasibility study is conducted. Also, EE
measures should be seen as having benefits that cut across sectors. For
example, measures to improve the EE of a municipal building could be done
with other upgrades that would improve structural integrity or make the
buildings more resilient to disasters.

savings of the retrofit program.
   Meters are important to improve the efficiency of public lights.
However, measuring their energy use can be challenging because in some
areas, residential buildings and streetlights share the same electricity
distribution cables. Thus, the billing for streetlights from Codensa to the
city may not be based on real consumption but rather on 12-hour daily
average consumption estimates per light pole. The city could benefit from
metering streetlight consumption, although this issue needs to be further

Another TRACE recommendation is designed to help people become more
aware of the benefits of EE. To this end, the city could use public education
and training campaigns to increase awareness and understanding of
energy conservation and ultimately influence behavior.
   Awareness campaigns could target public utility services, such as water
and solid waste, using techniques of the sort related to TransMilenio. The
city could promote advertising campaigns, public events, and features
in the local media; dedicated websites; training programs in schools and
community centers; and even an EE advocacy program. Besides changing
residents’ behavior, the indirect benefits would mean less pressure on
energy infrastructure, reduced GHG emissions, better air quality, and
financial savings.
   Regarding training, the city could partner with an education provider                                     Source: miamidade.gov.

to develop a program in schools and offices. Although the city’s per
capita water consumption is fairly good (less than 100 L per capita a            Public education campaigns could publicize the benefits related to less
day), there is room for improvement. The program would mainly target             energy consumption. The city could join with an advertising or marketing
large energy users, such as public and private offices, industrial facilities,   firm to develop a strategy for providing information on EE. The campaigns

URBAN TRANSPORT

Because public transport is the largest energy consumer in the city, there
would appear to be opportunities to save energy. Based on the TRACE
analysis, the sector could reduce consumption by 20 percent, mainly
through a shift from private vehicles to public transport and NMT. The
city has been improving the system’s efficiency through the SITP initiative,
expanding TransMilenio, developing the first metro line, and expanding
NMT networks. Additional efforts to reduce congestion could take the
form of road pricing, where vehicles are charged to operate on city streets
during peak hours, as has been done successfully in Singapore. At the
same time, the city can continue to improve the quality of public transport,
especially for the popular, well-used BRT system. To this end, Bogotá is
expanding the BRT with 35 km of new routes and is also pursuing, with
private investors, a light rail system that would connect the northern,
western, and southern neighborhoods.
   Another important area to improve is NMT, which involves expanding
pedestrian walkways and the nearly 400 km of bike lanes. The city
aims to connect the lanes with the public transport systems, to serve
as alternative feeders to the TransMilenio and SITP systems. This move
might be furthered if the city created bike parking areas near bus and
other transit stops to facilitate transfer between the modes. Also, the city
has experimented with bike-share programs, which have been popular in
other cities, and would be another incentive for bicycle use.
   To promote the BRT, the city could provide reduced fares for riders who
undertake part of their journeys by bike or on foot.

 Description                                                                                                 ATTRIBUTES
 Incandescent bulbs used in streetlights are highly inefficient. They produce little light and much heat     Energy-saving Potential
 from their significant power consumption. Also, they are often poorly designed and unnecessarily            >200,000 kWh/year
 disperse light in all directions, including the sky. New bulb technologies can substantially increase       First Cost
 their efficiency as well as extend their life. This recommendation aims to both assess current lighting     US$100,000–US$1,000,000
 efficiency and upgrade where needed.                                                                        Speed of Implementation
    The upgrades deliver the same lighting levels using less energy and reduce carbon emissions and          1–2 years
 operating costs. The increased life reduces maintenance and costs and interruptions to service, thus        Co-Benefits

                                           The main costs related to upgrading streetlights are to replace the bulbs, the control system, and labor to
 Self-implementation                       install the items. These expenses, along with consulting fees, are funded by the city, which means it receives all
                                           the financial benefits but bears the financial risks.


                                           The city engages an ESCO to carry out the project, which can involve part and full ownership of the system and

 upgrades                                  over the project’s life. Using local ESCOs helps streamline the process and makes the upgrade more feasible.
                                           Similarly, having a local, credible, and independent measurement and verification agency minimizes contractual
                                           disputes by verifying performance. See the Akola Street lighting Case Study for details.

  Activity                                      Method

                                                Such contracts give the city flexibility to set performance standards and review contractors’ work as part of
  Supply and install contracts                  a phased project. This approach requires up-front spending and an appropriate financing plan. See the Los
                                                Angeles Case Study for details.


                                                These free the city from financing pressures but the financial savings achieved through EE are obtained by the
  Long-term contracts                           company conducting the upgrade. This strategy can benefit cities that do not have the financial resources to
                                                cover the up-front costs and bring in an informed stakeholder to carry out the process.


                                                Joint ventures allow a city to maintain a significant degree of control over upgrade projects while sharing the
  Joint ventures                                risks with a partner experienced in dealing with streetlight issues. Such ventures are effective where both
                                                parties can benefit from improved EE and do not have competing interests. See the Oslo Case Study for details.



Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of the recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define the targets that indicate the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, and monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece
of the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 US$/km - Determine annual energy costs on a per km basis.

   •	 Lumens/watt - Determine the average effectiveness of illumination provided by current streetlights.

 Performance Contracting for Street lighting Energy Efficiency.”


 Akola contracted with an ESCO to replace over 11,500 streetlights (standard fluorescent, mercury vapor, and sodium vapor) with T5 fluorescent lamps.
 The contractor, AEL, financed 100 percent of the investments, launched the project, maintained the new lights, and received part of the verified energy
 savings to recover its investment. Under the contract, the city paid AEL 95 percent of the verified energy bill savings over the six-year period it was in
 effect. It also paid AEL an annual fee to maintain the lamps and fixtures. Initial investments were about US$120,000 and the upgrade was completed
 in three months. The project saved 56 percent in energy costs a year, which meant a total savings of US$133,000—a payback in less than 11 months!

 In 2000, Dobrich audited its entire streetlight system, which resulted in a project the next year to modernize it. Mercury bulbs were replaced with high
 pressure sodium (HPS) lamps and compact fluorescent lamps (a total of 6,450 EE lamps). The control system was also upgraded, and two electric
 meters were installed. These measures delivered an illumination level of 95 percent and saved 2,819,640 kWh a year (€91,400 a year).

 This project, which involved a partnership between the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) and the city of Los Angeles, is the largest streetlight upgrade by a
 city to date, replacing traditional lights with environmentally friendly LEDs. It will reduce CO2 emissions by 40,500 tons and save US$10 million annually,
 through reduced maintenance costs and 40 percent reduced energy consumption.
    The mayor and Bureau of Street Lighting collaborated with the CCI’s Outdoor Lighting Program to review the latest technology, financing strategies,
 and public-private implementation models for LED upgrades. CCI’s analysis of models and technology, and its financial advice, were key sources for
 developing this comprehensive plan.

    The project’s phased nature allowed the city to evaluate its approach each year which gave it flexibility when selecting contractors and the lights to
 be upgraded. It also capitalized on its status to attract financial institutions that would offer favorable loans and funding mechanisms since they wanted
 to create positive relationships with the city. Thus, the city was able to create a well-developed business case for the project.


 Lighting Retrofit, Oslo, Norway

 Oslo formed a joint venture with Hafslund ASA, the largest electricity distribution company in Norway. Old fixtures containing PCB and mercury were
 replaced with high-performance HPS lights and an advanced data communication system was installed using power-line transmissions that reduced the
 maintenance. They also installed ‘intelligent communication systems’ that dim lights when climate conditions and usage patterns permit. This reduced
 energy use and increased the bulbs’ life, which also reduced maintenance (and related costs).
    The system is fully equipped with all its components and is calibrated to correct some minor problems related to the communication units. Overall,
 the system has performed well under normal operating conditions.

Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. Where the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, and monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece
of the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 US$/km - Benchmark the annual energy cost on a per km basis.

   •	 Lumens/watt - Average effectiveness of illumination for currently operating streetlights.

  Under the East Midlands Improvement and Efficiency Partnership (EMIEP), the Midlands Highways Alliance (MHA) will save the region, on average, GBP
  4 million per year in highway maintenance and improvements. Supported by Constructing Excellence’s consultancy arm, the Collaborative Working
  Centre (CWC), the nine councils in the region, and the highway `agency became more efficient and reduced costs by using best practice procurement
  plans for major and medium-sized highways. The professional civil engineering services shared best practice maintenance contracts and jointly procured
  new technologies, such as for streetlights and signs, which lowered unit costs. The plans list the minimum and desired specifications for streetlight
  technologies in order to reduce a specific level of carbon emissions and costs.

 Australia is committed to reducing the growth of GHG emissions and initiatives are underway at all government levels to improve the efficiency of public
 lights; these have involved trials of more efficient bulbs. Further, illuminating minor roads is a major source of GHG emissions for local governments, and
 many opportunities exist to improve both the quality of the lights and reduce costs and GHG emissions. Thus, stakeholders produced a procurement
 guide, ‘Lighting the Way’, which provides information that helps local governments to (1) improve the lights on minor roads while reducing their GHG
 emissions, (2) lower costs, and (3) decrease liability and risks. These outcomes can be achieved through EE solutions that provide better streetlight
 service and comply with Australian standards (AS/NZS 1158).
    The document describes technical and other issues related to EE lights and guides cities on techniques to improve their negotiations about public
 lighting issues with distribution companies. Several types of lamps offer considerable advantages over the standard 80 watt mercury vapor lamps with
 regard to energy use, lumen depreciation, light output, maintenance, lifespan, aesthetics, and performance in various temperatures.

 Description                                                                                                 ATTRIBUTES
 Public lights usually only perform ‘on’ and ‘off’ functions and switch between these two settings in the    Energy-saving Potential
 early evening and early morning. However, demand for light varies, with periods where little light is       >200,000 kWh/year
 needed, such as in the middle of the night. A program with timers or dimmers tailored to meet specific      First Cost
 needs in different areas can significantly reduce energy consumption and yet deliver appropriate levels     <US$100,000
 of light that provide safety and security. These devices, called ‘intelligent monitoring systems’, can      Speed of Implementation
 be used to adapt the levels of light according to weather and activity levels. The recommendation           <1 year
 involves identifying public space use patterns and adjusting the lighting levels accordingly. Often, the    Co-Benefits
 timing programs are part of a full audit and upgrade program, but for cities that already have energy-      Reduced carbon emissions
 efficient public lights, a timing program may be a small but effective measure.                             Enhanced public health & safety
    Timing programs can reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operating costs. They               Increased employment opportunities

   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Define the hours each year that streetlights are illuminated at maximum output.

   •	 Define the hours each year that streetlights are illuminated at less than 50 percent of maximum output.

  Instead of turning streetlights off at certain times of the day, as is done in other cities, Kirklees chose to dim lights to varying levels. It adopted this course
  (not turning the lights off completely) so as to prevent crime. Dimming equipment that used wireless technology was installed on each light pole. This
  required only adding a small antenna to the lamp heads, which was plugged into the electronic ballast with no need for more wiring. Generally the lights
  are switched on 100 percent at 7 p.m., dimmed to 75 percent at 10 p.m., and to 50 percent at midnight. At 5 a.m., they are increased again to 100

percent. By dimming the lights gradually, people can adjust to lower lighting levels, and the dimming is barely noticed. The remote monitoring system
also provides accurate information and allows streetlight engineers to identify failed lamps quickly. This reduces the need for engineers to carry out night
inspections and also other on-site maintenance costs. The dimming can save up to 30 percent of the electricity used annually. By replacing 1,200 lights,
Kirklees estimates savings of about US$3 million in energy costs a year.


Intelligent outdoor city lighting system, Oslo, Norway

An ‘intelligent’ outdoor lighting system replaced fixtures containing PCB and mercury with high-performance HPS lights. These are monitored and
controlled by an advanced data communication system which operates over the existing 230 V power lines using special technology. An operations
center remotely monitors and logs the streetlights’ energy use and running time. It collects information from traffic and weather sensors and uses an
internal astronomical clock to calculate the availability of natural light from the sun and moon. This data is then used to automatically dim some or all
the lights. Controlling light levels this way not only saved a significant amount of energy (estimated at 62 percent) but extended lamp life, thus reducing
replacement costs. The city used the monitoring system to identify lamp failures, often fixing them before being notified by residents. By predicting
the lights’ failure based on a comparison of actual running hours against expected lamp life, repair crews have become more efficient. The city paid
about US$12 million to replace 10,000 lights and saves about US$450,000 in operating costs a year. However, it is estimated that if the program was
expanded through the entire city, the greater economies of scale would yield a payback in less than five years.

This project upgraded the lights on the highways leading to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which cover 66 km. The main requirement was
that each lamp should be dimmed independently from the others. This called for a network linking all 3,300 posts to a central control facility. Further,
maintenance needed to be more efficient and visibility needed to be set at levels that did not compromise vision. The project used tele-management
controls which made it possible to switch or control each light from a central point. It also allows the system to dim specific lights to levels that are
appropriate for road conditions, receive instant messages when lights fail, and create a database where all information is stored. The project significantly
reduced energy consumption besides the 45 percent saved due to the dimming circuits.

 A program to detect leaks can result in minimal pressures and encourage, through less wastage, a
 more sustainable use of water resources. In sewerage systems, identifying and eliminating leaks can
 also significantly reduce the risk of ground contamination. Pressure management can cost-effectively
 reduce treatment and pumping costs by minimizing the leaks and the delivery pressure needed. It is
 particularly suited to pumped mains but may require estimates of how demand changes over the day.
 In turn, appropriately rated pressure-reducing valves will reduce the flow through the leaks and the
 total flow that must be delivered by the upstream pump at the source/treatment works. This solution
 may be particularly useful in gravity-flow networks. The key advantage of pressure management over
 leak detection is the immediate effectiveness. It is most useful where the network is long and has
 many small leaks that are difficult and expensive to locate and repair.

 Activity                                          Method


                                                   The city can create partnerships to conduct a feasibility study to assess leak levels throughout the
                                                   network(s). To do this, the city should form a team that includes network planners, water and utility
                                                   engineers, and financial advisors to ensure that the study will include all pertinent aspects. In turn, the
 Feasibility study                                 study will establish the technological and financial viability of upgrades, as well as procurement and
                                                   policy options. The latter should be appraised against baseline city energy expenditures associated
                                                   with fixing water leaks, monitoring the flows, and responding to demands to refine value and pump
                                                   controls. Technical ability, incentives, and taxes should be considered.


                                                   Where the city owns or runs the potable or wastewater network, it pays for upgrading the utility
                                                   infrastructure from the city budget or separate funding mechanisms. The advantage of this is that the
 Procurement for upgrades                          city has the legal authority to take ownership of the measure and thus facilitate compliance with local
                                                   laws, policies, and obtaining planning permits.
                                                       The main costs for managing pressure are related to buying and installing equipment (that is,

                                               best way to carry out the activity. The RFP requires bidders to adopt efficiency measures and fund the
                                               project, with remuneration paid through the savings that are achieved. This ‘shared savings approach’
                                               is common in the electricity industry.
Build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT)                 The contractor must provide services that include the financing of capital, design, implementation,

                                               The city should join with communities to increase understanding about the benefits of leak-detection
                                               initiatives (when less technical methods are adopted, they provide an opportunity for community
Community participation                        participation). In this way, the community may help identify leaks and the infrastructure may be

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of the recommendations is crucial to understanding their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation,
it should define the targets that indicate the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece of
the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Calculate the percentage of unaccounted-for water (UFW): This involves measuring the percentage of water lost (out of the total water treated) due to leaks, waste,

     theft, mechanical errors in meters at the source, or human errors in recording the meter data.

   •	 Calculate the percentage of water leaked per km of water main per day during the reporting period.

   •	 Measure the length of water mains inspected for leaks.

   •	 Measure the number of properties affected by low water pressure due to the old pipe network or repairs being made during the reporting period.

With an EcoLinks Challenge Grant of US$46,820, Regia Autonom Jude ean Apa-Canal Ia i (RAJAC) partnered with a U.S. environmental technology
firm, Cavanaugh & Associates, to develop a pilot leak detection/abatement program, whose total cost was US$118,074. The program (1) trained RAJAC
personnel to detect leaks, (2) began a leak detection system, (3) developed a water conservation program, and (4) launched a public outreach campaign.
The leak detection pilot program was a prerequisite for carrying out a water conservation program. The staff’s understanding of new technology
was significantly increased through training and seminars and the public awareness-raising program encouraged consumers to participate in water
conservation efforts. Environmental and economic benefits resulted from the more efficient use of water and energy. In the short term, it was estimated
that three of the leaks identified in the pilot were responsible for a water loss of 60,000 m3/year and a revenue loss of US$24,000. Since the equipment
used during the pilot cost about US$20,000 and no further significant investments were needed to eliminate leaks, the payback period for the equipment
was less than one year. This project contributed to a larger effort to improve water efficiency throughout Iasi County that will ultimately reduce water
loss by 8 million m3 and provide savings of US$3 million a year; however, this level of savings will require significant investment in infrastructure.

As part of a USAID-funded Ecolinks Project, the Cadmus Group assessed the city’s water supply system and discovered that energy conservation
measures could save roughly US$250,000 a year in electricity costs. Low-cost measures include trimming impellers to better match pumps and motors
with required flows and pressures. Moderate-cost measures include detecting and reducing leaks and replacing some pumps.

The Sebokeng/Evaton pressure management project used a BOOT contract because the city had only limited access to capital and lacked the technical
capacity to implement the project. The water savings were so significant that both the city and the contractor gained, with 80 percent of the savings
accruing to the city and 20 percent to the contractor for services provided over five years. Since the installed infrastructure is permanent and has a
design life of at least 20 years, the city will achieve savings well beyond the 5-year period. The staff also benefit from access to expertise and training.
The project reduced water losses by over 30 percent, saving about 8 ML a year with an equivalent financial value of around US$3.5 million. These
water savings also translated into energy savings of around 14,250,000 kWh a year due to the reduced energy needed to pump water. The project
demonstrated that introducing suitable technology with a shared savings arrangement could succeed in low-income communities. A private firm provided
financing for technical innovations at no cost to the city since it paid the firm through the savings achieved in water purchases.

The water supply project in Emfuleni resulted in lower costs for water—including lower energy costs associated with water supply—and improved the
city’s finances through a leak-management system for bulk water supply. Innovative pressure management technology was applied to the water supply
system of two low-income residential areas, yielding significant savings in water and energy costs for pumping and treating water. The payback period
was only three months and financial savings, from both reduced energy use and water losses, was estimated at US$3.8 million a year for 20 years.
Under the performance contract to finance and implement the project, the city retains 80 percent of the water and energy cost savings during the
first five years and 100 percent of the savings afterwards. The project has been hailed as a great success for South Africa, demonstrating that the use
of suitable technology under a shared savings arrangement can succeed in low-income communities. A private firm providing financing for technical
innovation—at no cost to the municipality—received remuneration by sharing the savings in water purchases. The contractor provided various services,
including financing the up-front capital, design, implementation, commissioning, and O&M costs over the contract period, as well as training municipal
staff in operations prior to handing over the installation. It was a ‘win-win’ situation, both for the city and contractor through a successful public-private
partnership (PPP).

Sydney Water has a water pressure management program to target areas where pressure levels are well above average and there are many water main
breaks. Because excessive water pressure can lead to breaks and cause leaks, the aim is to adjust water pressure in the supply system to achieve more
consistent levels which, in turn, reduce the number of water main breaks, improve the reliability of the system, and conserve water. The program is an
important part of Sydney Water’s leak prevention scheme and the New South Wales Government’s Metropolitan Water Plan.

The Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project (PPWSA) of Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided the opportunity for PPWSA, the government-
owned water supply utility, to partner with ADB and demonstrate its capacity to introduce water sector reforms. To phase out non-revenue water (where
consumers gain access to water for free), PPWSA started metering all water connections. It gradually equipped each network with pressure and flow
rate data transmitters that provide online data for analyzing big leaks in the system. It also created a training center to respond to in-house training
needs. PPWSA renovated old pipes using state-of-the-art materials and labor from PPWSA staff. PPWSA also institutionalized performance monitoring,
producing progress reports and indicators on a regular basis and annually auditing its accounts/procedures. The project promoted the transfer of more
managerial autonomy to PPWSA to enable it to use its own funds on maintenance and rehabilitation programs. The result was that PPWSA became
financially and operationally autonomous, achieved full cost recovery, and turned into an outstanding public utility in the region.

Activity                                    Method

                                            The city recruits local EE advocates and trains them to promote the issues. They can be drawn from
                                            those who are interested in spreading the message about EE, such as local authorities, businesses,
                                            community groups, NGOs, health trusts, school children, and others. This can be accomplished in several
                                            ways.
Energy efficiency advocates                    •	 Advocates can be asked to train the trainers and provide them with support to run sessions in their communities.

                                                    They teach the simple ways to save energy and provide leaflets to distribute locally. The trainers must inform

                                                    the community that they are the local contacts for EE information.

                                               Since the advocates are often volunteers, an official should be appointed to provide support and
                                            encouragement, conduct regular follow-ups, and monitor progress of each EE advocacy program.

Monitoring
Monitoring the progress and effectiveness of recommendations is crucial to understand their value over time. When the city adopts a recommendation, it
should define a target(s) that indicates the progress it expects in a given period and design a monitoring plan. The latter does not need to be complicated
or time-consuming but should, at least (1) identify information sources; (2) identify performance indicators that can measure and validate equipment/
processes; (3) set protocols for keeping records; (4) set a schedule to measure activity (daily, weekly, and monthly); (5) assign responsibilities for each piece
of the process; (6) create a way to audit and review performance; and (7) create reporting and review cycles.
   Some measures related to this recommendation are listed:
   •	 Determine the number of people participating in training programs annually.

   •	 Determine the number of hits to the city’s EE website monthly (if developed) or number of requests for EE measures.

   •	 Determine the number of articles in the press about the city’s EE.

   •	 Determine the number of EE advocates who are trained (if this is done).

  In 2004, the Meath Energy Management Agency’s (MEMA) extended its Energy Awareness Week to everyone who lived or worked in the county
  of Meath, Ireland, using media campaigns to raise consumers’ understanding of energy issues. This included visits to schools, information displays,
  widespread media coverage, competitions, a ‘Car-Free Day’, and an offer of free CFL light bulbs, which encouraged participation at all levels. The campaign
  dramatically increased requests for information from the energy agency. The competitions and promotions also improved local knowledge of EE and
  encouraged people to choose sustainable energy and transport options.
      Energy Awareness Week activities were coordinated and carried out by MEMA with support from the Environment Department of Meath County
