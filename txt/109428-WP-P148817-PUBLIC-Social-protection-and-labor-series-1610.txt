Abstract

The paper summarizes key design characteristics and performance indicators of national and civil service
pension schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is intended to serve as a resource in pension reform
efforts in the region. The note delivers an up-to date assessment of the main design parameters, key
performance metrics, and main challenges facing pension systems in SSA. The information provided in the
note aims to capture current trends in the region and benchmark performance and pension system design
choices made by countries against international experience.

Section I provides an overview of mandatory national pension systems in the region whereas Section II
presents the key design features of civil service pension schemes. Section III analyzes the performance of
both national and civil service pension schemes; particular attention is paid to the fiscal performance and
equity of the pension schemes. Pension system design parameters of both national and civil service
pension schemes are discussed in section IV. Section V aims to enhance the paper by providing relevant
demographic data and analysis.

Summary
This paper summarizes key design characteristics and performance indicators of national and civil
service pension schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is intended to serve as a resource in
pension reform efforts in the region. The paper delivers an up-to date assessment of the main
design parameters, key performance metrics, and main challenges facing pension systems in SSA.
The information provided in the paper aims to capture current trends in the region and
benchmark performance and pension system design choices made by countries against
international experience. Section I provides an overview of mandatory national pension systems
in the region whereas Section II presents the key design features of civil service pension schemes.
Section III analyzes the performance of both national and civil service pension schemes; particular
attention is paid to the fiscal performance and equity of the pension schemes. Pension system
design parameters of both national and civil service pension schemes are discussed in section IV.
Section V aims to enhance the note by providing relevant demographic data and analysis.


    I.   Mandatory national pension systems

Out of the 44 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa 1 where at least some information is available, 38
countries have mandatory contributory national 2 pension schemes. Out of the 38 countries, 31
are defined benefit (DB) 3 systems financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG)4 basis; four countries have
provident 5 funds (Uganda, Swaziland, Kenya, and Gambia); two countries (Malawi 6 and Nigeria)
have funded defined contribution schemes (DC), 7 and one country (Ghana) has a hybrid of a DB
and a DC system. Six countries (Botswana, Eritrea, Lesotho, Namibia, South Sudan, and South

  There are a total of 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
2
  In this note, national pension schemes refer to schemes operated by the Government which cover private sector
workers, and in the case of integrated system, also cover public sector workers.
3
 A Defined Benefit pension plan (DB) is a pension plan with a guarantee by the insurer or pension agency that a
benefit based on a prescribed formula will be paid; it can be fully funded or unfunded and notional.
4
  Pay‐as‐you‐go (PAYG) is a method of pension system financing whereby current outlays on pension benefits are
paid out of current revenues from an earmarked tax, often a payroll tax.
5
  Provident fund is a publicly run fully funded defined contribution fund.
6
  Malawi has recently established a DC scheme.
7
  A Defined Contribution pension plan (DC) is a pension plan in which the periodic contribution is prescribed and
the benefit depends on the contribution plus the investment return. Can be fully funded or notional and
nonfinancial.

Africa) do not have a mandatory national contributory pension scheme and instead only have
civil service pension schemes for public sector workers, occupational 8 pension schemes for
private sector workers provided by employers, and non-contributory old age benefits to those
who qualify.

Labor force coverage of national pension schemes varies significantly across the region, but on
average it is quite low. Over half of the labor force in Mauritius and Seychelles contributes to
the national pension system; coverage is also relatively high in Zimbabwe with around 33 percent
of the labor force accruing pension rights. However, across the remaining SSA countries, pension
coverage is less than 10 percent of the labor force. The potential issues impeding pension
coverage expansion in the region are many. First, mandatory defined benefit pension schemes
financed from payroll taxes are typically most successful in countries where the majority of
workers are in the formal labor market and hold employment contracts which enable them to
contribute to the pension system in a systematic manner. The situation is quite the opposite in
Africa where the majority of employment takes place outside the formal economy. As such, one
of the defining challenges facing SAA is to think about designing systems which will prove to be
attractive and beneficial for the working age population. Table 1 provides an overview of the
different pension design choices made by countries in SSA; it also presents latest figures available
on labor force and elderly coverage of national pension systems for the countries where recent
data are available.

 An occupational pension scheme is an arrangement by which an employer provides retirement benefits to
employees.

    II.   Civil service pension systems

Having two separate pension schemes operating in parallel for public and private sector
workers is a pronounced characteristic of old age income provision in SSA. Civil servants are
covered by pension schemes in all Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Out of the 44 countries where
information is available, 33 have separate schemes for public sector workers. In seven countries
(Botswana, Lesotho, 9 Liberia, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland) public sector
workers are typically covered by some type of social pension, in some cases a means or pensions
tested benefit, in addition to their civil service pension. Swaziland has a universal non-
contributory scheme which is pensions-tested, although it is not clear if the pensions test is
applied in practice—potentially meaning that civil servants could benefit from both the civil
service scheme as well as the non-contributory program. In Liberia, public sector workers are
members of the national pension scheme but also receive a top-up arrangement.

Ten countries (Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome e
Principe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, and Zambia) have an integrated pension system meaning that
it covers both public and private sector workers alike and there is no separate special civil service
scheme for public sector workers. In the case of Cape Verde, integration of the national and civil
service pension schemes has been done quite recently. Eritrea and South Sudan have not yet
established private sector pension schemes.

The South Africa Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) is one of the largest pension funds
in the region with over 1.2 million active contributors and over 406 thousand beneficiaries in
2015. GEPF beneficiaries account for 10 percent of the population over the retirement age. The
Government Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) of Namibia is another example of large and well-
managed pension fund in a country where there is no national contributory pension scheme. In
2013, GIPF had over 94 thousand contributors, or 11 percent of the labor force, and provided
pensions to 56 thousand elderly, or 45 percent of the population above the retirement age.

 In Lesotho and Swaziland, social pension programs are pensions tested – eligibility is limited to individuals
without access to a contributory pension. However, in practice both countries do not apply the pensions test and
all elderly above the eligibility age are effectively included in the program.

                                                        4
In Lesotho, the Public Officers’ Defined Contribution Pension Fund—civil service pension
scheme—accounts for the largest pension scheme in the country. The Public Officers’ Defined
Contribution Pension Fund was created through an act of Parliament in 2008; the reform
converted the system from a PAYG DB to a DC system. The fairly recent establishment of the DC
scheme helps to explain the very low coverage 10 of the elderly of less than 1/10 of a percent in
2015. During the same year the fund had 36 thousand contributors, or 4.1 percent of the labor
force. Botswana and South Sudan also fall into the category of countries where there is only a
civil service pension scheme for public sector employees and a non-contributory old age benefit.
South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Lesotho also have significant non-contributory pension
programs for the elderly. Namibia and Botswana have a universal pension, whereas South Africa
and Lesotho provide means-tested and pension-tested benefits respectively.

Civil service pension schemes in SAA are mostly defined benefit, financed on a pay-as-you-go
basis. Botswana, Lesotho, and Nigeria 11 have funded DC schemes; Kenya is introducing a DC
scheme; in 2013, Mauritius introduced a DC scheme for new entrants to civil service; Swaziland
has a funded defined benefit scheme for civil servants; Ghana has a hybrid of DB and a DC
scheme. The majority of civil service pension schemes in SSA are contributory schemes, however,
nine countries (Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Dem. Rep., Gambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda,
Mauritius, and Angola) fully or partially finance civil service pensions directly from the
government budget. It is important to note that in the case of civil service pension schemes
where the government is also the employer, financing the employer share of the pension
contribution rate is a direct cost for the government. Having a specified contribution rate may
improve transparency and promote long term financial planning, however, financing civil service
pensions is a direct fiscal obligation for the government—with our without a specified
contribution rate.

The recommended design for a civil service pension system is often to integrate it with the
national system (Palacios & Whitehouse, 2006). Integration typically allows for better labor

   Overall elderly pension coverage is higher as there are individuals drawing pensions under the previous, now
closed system.

   As discussed earlier, Nigeria’s civil service scheme is integrated with the national scheme.

market mobility (as it provides for increased portability of pension rights) and may help to avoid
some of the inequities observed between civil service and less generous private sector schemes
in the region. International experience suggests that either fully, or at least partially integrated
pension systems are strongly preferred over maintaining a dualism in old-age income provision
between public and private sector.

 III.      Performance of national and civil service pension systems

Fiscal performance

Based on the countries included in the analysis, spending on national pension systems in SSA
is low as a share of GDP, amounting to an average of 0.5 percent. Spending on national pensions
in SSA is currently low primarily because of two reasons: (1) the small share of elderly in total
population and (2) and even smaller share of elderly in receipt of a national pension. The small
number of pensioners also results from the fact that in a number of countries the national
pension funds were set up fairly recently. For example, all pension funds in Tanzania (except for
PPF) were converted from DC to PAYG DB between 1999 and 2003. Therefore, the relative
immaturity of pension systems is also a contributing factor for the low levels of pension spending
currently observed in the region.

The majority of national contributory pension schemes in SSA are fairly immature and currently
enjoy fiscal surpluses as the ratio of eligible beneficiaries to system contributors is low. As
pension systems begin to mature, the ratio of pension system beneficiaries to pension system
contributors—also known as a system dependency rate—increases, increasing the fiscal burden
on each contributor to finance pension benefits (in the case of pay-as-you-go financed systems).

                                                             7
It is important to note that in the beginning—when pension systems are immature—no matter
how generous or actuarially unbalanced they may be, they typically generate surpluses. As
pension systems mature, these surpluses fall and can be transformed into deficits if the
parameters are misaligned. Evaluating the long term financing needs of pension systems under
baseline and alternative reform scenarios could help countries adjust system parameters
accordingly and also improve long term financial planning overall. While countries may be able
to afford the generous benefits now, they may become unaffordable in the future as the ratio of
pensioners to contributors increases.

Civil service schemes, on the other hand, are generally much more mature and their
demographic profiles are often more advanced (i.e., older median age) than the national
population. The civil service in many SSA countries expanded and grew in the 1960s and 1970s.
While some increases in civil service positions, such as in education, are often tied to growth in
the population, in many other cases, the size of the civil service is affected by other factors, such
as budgetary expansions and slowdowns. After an initial ramping up of the civil service, most
countries have slowed the growth of the civil service due to budgetary pressures. And the life
expectancy of civil servants who have higher income and are better educated than the general
population is often much higher than the general population. With fewer, young new entrants,
and aging of the existing civil servants, the age structure of participants often looks more like that
of an aging country than of a young country, with all the fiscal problems that older countries face
in financing pensions.

In the majority of the countries where data are available, civil service pension schemes tend to
be more expensive than national pension schemes. For example, in Mauritius, national pension
scheme which is primarily for private sector workers costs 0.4 percent of GDP, whereas civil
service pension costs exceed 1 percent of GDP. This also holds true for Tanzania, Uganda,
Ethiopia, Benin, and Togo. Even though spending on both national and civil service pension
schemes in SSA may not appear high relative to spending in other countries, it is high relative to
the number of people receiving pensions—especially when looking at civil service pension
schemes. The relatively high cost of civil service pensions can be attributed to a number of factors
including: (i) generosity of benefits; and (ii) long duration of benefits, partly attributable to low
                                                  8
retirement ages and early retirement provision. Generosity of benefits can arise from a number
of parameter choices of a pension scheme: (i) the accrual rate, the rate at which the benefit
entitlements build up for each year of service; (ii) the averaging period for wages included in the
pensionable wage; (iii) indexation of the pension post-retirement; and (iv) commutation
options. 12 The generosity of the civil service schemes is important since the civil service schemes
in a country often guide the expectations for what private employers should be expected to
provide. It is also important because it results in an increasing fiscal burden, potentially crowding
out spending on other key areas essential for human development and poverty reduction such
as health, education, and safety nets.

   Commutation in the pension context occurs where a retiree surrenders part of his or her rights to receive a
pension in the form of a future income stream in exchange for receiving an immediate lump sum payment.
Commutation rate (factor) defines the relationship between the lump sum payment received and the future
income stream foregone. A rate of 10:1 means that a person commuting would receive $10 now for every $1 of
future annual income foregone. An actuary normally calculates the commutation rate using life expectancy tables,
pension indexation rules and expected interest rates.

Spending on non-contributory elderly assistance programs in SSA varies between countries and
largely depends on the level of the benefits, eligibility age and the size of the elderly
population. In 2013, Mauritius spent 2.9 percent of GDP on the universal basic pension program
which provides a pension to everyone above age 60 (Mauritius is the oldest country
demographically in the region, see Figure 15).               Seychelles and Lesotho also allocated a
comparatively large share of national income to non-contributory elderly assistance benefits, 1.5
percent and 2.28 percent respectively (Seychelles is the second oldest country in the region
whereas Lesotho is the 7th). Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda have non-contributory pilot pension
programs which have not yet been scaled-up for implementation on a national scale. South
Africa has a means-tested old age pension paid from age 60 which covers a significant share of
the eligible elderly. Even though non-contributory pension programs play an important role in
alleviating old age poverty, they typically do so at a substantial cost. Even now, when Africa is
still young and the share of population over the age of 60 in total population is quite small –
resulting in a small pool of eligible social pension beneficiaries, non-contributory pension costs
already range between 1 and 3 percent of GDP in six out of the eight countries with established
social pension schemes.

Elderly coverage

While pension spending in Africa may not appear high relative to spending in other countries
(OECD countries spend on average of 9 percent of GDP on national pensions), 14 spending is
high relative to the numbers of pension system beneficiaries. Generally, the share of elderly in
receipt of a contributory pension is very low. On the other hand, the share is high in countries
with large social pension schemes (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

National pension systems in SSA are accessible to a very narrow share of the elderly population
and as a result come at a relatively low cost. First, looking at the elderly coverage of the national
pension system, a few countries stand out namely Mauritius, Seychelles, and Cabo Verde for
having achieved markedly higher coverage rates in their national pension systems. 15 However,
in the majority of the countries, less than 10 percent of the population above age 60—the
prevailing retirement age in the region—is in receipt of a national pension. Currently, the
footprint of national pension systems in SSA is low—they are relatively inexpensive, but also only
cover a very narrow percentage of the elderly population. As such, one of the biggest challenges
facing SSA national pension systems remains coverage expansion. The reasons behind low
pension coverage in the region are many. Limited to no capacity to save due to low incomes and
the large size of the informal labor market rank towards the top of the long list of potential
impediments to coverage expansion.

A set of countries have non-contributory social pension programs in place which are either
universal or means/pensions-tested. Universal pension eligibility criteria are not contingent on
prior contributions and are therefore accessible to a much broader share of the elderly
population. Eight countries as shown in Table 3 have national social pension programs—
Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Mauritius, Lesotho, South Africa, Cape Verde, and Seychelles.
Generally, pension coverage of the elderly population in the countries with significant non-

place which further contribute to higher pension coverage rates among the elderly.

without non-contributory old age schemes.

Elderly coverage of civil service pension schemes is even lower, though absorbing a markedly
larger share of GDP than national pension systems. For example, in Uganda, currently 0.4
percent of GDP is being spent on civil service pensions—but this is being spent on only 2.5 percent
of the elderly population. Botswana spends 1.7 percent of GDP on civil service pensions which
reach only 6 percent of the population over the age of 65. The relatively high cost of civil service
pensions (as a share of national income), combined with low coverage of the elderly signals that
these scheme are providing pensions that are a very high, especially relative to income per
capita. Aside from equity and fiscal sustainability considerations, the generosity of the civil
service schemes is also important since the civil service schemes in a country often guide the
expectations for what private employers should be expected to provide.

IV.    Design parameters and characteristics of national and civil service pension systems

Contribution rates

All national, mandatory contributory pension schemes collect contributions from participants
in order to finance system expenditures. The average total contribution rate based on the
countries covered (employee and employer) is 12 percent of wages. This is low relative to other
regions and is partly explained by the immaturity of most pension schemes which reduces
                                                                                                                                                             14
financing needs on a pay-as-you-go basis. Some are already relatively high. The average
contribution rate across OECD converges around 18 percent while Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia, Sierra
Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda all have rates of at least 15 percent (Figure 6).

Civil service pension schemes have considerably higher contribution rates in many cases. In
fact, in many of the SSA countries, civil service contribution rates approach levels seen in
demographically much older countries. This trend is also reflective of the fact that many civil
service pension schemes in SSA are already quite mature and as a result have higher financing
needs (having been set up decades before the national pension systems). As mentioned above,
the demographic composition of civil service schemes can be much older than the demographic
profile of the overall population. The already high contribution rates are of concern because
there may not be much room to further raise contributions rates in the future when systems
become even more mature. It is also important to mention that in a civil service system, as
compared to a national system, raising employer contribution rates essentially raises the
government costs. Whether the government faces additional deficit to finance or higher
contribution costs is immaterial from the government’s perspective. The only way a higher
contribution rate would improve government finances is if it is fully paid for by employees, a
measure which would result in a decline in their net salaries.

Accrual rates

In the countries where data is available, national pension benefit formulas provide an average
2 percent of individual’s last wage per year of contributions. This parameter is also known as
an accrual rate and it is quite high compared to international standards—twice as high as the
OECD average, and especially high considering that the average national pension contribution
rate is 12 percent of wage. As pension schemes mature, the average length of service should be
expected to reach at least 30-35 years, as is the experience in medium to high income countries.
A simple calculation of multiplying the accrual rate by the number of covered years can expose
that on average SSA economies are promising a replacement rate of 60 percent. Furthermore,
longer careers of 35 or more years could result in unsustainably high benefit levels for many
countries over the long run. It is important to note that in many countries, contribution histories
can be significantly shorter, resulting it markedly lower pensions than would be expected if a
person contributed for 30 or more years.

The vast majority of SSA countries have an accrual rate that is higher in the first years of
employment and lower during the later years of employment. The national pension scheme in
Tanzania has an accrual rate that is higher for the first 15 years; in Ethiopia—both national and
civil service pension schemes—the accrual rate during the first 10 years is more than twice the

                                                      16
accrual rate applied after the first 10 years; the pension system in Ghana also provides for a
higher accrual rate during the first 15 years of employment. Most OECD countries have moved
to linear accrual rates given the potential distortions in behavior that such non-linear accrual
schedules may cause.

Against the backdrop of changing demographics, the key question to ask is what governments
can afford to provide in benefits in the longer run. In defined benefit plans, changing population
structure, characterized by aging, will, over time, cause pension system dependency rates to
increase. If one assumes that in the long run there will be about three workers for every
pensioner and, if you expect people to work from age 20 to age 65 (45 year career span), a rate
of 15 percent average wage can cover a pension of 45 percent of average wage or a 1 percent
accrual rate. Therefore, it is important to think about the benefit structure today as not to
overpromise when revenues are flush because reducing benefits later on is much more difficult.

accrual rate of 2 percent, assuming a full-career, translates into very high replacement rates
especially when compared to lifetime average earnings.

Wage base for pension calculation

The wage base—the income measure on which accrual rates are applied—in both national and
civil service pension schemes in SSA tends to include only the final few years of employment.
The wage base is an important parameter which has a significant impact on the generosity of the
pension benefit. OECD countries have almost universally moved to long or even lifetime earnings
bases where past earnings are revalued to take into account changes in the average wage of all
workers. This approach is more appropriate in terms of the consumption smoothing objective,
avoids inequities between workers with different age-earnings profiles and reduces the incentive
for gaming the system by inflating salaries just prior to retirement. The issue of equity is best
illustrated if we consider the issue that different workers have different salary growth paths.
Higher income earners tend to have steeper age earnings profiles, so their pensionable income
ends up being much higher than the income on which they have paid contributions throughout
their entire career. As a result, there is a transfer in the system to higher income earners.

                                                                                                                                                                     18
Conversely, lower income individuals typically experience flatter age-earnings profiles so their
pensionable income is about the same as the income on which they’ve paid contributions. As a
result, lower income earners may receive a lower return compared to higher income earners. On
top of that, lower income earners also tend to have shorter life expectancy, drawing a pension
for fewer years. Applying accrual rates to final three or five years of income could also induce
individuals or employers to seek a drastic increase in income in those final years in order to secure
a higher pension, a practice which can be extremely expensive for the pension system. Basing
civil servant pensions on final salary can be particularly expensive, since civil servants often
receive significant promotions at the end of their career and face a steadily increasing wage
based on seniority. Private sector salaries, by contrast, often peak earlier in the career around
the late 40s or early 50s and then either hold steady or decline slightly. As a result, the
overpayment in benefits relative to average contributions tends to be much higher for civil
servants. Additionally, in many cases, civil servants receive promotions and large salary increases
just before retirement, which inflate their pensionable salaries, but result in huge costs to the
pension system.

Retirement ages

Retirement ages in SSA rank on the low side of the international spectrum, with the majority
of countries having an official retirement age of 60 or lower. Additionally, in a number of
countries—including Gambia, Uganda, and Botswana—there are early retirement provisions
which permit retirement as early as age 45. Ghana, Tanzania, and Ethiopia provide the option
for early retirement from age 55. On the other hand, the average OECD retirement age is 64 for
men and 63 for women. One may argue that since African countries have lower life expectancies
than higher income countries, they should also have lower retirement ages. Although life
expectancy at birth across the majority of SSA countries is considerably lower than the OECD
average, when comparing life expectancy ate age 60—which is the metric one should use when
working with pension systems—the difference between the two sets of countries is considerably
smaller. Taking the analysis one step further, one could also safely assume that pension system
contributors—typically formal workers who tend to have higher wages (better healthcare, safer
jobs)—can have even higher life expectancy than the general population, thus justifying an ever
higher retirement age and smaller difference between African and OECD countries. Currently,
the retirement gap between the two sets of countries is far greater than the gap in life expectancy
at age 60, which suggest that retirement ages across a number of SSA countries probably need
to start rising, or early retirement needs to be reduced to enable average effective 17 retirement
age to increase.

Indexation

The experience in SSA has been that most countries adjust pensions in payment to either
growth in wages or on an-hoc basis. Indexation post-retirement aims to preserve the relative
value of the pension benefit throughout retirement. Most OECD countries have moved to price


                                                                21
indexation in order to reduce spending while protecting the real value of pensions. Wage or ad
hoc indexation also subject pensioners in specific cohorts to volatility in the real value of their
pensions. International best practices suggest that the best approach is to uprate pensions by
increases in prices only, with the logic that the individual’s purchasing power should be
maintained throughout retirement. Ethiopia and Togo (national system) do not index pensions
in payment. While indexing pensions to wage growth could prove expensive, a complete lack of
indexing of pensions in payment could put elderly at an increased risk of old age poverty. The
lack of any indexation measure would result in a decline in the real value of the pension benefit
overtime.

     V.   Demographics

Over the last six decades, Africa has gone through a demographic transition, moving from a
period of high mortality and high fertility rates to one of lower mortality, though still high
fertility rates. Historical fertility rates have declined from an average of 6.5 in 1950-1955 to 5.1

  In the case of Ghana, the national pension scheme indexation policies in practice tend to resemble much more
of an ad hoc approach with wage-based as well as flat nominal uprates of pensions.

in the 2010-2015. Total Fertility Rate (TFR)19 projections indicate that by 2080, the average TFR
in Sub-Saharan Africa would decline to 2.4 births per woman. Between 1950 and 2015, TFRs in
Sub-Saharan Africa decreased by 22 percent. In comparison, TFRs across high-income countries
during the same period decreased 41 percent from 2.97 to 1.75. Over the coming three decades,
TFRs in SSA are projected to further decrease by 28 percent, reaching 3.4 by 2040 while TFRs
across high-income countries are projected to remain largely unchanged during the same period.

Child Dependency Ratios (CDR) 20 are projected to decrease at a faster pace than the growth in
the Old-Age Dependency Ratio (OAD)21 as the steep decline in fertility rates over the past few
decades influences the age composition of the population. The result is a projected decline in
the Total Dependency Ratio (TDR) 22 providing a “demographic dividend” which may afford an

ages. It may be interpreted as the expected number of children a women who survives to the end of the
reproductive age span will have during her lifetime if she experiences the given age-specific rates.

Prospects: The 2015 Revision


The share of the population over the age of 65 in total population is projected to increase on
average four fold in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 15). Currently, the elderly account for about 3
percent of the population; by 2080 the elderly will compose on average 12 percent of the
population. In some countries, including Seychelles, Cabo Verde, and Mauritius, the demographic
shift will result in one fourth of the population being over the age of 65. Although elderly in SSA
on average account for only 3 percent of the population, well below the OECD average of 16
percent, in the coming decades, about half of all SSA countries will approach a similar
demographic composition to that of OECD countries today. The projected demographic change,
driven by declines in fertility and increases in longevity, will mean that without improvements in
the mechanisms for old-age income support that can reach the majority of the population, many
SSA countries may be faced with increased rates of old-age poverty.

Demographic projections show that Africa’s window to realize the benefits of this demographic
transition will likely be open for a couple of more decades. However, the opportunity will not
last forever and the region will need to act in order to translate these favorable demographic

                                                      25
trends into a demographic dividend. This argument is especially important when it comes to
pension system reforms, which typically take several decades to fully materialize. Pension
reforms are generally introduced in a way that current pensioners, as well as those individuals
that are relatively close to retirement, remain unaffected by the reforms—the approach known
as “grandfathering” of rights. Since pension reforms would typically only apply to younger
cohorts, the full effects of a reformed pension system may only become visible several decades
following the introduction of new parameters. That is why it is important to start thinking about
pension reforms now, even though the majority of countries are still enjoying young
demographics.

The projected growth in the 65 plus population will negatively affect the Old-Age Dependency
ratio which is important for the fiscal sustainability of pension systems, particularly under
defined-benefit pension systems financed on a pay-as-you-go basis (PAYG). On average, in
2015, there were 13 people of working-age for every person over the age of 65; by 2080,
projections show there will only be five people of working-age for every elderly person.
Worsening population dependency rates would likely translate into a decline in pension system
contribution revenue and a simultaneous increase in pension expenditure—reflecting an
increase in the number of elderly eligible for a pension. An unfavorable shift in pension system
dependency rates—defined as the number of pension system beneficiaries to the number of
pension system contributors—may result in a fiscal shortfall, particularly in the absence of
commensurate reforms to account for the changing age structure of the covered population.

                             Parameters of a Traditional Pension System

 Parameters of a traditional pension system include:
 Eligibility Conditions
      - Retirement age: Normal age at which people can retire.
      - Years of service: Minimum years of service required to qualify for a pension (for some occupations,
           the years of service awarded exceed the years actually worked).
 Benefit Parameters
      - Accrual rate: Percentage of wage base earned per year of service.
      - Wage base: Wage on which pension benefits are calculated, typically average wage earned during
           a specified period of time.
      - Averaging period for wage base: Number of years included in the average wage on which the
           pension benefits are calculated. This can range from last salary to full-career average.
      - Valorization of past wages: Parameter used to revalue past wages when averaging to account for
           the fact that wages were earned at different points in time when the cost of living and economy-
           wide average wages differed from what exists at the time of retirement. This is typically the
           economy-wide average wage growth between the time the wages were earned and the time of
           retirement.
      - Indexation: Parameter that determines how pensions are increased after retirement. It is typically
           linked to inflation or wage growth or some combination of the two.
 Contribution Rates
 Workers, their employers, and sometimes the government make contributions as a percentage of the net
 or gross wage. These contributions are typically subject to a ceiling and sometimes subject to a minimum as
 well.

Glossary of Pension Terms

Accrual rate. The rate at which pension entitlement is built up relative to earnings per year of
service in earnings‐related schemes—for example, one‐sixtieth of final salary.

Benefit rate. The ratio of the average pension to the average wage, which could be expressed as
relative to the economy wide average wage or to the individual’s specific average or final wage.

Commutation. Exchange of part of the annuity component of a pension for an immediate lump
sum.

Defined benefit. A pension plan with a guarantee by the insurer or pension agency that a benefit
based on a prescribed formula will be paid. Can be fully funded or unfunded and notional.

Defined contribution. A pension plan in which the periodic contribution is prescribed and the
benefit depends on the contribution plus the investment return. Can be fully funded or notional
and nonfinancial.

Full funding. The accumulation of pension reserves that total 100 percent of the present value of
all pension liabilities owed to current members.

Funding. Accumulation of assets in advance to meet future pension liabilities.

Indexation. Increases in benefits by reference to an index, usually of prices, although in some
cases of average earnings.

Means‐tested benefit. A benefit that is paid only if the recipient’s income falls below a certain
level.

Occupational pension scheme. An arrangement by which an employer provides retirement
benefits to employees.

Old‐age dependency ratio. The ratio of older persons to working‐age individuals. The old‐age
dependency ratio may refer to the number of persons over 60 divided by, for example, the
number of persons ages 15–59, the number of persons over 60 divided by the number of persons
ages 20–59, and so forth.

                                               29
Pay‐as‐you‐go. In its strictest sense, a method of financing whereby current outlays on pension
benefits are paid out of current revenues from an earmarked tax, often a payroll tax.

Pension coverage rate. The number of workers actively contributing to a publicly mandated
contributory or retirement scheme, divided by the estimated labor force or by the working age
population.

Pensionable earnings. The portion of remuneration on which pension benefits and contributions
are calculated.

Portability. The ability to transfer accrued pension rights between plans.

Provident fund. A fully funded, defined contribution scheme in which funds are managed by the
public sector.

Replacement rate. The value of a pension as a proportion of a worker’s wage during a base period,
such as the last year or two before retirement or more, or the entire lifetime average wage. Also
denotes the average pension of a group of pensioners as a proportion of the average wage of the
group.

System dependency ratio. The ratio of persons receiving pensions from a certain pension scheme
divided by the number of workers contributing to the same scheme in the same period.

System maturation. The process by which a pension system moves from being immature, with
young workers contributing to the system, but with few benefits being paid out since the initial
elderly have not contributed and thus are not eligible for benefits, to being mature, with the
proportion of elderly receiving pensions relatively equivalent to their proportion of the
population.

Universal flat pension. Pensions paid solely on the basis of age and citizenship, without regard to
work or contribution records.

Valorization of earnings. A method of revaluing earnings by predetermined factors such as total
or average wage growth to adjust for changes in prices, wage levels, or economic growth. In pay‐
as‐you‐go systems, pensions are usually based on some percentage of average wage. This

                                                30
average wage is calculated over some period of time, ranging from full‐career average to last
salary. If the period for which earnings history enters into the benefit formula is longer than the
last salary, the actual wages earned are usually revalued to adjust for these types of changes.

Vesting period. The minimum amount of time required to qualify for full and irrevocable
ownership of pension benefits.

Abstract

This paper summarizes key design characteristics and performance indicators of national and
civil service pension schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is intended to serve as a resource
in pension reform efforts in the region. The paper delivers an up-to date assessment of the main
design parameters, key performance metrics, and main challenges facing pension systems in SSA.
The information provided in the paper aims to capture current trends in the region and benchmark
performance and pension system design choices made by countries against international experience.
Section I provides an overview of mandatory national pension systems in the region whereas
Section II presents the key design features of civil service pension schemes. Section III analyzes
the performance of both national and civil service pension schemes; particular attention is paid
to the fiscal performance and equity of the pension schemes. Pension system design parameters
of both national and civil service pension schemes are discussed in section IV. Section V aims to
enhance the note by providing relevant demographic data and analysis.
