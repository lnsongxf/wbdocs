                              Earth’s ecosystems have provided humans with goods and
                              services for millennia. Every one of us depends in one way or
                              another on renewable natural resources to fulfill basic needs
                              like food and water, the maintenance of healthy crops, as well
                              as climate regulation and disease control. Nature has also
                              provided spiritual fulfilment and aesthetic enjoyment to
                              millions around the world.

Dr. Naoko Ishii               The ecosystems that have supported human development over

                              capita by a growing human population is putting enormous
                              pressure on many of these systems. Environmental indicators
                              continue to decline, and some of these systems no longer
                              provide sufficient resources to sustain previously stable human
                              populations and cultures. The degradation in the health of some
                              of these ecosystems is so severe that they are approaching the
                              point were recovery will be difficult, expensive and time
                              consuming. These trends must be reversed.

                              The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has engaged in
                              pioneering development of mechanisms that reward good
                              stewardship of natural resources, including the structuring of
                              Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes. For the GEF,
                              the concept of PES includes a variety of arrangements through
                              which the beneficiaries of ecosystem services compensate
                              those providing the services. This publication summarizes
                              the investments of GEF in PES from a variety of institutional,
                              thematic and geographic perspectives. The publication
                              also highlights some of the trends and opportunities for the
                              establishment of PES schemes to generate global environmental
                              benefits. Investments have ranged from global projects aiming
                              at building the human and institutional capacity necessary to
                              establish PES schemes, to stand-alone agreements between
                              buyers and sellers in watersheds of high biodiversity value.

                              supporting in PES schemes in an effort to provide solutions to
                              reverse the current degradation of Earth’s life support systems,
                              while at the same time allow humans to explore the full
                              potential of their natural and cultural inheritance.

     Services at GEF                      The following review is based on an analysis of 57 GEF
                                          projects in which PES is the core objective of the project
                                          or there is an explicit PES component/subcomponent in
                                          the project’s design. These 57 projects were chosen
                                          through a screening of the results frameworks of more
                                          than 500 GEF projects in GEF-1 to –5, which were in turn
                                          selected from the GEF Project Management Information

                                          57 projects include most of those in the FAO publication

                                          review (UNEP’s Division for GEF Coordination). This
                                          report does not cover GEF investments in financial
                                          mechanisms such as trust funds, ecotourism or
                                          certification schemes, unless there is an explicit reference
                                          to PES.


                                          GEF investments in PES projects have been significant.
                                          GEF has invested $70 million in 14 projects where PES is
                                          central to the project’s design, and leveraged an
                                          additional $395 million in co-financing. GEF has also
                                          supported 15 projects where PES is part of the project
                                          design but not a core element (GEF $73 million and $281
                                          million in co-financing), and another 28 projects where
                                          PES is only a minor element in the project (GEF $82
                                          million and $918 million in co-financing). Only a very small
                                          portion of the budget for projects in these last two
                                          groups targeted the PES elements.

                                        Strategy in particular. The goal of the Biodiversity Focal
                                        Area is “the conservation and sustainable use of biodiver-

                                        Biodiversity Strategy encompasses four complementary
                                        and mutually reinforcing objectives:

                                        The GEF’s Biodiversity Focal Area Strategy makes explicit
                                        reference to PES as a mechanism to help achieve two of
                                        its Objectives: 1) the Sustainable Financing of Protected
                                        Area Systems at the National Level and 2) Fostering
                                        Markets for Biodiversity Goods and Services. In these two
                                        strategic programs, the GEF supports the design and
                                        implementation of PES schemes as revenue mechanisms
                                        to support biodiversity conservation in protected areas
                                        and to compensate resource managers for off-site ecolog-

                                        compatible land-use practices. The GEF Biodiversity
                                        Strategy also calls for the strengthening of the terrestrial
                                        protected area network as a way to cover gaps in areas
                                        that provide the ecosystem services that support life in
                                        terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments alike.

                                        The GEF has provided financial resources for PES projects
                                        across focal areas since the early 1990s, using a variety of
                                        thematic and geographic approaches. There has been a sig-
                                        nificant shift during GEF-5 towards projects and programs
                                        which seek to achieve multi-global environmental benefits
                                        by combining resources from more than one focal area to
                                        achieve greater impact, in a more integrated manner. A spe-
                                        cific example is the SFM/REDD+ Program which is used to
                                        coalesce and augment MFA investments in transformative
                                        initiatives in forests that deliver multiple global environmen-

                                        sustainable forest management. The SFM/REDD+ Program
                                        include the establishment of PES as a core output.

                   Approaches to Projects
                   on PES
Portfolio Review
    and Analysis   The GEF portfolio of PES projects varies widely with
                   regard to the approach used to establish and implement
                   PES schemes. The GEF has funded a number of projects
                   to build the human and institutional capacity required by
                   stakeholders to develop and implement PES schemes, at
                   global, national and local scales. In addition to building
                   individual and institutional capacity, some projects have
                   targeted the economic valuation of ecosystem services, or
                   the development and implementation of pilot PES
                   schemes financed either by governments or by arrange-
                   ments between buyers and sellers.



                   GLOBAL PES PROJECTS

                   The GEF has supported PES project at a global scale,
                   because there are a number of components on building
                   institutional and human capacities for developing PES
                   schemes that are a common to many in countries with the
                   potential of delivering ecosystem services. Participating
                   countries also benefit from these global projects, as there
                   are economies of scale, including capacity for aggregat-
                   ing and disseminating lessons learned.

                   In addition to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the
                   GEF is supporting four global projects, two of which focus

                   for Ecosystem Services and UNEP’s Project for Ecosystem
                   Services—ProEcoServ.

                   Institutionalizing Payments for Ecosystem Services is a
                   global project with emphasis on tropical America and
                   South and East Africa. This project seeks to make informa-
                   tion on PES available to all stakeholders by means of the
                   “ecosystem marketplace,” improve capacity for institu-
                   tional and policy development, and deliver operational
                   models to design, establish and implement schemes for
                   payment for biodiversity conservation in agricultural land-
                   scapes. The project also targets business models for bio-
                   diversity offsets, PES for biodiversity in forest enterprises,
                   and PES assessment tools for coastal and marine habitats.

     Summary of
                     of a significant number of PES schemes around the world.

                     exchange for Global Environmental Benefits. The screening
Portfolio Analysis   of 500 projects in the GEF Project Management
                     Information System (PMIS) showed that there are 42
                     projects which either have PES as the main objective of
                     the project (14 projects), or which have a PES component
                     built into the architecture of the project (43 projects) GEF
                     is also investing in other financial mechanisms such as
                     trust funds, ecotourism and certification schemes of
                     terrestrial, freshwater and marine biological resources.
                     The REDD+ agenda is supported with a growing portfolio
                     under the SFM multi-focal area program.



                     Project Design
                     GEF has supported projects where the level of effort and
                     geographical scope vary widely. The GEF has financed
                     projects where PES schemes are at the center of the proj-
                     ect, or PES is a component of a larger project.

                     For the projects where PES is the main objective, the aim
                     has been to build human and institutional capacity to
                     deliver PES schemes or to develop and implement
                     national PES schemes, such as in Costa Rica and Mexico.

                     When PES is not the main objective of the project, but is
                     considered in the design, there are two types of projects:
                     those in which there is an explicit set of activities in pursuit
                     of a PES scheme and those in which PES is mentioned as
                     an optional financial mechanism for conservation.

                     For the first group, there is a specific plan that includes activi-
                     ties such as modifying the policy and regulatory frameworks
                     to make PES schemes viable, building human and institu-
                     tional capacity, or setting up and implementing pilot PES
                     schemes, many in watersheds. In many cases these projects
                     are utilizing PES as a tool for effecting change in manage-
                     ment practices of land managers and local users. Within
                     these the projects may be setting up the PES mechanism
                     and also acting as the initial buyer of the environmental ser-
                     vices in order to jump start the PES in the absence of a ready
                     market or easily identifiable service buyer.
