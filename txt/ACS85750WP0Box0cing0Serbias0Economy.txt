                                   Executive Summary
Serbia’s economy is out of balance and performing below its potential. Since the post-
Yugoslavian transition, Serbia’s economy has been running on one engine, the non-tradable
sector and expansion of domestic demand. This was financed with ample capital inflows, which
were sharply reduced since 2008 as the global economic crisis escalated. While this
consumption-led growth produced some improvements in living standards, it was not sustainable
and created hardly any formal jobs. This explains why Serbia’s job market is also out of balance.
Less than half of the working-age population has a job at all, and among those that are formally
employed, almost half are employed in the public sector.
Serbia needs to start the other growth engine – exports. In a small middle-income economy
exports should drive economic activity, a strategy which successful emerging markets have
embraced. Serbia can significantly increase its exports, especially to the large next-door market
of the EU. However, Serbia’s exports are very low by regional standards, clearl y indicating lack
of competitiveness. Serbia has a comparative advantage in agriculture and food products,
machinery, electronics, the automotive sector, and ICT. It also maintains a manufacturing base
in textiles, apparel, and leather. Competitors from new member states of the EU have higher
labor costs than Serbia, but have gained a competitive edge through strong international
integration and much higher labor productivity. To build on its comparative advantage, Serbia
will need to accelerate structural reforms of its economy.
Lack of competitiveness and weak exports are a consequence of low productivity and
insufficient investment, in particular in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing is the most
important exporting sector; yet for over a decade it has been underperforming greatly. Since
2000, the sector grew by less than 1 percent annually, which resulted in its relative decline.
Manufacturing today is below 20 percent of GDP, much lower than in more successful new
member states of the EU, where productivity in manufacturing is also more than double
compared to Serbia. Low productivity is directly linked with low investment: FDI to Serbia is
lower than in regional peers, and further more about three quarters of FDI went to non-tradable
sectors of the economy.
All investors, and especially large-scale ones, need stability and predictability. Most export
industries, particularly manufacturing, is lumpy and entail large-scale investments which will
only pay-off in the medium-term. This is why these investors will only come if they can expect a
certain degree of stability with respect to the economic fundamentals and a relatively smooth
process of starting and expanding a business, especially if they need to construct buildings and
factories. These are the areas where Serbia is particularly weak. Excessive regulatory burdens
add to the costs of production and exports, unclear land use policies inhibit investment, and the
current tax system does not make it worthwhile to hire low-medium skilled workers.
Complicated procedures and an opaque regulatory environment enable vested interests to
engage in rent seeking, while reducing incentives for rule-abiding long-term investment. To
start transforming its economy, Serbia will also have to reduce the power of vested interests.
These thrive when regulations are too burdensome, unclear or unpredictable, creating conditions
for unfair access and corruption to trump sensible business logic. The best way to reduce the
influence of vested interests is to simplify regulatory environment, reduce room for discretion
and ensure fully consistent implementation of regulations.
The new Government, which was elected on the basis of a strong pro-reform mandate, laid
out a vision to make Serbia a modern and economically competitive country. To start the

                                               1
export engine, the new government expressed its commitment to a substantial reform program.
This note identifies three priority areas and a set of specific measures which complement other
important reforms, especially those related to improving the country’s macroeconomic and fiscal
position. The proposed reforms would make it easier to invest, operate a business, and create
jobs. The measures could be implemented within a relatively short period of time, since many of
them build on the existing initiatives and address well identified problems (see table below for
the list of priority measures and expected impacts).
Priority area 1 – Making it easier to operate businesses, by reducing excessive
administrative burdens and making regulatory environment predictable. Serbia’s business
environment ranks 93rd out of 189 economies in the 2014 Doing Business report. This ranking
is below most countries in the region (22nd out of 26 ECA countries), and lower than what is
expected based on GDP per capita. An unfavorable business environment has a negative impact
on the day-to-day transactions of companies, and reduces incentives for long-term investments.
This undermines export potential. In order to become an attractive destination for export-oriented
investments, several measures need to be implemented. These include: accelerate and complete
the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform, and other similar initiatives; reduce red tape by
introducing E-Government; promptly ensure full functionality of the Central Registry of
Compulsory Social Insurance; introduce clarity and predictability in para-fiscal charges and fees;
strengthen the Better Regulation Unit; initiate reforms in the inspections system.
Priority area 2 – Making it easier to invest and expand business, by improving planning
and construction permits procedures. Problems with land management remain a major issue
affecting both business entry and resource allocation. In particular, Serbia ranks extremely
poorly on Dealing with Construction Permits (182nd out of 189 countries in the 2014 Doing
Business). Deep structural issues in the management of land and security of property rights must
be addressed. Reforms to facilitate accelerated structural transformation should include:
streamline the construction permitting process by introducing benchmarks and accountability;
complete the missing municipal plans and prepare rule books and planning manuals; implement
flexible safeguard measures; introduce one-stop shops on construction permits in municipalities;
streamline procedures related to the conversion from use rights to property rights.
Priority area 3 – Making it viable to create formal sector jobs, by reducing labor market
costs and rigidities. Serbia faces two main challenges related to jobs. First, it must create jobs
for the mid- and older generation of workers, mostly low productivity and flexible. In Serbia,
the employment rate peaks at low age, at around 35, and decreases quickly. Also, companies in
Serbia employ much fewer low skilled workers than in peer countries. This indicates that
employing older, low skilled workers is economically unviable. Reforms should ensure that the
mid and older generation and less skilled workers can benefit from the spillover effects of a
competitive private sector. Second, youth unemployment is among the highest in Europe and
policies must ensure that the youth entering the job market have skills to pursue career paths that
will lead them to higher productivity jobs, and become the entrepreneurs of the future. To
overcome these challenges, key labor market reforms must include the following: reform
severance pay regulation to better enable the hiring of older workers so that severance payments
are based on tenure with the firm, and not the entire work history; facilitate the creation of mini
and midi-jobs by abolishing the minimum social security contribution and by allowing for more
flexible work arrangements in the labor code; facilitate own-account work and micro-
entrepreneurship; and facilitate school-to-work transition for the younger group.

   1. Overview of Serbia’s Economy and Main Challenges

Serbia’s economy is out of balance

Serbia’s economy remains fundamentally out of balance, with important reforms
significantly lagging. The objective of this policy note is to review Serbia’s key constraints
impeding economic competitiveness, and to help Serbia rebalance an economy which has a lot of
potential. The new Serbian government will have an opportunity to make Serbia a fully
functioning market economy with a vibrant private sector. In order to do so, it must address
overdue reforms which many Eastern European, and other emerging countries have embarked on
over a decade ago.

The economy needs to shift from consumption to exports. Foreign markets are critical as they
provide deep demand for competitive products and services. This expansion of private sector-led
exports needs to happen in parallel with a gradual downsizing of the public sector. Therefore,
both economic growth and job creation needs to happen in the private sector. Creating favorable
business conditions to nurture a competitive private sector should be the priority of the economic
policy. Currently, the private sector in Serbia is relatively weak and not competitive. Only 60
percent of GDP comes from the private sector which is below other countries of the region where
the private sectors drives at least 75 percent of the economy (see EBRD Transition Report
indicators). Also, only 23% of the working age population has jobs in formal private sector.

Creating conditions for job creation in the private sector needs to be a priority for
economic policy. Since the global crisis escalated, a significant number of jobs in Serbia were
lost, and unemployment remains high at over 20 percent. Just before the crisis, in 2007/08 the
total number of employed people in Serbia was around 2.7 million. Since then, the number of
employed has dropped sharply, both in the formal and informal part of the economy. As of
October 2013, the total number of employed people in Serbia was around 2.3 million. Although
precise data is not available, the vast majority of job losses have been in the private sector.

Job market is very unfavorable, with large segment of population inactive and significant
chunk of active population employed in the public sector (Figure 1). Serbia has very low
employment and activity rates, with large segment of population economically inactive. In 2013
employment rate of the working age population was just 47 percent, compared with the average
employment rate of 62 percent for new member states of the EU (Figure 2). The structure of
employment is unfavorable, with almost half of the people with formal employment working in
the public sector. About one-third of formal jobs in the private sector are at sole proprietorships,
which are typically low productivity and low wages jobs. The current structure of the labor
market and significant fiscal constraints that the public sector is facing, it is clear that vast
majority of new jobs will need to come from the private sector.

Many inactive and unemployed have low levels of education and skills, yet low-wage jobs
are highly taxed and firms employ relatively little low-skilled labor in production.
Comparing Serbian firms to other Eastern European countries reveals that they use significantly
less unskilled labor: the share of unskilled workers in production is 14.2% while the ECA
average is 23.8%.1 One likely explanation is that Serbia has a relatively high tax wedge on low-
wage earners (Figure 3). The main reason for the high tax wedge is the minimum social security
contribution, which is set at about 40 percent of the average wage. This means that anyone
earning less than 40 percent of average wage, including part-time workers, have to pay social
security in the same amount as a full time worker at 40 percent of average wage, This makes any
formal part-time work unviable, but also makes full time work below 40 percent of average wage
relatively expensive and could deter firm from employing more unskilled labor. Yet, it is exactly
these low-paying (part-time) jobs that would be suitable for the large pool of unemployed and
inactive population.

Growing on “one engine”

Serbia began its transition to a market economy late, and under difficult circumstances. In
the 1990s, a lost decade for Serbia, the economy was devastated by regional conflicts,
international sanctions, and trade shocks following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. By
2000, the recorded GDP fell to below one-half of its 1989 level2, while other Central and Eastern
European countries had made significant progress on the transition path. In 2001, the new
government launched an ambitious reform program for a rapid transition to a more market-
oriented economy, normalization of relations with foreign creditors, and integration with
regional, European Union (EU) and world markets.

 1980s was also a difficult decade economically, with almost no growth in the aftermath of oil crisis and increased
pressure of debt service.

                                                                                                                                                                                                           6
During the first period of transition (2001-2008), the economy grew at a solid pace of 5
percent annually, but this growth was not accompanied by necessary competitiveness
enhancing adjustments. Growth was based largely on domestic demand and in particular
consumption. The expansion of non-tradable sectors contributed more than 80 percent of
growth. This model was financed by ample capital inflows, mostly in the form of increased
private debt, which further fueled the demand. Large capital inflows also contributed to
appreciation pressures. Fiscal policy added to the imbalances, as the budget was in deficits
almost consistently from 2000-2008. The consequence of this growth model can best be seen in
the growing current account deficit, which reached over 20 percent of GDP in 2008. The
outbreak of the global economic crisis and sudden drop in available financing made it apparent
that this type of growth was unsustainable. With financing likely to be constrained, consumption
has leveled off, and limited growth can be expected from the domestic market (Figure 4).

Composition of the GDP changed significantly: even though the economy was growing,
tradable sectors such as manufacturing were lagging behind (Figure 5). Real industrial
output from 2000-2008 grew by just 2 percent per year, at well below the overall economy
average of 5 percent. The share of manufacturing in value-added fell from around one quarter, to
less than one fifth, much lower than in successful new member states of the EU. For more than
one decade, there were significant job losses in manufacturing. About half of the manufacturing
jobs have been lost since 2000.

Sharp job losses in manufacturing reflect a delayed adjustment to output losses during the
1990s (Figure 6). During the 1990s, industrial output contracted by about 60 percent in real
terms, and driven by sanctions, the breakup of Yugoslavia, the loss of markets, and the collapse
of supply chains. However, the number of employed was reduced much less than the output
(mainly as a consequence of the adoption of a decree which prohibited the dismissal of workers
in the period of sanctions3). As a result, at the beginning of 2000s, employment and output were

3
  Decrease in employment was mostly due to retirements. During the 1990s early retirement was fairly common and
it contributed significantly to large increase in number of pensioners during the decade, with very unfavorable
consequences for the fiscal sustainability in the 2000s.

                                                                                             7
completely out of balance, and productivity was very low. Further exacerbating the problem was
the fact that during the 1990s, there was very little, if any, investment in upgrading technology.
The opening up of former Eastern bloc countries, and rapid growth of China and other East
Asian countries meant that Serbian companies were faced with very different and much more
competitive international environment.

A full rebound in industrial employment is highly unlikely. In order for manufacturing to
regain competitiveness, productivity needs to increase significantly. Although some gains in
employment can be expected, full recovery is not compatible with strong increases in
productivity. However, increase in productivity and output in manufacturing has a strong spill-
over and multiplying effect. Manufacturing, in particular in large companies, integrates various
other supply chains and generates demand for various inputs from the rest of the economy.
Improving productivity and increasing output in manufacturing should be a high priority.

  Imbalances were further aggravated by slow progress in structural reforms

  While Serbia made clear progress early in its transition, “reform fatigue” set in earlier
  than in other transition economies. Transition effectively started in 2000, much later than most
  of the other Central and Eastern European economies. Given the heritage of the Yugoslav era,
  Serbia’s starting position was on average, slightly better than in the new member states of the EU
  when they started their transition (Figure 7). Early in the transition, the progress of reforms in
  Serbia was comparable to that of the EU10. Momentum seems to have been lost relatively early,
  and the pace of reforms in Serbia has since been slow. At the end of the first decade of transition,
  Serbia was behind the EU10 average at a similar point in their transitions, as measured by the
  EBRD’s Transition Indicators (Figure 8).

  Slow progress in structural reforms and limited FDI inflows

  Poor performance of manufacturing and other tradable sectors is in large part a
  consequence of weak FDI inflows to these sectors (Figure 9). Overall FDI inflows to Serbia
  are relatively modest, as the stock of FDI per capita is less than one-third of that in more
  successful than Central European countries4. Additionally, about three-quarters of cumulative
  FDI inflows from 2000-2012 went to non-tradable sectors, and one-quarter to tradable sectors.
  This unfavorable composition of FDI inflows is likely a reflection of a volatile and uncertain
  business environment. When the business environment is uncertain, investments tend to flow to
  sectors which can generate relatively fast returns. This typically includes telecoms, trade, and in
  case of Serbia financial sector (which at the beginning of the decade was completely
  undeveloped and offered exceptionally high rates of return). The opposite of these is

manufacturing, which can also generate substantial returns, but over a much longer time period,
and hence requires a stable and predictable business environment. Low inflows into the tradable
sectors are also a consequence of a strong appreciation trend, which made these sectors less
competitive.

Exports are improving, but still lag behind regional peers

Exports remain low compared to regional peers due to unresolved structural problems and
modest investments in tradable sectors. For a small open economy geographically located
near a large market, exports are the most promising way for sustainable growth. This is even
more relevant since Serbia’s already small market will likely stagnate during the recovery from
the economic crisis. While there has been improvement over the last several years, exports are
well below regional peers, and significantly below some of the global leaders (Figure 10).

Large and expensive public sector is hampering private sector growth

The public sector remains large, has a significant role in the economy and is adversely
impacting the incentives. Currently, there are about 900,000 people employed in the public
sector. This accounts for over 19% of the working age population, and as much as one-third of
the active population. Large public sector also creates wrong incentives, as jobs in the public
sector are more attractive than jobs offered in the private sector. Public sector job security is
much higher, and benefits are relatively generous. The average public sector wage is
consistently higher than the private sector wage by about 20 percent. In some SOE’s, the
average wage was twice as high as the private sector average (Figure 11). Significant
discrepancies in job security and wage level between the public and private sector distorts labor
market incentives. A recent survey conducted by a local think-tank found that out of 1,002
representative respondents asked about their work preferences, 65 percent said their ideal job is
in public sector, 5 percent said they would prefer to be employed in the private sector, and 30
percent said they would like to run their own business

      2. Productivity and Competitiveness of Serbian Enterprises: A Sector-
         level Analysis


This section offers analysis on the labor reallocation process and productivity growth from
2007-2012.5 Drawing on Structural Business Statistics (SBS) dataset6, the main objective is to
answer four questions. 1. What are the recent trends for sector productivity and employment
shifts? 2. Was the labor reallocation process conducive to productivity growth? 3. What are the
leading sectors in labor productivity growth, and how does the Serbian economy fare against its
peers? 4. Have wages outgrown apparent labor productivity growth?

Employment in manufacturing continues to decrease, while it is increasing in services
sector in the 2007–2012 period. Evidence drawing form SBS data (which excludes agriculture
activities) shows that about 79,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing (a decrease of about 18
percent) in the 2007-12 period. The number jobs in services sectors has increased by about
17,000 (an increase of about 3 percent), particularly in wholesale and retail; professional and
technical activities; and administrative services.

This reallocation of labor has not been conducive to productivity growth of the overall
economy. SBS data shows that the overall economy has showed an incipient productivity growth
in this period: 0.74% annually (Figure 12). Results show that the main determinant of this
slightly positive performance was mainly the result of how productivity fares in each individual
sector. The contribution arising from structural change (reallocation of labor across sectors) was
showed to be negative which suggests the labor reallocation from manufacturing to services was
not productivity enhancing (Figure 12).

During the same period, the manufacturing industry experienced relatively high
productivity growth, while productivity in services has decreased. In both of these
industries, the reallocation of labor across (sub) sectors was not productivity enhancing,
which means that labor has been, on average, moving towards less productive activities,
both within manufacturing and within services During the observed period, productivity in
manufacturing was increasing at an average rate of 4.76 percent annually (Figure 12). The
within-sector productivity was the largest contributor for this positive performance of
manufacturing, while the structural change, again, has played a negative role. This suggests that
the labor reallocation process - even within the manufacturing industry - was not productivity
enhancing. Some of the surplus labor shifted into low productivity sectors in 2012; this includes
the manufacturing of apparel; wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; articles
of straw and plaiting materials; printing and reproduction of recorded media; and fabricated
metal products, except machinery and equipment. There are some exceptions however. Some of
the surplus labor generated within the manufacturing industry shifted to high productivity sectors
in 2012, as such the manufacturing of food products; manufacture of basic pharmaceutical
products and pharmaceutical preparations; and manufacture of rubber and plastic products. For
services, productivity has decreased 1.65% annually, and again, labor has moved, on average, to

low productivity sectors, which explains again the negative contribution of the “structural
change” component to productivity growth in the services industry.

Despite improvements in manufacturing productivity, Serbia is still significantly lagging
behind regional competitors. Growth of productivity in manufacturing in Serbia has been at
about the average of regional competitors. With a 4.76 percent annual growth rate, productivity
has been improving faster than in countries like Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland or Romania,
but significantly slower than in Bulgaria or Slovakia (Figure 13). However, the achieved
productivity level is significantly below comparator countries. Despite recent improvements,
productivity level of Serbian manufacturing is at about 40 percent of that in countries like
Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia, though it is comparable to Bulgaria and Romania
(Figure 14).

One major sector where Serbia is closer to regional competitors is food production. Food
production is the largest subsector of manufacturing, and accounts for almost one-fifth of
employment and value-added in manufacturing. Growth of productivity in food production in
Serbia has been among the highest in the region (Figure 15). This has helped to reduce the gap
with regional peers, which however still remains significant. Productivity level in food
production in Serbia is about 65 percent of top regional peers, much better than for the overall
manufacturing (Figure 16). It should be noted that food production is the sector which has
largely been privatized, and this likely explains the comparatively better performance.

          Cost competitiveness in manufacturing (as measured by unit labor costs) has been
          improving recently. From 2007–2012, the rise in manufacturing labor costs was lower than
          productivity growth, on average (Figure 17). As a result, unit labor costs have been improving,
          and in 2012 they were about 20 percent lower (in real terms) than in 20077. Few broad sectors,
          besides manufacturing, were also able to improve competitiveness from 2007–2012 (Figure 17).
          Other nuances are revealed when the cross-sector differences are explored. Figure 18 compares
          the growth rates since 2007, of (real) apparent labor productivity, and (real) unit labor cost for
          manufacturing sectors in Serbia.

Box 1: Automotive Industries in Serbia and Slovakia

Since recent major investment by Fiat in Serbia has become fully operational, automotives have become
an increasingly important industry. Fiat is already Serbia’s largest exporter, and various suppliers are
developing around the Fiat plant. As this investment is new, details are not yet captured in Structural
Business Statistics used in the rest of this section. To provide an early assessment on the impact of this
investment and its potential, this box 1 summarizes some key results of Fiat in 2013. It also provides a
comparison with Slovakia, a country that is similar in size to Serbia, and is a European leader in cars
produced, relative to population.

Notes: Data for Slovakia are for 2012 and for Serbia for 2013. Sources for data on Serbia are Fiat company reports, Statistical
Office and Ministry of Finance. Source for Slovakia data is a report on automotive industry by Slovakia Investment and Trade
Development Agency.

Car production in Slovakia has rebounded and accelerated after the first wave of the global economic
crisis. Three major producers in Slovakia produced a record level of over 900,000 cars in 2012. As the
table shows, labor productivity (measured by cars produced/employee in plants) in Serbia and Slovakia is
very similar, while labor costs in Serbia are lower than in Slovakia. This indicates that the Serbian
automotive industry is competitive and has significant potential for growth. There are factors other than
productivity and cost competitiveness that determine the performance of an industry. Slovakia has an
advantage in physical proximity to major export markets, infrastructure, more accumulated experience
and technical knowledge). Car exports from Slovakia are ten times higher than Serbia’s, giving an
indication of potential. The table shows major importance for the broader economy of the supplier
networks and spillovers. In Slovakia, total employment in the sector is more than 4 times higher than in
the plants themselves. This indicates and demonstrates that developments in the Serbian automotive
industry could grow considerably if the proper policies are implemented to improve the investment
climate.

         3. Serbia’s Export Performance

      Exports have been improving though from a low base, with the EU main export market

      Serbia’s merchandise exports have been growing over previous decade, though they are
      still low by regional standards. After a crisis related drop in 2009, exports have been steadily
      improving, and in 2013 have reached a record level of EUR 11 billion, or about 34 percent of
      GDP. However, despite this solid growth they still remain relatively low compared to regional
      peers (as discussed in Section 1 and shown on Figure 10).

      Exports to the EU represent about 60 percent of total exports and are growing fast. Serbia’s
      trade has shifted towards the EU, and away from its regional partners in the Balkans. Exports to
      the EU have doubled over the previous four years. In 2013, EUR6.9 billion worth of goods were
      exported to the EU (Figure 19). Serbia also imports mostly from the EU, though the imports
      have been growing much slower over the previous several years. A consequence of large and fast
      growing exports, the trade deficit with the EU is steadily declining. An important region for
      foreign trade is CEFTA, as Serbia maintains a consistent trade surplus with the region (Figure
      20). Exports to Russia and other CIS countries have also been growing very fast, though from a
      much smaller base.

      The advancement of Serbia’s integration into the EU provides both opportunities and
      challenges with respect to its external trade position. Subsequent to the adoption of the
      European Partnership with Serbia in 2008, and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and
      Association Agreement in September 2013, Serbia and the EU held their first round of formal
      accession negotiations in January 2014. Eventual full membership in the EU will further
      advance the integration of Serbia into the wider European economy, commence the eligibility of
      Serbia for EU structural funds, and alter the trade relations between Serbia and those of its
      regional neighbors, which are not yet members of the EU.

Serbia has several sectors with good potential for further growth

Serbia has a revealed comparative advantage in several important sectors and other sectors
are improving rapidly (Table 1). A “revealed comparative advantage” (RCA) means that
Serbia’s share of world exports in that category exceeds Serbia’s share of total world export.
Serbia has a revealed comparative advantage that is particularly evident in agriculture and food
products; this is followed by textiles, apparel, leather, and until recently iron and steel. The most
rapidly growing categories of exports from 2007-2012 were primary agriculture and
machinery/electronics/transportation equipment.          Exports of machinery, electronics, and
transport equipment are growing rapidly, and now represent the largest broad category of
Serbia’s merchandise exports. The rising RCA of this category suggests that Serbia now has a
comparative advantage in sub-categories of machinery, electronics, and transport equipment.
Demand for Serbian iron, steel, and metal products, a traditional strong area, has been declining.

Serbia has had success introducing new export products in established markets, but some
old products in established markets have disappeared. Similar to most countries, Serbia’s
export growth takes place primarily on the intensive margin (selling more old products to old
markets). The extensive margin (selling products to markets in new ways) shows both positive
and negative dynamics. The share of export growth consisting of product diversification in
established markets is higher than any of its nine comparator countries, at 84.8 percent (Table
2).8 This indicates that Serbia has been able to broaden the geographical scope of some of its
already existing exports. However, the rate of product extinction in existing markets is higher
than any of its competitor countries, except Bulgaria, at 43.8 percent. This indicates that in many
established markets, Serbia’s exports in some categories have been entirely crowded out by
competitors. The ability to maintain a presence in foreign markets varies widely across sectors.
Further analytical work could identify the characteristics of products and markets for which
Serbia is able to extend the geographical scope of its exports, as compared to those where it is
retreating.

Serbia’s export relationships have a lower survival rate than those of comparator
countries. Only 41.2 percent of Serbia’s export relationships survive into the following year,
and only 22.6 percent for three years9. By comparison, Poland has a 55.7 percent survival rate of
export relationships for one year, and 35.7 percent for three years (Figure 21). Continued
analytical work could help to identify sector variations in survival, and in the extensive and
intensive margins, which in turn may help to identify factors inhibiting competitiveness of
Serbia’s exports. A low rate of export survival could indicate weaknesses in the marketing
capacity of Serbian exporters or in their financing, volatility or uncertainty in the domestic
economic or institutional environment facing Serbia’s exporters, or similar factors.

 An export relationship is defined as the export of a particular narrowly defined (HS-6) product to a particular
country (e.g. bowling balls to Bulgaria).

                                                                            19
In the pre-crisis period, much of Serbia’s export growth was due to overall global growth. In
the post crisis period, most of the growth is due to increased competiveness

Export market share growth between 2006-Q1 and 2013-Q1 increased at an average
annual rate of 1.6 percent. As shown in Table 3, in the pre-crisis period (2006Q1-2008Q2)
there was a slightly negative growth rate of market share of -0.1 percent. Market factors in the
pre-crisis period were favorable for Serbia, largely offsetting the negative influence of sector
composition of exports and negative push factors. Conversely, in the post-crisis period (2010Q3-
2013Q1), market factors were unfavorable. This is because the EU (Serbia’s main export
market), has been recovering significantly slower than other regions of the world. However,
“push” factors (broadly speaking, reflect competitiveness) have been favorable and completely
offset the negative market trends. It is likely that improved unit labor costs (as demonstrated in
Section 3), linked with significant real depreciation in the aftermath of the crisis, was the major
driver of improved competitiveness.

Although sophistication of exports is improving, it still remains low compared to regional
peers

The quality of many of Serbia’s exports (as measured by unit values), is relatively low
compared to its peers, though there are some important exceptions. Differences in quality
among different varieties of similar products can be proxied by unit values of export. For many
of Serbia’s products, quality thus measured is lagging compared to its peers, particularly so for
exports in the category of iron, steel, and other metals. Serbia’s measured quality level is also
low for some key agricultural exports, such as frozen fruits, nuts and raw sugar. By contrast,
exports of mechanical and electrical goods are of high quality. This suggests that the shift in

   A country’s export market share growth is driven by export “push” factors, as opposed to “pull” factors, i.e.
market and sectoral export composition (a country’s export composition can be influenced by both demand and
supply side factors). This helps countries identify which factors are driving their export market share growth in
comparison to their competitors. Two countries may have similarly competitive bundles of export firms, but export
market share growth of one country will be higher in the short- to medium-term because this has a more favorable
composition in terms of export markets and sectors. “Push” factors, on the other hand, describe a country’s own
supply-side capacity to expand export market shares, assuming equal market and sectoral export composition across
all countries. “Push” factors are further decomposed into volume (quantity) and price factors (unit values). For
background information regarding the underlying methodologies and data, see Gaulier, Santoni, Taglioni, and
Zignago (2013): http://worldbank/trade.

exports, away from metals toward machinery and electronics, is partly explained by the ability of
Serbia to maintain or improve quality in some sectors relative to others.

Exports of manufactured intermediate goods are becoming increasingly important; this is
an indication that Serbian firms are increasingly participating in global value chains. The
share of manufactured exports consisting of intermediate goods increased from 14.9 percent in
2002, to 22.5 percent in 2012 (Figure 22). This increase suggests that Serbian firms are
increasingly participating in global value chains for the production of complex products. This
trend is consistent with the growing exports of machinery, electronics and transportation
equipment, since there are many intermediate goods in this category (Table 1, above) but
includes other products as well. Participation in exports of manufactured intermediates grew
faster than any of its comparators except Romania and Bulgaria.           In 2012, the share of
intermediates for Serbia was in the middle of the range for its comparators, significantly higher
than Greece, Latvia, Lithuania or Ukraine, but not as high as Hungary, Poland, or Romania.

Exports of services are increasingly important

Exports of services are at a normal level for its stage of development, and are growing at a
healthy rate. The degree to which a country engages in exporting services is strongly associated
with its level of development. Serbia’s current level of services exports are at the level expected
for its per capita income (Figure 23). Serbia’s service exports/GDP ratio in fact equals or
exceeds that of some of its comparator countries with a significantly higher per capita income
(Portugal, and Poland). The growth of service exports from 2007-2012, at 4.7 percent annually,
is in the middle of the range for comparator countries (Table 4).

Serbia has a strong comparative advantage in communication services and an additional
comparative advantage in transport services. Communications services comprise 51 percent
of services exports. This is a very high level compared to its comparator countries in the region,
and equaled only by Hungary (Figure 24). This is significant because communication services,
along with other modern business services, are important in the process of promoting innovation
and productivity in manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors. By contrast, the service sector
of a country specialized in travel services (e.g. Croatia, Bulgaria) is likely to have fewer linkages
to the rest of the economy. Measuring revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in the same
manner as was done for goods above, Serbia has a strong RCA in communication services and a
secondary one in transport services (Figure 25).

Box 2: An Overview of the IT Sector in Serbia
Trends
The IT industry officially employed 15 thousand workers. Majority of them, about 40 percent, are
employed at micro-companies, small companies employ 28 percent, medium-sized companies employ 23
percent, and large companies employ 10 percent of IT workers.11 It is estimated that in total there are
about 50 thousand ICT specialist working in Serbia (even though the IT industry officially employs 15
thousand people). In their study on the Belgrade Service Sector, CEVES estimated that the productivity
of ICT companies was higher than any other business sector in Serbia, and more than three times higher
than the Serbian average12.

Total IT market value peaked in 2008, at EUR545 million. Market value decreased to EUR410 million in
2012. According to the study “ICT in Serbia 2013” by DAAD, the market can be segmented into:
- IT services (EUR113.5 million total revenue)
- Software (EUR55.6 million)
- Hardware (EUR241.5 million)

It is very difficult to attain reliable figures on income, particularly for the outsourcing sector. According
to research done by SIEPA, Serbian IT developers are the best paid workers in Serbia, but still
competitive with respect to EU competitors. The average gross monthly salaries for developers are:
- Junior Programmer (0-2 years of experience) – EUR1,000
- Programmer (2-5 years of experience) – EUR1,500
- Senior Programmer (over 5 years of experience) – EUR2,000

Outsourcing sector
The outsourcing sector is a strong exporter and predominant IT sector. In 2011, out of 1,704 active IT
companies achieving revenue over EUR10,000, 104 were outsourcing companies. They employ 3,038 IT
experts, which is 20.4 percent of total IT workforce in Serbia. Average number of employees in
outsourcing sector is 29 per company, with average revenue EUR37,000 per employee annually. Top 10
companies in this sector employ 1,194 workers, have average of 119 employees, revenue of EUR51,000
per employee and EUR43,000 added value per employee13. According to NBS, total revenue of Serbian
IT outsourcing sector in 2011 was EUR112.8 million, while total export of computer and information
services was around EUR166 million.

Advantages compared to the EU and region
According to SIEPA research on IT in Serbia (Serbia ICT, SIEPA 2012), the main advantage of the
Serbian IT sector is a very favorable quality/cost ratio. Serbian IT market has a critical mass of
professionals to make Serbia a relevant player on the market (especially outsourcing).The market is still
shaping up, which allows for good business opportunities to find skilled and not very expensive
employees. Due to the size of the market, Serbia acts as the center of gravity for the region. A significant
role is played by a large diaspora, which maintains links and keeps Serbia as the main outsourcing
partner. Often, Serbian engineers working abroad are sent to Serbia to set up a daughter company in order
to act as an outsourcing partner.

Main challenges
One of the main challenges identified by companies is the limited number of graduates coming out of the
current educational system. This may cause a shortage of new employees. In 2012, ICT education was

taught at 35 higher education institutions: 16 state-owned and 6 private faculties, and 13 state-owned
technical colleges, with a total enrolment capacity of 8,619 students. The total number of students
enrolled in ICT education (for B.Sc, M.Sc, or Ph.D) in 2012 was 5,523, with 50 percent enrolled at state-
owned universities, 41 percent at state-owned technical colleges, and 9 percent at private universities.
The practice indicates that around 52 percent will attain a B.Sc, around 40 percent will attain a M.Sc, and
about 8 percent will attain a Ph.D.

Companies that are focused less on outsourcing, and more towards developing own products face a lack
of a supportive environment, and professional support in the form of venture capital, incubators,
accelerators, and other features which boost innovative companies. There are significant issues with
enforcement of IP rights, lack of corporate and entrepreneurial skills, lack of experience with international
partners, and almost no inflow of foreign programmers.

Background study: Asseco SEE
Asseco SEE is one of largest ICT companies in Serbia, and it is primarily developing its own products. It
is a member of Asseco Group, which is one of ten largest IT companies in Europe. Asseco Group
employs over 1300 people in 13 countries, and is the leading IT firm for production and implementation
of own designed software services in South Eastern Europe for the financial sector, banking,
telecommunications, public sector and administration. Asseco SEE was created in year 2009 by the
merger of three reputable companies: Antegra, Pexim and PeximCardinfo. Founded in 1994, Antegra’s
main area of focus was core software for banks. Originally, Antegra produced software for domestic
banks in Serbia, but quickly crossed the borders and became a regional leader in bank software. Pexim
produced bank software, but focused on eBanking and client-oriented applications. Primary business for
PeximCardinfo was POS terminal and credit card transactions. Asseco SEE currently has 450 employees.
Asseco identified large possible opportunity in partnership with the government on establishing e-
government solutions. According to Asseco, the largest obstacle for further development of the IT
industry in Serbia is a lack of educated programmers. Qualitatively, Serbia is at the level of EU
technology leaders, and some of worldwide best solutions are developed in Serbia.

Background study: HTEC
HTEC was established in 2011 as an outsourcing company. HTEC is oriented toward the EU market
where it seeks to maximize advantages and similarities with the EU, including foreign language
proficiency, market proximity, the same time zone, access to IT talent with a similar culture and business
procedures. HTEC started as a small company with 8 developers, working for only one client, and in two
years, grew to 60 employees and revenue over EUR1 million. They also created seven spin-offs in
different areas of business. HTEC cited several main obstacles hindering even faster growth of the IT
sector, including market fragmentation (companies are small and often not able to support larger project
proposals), and lack of specialization (“everyone does everything”). The lack of educated programmers
will be a major obstacle, since a shortage is already evident. Since most high quality programmers are
taught at state-owned universities, government support could include significantly increasing the quotas
for IT freshmen.

   4. Reforms to Support Private Sector Growth

As demonstrated in previous sections of this note, Serbia needs to change its growth model
towards exports. Growth model prior to the crisis has been based on expansion of domestic
demand, which generated improvements in living standards, but proved unsustainable. Reforms
to create a good investment climate were lagging. Investment, and in particular to tradable
sectors and manufacturing, were low throughout the previous decade and a half (Figure 9). As a
result, productivity in Serbia’s manufacturing is well below that in comparator countries (Figure
14). Improving productivity will be critical if Serbia is to restart the other growth engine –
exports. Although Serbia’s exports have been improving recently, they are still far below
regional peers (Figure 10). As shown in Section 3, there are several sectors where Serbia has
revealed comparative advantage (in particular agriculture and food products and more recently
competitiveness is improving in sectors like machinery, electronics and transportation
equipment). Importantly, Serbia is improving its integration with global supply chains (Figure
22). However, it was also shown in Section 3 that Serbia’s exports are typically of lower qual ity
and value added than in regional peers. It was also shown that export relations are volatile,
indicating possible issues with capacity and consistency of export production.

The business environment will need to improve significantly in order to boost private
sector investment and improve competitiveness. To improve productivity and increase the
quality and consistency of Serbia’s exports, it will be critical to create conditions for much
higher private sector investment in tradable sectors. Most export industries, particularly
manufacturing, is lumpy and entail large-scale investments which will only pay-off in the
medium-term. This is why these investors will only come if they can expect a certain degree of
stability with respect to the economic fundamentals and a relatively smooth process of starting
and expanding a business. These are the areas were Serbia is lagging: it ranks 93rd out of 189
economies in the 2014 Doing Business report, below most countries of the region (it is 22nd out
of 26 ECA countries), and lower than what one might expect from its GDP per capita level.
Similarly, in the latest Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum, Serbia
ranks 101st out of 148 countries. The unfavorable business environment has a negative impact on
the day-to-day transactions of companies, and on incentives for long-term investments. This
undermines export potential.

Serbia is also facing a severe jobs crisis. Since 2008 about 15 percent of jobs were lost and
there are no signs of turn around. Employment rate is very low (Figure 2), with less than half of
the working-age population (15 to 64) having jobs at all, even less having formal jobs, and those
having formal jobs largely being employed in the public sector (Figure 1). Employment rates
peak at very young age (in the age group of 35 to 39) and small number of low skilled people
have jobs. Short term priority in addressing the jobs crisis is making it economically viable for
this large pool of low and mid skilled unemployed to find formal jobs.

Government reforms have resolved some business environment bottlenecks (see Box 3), but
more remain and need to be addressed effectively. Over the last several years, Serbia’s
government has implemented a series of reforms to streamline procedures for starting and
closing businesses, improve access to credit, strengthened competition laws, and improved


                                               26
contract enforcement. However, Serbia’s relatively low rank with recent business ranking
indexes suggests there is significant scope for further improvements.

This section presents a set of concrete measures to improve investment climate, most of
which can be implemented in short to medium term. As discussed before, only significantly
higher private sector investment to tradable sectors can improve Serbia’s competiti veness. To
make it easier for private sector to decide to invest and operate a business, it is critical to
improve predictability, consistency and transparency of the regulatory environment. Set of
reforms aiming to achieve this is outlined in subsection 4.1. Decisions on entering or expanding
a business are heavily influenced on how easy (or difficult) it is to obtain permits needed to build
production facilities: subsection 4.2 presents a set of measures aiming to streamline construction
permitting and planning procedures. Reforms to make it viable to create jobs in formal sector and
help address Serbia’s job crisis are presented in subsection 4.3. As an example of specific
package of reforms, subsection 4.4 is presenting measures focusing on improving export
competitiveness in agriculture and food processing, one of the key sectors identified for Serbia’s
competitiveness. It should be noted that the measures that are proposed throughout this Section
were selected on the basis that they can generally be implemented fairly quickly and many of
them build on existing initiatives. Finally, it is very important to mention that the measures
discussed here are mainly focusing on investment climate and if they are to be successful in
improving Serbia’s competitiveness they need to be a part of a broader package of reforms
(including measures to ensure mid-term fiscal consolidation, broader job market reforms
including those related to skills, innovation and technology transfer policies, etc.).



4.1 Making it easier to operate businesses, by reducing excessive
    administrative burdens and making regulatory environment predictable

Despite recent progress, companies in Serbia, in particular SMEs, are still facing significant
regulatory burden. Businesses are faced with several hundred licenses and permits that govern
business entry and operations. Significant regulatory burdens hinder growth and hamper
competitiveness. One possible proxy for this is the Paying Taxes DB indicator, where Serbia is
ranked 161st globally (out of 189 countries), and 23rd out of 26 ECA countries. Similarly, the
Global Competitiveness Report ranks Serbia 142nd out of 148 countries on the Burden of
Government Regulation indicator. Resolving insolvency is another area pinpointed by the Doing
Business report as significantly problematic. Companies and investors do not feel that potential
litigation or financial distress would be adequately treated by the legal and institutional
framework, as is reflected by the ranking for Resolving insolvency and Contract Enforcement,
which is respectively 103 and 116 globally (out of 189 countries). Various reforms have been
implemented successfully, but clearly there is need to further significantly reduce the
administrative and regulatory burden. At the same time, the regulations and laws that are in
place, as well as court decisions, must be effectively implemented. It should be noted that most
of the recommendations in this section are in line with the Government of Serbia’s Draft
Strategy for Enhancing Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness for 2014–2020.




                                                27
Recommendations

   Accelerate and complete the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform and other similar
    initiatives aiming to streamline administrative and regulatory requirements. So far, 212
    out of 304 recommendations from Comprehensive Regulatory Reform have been
    implemented, accounting for about two thirds of the estimated savings. Other similar
    initiatives should be completed. For example, the latest edition of NALED Grey Book
    identifies 100 problems/recommendations, out of which 7 have been resolved, 14 are
    partially resolved, and the remaining 79 are either unresolved or are new initiatives.
    Approach similar to Paperwork Reduction Act should be considered.

   Improve the functioning of the debt resolution mechanisms in the country and contract
    enforcement. Although Serbia has reformed the insolvency law relatively short time ago,
    new amendments to the law are needed and being discussed. In addition to the legislative
    framework, it is essential to work on the proper implementation of the insolvency system, to
    enable and encourage the number of restructurings. The number of non-performing loans
    (NPL) is high at 19.9% (source: National Bank of Serbia). Out of these, Serbian businesses
    account for 57.7% of NPLs, according to the NBS data for 2013. Adequate implementation
    can be achieved by enforcement of deadlines, training insolvency administrators and the
    existing non-specialized courts, monitoring the statistical data for courts and insolvency
    administrators, enforcement of penalties and disciplinary sanctions against fraudulent
    debtors/directors/shareholders and insolvency administrators. Better framework and
    guidelines for restructuring and out of court workouts should also be considered to create
    proper incentives for reorganizing financially distressed but viable companies and, in the end,
    keeping jobs. Businesses and banks should be encouraged through public awareness
    campaign and through Central Bank’s prodding to consider debt restructuring at early stages.
    Additionally, other laws, such as company and tax laws need to be reviewed to remove any
    obstacles to timely and effective debt restructuring.

   Implement aspects of E-Government and enable data exchange and coordination
    between various agencies.
       a. Fully implement electronic filing of tax submissions for all companies (should
          have been introduced January 2014, but has been postponed).
       b. Consider developing a “meta database” where various data bases maintained by
          various agencies would be coordinated. For example, there are two data bases
          which contain official addresses of companies in Serbia (one in the Cadaster and one
          in Post), yet they are not coordinated between themselves and there is no automatic
          link with other users of this data (e.g. the Business Registries Agency). Data bases of
          the Customs Administration and Tax Administration are not linked. Data on
          individuals, which is highly relevant for administrative procedures related to
          registering and paying workers is dispersed between several uncoordinated data bases
          (including one in Health Fund and separate one in Pension Fund).
       c. Promptly ensure full functionality of Central Registry of Compulsory Social
          Insurance. The Central Registry was set up in May 2010, however it is still not fully
          functional because the necessary data bases are still not complete. Full functionality
          of the Central Registry will significantly simplify various administrative procedures
          related to the Health Fund and Pension Fund.
                                                28
   Strengthen the Better Regulation Unit. This unit has been set up with World Bank support
    and is operational. However, it is under-staffed and its role in developing new legislation and
    regulation has been marginalized. In addition to strengthening its capacity, a better
    mechanism for consultation with the private sector when proposing draft legislation that
    affects businesses, needs to be developed. For example, out of 29 laws that effect the
    business environment and were adopted in first half of 2013, more than two-thirds were
    adopted using the urgent procedure, without proper public consultations. The government
    should consider incorporating a full inventory of all national procedures that affect
    businesses into the national E-Register, and create a mechanism to accurately update it.

   Share best practices across municipalities, and move good sub-national practices to the
    national level. To the extent possible, government could continue supporting simplification
    of sub-national regulation, and try to link it with the national Better Regulation Unit to help
    ensure better coordination.

   Introduce clarity and predictability in para-fiscal charges and fees. Businesses tipically
    pay several dozen various fees each month to various agencies and different levels of
    government. The cost is an issue, but even more it is the non-transparent process according to
    which the fees are introduced, and the risk of fines if some of the plethora of fees are not
    paid. Some initial steps have been taken. After the 2012 elections, the government abolished
    some of the para-fiscal charges and introduced legislation which aimed to systemize the
    remaining ones. However, since then some new charges have been introduced, and the legal
    framework for systemizing para-fiscal charges is not complete.

   Initiate reforms of the inspections system. Inspections in Serbia are not coordinated and
    fragmented into 36 inspectorates operating under 15 different ministries. There is further
    fragmentation, as local governments and regulatory agencies also play a role. In the absence
    of a comprehensive and modern umbrella law to govern this area, business inspections are
    mired in uncertainty. For example, inspections are regulated through approximately 1,000
    individual (sector) laws and bylaws, some dating back to the 1990s and 1980s. Inspections
    need to be better integrated and coordinated, and work much more transparently. A lot of
    initial work in this area has been done by the USAID BEP project and the IFC. Based on the
    existing diagnostic and preparatory work, the steps in inspection reform should include: (i)
    Introduce risk-based inspections; (ii) Clearly delineate responsibilities of various inspections
    and develop checklists of what each inspection covers; (iii) Develop software to coordinate
    various inspections; (iv) Consider consolidating over 30 inspections (excluding fiscal) to 12-
    15 inspectorates; and (v) Consider creating a small centralized General Inspectorate (GI) at
    the Cabinet-level to govern the work of inspections and perform strong internal control of
    inspections.

   Improvements to National Quality Infrastructure (NQI). Improvements in NQI are
    critical for trade and exports in various sectors (automobile and food). This could include
    different measures related to standards, metrology, accreditation, and market surveillance.
    The government can explore the options to strengthen the Directorate of Measures and
    Precious Metals, and allow it more flexibility to respond to the needs of the private sector. It
    may be worth reviewing the suitability of alternate metrology models. In order to improve
    the accreditation system, the authorities could: (i) pursue regional and international

                                                29
    agreements for the mutual recognition of the established national accreditation bodies and (ii)
    promote awareness of the services of a national accreditation body in the regulatory domain
    and in the market place. A market surveillance structure could be established in full
    compliance with EC legislation, with more effective coordination among the market
    surveillance authorities.


Box 3: Successful reform to reduce administrative burden: Serbia’s Business Registry Agency
A comprehensive reform of the Serbia business registration system began in 2003, aimed at: simplifying
and accelerating the setting up and closing down of businesses; cutting administrative obstacles for doing
business; setting the conditions for improving legal security; creating a more favorable business
environment for investments; and establishing conditions for creating new jobs and reducing the informal
economy. Former business registration system in Serbia had numerous drawbacks: (i)        two business
registration procedures; (ii) five parallel and unreliable databases on registered business entities; (iii)
decentralized business registration system; (iv) lack of transparency; (v) very long business registration
time (71 days for companies and 3-7 days for sole proprietors; (vi) high business registration costs
(US$ 202 for companies) and very high minimum registered capital (US$ 5,000 for companies).

The business registration reform was successfully implemented by the establishment of the Serbian
Business Registers Agency (SBRA), which became operational on 1 January 2005, as the sole institution
in the Republic of Serbia in charge of keeping the business and other registers prescribed by the law, as
unique, centralized, public and electronic databases. Establishment of SBRA based on best practices, and
continuous improvements at this agency, brought numerous benefits to Serbian business: (i) uniformed
procedure of registration, recording and publication of data and documents that are subject to registration,
regardless of where registration takes place (either at the SBRA’s head office in Belgrade, or at any of its
13 regional offices throughout Serbia); (ii) significantly shortened business registration time (for
companies: down to 5 days in 2005, 3 days in 2009 and just 1 day as of December 2013; for sole
proprietors: down to just 1 day as of December 2013); (iii) significantly reduced costs of starting a
business (for companies registration costs are down to EUR42 and as of February 2012 minimum
registered capital is only EUR1); (iv) unique electronic database, containing up-to-date and reliable
information on registered business entities; (v) SBRA’s official web site provides a free of charge
access to all registered data to any legal entity and natural person.

The SBRA is a self-sustainable institution financed out of the fees charged to its customers, which are set
at the minimum level (cost-cover principle). It is the only state institution of the Republic of Serbia that
has been applying a five-day “silence is consent” principle since its establishment.

The number of registers run by the SBRA has significantly increased, from 3 (2005) to 17 (2014), while
at the same time, the number of staff employed and engaged by the SBRA has remained almost
unchanged since its establishment. 397 SBRA employees (2014) are replacing approx. 1,500 employees,
who used to perform this work in the commercial courts, local self-government bodies, organizational
units of the Ministry of Interior, and other ministries.

The business registration reform implemented by SBRA and a continuous improvement of the SBRA
business registration procedures have considerably contributed to a better “starting a business” ranking of
the Republic of Serbia in DB: “Top reformer” country (DB2006); +33 positions (DB2010); + 42 positions
(DB2013). Serbia could further improve its “ease of doing business” and “starting a business” rankings if
registration of business entities with the local tax authorities is simplified and accelerated.

4.2 Making it easier to invest and expand business, by improving planning and
    construction permits procedures

Problems with land management remain a major issue for improving the investment climate. In
particular, Serbia ranks extremely poorly on the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator of
the 2014 Doing Business (ranked 182nd out of 189 countries). Deep structural issues in the
management of land and property rights must be addressed.

The World Bank has prepared a separate policy note dealing with various aspects of land
management and property rights. The policy note draws on extensive technical work in this area
and detailed technical notes. The recommendations from the policy note cover three broad areas:
(i) Reducing the fiscal deficit by broadening the property tax base rather than increasing the level
of taxes, and improving state land management, (ii) Increasing fiscal stability by adopting
internationally-recognized valuation standards which would help lower the risk commercial
banks currently transfer to the state-owned National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NKOSK),
and (iii) Strengthening the business climate by streamlining the process related to planning,
permits, restitution, conversion, and registration. In this section we reproduce some of the
recommendations from the policy note, focusing on areas that have direct implications on
improving competitiveness.

Recommendations

   Improve planning process. Serbia is struggling with several issues, including lack and/or
    poor quality of spatial plans, and lack of general urban plans (GUP), general regulation plans
    (GRP), and detailed regulation plans (DRP). In addition to the lack of such important
    planning tools, there is also frequent change in legislation, which confuses investors and adds
    to their cost of research to find out about planning processes, before undertaking a business
    venture or investment. The GOS is currently working on introducing a new law on planning
    and construction. While the new law introduces certain aspects of contemporary planning, it
    is does not address several key issues such as a complex institutional framework, weak
    institutional capacity, scarce financial resources, incomplete regulatory framework on
    planning, lack of coordination between service utilities and municipalities, and a weak
    private planning sector.
        a. Prepare the missing municipal plans as a framework for issuing the construction
             permits.
        b. Improve the quality of plans, by increasing the capacities of public and private
             sector.
        c. Strengthen public and private sector planning capacities.
        d. Reduce the number of mandatory plans in smaller municipalities (such as those
             with less than 30,000 inhabitants) where General Regulatory Plan would be
             sufficient.
        e. Prepare regulations, rule books and planning manuals to be used by both private
             and public sector to apply the law, and then prepare and implement the plans. The
             rule books and manuals should include with all planning regulations and conditions
             with practical examples, and make clear reference to the obligation for the utilities to
             participate to the planning.

                                                 31
        f. Create urban information systems and urban data bases. The preparation and
           implementation of urban plans depends on the full functioning of planning,
           implementation, monitoring, supervision, participation, and control systems. Such
           systems must rely upon accurate, standard, reliable, advanced and a continuously
           updated urban database regarding the economic, social, and financial features of the
           municipalities.

    Streamline the construction permit process. The current construction permit process
     suffers from several issues. This includes the lack and/or poor quality of planning documents
     at the local level, an incomplete regulatory framework, inadequate training of local municipal
     staff, lengthy and expensive procedures, and lack of coordination between authorities.
     Serbia’s Foreign Investor Council reports that, “the overall process of issuing permits
     remains non-transparent, long and heavily burdened with red tape, primarily as a
     consequence of difficult and time-consuming process of collecting all of the required
     documents.”14 According to the USAID Business Enabling Project (BEP), Serbia's GDP
     could increase by as much as 2 percent or EUR570 million if its construction industry
     matched that of OECD countries; 57 percent of respondents to BEP's most recent Annual
     Business Survey said that a more efficient construction permitting system would enable them
     to expand their businesses.15 To improve the situation, the reforms should focus on:
         a. Introduce benchmarks and accountability to reduce the degree of discretion.
         b. Introduce flexible safeguard measures (such as Minimum Applicable Urban
              Planning Standards) to be used in the presence of old plans and new spatial plans, or
              in absence of plans, in order to facilitate the issue of construction permits.
         c. Introduce One-Stop-Shops for construction permits in the municipalities.
         d. Introduce coordination mechanisms between the service utilities and the
              municipalities, and establish fixed criteria for screening project applications.
         e. Resolve property issues related to ownership rights, land restitution and conversion
              of use rights to property rights.
         f. Strengthen institutional capacities in the municipalities by providing training for
              municipal staff in the implementation of the permit provisions.

    Streamline procedures related to conversion. The conversion of use rights to property
     rights, as outlined in the Law on Planning and Construction of 2009, is a welcome step
     towards greater security for property rights. However, there were a variety of problems with
     the conversion process involving a fee, particularly in relation to calculating the fee and
     administration of the process. While some of these problems have been resolved, others
     remain, and only a very small number of people have taken the opportunity to convert.
     Streamlining the conversion related procedures would lead to a much higher number of
     applications, and result in clearer property rights.
         a. Introduce a streamlined process with a reduced fee.
         b. Provide training in valuation and using private evaluators to ensure that the
             values on which fees are based are fair
         c. Simplify the valuation procedures for the conversion of non-residential land

           d. Consider alternative ways to encourage conversion, such as a mass conversion
              program that would not require an application, or even conversion of use rights
              simply by a statement in the law
           e. Prepare clear regulations and guidelines.
           f. Clarify the status of land under apartment buildings to ensure that the benefits of
              secure property rights apply also to apartment owners


4.3 Making it viable to create formal sector jobs, by reducing labor market
    costs and rigidities16

The labor market is not functioning well, and it is not supportive of efficiency enhancing
reallocation. Unemployment is very high, and the structure of employment is unfavorable, with
a large share of employment linked to the public sector. Labor market rigidities are identified as
a major issue in other relevant reports, including the Foreign Investor Council’s White Book.
Fully appreciating the high relevance of these issues, the World Bank is preparing a separate
policy note on labor market. This section reproduces key messages and recommendations from
that policy note.

The jobs challenge in Serbia is to find more jobs for the transition generation—born 1975 or
earlier—before they are too old to work, while at the same time ensuring that the young have the
right skills for the jobs of the future. Serbia faces two main jobs challenges: (i) creating—
mostly—low productivity and flexible jobs for the transition generation; (ii) help ensure the
young chose entirely different career paths than their parents. The key to addressing both of these
challenges is to link the young and the older working population to Serbia’s young and fast
growing firms that create most jobs. The task of the government is to ensure that the older
generation can benefit from the spillover effects of these fast growing firms, and benefit from
jobs that are created in the surrounding environment. The younger generation must have access
to the appropriate education and skills training to nurture growth, and become the entrepreneurs
of the future.

Recommendations

      Facilitate the creation of mini and midi-jobs for the transition generation. In Serbia, the
       employment rate peaks at a dramatically low age, at around 35, and decreases quickly for
       older age groups. This generation received its education, training and first job before or
       during the onset of the transition. Today, they are largely de-skilled: many of them have held
       “life-long” jobs at SOEs and were never able to find new, stable employment after becoming
       redundant. Too many of them have given up of ever finding new proper employment again,
       as evidenced by the very high share of inactive and long-term unemployed among those aged
       45 and older. Given their outdated skills profile, policy has to recognize that the prospects of
       finding promising remaining career paths for these people are slim. Rather, policy should aim
       to provide low-productivity jobs that this group can perform viably in the formal sector.
       These so called mini and midi-jobs are typically concentrated around fast growing
       companies. They are less well-paying, mostly casual and are usually in retail, in construction,

16
     For more details, see policy note on Labor Market Policies.

                                                           33
       and in the service sector. For these jobs to be performed formally, a flexible work contract
       and a tax and benefit system that encourages—and not prohibits—part time work, are
       necessary. These reforms should include:
          a. Urgently reform severance pay regulation. In order to better enable the hiring of
              older workers, the severance pay regulation has to be reformed, so that severance
              payments are based on tenure with the firm, and not the entire work history.
          b. Allow more flexible work arrangements: The planned reform of the labor code
              should allow for more flexible work arrangements that reflect a more casual
              arrangement and uncertain weekly work hours for many jobs in the service sector.
          c. Abolish minimum social security contribution: Serbia is the only country in the
              region that still has a social security floor that is not adjusted by actual hours worked.
              Anyone who has a formal job has to pay at least RSD 3,400 a month in social security
              contributions17, no matter how much he or she earns. This makes any low-paying
              part-time work unviable in the formal sector.
          d. Improve work incentives of existing benefits: Serbia’s current unemployment,
              social assistance, and family benefits are of a typical first-generation design that does
              not encourage work. A better, second-generation design is a phased withdrawal of
              benefits, so that beneficiaries can actually increase their income from work because
              benefits are only gradually withdrawn.

      Facilitate own-account work and micro-entrepreneurship for the older generation. Just
       like mini and midi-jobs can help the older generation to connect to the indirect creation of
       dependent jobs around fast growing companies, own-account work and micro-
       entrepreneurship can help create independent employment opportunities. As with mini-jobs,
       these opportunities are limited, and will not provide substantial income generation; but there
       will be opportunities in the ecosystem of large job generators to set up their own micro
       businesses. In order for this to happen, some basic entrepreneurship skills and access to seed
       funds to help start a business are needed.
           a. Technical training for self-employment: Setting up an own-account business
               requires technical skills for business. This includes general entrepreneurial skills,
               plus the ability to handle tasks such as the ability to set up a business development
               plan, perform cost calculations and revenue estimates, some legal knowledge about
               paying taxes, and hiring and managing employees. These skills can be taught, but the
               right system needs to be in place to provide this type of adult learning.
           b. Financial support for self-employment: Access to financial resources is essential
               for a successful business start-up. The NES has a program to support start-ups, which
               includes both training and financial support. One particular program, which is
               especially designed for redundant workers, is the severance-to-job program. This
               program helps redundant workers to use their severance payment to successfully
               launch their own business. These programs should be strengthened, as program
               evaluations have shown favorable outcomes.
      Facilitate school-to-work transition for the young. The younger working generation
       should have access to education and vocational training which will help them to attain a
       stronger skill set. This will maximize their possibility to choose careers that will link them

    with highly skilled jobs. A transition can be more effective by linking employers to the
    education system, providing opportunities to work while studying, and in some cases,
    employers provide further education to their employees. This can be achieved through
    entrepreneurship programs in universities, traineeship and internships, and employer
    sponsored training.
   Foster labor market institutions. All of the above-mentioned reforms require strong labor
    market institutions for a successful implementation. This includes enhancing the capacities of
    the NES to better serve the unemployed, linking them with job opportunities, especially in
    areas with strong job growth, and providing programs to either increase the likelihood of
    matching job seekers with firms, or, as a measure of last resort, to mitigate the negative
    impacts of unemployment. Key to these reforms is to decrease the caseload of NES case
    workers, a decentralization of NES, and a redesign of active labor market programs
    (ALMPs). There is also an urgent need to improve the use of existing data, and gathering of
    new data to better monitor, evaluate, and research labor market conditions and programs.

4.4 Improving the Competitiveness of Agriculture and Food Processing

Agriculture and food processing is a sector where Serbia has a clear comparative advantage. It is
a very important sector in terms of significant employment. Primary agriculture accounts for
around 10 percent of GPD, and employment in agriculture is close to half a million people.
Serbia needs to considerably increase its performance to fully realize the potential that it has in
this sector. For example, in 2009, the per-hectare export value for Serbia was EUR385, while for
new member states of the EU, it was on average EUR800. The IFC has recently conducted a
detailed diagnostic of top reform priorities to strengthen the agriculture and food processing
sector. This section is based on their main findings and recommendations relating to investment
climate and business environment improvements in the agriculture and food processing sectors.

Recommendations
   Improve investment and incentive policy. Generous investment incentives place a heavy
    burden on government funds, and are ineffective in attracting greenfield FDI and generating
    jobs. There has been no cost benefit analysis or impact assessment of existing incentives
    carried out by the implementing agencies or the central government. This creates an
    environment where the government does not know enough about the effectiveness of the
    incentive instruments, and whether they are allocating scarce government funds
    appropriately. Poorly designed subsidy/incentive programs fail to adequately compensate
    lenders for their risk. Such a system distorts the market, and creates unhealthy competition
    among beneficiaries.
        a. Establish a fiscal and financial data collection mechanism. This would become the
            basis for detailed cost-benefit-analysis of incentives, and provide reliable access to
            information for the public and officials. This activity would expand and build upon
            the efforts currently undertaken by the government to comply with EU state aid
            regulations.
        b. Develop procedures to assess the efficiency of subsidy and incentive schemes. A
            number of key incentives relevant for the agribusiness sector should be identified, and
            a detailed cost-benefit/impact analysis performed. This analysis would provide the

                                                35
           basis for developing detailed recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of
           incentives offered in terms of generation of investment, improvement of profitability,
           productivity, and job creation.
   Improve agri-business regulations. Regulations and quality infrastructure for fruits and
    vegetable value chain are not fully transposed and aligned with EU. This prevents
    competitiveness and exports of the sector. The dairy sector faces several structural issues
    which impair sector growth and exports. The quality of raw milk is a key issue for the dairy
    sector because standards are far from the requirements prescribed by EU regulations (46/92,
    852 and 853/04 EC). This makes it impossible for the producers to export into the EU. As a
    net grain exporter, Serbia has potential for productivity and export logistics improvement.
    Grain production is about 9 million tons a year. Most of the grain is feed grain for clients
    along the Danube River, including Austrian and Southern German livestock producers. The
    IFC could provide detailed technical assistance in reforming most relevant parts of the
    regulatory framework.
        a. Introduce Integrated Pest Management (IPM) into the regulatory framework
            and harmonize it with the European Directive on Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
        b. Revise Law on Cooperatives, to enable greater flexibility of cooperatives and create
            better conditions for farmers.
        c. Regulatory harmonization of fruit packaging and calibration regulation with EU.
        d. Develop regulation on increased level of official controls of imports of feed and food
            of non-animal origin representing known or emerging risk to public health to enable
            harmonization of the national legislation with the EU to reduce input market costs
            and final product cost.
        e. Develop dairy sector guidelines listing necessary rules, requirements and check lists
            for compliance with EU hygiene and quality requirements.
        f. Operationalization of single river border crossing point between Croatia, Hungary
            and Serbia, to significantly reduce transport costs for grain exporters.
   Streamline lengthy export/import licenses/permits and procedures. Lengthy procedures
    related to sampling and testing during imports, such as high prices of laboratory testing
    (fruits/vegetables around RSD 20,000) and long wait periods for results (7 to 10 days) cause
    significant costs to businesses. There is also a need to promote simplified procedures/trusted
    traders/in-house clearance.
        a. Fully map and analyze export and import permits, licenses, certification,
             approvals, and tests as they relate to food products, to streamline them. The
             export and import procedures could be further streamlined through electronic
             exchange of trade related documentation with the Ministry of Agriculture.
        b. Promote simplified procedures/trusted traders/in-house clearance, and enable
             greater use of this clearance in the private sector. Also, improve information
             exchange/pre-arrival information sharing and post clearance audit, as these would
             reduce burden to business.

   Ensure certification recognition among countries in the region. Serbia signed several
    international agreements in veterinary and phytosanitary area governing mutual recognition
    and acceptance of certificates of conformity with domestic food requirements, as well as
    testing results issued in other CEFTA countries during 2012. In practice, however,


                                               36
    procedures for recognition and acceptance of certificates/testing results are not fully and
    consistently applied.
       a. Streamline the procedures for mutual recognition of certificates and testing
            reports for most traded commodities in the dairy, fruits and vegetables sub-sectors.
       b. Streamline documentation requirements for preferential CEFTA origin. It
            requires traders/exporters to demonstrate that the goods they are selling are of
            CEFTA origin. In the case of jams, for example, the company must provide customs
            with individual contracts with farmers from which the fruits were purchased. An
            affidavit should suffice in such cases, allowing for significantly reduced burdens of
            compiling and presenting paperwork.
       c. Further transposition of EU technical standards as they relate to inputs, fruits and
            vegetables, dairy and related certification into Serbian system.

   Ensure consistent border treatment at various border posts, and introduce Risk-Based
    Controls. There is no standardized risk assessment conducted by Serbia SPS agencies. This
    results in a high frequency of physical examinations/lab tests. Regional trade is hampered by
    these high levels of examinations and long wait times for test results. Delays increase final
    product costs, affecting competitiveness of producers and traders. The IFC could provide
    support in developing methodology based on the systematic application of profiling and
    other risk criteria, including an annual sampling plan and operating procedures for the
    border inspectors. Risk-Based Clearance Controls will reduce the level of checks at the
    border, and reduce backlog created by excessive testing.

   Facilitate the establishment of joint border crossing points between Serbia and
    neighboring countries. This activity will significantly reduce the time needed for goods to
    cross regional borders by eliminating one set of clearance procedures, and enabling closer
    and more harmonized inter-agency cooperation between countries, and greater use of
    electronic systems for data exchange and risk based controls.

Annex 2: Data sources and methodology used in assessing productivity growth and
labor allocation

This annex provides additional details on the data sources and methodology used in Section 2 to
assess developments related to productivity growth and labor allocation.

The empirical analysis draws essentially on NACE 2 digit level tabulations from the Structural
Business Statistics (SBS) for the 2007-2012 period, produced by the Statistical Office of Serbia
in line with Eurostat methodology. It is important to note limitations of the SBS data. In Serbia,
detailed SBS data cover only formal sector enterprises that report to Business Registries Agency.
In total, enterprises that are covered by SBS employ about 1 million people, or about 55 percent
of total formal sector employment. The difference is due to employment in public sector
(administration, health, education, defense, etc.) and formal employment at sole proprietors.
Gross value added of companies covered by SBS in 2012 is EUR 12.7 billion, or approximately
51 percent of overall value added of Serbian economy. The SBS data does not cover agricultural
sector. It also does not cover informal employment. International comparisons are made using
SBS data compiled by Eurostat.

Three main variables were extracted from SBS data set: value added at factor cost, number of
employees, and gross salaries and wages. Nominal values (originally expressed in million RSD)
were adjusted by Serbian GDP deflator (extracted from WDI database) and then converted to
constant 2005 Euro values. Two main performance variables were computed: apparent (real)
labor productivity – defined as the ratio of (real) value added at factor cost by number of
employees – and unit labor cost – is proxied by real cost of salaries to (real) value added.

In order to examine whether labor reallocation has been productivity enhancing, simple
productivity growth decomposition is performed. Following the approach of McMillan and
Rodrik (2011), labor productivity growth in an economy is assumed to be achieved in one of two
ways: first, within economic sectors through capital accumulation, technological change, or
reduction of misallocation across plants; second, through a structural change in which labor can
move from low-productivity sectors to high-productivity sectors. The following growth
decomposition was applied:
                                     ∑                ∑

where      and      refer to economy-wide and sectoral labor productivity levels, respectively,
while        is the share of employment in sector i. The Δ operator denotes the change in
productivity or employment shares between t-k and t. The first term in the decomposition is
called the “within” component of productivity growth, and is defined as the weighted s um of
productivity growth within individual sectors (with weights being the employment share of each
sector at t). The second term reflects “structural change” and captures the productivity effect of
labor reallocations across different sectors. It is the inner product of productivity levels (at the
end of the time period) with the change in employment shares across sectors. A positive
(negative) “structural change” component suggests that structural change in the economy has
been productivity-enhancing (reducing).
