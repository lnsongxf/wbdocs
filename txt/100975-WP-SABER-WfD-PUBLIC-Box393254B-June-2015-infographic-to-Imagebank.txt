                                   agenda for skills policy. This directs and helps coordinate the efforts
                                   of others in the system.

Why do we look at this?
                                  High quality service delivery produces the skills needed for
                                  productivity and growth. The quality of regulation, management and
                                  monitoring of public and private providers has a strong influence on
                                  the quality and relevance of education and training delivered.
