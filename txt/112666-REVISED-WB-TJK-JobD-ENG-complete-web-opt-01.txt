OVERVIEW
Jobs need to be positioned at the center of economic development in Tajikistan. Although remit-
tance-driven growth since the early 2000s has led to a steep decline in the poverty rate, poverty remains high.
Strong economic growth in the last decade has not resulted from structural transformation that can lead to sus-
tained improvements in the standard of living. Jobs have been created, but these are mainly in low-productivity
activities, often in the informal sector. In addition, there are major inequalities in terms of labor market outcomes
between population groups and across regions. The objectives of this report are twofold. First, it analyzes the
main challenges facing the country in terms of jobs at the macro, ﬁrm, and household levels. Second, it outlines
a set of policies and programs that can facilitate structural transformation to achieve the country’s development
objectives through: i) a higher rate of job creation in the formal sector; ii) improvements in the quality of jobs,
particularly those in the informal sector; and iii) better access to jobs among vulnerable population groups.


ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOBS
The Tajik economy is not creating sufﬁcient jobs for its growing workforce. Between 2003 and 2013, GDP
grew by an average of 7.2 percent per year. Employment, however, expanded only at 2.1 percent annually. At the
same time, fertility rates in Tajikistan remain high and the working-age population (15–64 year olds) rose from
3.31 million in 2000 to 5.23 million in 2015, with an average of 40,000 people entering the labor force each year.
The lack of jobs in Tajikistan led to increased labor migration, with remittances becoming an import-
ant source of income for Tajiks during the last decade. A large share of the workforce—as many as one
million working age adults1 or approximately 30 percent of the labor force—has opted to leave the country
for jobs and/or better pay. About 90 percent of migrants work in the Russian Federation. Growing remittances
have led to a sharp drop in poverty, which fell from about 65 percent in 2003 to 23.5 percent in 2009.2 Today,
remittances account for about 40 percent of GDP and make Tajikistan the most remittance-dependent country
in the world. This, in addition to a narrow exports base, make the economy vulnerable to external shocks, in
particular developments in the Russian Federation.
Structural transformation is lagging, and labor productivity remains low, especially in agriculture and
services. The share of workers in agriculture has not changed between 2000 and 2014, indicating a lack of
structural transformation in the economy. Growth in real GDP per capita (5.3 percent between 2000 and 2014)
was largely driven by increases in labor productivity. In addition, the movement of workers across sectors was
generally not productivity enhancing and contributed negatively to labor productivity growth. This is because
labor has moved out of the more productive sectors, such as industry, into low-productivity services and agricul-
ture sectors, where domestic job creation was the highest. Despite recent increases in labor productivity, which
grew by about 5.3 percent between 2000 and 2014, it remains low by international standards.
The increasingly challenging economic environment accentuates the need for domestic job creation
and a comprehensive jobs strategy. The recent (since mid-2014) fall in price of the key commodities that
Tajikistan exports (aluminum and cotton), and an economic slowdown among its main trading partners like the

    While estimates vary, according to Russia’s Federal Migration Service, as of June 2015 there were 992,170 migrants from Tajikistan in
    the Russian Federation (Bakanova et al. 2015). However, oﬃcial estimates of TajStat diﬀer and point to decreasing number of migrants in
    recent years: 799,000 in 2013, 669,000 in 2014, and 529,000 in 2015.

Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and China, have led to lower economic growth. Moreover, a sharp depreciation
of the Russian ruble and greater restrictions on migration to the Russian Federation since January 2015 have
contributed to the decline in remittances. Despite continued robust economic growth due to increased invest-
ments, returning migrants are likely to add pressure to an already tight labor market. In this context, there is
an increasing need to rethink the existing growth model to ensure faster job creation and improvement in the
quality of existing jobs.


THE WORKFORCE 3
The potential workforce is growing, but too many working age adults are not in the labor force; as a
result, Tajikistan’s most valuable resource—its human capital—is underutilized. Tajikistan has a working age
population, deﬁned as 15–64 year olds, of about 4 million people.4 Less than half (43 percent) of them are in the
labor force (Figure O1). Many working age youth and adults, especially women, are neither employed nor looking
for work, and therefore, are not contributing to economic growth. In 2013, the female labor force participation
rate was just 27 percent compared to 63 percent among males.
The majority of those working are in low quality jobs in the informal sector. The informal sector5 rep-
resents a large and growing source of jobs. Between 2007 and 2013, the proportion of all wage employees in
the informal sector increased from 28 percent to 39 percent (Figure O2). The share of unpaid workers increased
slightly from 16 to 18 percent. Not surprisingly, the informal sector is particularly large in rural areas and in
agriculture, where unpaid family workers are very common. Moreover, too many jobs in Tajikistan are seasonal
or temporary, and their share has increased over time.
At the same time, public sector employment remains large. The number of jobs in the public sector6 has
fallen since the 1990s as a result of privatization efforts, but the share of total employment in government

     household surveys: Tajikistan Living Standard Measurement Surveys (2003, 2007, and 2009), Tajikistan Household Panel Survey (2011)
     and World Bank / GIZ Tajikistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013).

     Please note that these estimates exclude current international migrants. If migrants are included, the total working age population is 4.85
     million according to the 2013 survey estimates while the oﬃcial estimate of 4.9 million.

     Informal sector workers are those wage and salaried workers who lack an employment contract and unpaid family workers excluding those
     who are self-employed.
 6
     The public sector includes public administration and state owned enterprises, as well as public employment in such sectors as education
     and health. According to TajStat data, employment in government institutions and SOEs was 19.4 percent in 2010 and decreased to 18.6
     percent in 2015.

institutions and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is 28 percent (Figure O3). This is high relative to other countries
in the region (e.g., 15 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2007).
Youth (15–24 year olds) have weaker jobs outcomes. Youth who are idle, i.e. youth who are neither
employed nor in school (NEET), represent 40 percent of the total, which is high by international standards.7
Between 2003 and 2013, NEET rates among youth increased from 37 to 41 percent, despite relatively favorable
economic conditions (Figure O4). Moreover, the NEET rate for female youth is considerably higher than for male
youth. While youth are more likely to work in private sector wage jobs than adults, almost a third of employed
young people are in unpaid (informal) jobs compared to 15 percent of adults. Youth are also signiﬁcantly less
likely to be self-employed (5 percent compared to 11 percent among adults).

     These rates are similar to NEET rates, which are rates of 15-24 year olds who are not in employment, education, or training. For Tajikistan,
     where training rates are very low, we refer to NEET for people who are not in employment or education.

Women are at a disadvantage in employment outcomes. Between 2003 and 2013, the disparity between
male and female employment rates increased. In 2003, the gap between male and female employment rates
was 21 percentage points, and this increased to 35 percentage points in 2013 (Figure O5). Employed women
are somewhat more likely to work in the public sector, but almost a quarter of women are involved in unpaid
employment in family businesses compared to 13 percent among men. Women are also less likely to be self-em-
ployed (7 percent compared to 12 percent among men).
Not surprisingly, workers from richer households have better quality jobs. While there is some variation
in employment type across consumption quintiles, the biggest difference between poorer and richer workers is
in terms of the quality and stability of their wage jobs. Richer workers in wage jobs are more likely to be paid
in regular installments. Only 30 percent of workers in households in the poorest quintile are paid using regular
installments, compared to 45 percent of workers in households in the richest quintile.8 Similarly, piecewise work,
which is more common in the informal sector and among seasonal or temporary jobs, is much more prevalent
among workers in poor households.
Skills and education are particularly important determinants of jobs outcomes, yet completion rates
for secondary education might be falling. Employment rates are positively correlated with educational
attainment (Figure O6), and analysis conﬁrms large education premiums in terms of earnings: adults who
have attained post-secondary education earn 57 percent more than otherwise identical adults with less than
primary school education. While the overall proportion of adults (25 years and older) who have achieved at least
secondary education is approximately 80 percent, there are concerning trends. A higher percentage of younger
cohorts of women are not completing secondary school or secondary special/technical education (Figure O7).


LABOR DEMAND IN THE FORMAL SECTOR
The formal private sector, squeezed by the large public and informal sectors, is underdeveloped and the
entry rate of new ﬁrms is low. In most countries, the creation of good jobs depends on a thriving formal private
sector. In Tajikistan, formal wage employment in the private sector represents just 13 percent of total employ-
ment. The rate of entry of formal businesses remains low (Figure O8). This is not due to a lack of entrepreneurial

potential. Survey data suggests that almost 40 percent of the labor force has a preference for self-employment,9
one of the highest rates in the region (Arias et al. 2014). However, the share of latent entrepreneurs who try to
start a business is very low at 11.8 percent, pointing to signiﬁcant barriers to entrepreneurship.
Private sector formal ﬁrms are small and relatively young, especially compared to SOEs, which are still
present in many economic sectors. The majority (70 percent) of private sector formal ﬁrms10 have fewer than
10 employees and two thirds (66 percent) have been registered for six years or less (Figure O9). SOEs make up
a small share (less than 4 percent) of total ﬁrms, but they are generally larger than formal private sector ﬁrms.11
While the share of SOEs is not high overall, they are still present in many sectors. The lack of a comprehensive
government database and monitoring of SOEs makes it difﬁcult to understand their real economic impact
(Bakanova et al. 2014). However, their relative size and presence in many economic sectors suggests that SOEs
could be potentially undermining competition and the entry of private companies.
As in other countries, formal sector employees tend to work in larger and older private ﬁrms, but this
pattern is even more pronounced for SOEs. The few large ﬁrms with more than 100 employees (only 2 percent
of the total), employ about 40 percent of all formal employees (Figure O10), which is consistent with ﬁndings
in other countries.12 The high share of employment in these larger and older ﬁrms is only a concern if they are
less productive,13 which appears to be the case in Tajikistan—at least in the manufacturing sector. This could be
indicative of a misallocation of labor resources or a reﬂection of rigidities in the labor market. Lack of competition
may also be allowing less productive ﬁrms to retain higher employment than optimal. Notably, the concentration
of formal employment in larger SOEs is even starker (Figure O11).14

    There is some evidence that this may be the case—at least in the case of the manufacturing sector—but more research is needed to vali-
    date this with more and better data.

    This could be partially a result of the way the government conducted privatization by selling oﬀ smaller SOEs ﬁrst or “labor hoarding” by
    SOEs, which might be hampering reallocation of labor to more productive sectors.

Older private sector ﬁrms are larger, but to a lesser extent than ﬁrms in other countries. Firms in the
private sector that survive beyond ﬁve years in Tajikistan tend to be larger, on average, than younger ﬁrms. But
the difference in size between older and younger ﬁrms is smaller in Tajikistan compared to other countries, which
may indicate some barriers to growth. While the size of private sector ﬁrms aged 5–9 years is roughly comparable
to the U.S. and Moldova, the trend starts to diverge for older age brackets (Figure O12). Older private sector
ﬁrms (10–14 years old) are only about 1.5 times larger than young ﬁrms. In comparison, U.S. ﬁrms in that age
bracket are 2.2 times larger. The difference is even more pronounced for ﬁrms aged 15–19 years in Tajikistan. This
suggests that private sector ﬁrms in Tajikistan may face constraints and they do not grow to their full potential.
There are wide dispersions in labor productivity (output per worker) in the manufacturing sector,
suggesting problems of allocative efﬁciency. There are no signiﬁcant differences in average labor productivity
in the manufacturing sector by size of ﬁrm, but there is a large variation in productivity for all ﬁrm types
(Figure O13). Large differences in productivity across businesses, even within narrowly deﬁned sectors, is a
persistent feature in both developed and developing countries (Haltiwanger 2011), which may suggest allocative
inefﬁciency, i.e. the inability of the economy to shift resources from low- to high-productivity activities. Analysis

using panel data for the manufacturing sector shows that larger ﬁrms are not more productive in Tajikistan.
Moreover, ﬁrms increase productivity by laying off workers, suggesting that productive ﬁrms do not grow their
employment levels, either because of barriers or disincentives.
Importantly, SOEs appear less efﬁcient than the private sector manufacturing ﬁrms. The analysis suggests
that SOEs are less productive than private sector manufacturing ﬁrms, regardless of size, age, sector and location.15
While this result should be taken with caution,16 it is nevertheless consistent with ﬁndings in the region that labor
productivity among private ﬁrms tends to be higher than in SOEs operating in the same sector (Arias et al. 2014).
The jobs strategy can contribute to achieving the objectives outlined in the National Development
Strategy 2030. The Government of Tajikistan set a number of ambitious goals for improving the living con-
ditions of the population in its National Development Strategy (NDS) 2030. The NDS 2030 outlines four key
objectives: i) ensure energy security; ii) develop the country’s communication opportunities; iii) ensure food
security and nutrition; and iv) increase productive employment. The latter aims to both increase the quantity of

      of inputs (labor and capital used in production), such as value added per worker or total factor productivity. These measures were not pos-

jobs created and improve the quality of these jobs through increasing labor productivity and expanding access
to social protection. Hence, the proposed objectives of the Jobs Strategy and NDS 2030 are well aligned.
Policy recommendations for each area are presented in Table O1 and elaborated in more detail in the
report. These recommendations are based on the analysis in the jobs diagnostic and draw on a large volume
of sectoral and complementary work, as well as consultations with the Government, private sector, civil society,
and other stakeholders.


STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR JOBS IN TAJIKISTAN
To improve labor market outcomes, the Government of Tajikistan needs to rethink the role of jobs in
achieving its development objectives. Beyond a growth strategy, the government needs to consider a jobs
strategy that aims to achieve the following key objectives: i) facilitate the creation of more jobs, particularly in
the private formal sector; ii) improve the quality of existing jobs, especially in the informal sector; and iii) facilitate
better access to jobs including transitions from inactivity to employment and from low to higher quality jobs,
with a focus on vulnerable workers (Figure O15). The latter include youth, women, residents of lagging regions,
and the bottom 40 percent of the population.
To address these objectives, the proposed jobs strategy is organized around three pillars (Figure O16).
1. Promoting private sector growth: Sustainable job creation relies upon the growth of a competitive private
   sector. Accordingly, this pillar focuses on the reforms needed to ensure an effective enabling environment at
   the macro- and micro-levels that will enable entrepreneurs to create new businesses, and current ﬁrms to invest,
   expand, and hire workers. Part of the agenda requires trade facilitation, infrastructure and logistics, given the
   country’s small size and landlocked position.
2. Improving productivity and earnings, and access to formal jobs: This pillar focuses on strengthening
   local value chains and connecting small producers and rural SMEs in order to improve their productivity and
   earnings. It also involves policies to improve incentives for formal jobs.
3. Connecting people to jobs: This pillar focuses on connecting potential workers to jobs through a set of
   supply side policies and programs aimed at increasing labor force participation through enabling policies,
   improving access to jobs through labor market programs, and better leveraging the beneﬁts of migration.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of the report is to develop a comprehensive Jobs Strategy for Tajikistan to promote
inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. The main proposition is that jobs need to be at the center
of a development strategy in Tajikistan. Indeed, economic growth will accelerate if more people work and if the
productivity of jobs increases; and standards of living will improve if workers have access to good jobs. Thus,
the main purpose of the report is to outline a set of policies and programs that can enable structural changes/
transformations in terms of job creation, improvements in the quality of jobs, and access to jobs needed to
achieve the country’s development objectives.
The Tajik economy today is not able to create sufﬁcient jobs, existing jobs are mainly in the informal
sector and have low quality, and there are major inequalities in terms of labor market outcomes. Job
creation, despite high economic growth, has not kept up with the rapid increase in the workforce, and too many
potential workers are inactive and not contributing to the economy. The small formal private sector is squeezed
between a large public sector and the informal sector. It mainly consists of small and young ﬁrms which face
difﬁculties in expanding employment. In addition, many of the available jobs are poor quality jobs: seasonal,
occasional and temporary with irregular pay, largely in the informal sector, and without access to beneﬁts or
social protection. Finally, access to jobs is inequitable and therefore, some important groups—in particular youth
and women—ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to access gainful employment. There are also some regional inequalities in
terms of the distribution of jobs.
The lack of good jobs in Tajikistan has led to increased labor migration, and remittances have become
an important source of income and growth in the last decade. A large share of the workforce—as many as
one million working age adults17—has opted to leave the country for better pay. About 90 percent of migrants,
who are mostly men, work in the Russian Federation, where workers can earn signiﬁcantly higher wages than
in Tajikistan. Increasing remittances have led to a sharp drop in poverty, which fell from about 65 percent in
2003 to 23.5 percent in 2009.18 The importance of labor migration has grown over the last decade, and today,

    While estimates vary, according to Russia’s Federal Migration Service, as of June 2015 there were 992,170 migrants from Tajikistan in the
    Russian Federation (Bakanova et al. 2015). However, oﬃcial estimates of TajStat are 529,000 labor migrants in 2015.

Tajikistan is the most remittance-dependent country in the world, with remittances accounting for about 40
percent of GDP. This, in addition to a narrow export base, makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks, in
particular, developments in the Russian Federation.
Recent macroeconomic developments have exposed vulnerabilities in the existing growth model.
The recent (since mid-2014) fall in the prices of key commodities that Tajikistan exports (aluminum and cotton),
together with the economic slowdown in its main trading partners like the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan,
and China, has led to lower economic growth in Tajikistan. Moreover, the U.S. dollar value of remittances fell
by 33 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to the sharp depreciation of the Russian ruble. Greater
restrictions on migration to the Russian Federation since January 2015 have also contributed to the decline in
remittances. This slowdown has affected domestic demand, which in turn has depressed growth in services, a
major contributor to economic growth and job creation. Further declines in remittance incomes could jeopardize
economic and social gains experienced over the last decade. Despite continued robust economic growth due
to increased investments, returning migrants are also likely to add pressure to an already tight labor market.
Going forward, Tajikistan needs to rethink the role of jobs in the context of the country’s development
goals. There are three key objectives: i) facilitating the creation of more jobs particularly in the private formal
sector; ii) improving the quality of existing jobs, especially in the informal sector ; and iii) facilitating better access
to jobs including transitions from inactivity/unemployment into employment and from low to higher quality jobs,
with a focus on vulnerable workers (Figure 1). The latter include youth, women, residents of lagging regions, and
the bottom 40 percent of the population. Clearly, these objectives are not mutually exclusive, but there may be
temporary trade-offs: for instance, increasing productivity in one sector, as a result of upgrades in technology,
could lead to better, but fewer jobs.
To address these objectives, the proposed jobs strategy is organized around three pillars (Figure 2).
∫ Promoting private sector growth: Sustainable job creation relies upon the growth of a competitive private
  sector. Accordingly, this pillar focuses on the reforms needed to ensure an effective enabling environment
  at the macro and micro level that will enable entrepreneurs to create new businesses, and current ﬁrms to
  invest, expand, and hire workers. Part of the agenda requires trade facilitation, infrastructure and logistics,
  given the country’s small size and landlocked position.
∫ Improving productivity and earnings, and access to formal jobs: This pillar focuses on strengthening local
  value chains and connecting small producers and rural SMEs in order to improve their productivity and earnings.
  It also involves policies to reduce incentives for informality and enable access to social insurance programs.
∫ Connecting people to jobs: This pillar focuses on connecting potential workers to jobs through a set of supply
  side policies and programs. It involves increasing labor force participation through enabling policies, improving
  access to jobs through labor market programs and policies, and better leveraging the beneﬁts of migration.

The jobs strategy will contribute to achieving the objectives outlined in the National Development
Strategy 2030. The Government of Tajikistan set a number of ambitious goals for improving the living conditions
of the population in its National Development Strategy (NDS) 2030. The Strategy outlines four key objectives:
i) ensure energy security; ii) develop the country’s communication opportunities; iii) ensure food security and
nutrition; and iv) increase productive employment. The latter, in particular, aims to both increase the quantity of
jobs created and improve the quality of these jobs through increasing labor productivity and expanding access to
social protection. In this regard, the proposed objectives of the Jobs Strategy and NDS are well aligned. Moreover,
there are many other synergies with different pillars of the NDS (Figure D1 in Annex D).
The rest of the report is organized as follows. Chapter 1 presents an overview of Tajikistan’s economic develop-
ment and broad structural changes in terms of job creation and labor productivity growth. Chapter 2 presents
the results of the analysis of the labor supply based on household surveys for the years 2003, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013. It looks at: 1) demographics and labor force participation; 2) employment and types of jobs;
3) inequalities in labor market outcomes; 4) the micro-determinants of these outcomes; and 5) the role of skills.
Chapter 3 focuses on labor demand and labor productivity using ﬁrm-level data from the Business Register
(2014-2015) and ﬁrm survey on Industrial Production (2012-2014). The chapter discusses: 1) the proﬁle of labor
demand; 2) the proﬁle of formal sector ﬁrms and jobs (private and SOEs); 3) ﬁrm growth and job creation; and
4) productivity and jobs. Finally, Chapter 4 outlines a set of policies and programs to address the country’s main
challenges in terms of job creation, labor productivity and earnings growth, and access to jobs.

1. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOBS
1
Economic growth since the early 2000s has improved welfare, but Tajikistan remains poor
On September 9, 1991 Tajikistan declared independence from the Soviet Union, and civil war erupted
soon afterwards in 1992. This delayed post-transition recovery until 1997 when the civil war ended. It led to
signiﬁcant loss of life, emigration by minorities, and physical damage. GDP is estimated to have bottomed out
in 1996 at nearly 70 percent below its 1991 level (Amir and Berry 2003). Although there has been peace since
1997, isolated security incidents ﬂare periodically, especially close to the border with Afghanistan.
Tajikistan possesses tremendous human and natural resources. The country’s population of 8.2 million
is growing fast. The demographic contrast between Tajikistan and many countries in Europe and Central Asia
(ECA), and East Asia is stark because many of these countries have aging and contracting populations. Tajikistan
has a wealth of largely untapped natural resources: the country’s hydropower potential is substantial; it has coal,
silver and gold, as well as signiﬁcant hydrocarbon potential.
The macroeconomic situation has improved in Tajikistan since 2000 and its GDP per capita has increased
sharply, driven by external demand for commodities and an increasing inﬂow of remittances (Figure 3).
Macroeconomic performance improved in the 2000s, inﬂation declined from around 30–40 percent in the late
1990s to around 6–7 percent in the mid-2000s; ﬁscal deﬁcits fell; and the current account deﬁcit and external
debt reached manageable levels (World Bank 2011a). Much of the growth since 2000 has been driven by strong
external demand for Tajikistan’s exports of aluminum and cotton. Furthermore, remittances from the steady
stream of migrants who left the country have fueled consumption. Overall, Tajikistan has enjoyed high GDP
growth rates in the last decade19 (about 7 to 8 percent) (Figure 4).

Strong growth has reduced poverty. Poverty, as deﬁned by the national poverty line, fell from 81 percent in
1999 to 47 percent in 2009, and to about 32 percent in 2014.20 Extreme poverty fell more precipitously, from
73 percent to 14 percent during the same period (World Bank 2014b). When measured by the international
poverty line (US$ 3.1 2011 PPP per day), the poverty rate fell from about 65 percent in 2003 to 23.5 percent
in 2009 (Figure 5). This places Tajikistan among the top 10 percent in the world in terms of the rate of poverty
reduction (Azevedo, Atamanov and Rajabov 2014a). Strong economic growth also boosted shared prosperity;
the welfare of households in the bottom 40 percent grew by 6 percent from 2004 to 2009, mostly driven by
labor income and remittances, indicating that the less afﬂuent were able to beneﬁt from growth (Ibid).
Nonetheless, Tajikistan remains the poorest country in Europe and Central Asia. About one third (32
percent) of the population is poor, based on the national poverty line. Although Tajikistan reached the status of
lower-middle-income economy in 2015, with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$1,080,21 it remains
the poorest country in the ECA region. Furthermore, while monetary poverty has fallen in the last 15 years, the
country been less successful in reducing non-monetary poverty, especially in the areas of: access to education;
sanitation; and heating facilities (Azevedo, Atamanov and Rajabov 2014b).

Tajikistan’s economic model has become increasingly reliant on remittances as a source of growth
Tajikistan has become increasingly dependent on migrant labor,22 and therefore on remit-
tances, as a source of jobs and growth. Remittance inﬂows rose by a factor of ﬁve between 2004 and
2008, overtaking exports and foreign direct investment: in 2009 the value of remittances was 17 times
that of foreign direct investment, and 200 percent more than that of exports (World Bank 2011). Driven
largely by rapid growth in the Russian Federation, where 90 percent of Tajik migrants work, remittances
peaked at $4.2 billion, or close to 50 percent of the country’s GDP, in 2013, making Tajikistan the most
remittance-dependent country in the world. Remittance-fueled consumption has led to rising imports, which
reached US$5.4 billion by 2013: close to 70 percent of GDP. They have also contributed to revenue, as a result of
value-added taxes on imports. Even though they fell in 2009, remittances were critical in mitigating the impact
of the Great Recession on Tajikistan, providing much-needed foreign exchange and slowing the depreciation of
the national currency. With the fall in aluminum and cotton prices in the post-crisis period, economic growth
became increasingly dependent on the export of labor and inﬂow of remittances.
Tajikistan continues to rely heavily on commodities for exports, while imports have increased sharply.
Between 2005 and 2013, imports increased from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion in real terms: total growth of 58
percent (Figure 7). Tajikistan relies on commodities for its exports: between 2003 and 2013 aluminum and
cotton represented about 72 percent of exported products. In 2013, aluminum represented 53 percent and raw

2013, exports were ainly sent to Kazakhstan (25 percent of total exports), Turkey (23 percent), Switzerland (17

Job creation during the past decade has been weak
Years of strong economic growth in the last decade have not translated into sufﬁcient job creation.
Between 2003 and 2013 the economy added fewer than 500,000 jobs. During this period, real GDP grew by
an average of 7.2 percent per year, as employment expanded by about 2.1 percent per year. This implies an
average employment to growth elasticity of around 0.3, which is lower than in most comparator countries but
equal to the averages of the ECA region and lower-middle-income countries (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Even more
worrisome is that in Tajikistan this elasticity decreased signiﬁcantly following the Great Recession, from 0.33 in
2000–2009 to just 0.13 in 2010–2014, further exacerbating the lack of domestic job creation in recent years.
Those jobs that were created domestically were mainly in agriculture and services, sectors with low
productivity. Between 2000 and 2014, employment expanded by an annual average of 2 percent, driven by
the services and agricultural sectors. A total of approximately 580,000 net jobs were created during this period,
of which 62 percent were created in the agricultural sector (389,000) and 20 percent in services (113,000). The
industry sector shed as many jobs as the construction sector created. In fact, employment decreased by around
25,000 in industry, while employment increased by around 26,000 in construction (Figure 11 and Figure 12).

Structural transformation is lagging
There has been very little structural transformation, as the majority of workers have remained in
agriculture. According to the ofﬁcial statistical data, there was no change in the share of employment in
agriculture between 2000 and 2014, indicating a lack of structural transformation in the economy (Figure 13).
Two thirds of all those who are employed (66 percent) continue to work in agriculture,25 the sector with lowest
labor productivity. During the same period, the share of those employed in industry actually decreased from

    Exports fell somewhat in 2014 and changed composition: due to a lack of demand and low prices, unwrought aluminum represented 26
    percent of exports in 2014 and cotton 7 percent. Their share was largely taken by other commodities exports: zinc ores (9 percent); lead
    ores (9 percent) and other ores (5 percent). Gold and gold content contributed 19 percent. Source: Atlas of Economic Complexity.

7 percent to 4 percent. Employment and labor productivity increased in the trade, construction and transport
sectors, but from very low levels.
The shift toward services came largely at the expense of industry, while agriculture’s contribution
to economic output has remained virtually unchanged in the last 15 years. Remittances contributed to
the expansion of services, while industry contracted. Agriculture’s share of GDP has remained at an average
of 22 percent since 2000, while industry’s share fell from 33 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2014. Services’
contribution increased to more than half of GDP (51 percent) in 2014 from 33 percent in 2010 (Figure 14), but
as Figure 12 shows, employment is concentrated and growing in lower productivity services; high productivity
services such as transport and communications employ very few workers.

Despite economic growth, labor productivity remains low
Growth in GDP per capita was largely driven by increases in labor productivity, mostly in services, but
more recently, in agriculture and industry. In Tajikistan, annual per capita value added grew by 5.3 percent
between 2000 and 2014, almost entirely driven by increases in labor productivity. The positive contribution of
demographic change, i.e. increasing share of the working age population, was counteracted by the decrease in
labor force participation (Figure 15). A decomposition of labor productivity (value added per worker) growth (5.3
percent) during the same period shows that more than half of aggregate growth came from the services sector
(Figure 16). Labor productivity growth slowed down signiﬁcantly (3.5 percent) during the crisis period (2008–2010)
and after the crisis (2010–2014)—4.0 percent. Since 2010, industry and agriculture increased their contribution
to growth to 44 percent and 53 percent, respectively. Services, hit by the remittance declines during the crisis and
more recent slowdown, contributed less than 10 percent of total labor productivity growth since the crisis.
The movement of workers across sectors was generally not productivity enhancing. Consistent with
the trends described above, inter-sectoral shift (i.e. changes in productivity due to reallocation of workers from
less to more productive sectors) made a small, but negative contribution (-0.4 percentage points) to productivity
growth in 2000-2014. This is because labor has moved out of more productive sectors, such as industry, and
moved to low-productivity services or remained in agriculture. Contribution of inter-sectoral shift was positive
only during the crisis period, and has been negative, albeit small, since 2010.

Despite recent increases, labor productivity levels remain low. Labor productivity levels have been growing
steadily in all sectors, especially in the industry sector (Figure 17). From 2000 to 2013, labor productivity in agri-
culture and industry grew at an annual average of 5 percent each; and grew by 8 percent in the services sector.
However, between 2010 and 2013, following the crisis, labor productivity in the industry sector grew by 24
percent on average per year, entirely driven by construction, whereas productivity growth in the services sector
stalled. Despite growth, total labor productivity remains very low by international standards (Figure 18).

Recent macroeconomic developments have exposed vulnerabilities in the existing growth model
Demand for Tajikistan’s exports has recently decreased as a result of the global commodities price
crisis. The recent (since mid-2014) commodities price crisis, which has affected trading partners, such as the
Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and China (Figure 19), has affected demand for Tajikistan’s exports, and has
led to lower economic growth in Tajikistan. Tajik exports, especially aluminum and cotton, and remittances,
have driven economic growth for the last 15 years, and a reduction in demand for these exports and lower
commodity prices (Figure 20) could have a signiﬁcant impact on Tajikistan’s economy. Moreover, the U.S. dollar
value of remittances fell by 33 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to the sharp depreciation of the
Russian ruble. Greater restrictions on migration to the Russian Federation since January 2015 have also contributed
to the decline in remittances. This slowdown has affected domestic demand, which in turn has depressed growth
in services, a major contributor to economic growth in the past.
The recent currency depreciation may not have been sufﬁcient to make exports competitive. The
somoni lost 39 percent of its value against the US dollar during the period January 2014-June 2016. However,
the mitigating impact of the depreciation on the economy and the external account has been limited, as the
adjustment came with signiﬁcant delays and the depreciation was relatively limited compared to other major
regional currencies: Russian ruble (at 49 percent) and Kazakh tenge (at 55 percent). The relatively strong somoni
continues to hamper the competitiveness of exports, and also discourages import-substitution in sectors that
could potentially offer employment opportunities.
Shrinking ﬁscal space has led to adverse incentives to meet revenue targets. As a result of plunging
revenue collections on external Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs duties, ﬁscal space has become strained,
leading to adverse incentives to meet revenue targets. In order to offset the revenue shortfall, the authorities
intensiﬁed tax audits, charging heavy ﬁnes and penalties along with mounting pressure for advance payments.
This strategy by authorities has the potential to encourage entrepreneurs to shift to the shadow economy and
further erode the already limited tax base.

Banks are also showing signs of stress as a result of lower remittance ﬂows and the economic downturn.
The banking sector has suffered markedly from the slump in migrant transfers and the sluggish economic envi-
ronment in trade and services. High exposure to unhedged foreign exchange borrowers led to the widening
of open foreign exchange positions and capital erosion in light of growing non-performing loans as business
activity subsided and earnings became squeezed.

Yet several structural features continue to shape jobs outcomes
In addition to the recent macroeconomic developments, there are important structural factors which
shape job challenges in Tajikistan. A country’s level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and
demography deﬁne where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus
be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features (World Bank 2012). In addition
to a more difﬁcult macro-economic environment, Tajikistan continues to face challenges which are associated with
structural features of the country (geography), its structural transformation path (agrarian country), demographics
(youth bulge), and institutional development (legacy of transition). All of these (Box 1) are important constraints
(as well as opportunities) to Tajikistan achieving the more, better and more inclusive job outcomes.

BOX 1: SEVERAL FEATURES THAT SHAPE JOB CHALLENGES IN TAJIKISTAN
There are several features which shape Tajikistan’s development and job challenges:

¬ Geography: mountainous and landlocked.
Domestic and international trade is challenging because the country is landlocked and mountains cover about 90
percent of the country. This geographic location and topography, in addition to diﬃcult relations with some of its
neighboring countries, have led the country to become one of the least accessible, and most isolated countries in
Europe and Central Asia, with only limited regional and international connectivity.

¬ Agrarian country: almost 3 out of 4 still live in rural areas.
Tajikistan’s urbanization level was only 26.7 percent in 2014, while ECA’s average was 70.5 percent. Despite increas-
ing labor migration abroad, especially from rural areas, the urban population in the country only increased by 0.2
percentage points. As many as two thirds of the population are still engaged in agriculture.

¬ Youth bulge: fast growing and young population.
Tajikistan is also faced with a young and rapidly growing population. Recent estimates show that 55 percent of the
population in Tajikistan is under the age of 25.

¬ Legacy of transition: slow pace of structural reforms.
Tajikistan lags many of its peers in the region in terms of institutional reforms, partially a result of the civil and
political conﬂict in the early years of independence, but also because of the slow pace of reform implementation.
In EBRD Transition indicators, Tajikistan falls behind in almost every area, especially with respect to large scale
privatization; governance and enterprise restructuring; and competition policy. In general, Tajikistan could be
categorized as a “late modernizer” (Arias et al. 2014).


SUMMARY
This chapter has presented an overview of Tajikistan’s economic development and broad structural changes in
terms of job creation and labor productivity growth. The key messages are as follows:
∫ Tajikistan reached the status of a lower-middle-income economy in 2015, with a Gross National Income (GNI)
  per capita of $1,080. However, it remains the poorest country in the ECA region. Poverty remains high, even
  though remittance driven growth led to a steep decline over the last decade.
∫ Importantly, strong economic growth in the last decade has not led to sufﬁcient jobs creation. Between 2003
  and 2013, the economy added fewer than 500,000 jobs. During this period, real GDP grew by an average of
  7.2 percent per year, with employment expanding by only 2.1 percent per year.
∫ Structural transformation is lagging: the majority of workers remain in agriculture and domestic job creation
  was mainly in the agriculture and services sectors with low productivity.
∫ Growth in GDP per capita was largely driven by increases in labor productivity, but the movement of workers
  across sectors was generally not productivity enhancing. This is because labor has moved out of more pro-
  ductive sectors, such as industry, and either moved to low-productivity services or remained in agriculture.
∫ More recently, the Tajik economy has been impacted by the commodity price crisis and reduced remittances
  due to devaluation of currencies in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. These forces have led to reduced
  external demand for Tajik exports and also internal demand, which in turn have depressed growth in services,
  a major contributor to economic growth in the past.
∫ The increasingly challenging economic environment accentuates the need for domestic job creation and a
  comprehensive jobs strategy.

2. THE WORKFORCE
2
This chapter presents a picture of the workforce in Tajikistan. The workforce is Tajikistan’s most valuable resource
and has enabled the country to emerge from a painful transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union and
a brutal civil war which ended in 1997. At present though, the country is facing one of its biggest challenges
stemming from low prices for its key export commodities and the economic slowdown in its main trading part-
ners, namely the Russian Federation, China, and Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the economic recession in the Russian
Federation, together with political tensions, has led to decreased remittances and lower outﬂow of migrant workers
from Tajikistan. Emerging evidence indicates that household welfare is starting to be impacted due to lower
remittances and the economic slowdown.26
It ﬁrst presents trends in demographics and labor force participation rates, which ultimately determine the supply of
potential workers. It then proceeds to present employment and the types of jobs people have in Tajikistan, before
discussing the inequalities in labor market outcomes for different population groups as well as micro-determinants of
jobs outcomes. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the role of education and skills in labor market outcomes.
While the chapter focuses on structural issues that are affecting the creation of jobs, the availability of good jobs,
and the inclusiveness of available jobs for various sub-groups in the population, the ensuing policy recommendations
(see Chapter 4) are applicable as response measures during this labor market slowdown. The chapter primarily relies
on the analysis of household surveys for the years 2003, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 (Box 2).


DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
The potential workforce is growing at a steady clip
Tajikistan’s potential workforce is growing fast—faster than many of its neighbors in Europe and
Central Asia. Fertility rates in Tajikistan fell from a relatively high rate of 4.6 in 1995 to 3.8 in 2013, but they
remain above the 2.1 approximate replacement rate required to maintain populations at current levels without
immigration. For comparison: in Europe and Central Asia, the fertility rate is an average of 2 children per woman,
and in lower-middle-income countries women give birth to 3 children on average. The high fertility rate means
that Tajikistan’s population of young people is large and is expected to continue growing for several decades.
The working-age population (15-64 year olds) rose from 3.31 million in 2000 to 5.23 million in 2015, which
adds an average of 40,000 people to the labor force each year; and this working-age population is expected
to increase to 7.04 million by 2030 (Figure 21) while the working age populations in many other European
and Central Asian countries are expected to contract. For instance, the working age population in the Russian
Federation is expected to shrink by 11 percent from 99.7 million in 2015 to 88.8 million in 2030.
In addition to a relatively large working age population, Tajikistan also has the beneﬁt of a youthful
population and a relatively low elderly population. The country has a low elderly dependency ratio; the
share of people over 65 years is 3.3 percent. The share of Tajikistan’s elderly population is expected to increase
to 5.3 percent by 2030. At the same time, 36 percent of the Tajik population is aged 15 or under.27 The youthful
population will ensure strong growth in the working age population for several decades.

    Average per capita real income fell across many population subgroups between November 2015 and April 2016, including people in
    urban and rural areas, and in both the bottom 40 percent and top 60 percent of the population in terms of consumption. Source:

BOX 2: HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA USED
The analysis in this chapter primarily relies on World Bank / GIZ Tajikistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013),
three rounds of the Tajikistan Living Standard Measurement Surveys (2003, 2007, and 2009), and the Tajikistan
Household Panel Survey (2011). All surveys are nationally representative, allow for individual analysis of labor market
outcomes, and household welfare analysis. The World Bank / GIZ Tajikistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013)
contains a labor market module, detailed questions pertaining to cognitive and non-cognitive skills of a working
age adult in the family, and questions about intentions to migrate and behavior after migration.
Tajikistan does not have a regular Labor Force Survey (LFS). The latest LFS was conducted in 2009, and the new
LFS is expected to be ﬁelded in 2016. The Household Budget Survey (HBS), which is conducted quarterly, does
not currently allow for an individual level analysis of labor market outcomes. With the support of the World Bank,
TajStat is considering an integrated regularly conducted survey on the basis of the HBS. In the meantime, the lack
of regular up-to-date information on the labor market situation signiﬁcantly limits the policy making in this area.
Oﬃcial statistics on employment in the formal sector draws from mandatory enterprise reporting, but information
on informal employment is not up to date.
Going forward, implementation of regular labor market monitoring based on regular surveys, including the situation
with migration and informal employment, is critical to support implementation of jobs-focused policies in the country.


Too many working age adults are not in the labor force
Tajikistan has a working age population, deﬁned as 15-64 year olds, of about 4.06 million people
who can contribute productively to the economy. Of this working age population, about 1.7 million (43
percent of the working age population) are in the labor force and therefore, they are either employed or looking
for work (Figure 22). Most people in the labor force in Tajikistan are employed, and therefore, unemployment
rates are relatively low at 5 percent.28 These low unemployment rates have held over the years despite some
ﬂuctuations in GDP growth. As a result, 1.6 million people, or 95 percent of the labor force, are employed in
either formal or informal jobs.
Overall labor force participation in Tajikistan is low relative to its comparators, especially for women
(Figure 23). In 2013, the female labor force participation rate was 27 percent, 41 percentage points below the
male labor force participation rate of 68 percent. In comparison, female labor force participation in Kazakhstan


 28
      Estimates vary, however, depending on the survey used. Tajikistan does not have a regular Labor Force Survey (LFS). The latest LFS (as of
      report writing) was conducted in 2009 and showed an unemployment rate of about 11 percent. Oﬃcial statistical sources report unem-
      ployment based on the number of registered unemployed, which tends to be about 2–2.5 percent.

is 75 percent. The Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have female labor force participation rates of 60 percent and
51 percent, respectively; while in European and Central Asian countries this Figure is 52 percent. Male labor force
participation, at 68 percent, is also lower than the average male labor force participation rates in Kazakhstan,
the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan of around 80 percent. Europe and Central Asia countries have an average
male labor force participation rate of 75 percent.
Labor force participation rates have declined sharply since the collapse of the Soviet Union. During
the Soviet Union era, labor force participation rates were held artiﬁcially high. ILO estimates show that about
70 percent of all 15-64 year olds participated in the labor force before independence in 1990.29 In 1990, male

labor force participation was 79 percent, and female labor force participation was close to 63 percent, high by
international standards. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the ensuing civil war in Tajikistan (1992–
1997), industrial output declined and labor was reallocated across sectors. Industries that had employed a high
proportion of women (textiles, manufacturing, and agriculture) were severely affected (Asian Development Bank
2000). In addition, men migrated, mostly to the Russian Federation, but also to Kazakhstan, in large numbers
starting in the 2000s for employment. Women, on the other hand, were increasingly called upon to become
full-time homemakers. In general, focus group interviews reveal that when young women have children to take
care of, or in some cases their families ban women from working outside the home, then women do not look
for a job, despite having completed their education (Davalos, et al., 2016). By 2003, labor force participation
rates had fallen to 47 percent for women, and 66 percent for men (Figure 23). By 2013, the female labor force
participation rate had decreased to 27 percent, and the male participation rate had inched up to 68 percent;
but the disparity between male and female labor force participation rates is signiﬁcant.
Between 2003 and 2013, adult labor force participation rates fell, but the reason may be an increase in
inactivity and possibly migration opportunities. Between 2003 and 2013, labor force participation rates fell
from 56 to 50 percent (Figure 24). There are two possible explanations for the reduction in labor force participa-
tion: ﬁrst, inactivity rates increased, mostly driven by women exiting the labor force. This trend began following
independence and during the civil war. Second, as adults increasingly began to seek out opportunities in the
Russian Federation in the 2000s, this led to increases in the reservation wage (the minimum acceptable wage
for a worker to choose to enter the labor force) and family income also increased. Other studies have found
that the inﬂow of remittances in Tajikistan has led to reduced labor force participation among remaining family
members (Justino and Shemyakina 2012; Abdulloev 2013). Workers exited the labor force either because domestic
wages were too low or because household income was sufﬁciently buoyed by remittances.
Today, around 1.8 million people are not in employment nor in education, and therefore, Tajikistan’s
most valuable resource—its human capital—is underutilized. Of Tajikistan’s approximately 4.06 million
working age population, about 2.3 million are not in the labor force. Approximately 500,500 of those who are
not in the labor force are enrolled in school. However, the remaining 1.8 million are not investing in human
capital and are not contributing to economic activity. We refer to the working age population that is both not
in the labor force and not in education as inactive.

Outmigration has become a crucial source of jobs for Tajik workers
Although there is no consensus on the number of migrants, it appears that almost one million of
Tajik citizens30 work outside the country and Tajikistan is the most remittance-dependent country in
the world (Bakanova et al. 2015). A large share of the workforce, including one third of men aged 20–39, has
opted to leave the country for better pay. Most of these migrant workers (90 percent) end up in the Russian
Federation, mainly working in construction, trade, housing and cleaning services, agriculture, and maintenance
(Ajwad et al. 2014; World Bank 2016c; World Bank 2015b). With almost all migrants working in the Russian
Federation, the recent devaluation of the ruble has had a signiﬁcant impact on remittance-receiving households,
who collectively received just under $4 billion in 2014 (World Bank 2016c). Russia’s Central Bank reported
that the amount of money transferred to Tajikistan from Russia fell by 66.6 percent, from US$ 3.831 billion in
2014 to US$ 1.278 billion in 2015. The ruble was devalued by more than 50 percent between July 2014 and
March 2016, although this devaluation is not the only reason for remittance reduction. In particular, the Russian
Federation implemented legislative changes that have made it difﬁcult and expensive for Tajik migrants to work
in the Russian Federation. In 2014, the Russian legislation placed 270,000 Tajik workers on the re-entry ban list.
The recession in the Russian Federation, following the oil price collapse, combined with the impact of economic
sanctions,31 is therefore, contributing to lower demand for Tajik migrants in the Russian Federation.
The typical migrant worker is a relatively young married man who has secondary education and lives
in rural Tajikistan. According to the 2013 household survey data, more than 90 percent of migrants are men
and about 67 percent of these men are married. They are relatively young (under 30 years old) and they have
completed secondary education. These migrants support households that are on average 7.5 persons in size,
and in most cases, the migrants have children. About 77 percent of migrants live in households located in rural
areas of Tajikistan.
The typical migrant is either an unskilled worker or is not employed prior to migrating, and therefore,
the migrant taps a number of sources to pull together the funds needed to migrate. In fact, 46 percent
of migrants are unemployed prior to migrating. This might reﬂect the difﬁcult job prospects in Tajikistan, but
it might also reﬂect the higher reservation wages held by potential migrants who have foreign wage rates on
their minds and hence, turn down job opportunities that do not pay sufﬁciently high wages. Despite the lure of
migration opportunities, and therefore, higher wages, migrants often have to use savings (36 percent), borrow
from relatives (22 percent), friends (13 percent) and others (8 percent) to make the journey.

   While estimates vary, according to Russia’s Federal Migration Service, as of June 2015 there were 992,170 migrants from Tajikistan in the
   Russian Federation (Bakanova et al. 2015). However, oﬃcial estimates of TajStat are 529,000 labor migrants in 2015.
31
   In 2015, the consequences of these twin shocks caused real GDP to contract by 3.7 percent (World Bank 2016d).

                                                                                                                                               32
EMPLOYMENT AND JOB TYPES
Among labor force participants, employment rates are relatively high
In 2013, there were more than 1.73 million people in the labor force and about 1.6 million adults
working in Tajikistan (excluding current international migrants). Paid employees made up about 70
percent of the workforce; the self-employed were around 10 percent; and unpaid workers constituted 18 percent
(Figure 22).32 Every country has a different labor market proﬁle of their working age population, and a large
share of the working age population in Tajikistan is engaged in unpaid work and signiﬁcantly fewer are engaged
in elf-employment. Tajikistan has a relatively low unemployment rate on average, and therefore, employment
rates mimic labor force participation rates.33

A majority of jobs are in the informal sector
The informal sector represents a large and growing source of jobs for workers. Although the deﬁnition
of informality varies across countries (Perry et al. 2007), the following deﬁnition is used here: informal sector
salaried workers are those who lack an employment contract or are unpaid family workers excluding those
who are self-employed. Between 2007 and 2013, the proportion of all wage employees in the informal sector
increased from 28 percent to 39 percent (Figure 25). The share of unpaid workers has increased slightly from
16 to 18 percent in 2013. Not surprisingly, the informal sector is particularly large in rural areas and agriculture,
where the share of unpaid family workers is particularly high. It is also higher in more remote regions such as
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO).
Informal sector employment is a crucial source of jobs for the working age population who do not
have a desirable formal sector job. Because of the lower barriers to entry in the informal sector, there are
usually more startups among informal ﬁrms and these informal ﬁrms usually provide jobs to young, inexperienced,
and unskilled workers. Studies have shown that some workers seek out informal sector work because of the ﬂex-
ibility associated with the work (Maloney 2004).

      There is variation in unemployment rates across socio-economic groups. Men are more likely to be unemployed than women; and 24-64
      year olds are more likely to be unemployed than 15-24 year olds.

Informal (including unpaid) workers tend to be younger men with less educational attainment, and
from rural areas, GBAO, and Khatlon. They tend to work in construction, trade, and agriculture. Additional
stylized facts about informal workers are as follows (Figure 26):
∫ Informal (including unpaid) workers have lower educational attainment (are lower skilled) than
  formal workers. While only 11 percent of informal workers have completed higher education, 32 percent of
  formal workers have a tertiary degree. At the other end of the spectrum, almost one in ﬁve informal workers
  has not completed secondary education compared to one in ten among formal sector workers. This is con-
  sistent with the situation in other middle- and lower-income countries.34
∫ Informal workers tend to be a little younger than formal sector workers. More than 35 percent of
  informal sector workers are under the age of 30, while only 24 percent of formal sector workers are under
  age 30. This demographic pattern has been observed in other countries too, where the informal sector
  appears to function as an important step in the school to work transition, especially for poorly educated
  youth (Maloney, 2004).35 In Mexico, the mean age of informal salaried workers is ﬁve years lower than that
  of formal sector workers and 14 years lower than that of the informal self-employed workers. In Tajikistan
  the difference between formal and informal sector workers’ mean ages is only 1.55 years. It is possible that
  the age difference between formal and informal sector workers in Tajikistan is small because younger workers
  have a preference for international migration opportunities over domestic informal sector work.36
∫ Informal workers tend to be poorer than formal sector workers. While 18 percent of informal workers
  are in the poorest quintile of household consumption, only 11 percent of formal workers are in the bottom
  quintile. At the other extreme, while almost 22 percent of informal workers are in the richest quintile, more
  than 30 percent of formal workers are in the richest quintile.
∫ Informal workers are more likely to live in rural areas, GBAO, and Khatlon. More than 75 percent
  of informal workers live in rural areas, while only 61 percent of formal workers live in rural areas. Although

    Koettl, Packard and Montenegro (2012) ﬁnd that across Europe, too, people who have only completed basic education are more likely to
    be informally employed. Perry, et al. (2007) ﬁnd that workers who have not completed their primary education are more likely to be in the
    informal sector (either earning a salary or in self-employment) in Argentina, Bolivia, or in the Dominican Republic.
 35
    Koettl, Packard and Montenegro (2012) also ﬁnd that 15-24 year olds in some European countries are more likely to be employed in the
    informal sector (deﬁned as jobs with no labor contract).
 36
    Abdulloev, Gang, and Landon-Lane (2012) ﬁnd empirical evidence which suggests that migration and informality substitute for one
    another in Tajikistan.

                                                                                                                                                  34
      the differences in the distribution of workers across regions are marginal, informal workers are slightly more
      prevalent in GBAO, Regions of Republican Subordination (RRP), and Khatlon.
∫ Informal workers are more likely to work in construction and agriculture. More than 35 percent
  of informal workers are engaged in the agriculture sector, while 17 percent of formal employees are in
  agriculture. Similarly, 19 percent of informal workers are engaged in the construction sector compared to 10
  percent among formal  workers.

Working conditions in the informal sector are inferior to those in the formal sector, and can impose
costs to the economy at large. Consistent with evidence from other countries in the region (Koettl, Packard
and Montenegro 2012), jobs in the informal sector in Tajikistan are different from jobs in the formal sector. A
bit surprisingly, there is no evidence that informal sector wages are lower than formal sector wages, controlling
for individual and job characteristics.37 However, despite potentially higher pay, informal sector jobs offer sig-
niﬁcantly less protection and poorer working conditions. The following are some stylized facts:
∫ Formal sector workers are able to manage risk better than informal sector workers. Around 50
  percent of workers in the formal sector are entitled to sick leave, but fewer than 16 percent of workers in the
  informal sector have this beneﬁt. Moreover, people working informally typically do not have access to public
  social insurance instruments to manage shocks. In addition, workers in the formal sector have better access
  to pensions (M-Vector forthcoming).
∫ Informal work tends to be more physical than work in the formal sector. Two-thirds of tasks are
  characterized as “manual/physical” in the informal sector, while 45 percent of tasks in the formal sector are
  characterized as such (Ajwad et al. 2014).

And many jobs are seasonal or temporary
Job quality can be measured in a number of ways, but a number of job quality indicators show that
this is a concern in Tajikistan. While workers are drawn to regular installment pay, formal sector work, and
permanent or longer term jobs, too many jobs in Tajikistan are: in the informal sector; available only during
certain times of year; receive payment only occasionally; and are temporary. The job quality trends show a slight
deterioration over time. While the changes are small, seasonal and temporary jobs have become more common
since 2007, and permanent or long-term jobs are less common (Figure 27).

      On the contrary, Arabsheibani and Staneva (2012) ﬁnd a signiﬁcant informal employment wage premium across the whole earnings distribu-
      tion. The wage premium in the informal sector could try to compensate for lack of beneﬁts and security (compensating diﬀerentials theory).
      Therefore there may be a tradeoﬀ between higher pay but no beneﬁts or protection versus a more secure job with beneﬁts that pays less.

                                                                                                                                                    35
Public sector employment remains sizable
The Soviet legacy resulted in a bloated public sector relative to the overall share of employment
in Tajikistan. Until the mid-1990s, the public sector dominated most economic activities, directly or through
publicly owned enterprises (Van Eeghen et al. 2014). Public sector employment has since fallen in Tajikistan,
reﬂecting privatization efforts, but public sector work as a share of total employment remains substantial
(Figure 28). Public sector employment38 as a share of total employment in Tajikistan is relatively high at about
28 percent in 2013, while it was 17 percent in Armenia in 2010, 15 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2007,
and 13 percent in Turkey in 2010.
Public sector workers earn higher wages, largely as a result of their better socioeconomic character-
istics. Males in the public sector earn, on average, 132 somoni ($6.7) per month more than males in the formal
private sector; while women who work in the public sector earn 78 somoni ($9.9) per month more than women
in the formal private sector. These ﬁgures do not account for such differences as education level or experience
of workers, and therefore, we apply an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess whether the premium paid to
public sector workers can be explained by valuable socioeconomic traits or if it is a premium associated with
public sector employment. We ﬁnd that workers with socioeconomic characteristics valued by the labor market
self-select into the public sector. For example, 47 percent of men in the public sector have completed higher
education, while only 17 percent of private sector males have the same attainment rate. Similarly, 34 percent
of women in the public sector have completed higher education, as opposed to only 18 percent in the private
sector. There is also a high disparity for women with regard to vocational education among public sector workers
relative to private sector workers. Almost 31 percent of female workers in the public sector have received some
form of vocational education, as opposed to only 13 percent of formal private sector workers.


INEQUALITY IN LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES
Youth have weaker jobs outcomes
Youth (15-24 year olds) labor force participation rates have always been lower than 25-64 year old
labor force participation rates. Between 2003 and 2013, youth labor force participation rates fell from 42
percent to 34 percent (Figure 27 above). Much of this fall in labor force participation can be explained by an

increase in inactivity by female youth (see below). Some of the decline in youth labor force participation rates
over the last decade is explained by increasing educational enrollment. That is, youth enrollment in education
increased by 87 percent for those not in work during 2003 and 2013.
Youth idleness, i.e. youth who are neither employed nor in school, is high by international standards.39
In 2013, almost 650,000 youth in Tajikistan, 41 percent of 15-24 year olds, were neither employed nor in edu-
cation (NEET) (Figure 29). This is high by international standards. In the Russian Federation, about 12 percent
of 15-24 year olds are neither employed nor in education; this Figure is 20 percent in Ukraine, 21 percent in
the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic, and 25 percent in Turkey. Rates of youth who are neither employed nor in
education in OECD and the EU-28 are about 17 and 19 percent, respectively;40 and in Latin America, one in
every ﬁve young persons is neither employed nor in education (Hoyos et al. 2015).
NEET rates among youth have proven to be very persistent, despite a decade of strong growth in
Tajikistan. Between 2003 and 2013, the share of NEET among youth increased from 37 to 41 percent despite
relatively favorable economic conditions (Figure 29). A recent study in Latin America found that society needs to
focus more on young people who are neither employed nor in school, because of the particular risks associated
with youth inactivity: i) it contributes to the intergenerational persistence of inequality; ii) it is linked to crime and
violence in some contexts; and iii) failing to address the NEETs problem could prevent a country from exploiting
a demographic window of opportunity (Hoyos et al. 2015). Research in ECA countries has shown that youth
who are neither employed nor studying are less likely to trust other members of society or to participate in civic
and political activities than youth who are engaged in work or studies (Arias et al. 2014). These are compelling
reasons for addressing youth employment and schooling needs, and possibly in a more urgent and focused sense
than other subgroups in society.
Female youth are more likely to be not in employed or school than male youth. Between 2003 and
2013, female youth have always maintained higher NEET rates than male youth. In 2013, 54 percent of female
youth were not in employment or school, while 27 percent of male youth of the same age group were NEET
(Figure 30). NEET rates of female youth rose from 47 percent to 60 percent between 2003 and 2011 and then

    These rates are similar to not in education, employment, or training (NEET) rates, which are the rates of 15-24 year olds who are not in employ-
    ment, education, or training. For Tajikistan, where training rates are very low, we refer to NEET for people who are not in employment or education.

dropped to 52 percent between 2011 and 2013. On the other hand, NEET rates for young men were relatively
stable between 2003 and 2013, maintaining a rate of around 26 percent.
The majority of young men transition from school to work while most young women transition
to inactivity. Until about age 16, there is little difference between the activity choices of women and men
(Figure 31). Both groups are overwhelmingly similar at school, mostly due to the national compulsory educa-
tion requirements. However, after age 16, the differences between women and men become stark, with two
noteworthy patterns emerging. First, overall labor force participation rates increase from around zero at age 16;
male participation in the labor force increases sharply to almost 80 percent by age 35, but women’s participa-
tion increases to only 30 percent by age 35. Second, the proportion of both women and men who are neither
employed nor in school increases from close to zero at age 16, but labor inactivity for women, as measured the
indicator, increases very sharply. Female labor inactivity rates are low until age 16 and by age 25, they reach
about 70 percent. In contrast, male inactivity rates increase to about 30 percent by age 20.
Too many young men and women who could work feel discouraged from seeking work. Discouraged
workers are deﬁned as people who are not in the labor force and are available to work, but are no longer looking
for a job because they do not believe they will ﬁnd one. The share of discouraged workers is particularly high
among young people; approximately one in six young men and one in ten young women aged 20–24 are too
discouraged to look for work (Figure 35). By comparison, the average share of discouraged workers among the
young labor force (aged 15–24) was just 0.5 percent in OECD countries in 2012 (Figure 32). Tajikistan has not
been able to absorb working-age young people into the labor market, limiting the extent to which the country
can turn the youth bulge into a demographic dividend.

Recent studies find that inadequate skills and experience are at the root of labor market
discouragement. A qualitative study has found that youth face particular barriers to ﬁnding jobs, as they do
not have the skills and experience required by employers (Davalos et al., 2016). Lacking work experience, youth
may choose to exit the labor force after a few failed attempts. It is also possible that some of the labor market
discouragement in Tajikistan is a result of young people leaving the domestic labor force in favor of international
migration. There is an urgent need to address these high levels of youth labor market discouragement, partly
because this is a wasted resource, but partly because the longer the youth are in a state of inactivity, the harder
it becomes to reactivate these workers.
Among youth who are employed, youth are more likely to work in the private sector, but almost
a third of youth work in unpaid jobs (Figure 33). More than half of employed youth (15-24 year olds) are
employed in the private sector, which is higher than the share of employed 25-64 year olds who work in the
private sector (43 percent). Likewise, the latter are also more likely to be employed in the public sector than
employed youth. However, youth are signiﬁcantly more likely to work as unpaid workers in family businesses:
30 percent of youth compared to 15 percent of adults. A very small share of youth (about 5 percent) are self-
employed compared to 11 percent among adults.

Women are at a disadvantage in employment, and the trends are not encouraging
Between 2003 and 2013, the disparity between male and female employment rates has increased
from a relatively high base (Figure 34). In 2003, male employment rates were 67 percent and for women this
Figure was 46 percent; by 2013, male employment rates had declined by 6 percentage points to 61 percent, while
the women’s rate had decreased by 20 percentage points to 26 percent. There are several reasons why women
would have lower employment rates. The reasons range from skills mismatches, to cultural factors, family responsi-
bilities, and discrimination by employers. One factor, however, is that legislation in Tajikistan prohibits women from
employment in certain sectors and occupations, and this may be impacting employment rates (see Spotlight 2).
Across the age distribution, women are less likely to engage in employment at particular times in
their lives. To examine employment rates across age, we compare working age Tajik men and women with the
equivalent population in Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Figure 35).
We ﬁnd that, there is a big disparity between employment rates of Tajik women and OECD women (approxi-
mately 30 percentage points), especially in the 20-34 age group. A recent qualitative study ﬁnds that caring for
children is a signiﬁcant obstacle for women to participate in the labor market (Davalos et al. 2016). If Tajikistan’s
female employment rates were on par with those of OECD countries, there would be 700,000 more women
contributing to the Tajik economy today (Ajwad et al. 2014).

The public sector is a more important source of employment for women and so is unpaid work. The
public sector is a more important source of employment for women than for men, while employed men are more
likely to be in a private sector job. The share of women who are employed in the public sector is 32 percent,
while 26 percent of men are employed in the public sector (Figure 36). On the other hand, the share of employed
men who are wage employees in the private sector is almost 50 percent, while only 37 percent of female wage
employees are in the private sector. Importantly, women are much more likely to be in unpaid employment in
family businesses (25 percent of women compared to 13 percent among men).

The most desirable jobs are in Dushanbe
Employment rates do not favor big cities, as they sometimes do in many other countries. There is very
little variation in employment rates, except in GBAO where employment rates are signiﬁcantly higher than other
regions of Tajikistan (Figure 37). The employment rate in the densely populated region of Dushanbe is almost the
same as Khatlon, which is a signiﬁcantly less dense region of the country where agriculture is the primary activity.
Workers in Dushanbe are more likely to be public sector workers and more likely to be paid in
regular installments. Workers in Dushanbe have more desirable jobs than in any other region of Tajikistan
(Figure 38) Almost 49 percent of workers are in the public sector in Dushanbe, while in all other regions of
Tajikistan fewer than 30 percent of workers are engaged in the public sector. In Dushanbe, almost 59 percent
of employees are paid in regular installments, while fewer than 40 percent of employees in each of the other
regions of Tajikistan are paid in regular installments. Surprisingly, salaried formal sector employment is rela-
tively equally distributed across regions.

Workers from richer households have better quality jobs
There is some variation in employment outcomes across household consumption quintiles. The share
of workers who earn wages and salaries vary marginally across household consumption quintiles, a proxy for
household wealth (Figure 39). Among workers from households in the poorest quintile, 72 percent earn wages
and salaries, while for households in the third quintile, 66 percent earn wages and salaries; and among the
richest households, 71 percent are earners. There is more variation in the incidence of unpaid workers, which
follows an inverted U-shaped curve across household consumption quintiles. Among the poorest households,
about 15 percent of workers are unpaid; while for households in quintile 3, about 20 percent are unpaid; and
for the richest households, about 12 percent receive no pay. Self-employment among the richest households is
about 5 percentage points higher than that for the poorest households.

Richer workers are more likely to have better quality jobs (regular installment pay, formal sector
work, and public sector jobs). While job quality can be measured in a number of ways, one measure is
whether workers are paid in regular installments. Richer working age adults are more likely to be paid in regular
installments. While 29 percent of workers in the poorest quintile are paid using regular installments, 45 percent
of workers in the richest quintile are paid in this way (Figure 39). On the other hand, piecewise work (mainly
construction and agriculture) is more common among workers in poor households. 47 percent of workers in
the poorest quintile and only 29 percent of workers in the richest quintile receive income from piecewise work.
Piecewise work is also more common in the informal sector, for seasonal or temporary work; while regular
installment pay is more common among formal sector workers with permanent or longer term jobs.
There is a clear relationship between household welfare and job quality. It is not easy to determine whether
households are rich because they have better quality jobs, or whether richer households have access to better
quality jobs (because of networks, location, education, etc.). However, there is a clear pattern that shows that
workers from richer households have more desirable jobs. For example, of all workers who belong to the poorest
quintile, 19 percent work in the public sector, while of all workers who belong to the richest quintile, 35 percent
work in the public sector (Figure 40). Of all workers who belong to the poorest quintile, 45 percent work in the
informal sector, while of all workers who belong to the richest quintile, only 26 percent work in the informal sector.


MICRO-DETERMINANTS OF JOB OUTCOMES
The micro-determinants of employment outcomes are revealing
Gender, educational attainment, and location of residence determine employment outcomes.
Multinomial logit models of employment outcomes reveal that: females are about 23 percentage points less
likely to be employed than otherwise identical males; people residing in RRP, Dushanbe, Sogd, and GBAO are
between 14 and 19 percent less likely to be employed than otherwise identical people living in the Khatlon
region (Figure 41). People who have completed secondary school are more than eight percentage points more
likely to be employed; and those with post-secondary school attainment are more than 25 percentage points
more likely to be employed than otherwise identical people who have not completed primary school.
Gender, educational attainment, and location of residence also determine the type of employment.
Females are 12 percentage points less likely to be private sector wage employees than males. Residents of RRP
and GBAO are 13 and 25 percentage points, respectively, less likely to be in private sector wage employment
than residents of the omitted Khatlon (Figure 41). Primary and secondary school completion increases the
chances of private sector wage employment by about 30 percentage points relative to people who did not

complete primary school; and rural residents are about 16 percentage points more likely to work in private wage
employment. The high incidence of private wage employment in rural areas and in some geographic regions
of Tajikistan, is explained by agricultural employment, which includes informal sector employment. The multi-
nomial logit also shows the determinants of public sector wage employment. Unsurprisingly, people who have
post-secondary educational attainment are 44 percent more likely to receive public sector wages than people
who have not completed primary school.
Holding personal characteristics constant, gender, experience, educational attainment, location of
residence, and sector of employment all determine wages. We estimate a mincer regression with log
monthly wages for working age adults as the dependent variable and a number of socioeconomic characteris-
tics as the independent variables.41 We ﬁnd that the sector of employment is the most important determinant
of wages once all other factors are held constant. In Tajikistan, working age adults who are engaged in the

identical adults in the agriculture sector. Results show that educational attainment is crucial in that working
age adults who have attained post-secondary education earn 57 percent more than otherwise identical adults
with no primary school education (Figure 42). Women earn 36 percent less than otherwise identical men. In
addition, experience, measured by age, matters, but it diminishes as more and more experience accumulates.
Finally, adults in Dushanbe earn 43 percent more than otherwise identical adults in Khatlon.



EDUCATION, SKILLS, AND LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES
A number of socioeconomic factors emerge as important determinants of labor market outcomes,
but education and skills deserve particular mention. There is signiﬁcant demand for skills in the Tajik
economy, as evidenced by substantial positive labor market returns to both cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
Yet, considerable skills gaps persist. Inactive individuals in Tajikistan have signiﬁcantly lower cognitive and
non-cognitive skills than employed individuals. Additionally, a large share of employers reports shortages of
adequately skilled individuals in the workforce (Ajwad et al. 2014).

have not completed secondary education, 35 percent are employed, while more than 79 percent of those who
have completed higher education are employed (Figure 43). These positive correlations between educational
attainment and employment outcomes are observed in other countries as well. In Europe, for example, employ-

employment rates of those who had attained no more than a primary or lower secondary education was 52.6

educational attainment. For 25-64 year old adults who have not completed secondary education, 14 percent are
public sector wage employees, and 53 percent are private sector wage employees. However, for 25-64 year olds
who have completed higher education, the public sector is more appealing. Speciﬁcally, 64 percent of 25-64
year olds who have completed higher education are public sector wage employees, and only 21 percent are in
the private sector. Self-employment does not show a big incidence gap between 25-64 year olds who have not
completed secondary education and those who have completed secondary special or technical education. At
the other extreme, almost 64 percent of 25-65 age adults who have less than secondary education are neither
employed nor in school, while only 48 percent of all 25-65 year olds are neither employed  nor in school.
While education completion rates have been relatively high at the secondary level, an increasing
share of people, women in particular, are not completing secondary school. The education system in
Europe and Central Asia was well-regarded prior to transition, as a result of the Soviet system’s emphasis on
equalizing the population’s access to education (Davalos, et al., 2016). Tajikistan’s achievement in terms of access
to general education remains strong: educational enrollment is high at the secondary level. The proportion of
adults (25 years and older) who have achieved at least a secondary level education is approximately 80 percent
(Figure 44). Worryingly, however, recent cohorts of women are not completing secondary school nor secondary
special/technical education. Secondary completion rates are 54 percent for 25-29 year olds, while for 45-49 year
olds, the completion rates are 66 percent. More recent generations are also stopping with less than secondary
general completion. Among 25-29 year olds, 34 percent completed less than secondary, while among 45-49
year olds, 14 percent completed less than secondary level.

Female educational attainment has either stayed constant or declined over time, while male educa-
tional attainment has largely improved. A closer look at secondary school completion shows an unambiguous
increase in secondary school completion rates for men in both urban and rural areas for younger cohorts relative to
older cohorts, implying that secondary school completion rates are increasing. However, for females, the pattern
is ambiguous. For example, urban cohorts of females aged 40-44 have a higher education attainment rate than
20-24 year olds; rural cohorts of females aged 50-54 have a considerably higher secondary educational attainment
than females aged 20-29. The trends become starker when special/technical education attainment is observed.
Female educational attainment of special/technical education has decreased for younger cohorts in urban areas
and remained steady, though at a lower level, in rural areas. This is a concerning trend especially considering the
government’s efforts to improve overall access to education in recent years at all levels.

Skills and education are particularly important; however, access to education is not equitable
Education completion is correlated with wealth, and that is a problem. The higher education completion
rate is nearly three times greater among men from households in the richest per capita consumption quintile
(33 percent), compared to men from the poorest quintile (12 percent). Among women, this ratio is ﬁve to one.
In poorest-quintile households, approximately one-third of all men and women have not completed secondary
education, compared to just 8 percent of men and 20 percent of women in households in the richest quintile
(Figure 45). Education completion is higher for individuals from wealthier households, implying that richer
households have better access and better ability to complete education than poorer households.

SUMMARY
This chapter presented a picture of Tajikistan’s workforce. The key messages are as follows:
∫ Tajikistan’s potential workforce is growing rapidly due to the high fertility rate. As a result, the country is expe-
  riencing a demographic dividend, which is especially noticeable relative to many other countries in Eastern
  Europe and Eastern Asia.
∫ But too many working age adults are not in the labor force, and therefore, are not contributing to economic
  growth. For some groups, labor force participation rates have declined sharply in the last decade, and for
  women, the rates are now among the lowest in the world.
∫ Outmigration has become a crucial source of jobs for Tajik workers. As many as one million Tajiks, mostly
  young men, have migrated for work, with 90 percent of workers traveling to the Russian Federation. However,
  recent developments indicate that, going forward, fewer Tajiks will be able to ﬁnd work in the Russian
  Federation because of a number of legislative restrictions on Tajik migrants attempting to work there.
∫ The quality of jobs is an issue: the majority of jobs are in the informal sector; and many jobs are seasonal,
  temporary or occasional. The informal sector workers are typically young, unskilled, rural residents, who work
  in the agriculture and construction sectors.
∫ Public sector employment remains sizable, but tends to beneﬁt urban residents and the better educated,
  in particular.
∫ The labor market is characterized by demographic, geographic, and wealth disparities—youth, women,
  workers outside Dushanbe, and workers from poorer households have less desirable jobs outcomes.
∫ Skills and education are particularly important determinants of jobs outcomes; however, female educational
  attainment by younger cohorts has declined. Younger cohorts of females are not completing secondary school
  and special/technical education as much as older cohorts, implying that secondary school and special/technical
  education completion rates might be decreasing over time.
∫ Access to and completion of education is not equitable. Workers in richer households have higher educational
  attainment, and, since higher educational attainment leads to better employment outcomes, there is some
  evidence that richer households have an intergenerational advantage.

SPOTLIGHT 1: WOMEN FACE LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT
Many factors contribute to the observed low female labor force participation rates in Tajikistan; one factor is its
Labor Code. Tajikistan’s Labor Code (Article 160) prohibits women’s employment in: underground jobs, diﬃcult jobs,
jobs in harmful conditions, or jobs linked to manual lifting and moving of heavy loads. The list of speciﬁc sectors and
professions where female employment is not allowed is established by Ordinance No. 240 of 25 July 1978 inherited
from Soviet times. Tajikistan chose to preserve the restrictive list in its original form at the national level,43 the only
post-Soviet Republic to do so despite the archaic nature of the restrictions. According to the ordinance, women are
excluded from numerous professions and tasks that are perceived to be harmful or diﬃcult in around 36 sectors of
the economy. Crucially, women are not allowed to engage in “dangerous” professions or tasks within economic sectors
important to Tajikistan such as construction, mining, geological exploration and topography, railway transport and
subways, even agriculture. Not all restrictions are enforced, but their existence may mean that some women avoid
these sectors for employment and training; male employers may also avoid hiring women for these jobs.
According to the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law project, which monitors legal and regulatory barriers
to women’s employment in 173 economies, Tajikistan stands out as a particularly restrictive country for women
(World Bank 2016e).
The existing legal framework (Ordinance No. 240 of 25 July 1978) prevents gender parity in the labor market,
particularly in export sectors:
¬ restrictions are in place in the production of minerals like aluminum, zinc and lead ores, gold, which are key exports
¬ women are prohibited from 32 professions and tasks within the non-ferrous metallurgy sector; this includes
   the production of aluminum, zinc dust, silicon, also processing cinders for the production of mercury (Part VIII)
¬ women are restricted from nearly 28 professions and tasks in the metal industry, including forging and
   thermal work, gas welding, or melting metals and alloys (Part I)
¬ in the textile and light industry, women are prohibited from about 19 professions and tasks. Women cannot
   work as press operators in primary cotton processing, scourers engaged in the ﬂeshing and breakdown of
   major raw hides, or leather cleaners (Part XVI)
¬ women are also barred from about 25 professions and tasks within the food industry including: processing
   ﬁsh, or working on a kneading machine with a movable capacity of more than 330 liters, where manual trans-
   fers are needed (Part XVII)
¬ in the agricultural sector, women cannot drive tractors equipped with dusters and sprayers when working with
   pesticides, or work in the pits, and septic tanks (Part XXXVI).

                                                                                                                                        48
Regulatory restrictions also keep women from some occupations which span many sectors of the economy in Tajikistan.
The legislation does not allow women to become rescuers, crane operators, or ﬁreﬁghters. In addition, Tajik women
may not work during night hours, except in certain sectors of the economy where it is particularly needed.44
Unsurprisingly, restrictions on sectors and occupations have led to gender-segregated areas of study. Most girls
in Tajikistan remain in ﬁelds commonly associated with women’s traditional roles in society, such as education,
health, and social services, with only a few entering scientiﬁc or technical study.
The original intention of the restrictions was to protect women and women’s reproductive health, and more recently
countries have been reforming their regulations to include gender neutral protection; countries are leaving employ-
ment decisions to the worker. In the case of “dangerous” jobs, governments, employers, and trade unions work
together to establish safe working conditions that protect women and men. Removing restrictions on women’s
employment is not expected to create substantive costs for Tajikistan. On the contrary, restrictive labor laws tend
to result in: considerable variation in employment opportunities for women compared to men; uneven distribution
of jobs; and inﬂexibility in the labor market in terms of women’s employability. Another negative implication of
labor regulatory barriers is occupational segregation that may reduce women’s earnings potential, since many
restricted jobs are often in higher-paying sectors. A study shows that the Russian Federation had a high gender
earnings diﬀerential during its transition to a market economy largely because of occupational segregation by
gender (Ogloblin 1999). That segregation was more related to gender-based job restrictions in Soviet-era labor
regulations than to gender diﬀerences in education or the higher incidence of part-time work among women. In
addition, World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2016 found that in those countries where there was at least
one restriction on women’s employment, their estimated earned income was 12 percent less than men’s income
relative to countries where such restrictions do not exist (World Bank 2016e).

3 LABOR DEMAND IN
3.
THE FORMAL SECTOR
In many countries, including Tajikistan, the availability of more and better jobs depends on a thriving
formal private sector. It is therefore important to better understand the proﬁle of ﬁrms and employment in the
private sector and the relationship between productivity and employment. This chapter presents an overview of
the demand side of jobs, focusing on the formal private sector in Tajikistan. It looks at the distribution of formal
sector ﬁrms to understand their characteristics. It then looks at where the jobs are and what type of ﬁrms create
jobs. Finally, it reviews the relationship between employment and productivity (in the manufacturing sector).
The chapter pays particular attention to differences by ﬁrm ownership (private vs public), age, size, sector and
region. The analysis draws parallels and comparisons with other countries.


PROFILE OF FORMAL SECTOR LABOR DEMAND IN TAJIKISTAN
The formal private sector is squeezed between large public and informal private sectors
On the one hand, the demand for labor in Tajikistan is largely dominated by the public sector. The share
of public employment, including state owned enterprises (SOEs), is relatively high at 28 percent compared to
many other countries in the region (Chapter 2). Employment in SOEs is about half of total public employment.
Public sector jobs, coveted by many for their security and other beneﬁts, are not a sustainable source of jobs,
especially given the current high levels of public sector employment. The public sector also tends to favor those
with higher education and is much less accessible to those in the bottom 40 percent.
On the other hand, the demand for labor in the private sector is largely informal. Informal wage employ-
ment is about 31 percent of total employment or almost half of all private sector employment.45 The informal sector
may be able to provide a large number of jobs, especially to the poor, but they are not necessarily good jobs. The
pay may be comparable or higher than in the formal sector for a comparable worker (Arabsheibani and Staneva
2012), but informal sector jobs are largely temporary or seasonal, and lack security and beneﬁts.
The formal private sector, which is small and squeezed between the large public and informal private
sectors, has the potential to create more and better jobs. Formal wage employment in the private sector
represents just 13 percent of total employment in Tajikistan. The formal sector is small, but an important part of
the labor demand. This sector needs to grow in order to create more jobs for Tajiks, especially for those in the
bottom 40 percent. A better understanding of the formal private sector in Tajikistan is needed to assess imped-
iments or inefﬁciencies that could hold back growth in private sector employment, where there is potential to
provide better (formal) jobs. The rest of this chapter focuses on the private formal sector in Tajikistan utilizing
limited, but never previously analyzed, ﬁrm-level data (see Box 3).

Tajik entrepreneurial potential is not fully utilized
The formal private sector in Tajikistan is still relatively underdeveloped with low formal ﬁrm creation.
The rate of entry of formal businesses remains low in Tajikistan, in comparison with other countries and over time
(Figure 46). Despite an uptick in 2009 and 2010, the rates of formal ﬁrm entry remain one of the lowest in the

     Another 18 percent are unpaid contributing family workers, who are also considered informal.

ECA region. Recent improvements to simplify the process of business registration, including the establishment of
a one-stop-shop mechanism for starting and registering a business in 2009 (Box 4), have had only a temporary
effect on entry of formal businesses.
There is signiﬁcant entrepreneurial potential, which is not being fully utilized. Survey data suggests that
the lack of business creation is not a result of the lack of desire among Tajiks to become an entrepreneur; almost
40 percent of the labor force has a preference for self-employment,46 one of the highest rates in the region47
(Figure 47). However, the share of latent entrepreneurs who try to start a business is very low at 11.8 percent,
considerably lower than the ECA average of 26.8 percent. Only about 55 percent of those who attempt to
start a business succeed, compared to almost 64 percent in the ECA region as a whole, pointing to signiﬁcant
barriers to entrepreneurs in Tajikistan. Research shows that while latent entrepreneurship and the likelihood
of success with a new business are associated with particular attitudes and demographic characteristics,48 the
quality of the local business climate also matters. The gap between starting a business and success is highest
among countries that lag on structural reforms, with success being more likely in those countries which were
able to proceed with reforms more efﬁciently (Arias et al. 2014).

    This is measured in the survey with the following question “Suppose you were working and could choose between diﬀerent kinds of jobs.
    Which of the following would you personally choose: self-employed or being an employee?”
 47
    The desire to be self-employed does not appear to be driven by necessity or at least not by necessity alone (survival entrepreneurship). In
    the ECA region overall, as many as one ﬁfth of the wage-employed declare a preference for self-employment; a large number of these are
    highly educated or highly skilled professionals currently working as directors or managers (Arias et al. 2014).
 48
    Older married men and individuals willing to take risks are more likely to self-report latent entrepreneurship. While there is no consistent rela-
    tionship between educational attainment and latent entrepreneurship, educational attainment is positively correlated to the probability of
    starting a business and succeeding. Working in the private sector is also associated with higher latent entrepreneurship rates compared to
    working in the public sector. Latent entrepreneurship is also greater in areas with a higher concentration of economic activity (Arias et al. 2014).

BOX 3: KEY DEMAND SIDE DATA USED IN THE ANALYSIS
The demand side analysis for the Tajikistan job diagnostics is carried out using data made available in anonymized
form by TajStat: The Business Register and the Data on Industrial Production.

BUSINESS REGISTER (2014 AND 2015)
The Business Register incorporates all registered legal entities in the country, including: private sector ﬁrms and
farms (dekhan); state owned enterprises (SOEs); and government institutions (ministries and state agencies). The
latter are not included in the analysis. The dataset included ﬁrms in the Business Register as of January 1 of each
year; in 2014, for example, the data represents legal entities at the end of 2013. The major advantage of using the
Business Register is that it incorporates all registered entities in the country. However, the available information
on the ﬁrms is very scarce, limited to average annual number of employees, location, sector of economic activity,
date of registration, type of ownership (private, collective, state, mixed, foreign), and legal form.

DATA ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (2012-2014)
Data on Industrial Production is a separate dataset with information collected on registered ﬁrms in the following
economic sectors: mining, manufacturing and utilities. Reporting is mandatory for those enterprises which have active
production in a given year. Industrial Production data includes more information such as output and ﬁxed assets, in
addition to the number of annual average production employees. The main advantage of using Industrial Production
data is that it allows for linking productivity to employment and assessing these variables by location, size, age, etc.

DATA LIMITATIONS
Business Register
The Business Register does not include information on sales or ﬁxed assets, or more detailed information on employment
(such as permanent versus temporary workers, male or female employees, etc.). It also does not have information on
average wages or the wage bill. As a result, it cannot be used for analysis of productivity and/or wages. TajStat plans
to include additional variables in the next round of data collection.Missing data in the Business Register continues
to limit most of the analysis. Information on employment information is missing for 37.8 percent of the ﬁrms in
2015 compared to 14 percent in 2014 (Table B1, Annex B). The sharp increase in the number of ﬁrms with missing
employment data suggests that the data quality issue is signiﬁcant and may be systematic, especially in 201546.
This is the main reason for not using 2015 data in the analysis with the exception of estimating job creation for
ﬁrms with employment information in both years.
In addition to this, and despite improved data collection and cooperation between TajStat, the Tax Committee and
the Pension Fund, direct data sharing among these institutions remains limited. As a result, TajStat is not able to
electronically crosscheck records of ﬁrms in the Business Register with those of the Tax Committee. A manual cross-
check was done in 2015 and ﬁrms with active tax payer status were identiﬁed for that year. More regular electronic
cross-checks would allow for regular updating of the Business Register. Finally, the capacity of TajStat to keep records
up to date and properly record status changes (entry, liquidation, reorganization) needs to be improved to ensure
the data is more reliable and informative for statistical reporting purposes, as well as for analysis and policy making.
Industrial Production
A major limitation in the Industrial Production data is that it does not include the date of a ﬁrm’s registration. Merging
the Industrial Production data with the Business Register was not possible given the diﬀerent business identiﬁers
provided. TajStat was able to manually match ﬁrms with the date of registration from the Business Register, but
merging the data was successful only for about 60 percent of the ﬁrms, suggesting that the identiﬁers might have
changed between the datasets and/or over time. Industrial Production data is therefore assessed separately and
is a complement to the Business Register. Information on wage bill/labor costs is also not included, which means
that the productivity analysis is limited to output per worker; computation of value added per worker is not possible.

PROFILE OF FORMAL SECTOR FIRMS AND EMPLOYMENT
Private sector formal firms are small and relatively young, especially compared to SOEs
Private sector formal ﬁrms in Tajikistan tend to be small and relatively young. The majority (70 percent)
of private sector formal ﬁrms49 in Tajikistan have fewer than 10 employees (Figure 48). This is comparable to
countries in similar economic conditions, like Moldova50, where 61 percent of ﬁrms are also small (Figure 49)51.
However, given Tajikistan’s history since independence, which included a civil war (1992–1997), private ﬁrms
have been more recently established there than in Moldova and other countries for which comparable data
is available (Annex C): two thirds (66 percent) have been registered for six years or less, while in Moldova this
share is 20 percent. This is also likely a result of the reforms to ease the process of business registration (Box 4),
such as the establishment of a one-stop-shop mechanism for starting and registering a business, which was
established in 2009.52 The large share of young ﬁrms does not need to be a concern if these ﬁrms can grow and
expand employment. There is evidence that shows that it is young, not necessarily small, ﬁrms that create the
most jobs (Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda 2013). In Tajikistan, however, it does not appear to be the case,
as shown below. Consistent with the new business density estimate cited above, the number of new entrants
(i.e. 1-year-old ﬁrms) is low in Tajikistan; it was 8.3 percent in 2014, only a little higher than Moldova (6.3
percent) in the same year, but comparable to the rate (9 percent) observed in the Kyrgyz Republic (2009–2012)
(Sattar, Keller and Uulu 2015).


SOEs make up a small share of total ﬁrms in Tajikistan, but they are generally larger than formal private
sector ﬁrms. The number of SOEs has been declining over the years (Bakanova et al. 2014), although about
800 continue to operate according to the Business Register.53 This is small (3.8 percent of the total) compared to
the approximately 25,000 private sector registered ﬁrms. There are signiﬁcant differences between private sector

    Excluding State Owned Enterprises, but including dekhan farms. Formal here is deﬁned as being registered in the Business Register.
    Dekhan farms are included since by the nature of being registered as a legal entity they can undertake commercial activity,
    i.e. conduct business as a ﬁrm.

    Moldova is chosen as a comparator due to its similar transition history (former Soviet Union Republic) and high reliance on remittances.
    There are, however, diﬀerences between the countries, including population size (with a population of 3.5 million, Moldova is much smaller
    than Tajikistan; its GDP per capita is twice as high as Tajikistan’s). Additional country comparisons are presented in Annex C.
 51
    The average size of private sector ﬁrms is nearly identical in Tajikistan and Moldova: approximately 16.5 employees.

    Almost all ﬁrms represented in Tajikistan’s Business Register are less than 20 years old, which is expected given the civil and political con-
    ﬂict which took place between 1992 and 1997. Age is measured based on date of registration in the Business Register.
 53
    The actual number may be less due to the lack of a common methodology for identifying SOEs in diﬀerent registries (see Bakanova et al.
    2014 for more details).

ﬁrms and SOEs: private sector ﬁrms in Tajikistan tend to be smaller than SOEs 54, although there are some SOEs
with only 1-9 employees 55. The average size of a formal private sector ﬁrm in Tajikistan is 16, and the average
size of an SOE is 6056 (Figure 50). In Moldova, comparable ﬁgures are 18 and 120, respectively (Figure 51). The
lack of a comprehensive government database and a coordinated management system of SOEs makes it difﬁ-
cult to understand their real economic impact (Bakanova et al. 2014), but their size suggests that SOEs could
be potentially inﬂuential in those sectors where they operate (the issue of the sectoral distribution of SOEs is
discussed below). Entry of the private sector in such sectors is either forbidden by law or in practice not doable
because of current institutional and political arrangements. Complex entry and operational requirements, as well
as political preferences (both national and local) protect SOEs’ monopoly position and overemployment (Ibid).

    The government has also been a lot slower to privatize medium and larger SOEs. For example, of the 6,029 state properties privatized in
    the ﬁrst decade of transition (1991–2000), 95 percent were small enterprises. Privatization of other SOEs grew in the mid-2000s with the
    adoption of the Strategic Plan for Privatization of Medium and Large Enterprises for 2003–09 in 2004, but it has stalled again since then
    (Bakanova et al. 2014).
 55
    This may be a result of poor quality data on SOEs and also the inclusion of some government units in a departure from standard global practice.

BOX 4: REFORMS TO SIMPLIFY BUSINESS REGISTRATION IN TAJIKISTAN
The Government of Tajikistan has been conducting reforms to the business registration system since 2008, and has
worked with donors to develop an action plan for a one-stop shop mechanism for business registration. A European
Union project supported the action plan and changes were introduced as early as 2009. A network of entry points
was established through district Tax Committees and the action plan required the three government agencies: the
Tax Committee, the Pension Fund and the Statistics Committee to exchange data, rather than to require a client to
do it for themselves. Before the introduction of the one-stop shop, business registrations could take up to 49 days to
complete and registrants had to apply across multiple ministries. The current process takes a maximum of 11 days.
The progress in this area has been remarkable since 2008. In the Doing Business 2016 report, Tajikistan moved to
57th place out of 189 countries in the area of Starting a Business; it ranked 161th out of 178 countries in 2008.
Other factors that have led to Tajikistan’s recent improvements include:
¬   Reducing the number of business activities that are subject to licensing requirements (2008).
¬   Reducing the minimum capital requirement and speeding up issuance of tax identiﬁcation numbers (2010).
¬   Creating a one-stop shop that consolidates registration with the state and the tax authority (2011).
¬   Allowing entrepreneurs to pay in their capital up to 1 year after the start of operations, thereby eliminating the
    requirements related to opening a bank account (2012).
¬   Enabling the Statistics Agency to issue the statistics code for the new business at the time of registration (2015).
However, not all recent reforms have helped ease the business registration process; in 2014 Tajikistan introduced a
requirement to have preliminary approval from the tax authority before starting a business and to submit additional
documents at registration.

Formal employment is concentrated in larger and older firms
As in other countries, formal sector employees tend to work in larger and older ﬁrms. Despite the low
number of large ﬁrms (only 2 percent of the total), large ﬁrms with more than 100 workers employ about 40
percent of all formal employees (Figure 52); and about half of all formal employees work in ﬁrms older than 5 years
and more than a third work in ﬁrms older than 10 years (Figure 53). This is also consistent with ﬁndings in many
other countries (e.g., Hsieh and Klenow (2014) for emerging countries, and Haltiwanger et al. (2013) for the United
States). In Moldova, employment is also concentrated in large and older ﬁrms. Concentrating employment in these
larger and older ﬁrms is only a concern when they are unproductive, as seems to be the case in the manufacturing
sector in Tajikistan. In this case, the tendency to distribute the formal workforce toward older, larger, but not nec-
essarily more productive, ﬁrms could be a misallocation of labor resources or a reﬂection of rigidities in the labor
market. Lack of competition may also be allowing less productive ﬁrms to retain higher employment than optimal.

But concentration of employment in larger older ﬁrms is even more pronounced for SOEs.57 This is
partially a result of the way the government conducted privatization. The Government divested itself of smaller
SOEs in successive waves of privatization, but retained ownership of the largest Soviet-era enterprises and any
sector deemed to be a natural monopoly (U.S. Department of State 2015). As a result, SOE employment is more
concentrated in larger and older ﬁrms. Among SOE employees, almost two thirds (61 percent) work in ﬁrms
with more than 100 employees (Figure 54). This share is higher still in Moldova (84 percent) where SOEs are an
average of two times larger than in Tajikistan (Figure 55). Larger, older SOEs in the manufacturing sector do not
appear to be more productive than smaller and younger SOEs; there is therefore reason to believe that this large
share of employment in larger and older SOEs may not be efﬁcient. Research shows that efforts to reform SOEs
and reduce public sector employment has paid off signiﬁcantly in the form of employment growth in the private
sector in ECA countries58 (Arias et al. 2014). To the extent that labor hoarding by SOEs may still be happening
in Tajikistan, it could hamper reallocation of labor to more productive sectors.

SOEs’ presence in most sectors of the economy can have negative implications for
efficiency and competition
The distribution of formal ﬁrms by sector indicates a private sector that is still skewed toward agri-
culture. Formal private sector ﬁrms operate mainly in the agricultural sector59 (38.7 percent of all formal private
sector ﬁrms); 25 percent are in commerce, and 17.5 percent are in other services (Figure 56). Formal employ-
ment by sector is more skewed toward agriculture (57 percent of all formal employees—Figure 57) given that
registered farms tend to be larger (Figure 58) than private ﬁrms in other sectors.60
While the share of SOEs is not high overall, they are still present in many sectors. Around 18 percent of
SOEs are in utilities, where a large share of government ownership is to be expected; however, they are present

        Total employment in SOEs in the Business Register is likely to be somewhat under-reported since the number of employed in SOEs
        reported in the data represents just 2 percent of total employment; survey estimates suggest 14 percent (2011 LSMS) while oﬃcial
        TajStat estimates are even higher (about 16.8). As a result, data on employment in SOEs may be less reliable.

        Results from an accounting decomposition exercise suggest that GDP growth and changes in public sector employment are the two
        largest contributors to changes in private sector employment over 2000–10 (Soto 2013). On average, 1 percentage point reduction in
        public employment is associated with a 0.53 percentage point increase in private employment (Arias et al. 2014). While on average this
        implies a decrease in total employment, a reallocation of jobs from public to private employment would lead to dynamic gains as the
        private sector could expand entry and increase employment in the long run.

        The majority (86.6 percent) are small holder (dekhan) registered farms.

        In 2014, the average size of agricultural ﬁrms was 23.9 employees compared to 6 in the commerce sector and 12 in other services. Within mining,
        utilities and construction, mining ﬁrms are the largest, on average (29.7 employees), followed by utilities (24.8) and construction ﬁrms (12.1).

in nearly all economic activities in Tajikistan, including manufacturing, agriculture, transport, and other services
(Figure 59). Employment in SOEs is very heavily skewed to the manufacturing sector61 (Figure 60).
Some sectors are more dominated by SOEs than others, but all are likely to be affected by noncompet-
itive pressures (Box 5). The share of SOEs relative to all registered ﬁrms is not very high (Figure 61), but varies
by sector. In particular, the sectors with the highest share of SOEs (Figure 61) include: utilities (32 percent of total
ﬁrms), transport (8 percent), and mining (5 percent). Employment by SOEs is also very high in these sectors at: 53,
34 and 25 percent of the formal registered workforce. Given that SOEs tend to enjoy a set of implicit beneﬁts,
including preferential access to ﬁnance (Bakanova et al. 2014), their continued presence raises concerns that
private sector ﬁrms may be facing unfair competition. In many cases, governance issues and biased regulations
that favor SOEs can undermine competition, and inhibit incentives to reduce costs, innovate, or become more
efﬁcient, all of which could impede entry and growth of more efﬁcient private sector ﬁrms.

      But this is largely driven by an outlier SOE in the manufacturing sector. If that outlier is removed, the share of employed in SOEs in the
      manufacturing decreases from 27.6 percent to just 8 percent.

SOEs in Tajikistan are involved in elaborate quasi-ﬁscal activities (QFA) which carry signiﬁcant ﬁscal risks
for the state budget. The primary quasi-ﬁscal activity is the extensive use of below-market and even below-vari-
able cost price of energy, utilities, and other services, which creates a stream of subsidies that: deprive the public
sector of revenues; generate SOE losses; and give rise to large contingent ﬁscal liabilities. This also undermines
the rational economic behavior of SOEs, private companies and households alike, and results in inefﬁcient use
of energy and public resources. It erodes accountability of SOE managers and blurs the principles of responsible
behavior of the state as an owner of SOEs and an efﬁcient provider of critical public goods and services. The total
costs of these QFAs were estimated at about 3 percent of GDP in 2012 (Bakanova et al. 2014).

There are some regional differences in distribution of private sector firms and SOEs as well
Geographically, the distribution of the formal private sector is slightly skewed toward Khatlon, while
SOEs are more prevalent in Dushanbe. Somewhat surprisingly, there is not a large concentration of formal

private sector ﬁrms in the capital city.62 Only about one ﬁfth of all private formal ﬁrms are in Dushanbe while
the largest share (35.7 percent) is in Khatlon, where there is a large concentration of dekhan farms. Another
quarter of private sector ﬁrms (24.8 percent) is in Sogd. The smallest share is in the sparsely populated Gorno-
Badakhshan region (Figure 62). Employment is roughly proportional to these shares (Figure 63), although ﬁrms
tend to be somewhat smaller in Dushanbe and in the Region of Republican Subordination, where there are
approximately 13 employees, on average, compared to 18 in Khatlon and Sogd. The formal ﬁrms in Gorno-
Badakhshan are of larger average size (28 employees), but smaller ﬁrms are likely to face more hurdles to
registering in this remote region. The distribution of SOEs, on the other hand, is a little bit more skewed toward
Dushanbe (Figure 64), and employment in SOEs is also more concentrated in Dushanbe and in the Region of
Republican Subordination (Figure 65).

      In Moldova, 34 percent of all ﬁrms (private and SOEs) are in the capital city of Chișinău, while in Tajikistan only 25 percent of all ﬁrms are in
      Dushanbe. In Kenya, half of the formal manufacturing ﬁrms are in Nairobi (Cirera, Xavier and Mathilde 2015).

BOX 5: SOEs IN TAJIKISTAN — FEW BUT PRIVILEGED
The number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has dropped since the 1990s, but many SOEs remain active in
various sectors: travel; automotive/ground transportation; energy/mining; metal manufacturing/products; food
processing/ packaging; agricultural, construction, building & heavy equipment; services; ﬁnance; and information
& communication. The Government of Tajikistan divested itself of smaller SOEs in successive waves of privatization,
but retained ownership of the largest Soviet-era enterprises and any industry deemed to be a natural monopoly.
The State Committee for Investments and State-Owned Property Management maintains a database of all SOEs
in Tajikistan, but this information is not publicly available. Major SOEs include:
¬   Travel: Tajik Air, Tajik Air Navigation Dushanbe Airport, Kulob Airport, Qurghonteppa Airport, Khujand Airport;
¬   Automotive & Ground Transportation: Tajik Railways;
¬   Energy & Mining: Barqi Tojik, TajikTransGas, Oil, Gas, and Coal, and VostokRedMet;
¬   Metal Manufacturing & Products: Tajik Aluminum Company (TALCO), and AluminSohtMon (TALCO subsidiary);
¬   Agricultural, Construction, Building & Heavy Equipment: Tajik Cement;
¬   Food Processing & Packaging: Konservniy Combinat Isfara;
¬   Services: Dushanbe Water and Sewer, Vodokanal Khujand, and ZhKX (water utility);
¬   Finance: AmonatBonk (savings bank), TajikSarmoyaguzor (insurance), TajikSugurta (insurance);
¬   Information & Communication: Tajik Telecom, Tajik Post, and TeleRadioCom
While information on SOEs and rules governing them remain quite unclear, it is generally believed that they enjoy
signiﬁcant privileges and remain largely protected from competition. In sectors that are open to both the private
sector and foreign competition, SOEs receive a larger percentage of government contracts than their private sector
competitors. According to government policy, private enterprises cannot compete with SOEs under the same terms
and conditions with respect to market share, products/services, and incentives, and they do not have the same
access to ﬁnancing Local domestic law makes SOEs subject to the same tax burden and tax rebate policies as
their private sector competitors, but the government regularly writes oﬀ their tax debts via administrative orders
or decrees. SOEs are aﬀorded material advantages, including preferential access to land and raw materials that
are not granted to private enterprises.
SOEs in Tajikistan are engaged in a variety of quasi-ﬁscal activities which are ineﬃcient, undermine competition,
and come at a signiﬁcant ﬁscal cost and risk:
¬ Mispricing: pricing goods and services at below-market or cost recovery levels. This creates ﬁnancial losses
    for SOEs and ineﬃciency in the use of scarce resources.
¬ Provision of noncommercial services: SOE delivery of social services free of charge or below cost recovery,
    with no mention in the government budget.
¬ Soft budget constraints: tolerance of SOE arrears (implicit subsidy) leading to distortions in the allocation of
    resources.
¬ Barter and oﬀset arrangements: arrangements that reduce revenue and spending, making it diﬃcult to calcu-
    late the precise size of QFAs or to manage the related ﬁscal risks.
¬ Operating ineﬃciency: technical losses and unmetered/unbilled consumption (including from theft).
¬ Subsidized lending and rescue operations and bailouts: below-market and preferential lending rates; poorly
    secured and sub-par loans; mispriced loan guarantees.
¬ Subsidies related to the exchange rate system: unjustiﬁed subsidies arising from biased application of multi-
    ple exchange rates and subsidized exchange risk insurance.

FIRM GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT
Private sector firms grow as they age, but to a lesser extent than private firms
in other countries or SOEs
Young ﬁrms that survive longer than ﬁve years in Tajikistan tend to grow as they age, but to a lesser
extent than in other countries. While the available data does not allow for long-term tracking of ﬁrms, it
is possible to gauge whether ﬁrms tend to be larger as they get older in Tajikistan. Hsieh and Klenow (2014)
ﬁnd that older ﬁrms in the manufacturing sector in the United States tend to be signiﬁcantly larger than young
startups.63 For instance, U.S. ﬁrms aged 25-29 years old are 3.4 times larger than ﬁrms that are younger than 5
years (Figure 66). Using a slightly different methodology,64 we ﬁnd evidence of somewhat stunted growth among
surviving (beyond 5 years) formal private sector ﬁrms in Tajikistan. While the differences in size of private sector
ﬁrms aged 5-9 years compared to ﬁrms younger than ﬁve years are roughly comparable to the U.S. and Moldova,
the trend starts to diverge for older age brackets. Older (by Moldova and Tajikistan standards) private sector ﬁrms
(10-14 years old) are only about 1.5 times larger than young ﬁrms. In comparison, U.S. ﬁrms in that age bracket
(10-14 years old) are 2.2 times larger than young ﬁrms.65 The difference is even more pronounced for ﬁrms aged
15-19 in Tajikistan, which are not only far behind the U.S., but also the Moldova private sector benchmark, and are
just slightly larger, on average, than ﬁrms in the 10-14 age bracket. This suggests that market distortions and other
obstacles keep private sector ﬁrms small as they age and they don’t grow to their full potential. SOEs, however, are
doing much better in terms of average employment, suggesting that these constraints are less binding for them.
An important lesson from other countries is that reforms and a better business climate can help ﬁrms grow.
While it is difﬁcult to identify obstacles to ﬁrms’ growth with the available data, literature suggests that business
reforms that improve market functioning can positively affect ﬁrm growth and job creation. Hsieh and Klenow
(2014) describe clear differences in the life cycle of ﬁrms in India subsequent to reforms in 1994 (Figure 67).66
Econometric analysis using a variety of ﬁrm data for the ECA region also suggests that ﬁrms that face a less
burdensome regulatory environment and less corruption experience improved growth in employment (Arias et
al. 2014). Increased access to improved infrastructure and greater bureaucratic and judicial efﬁciency were also
associated with better performance. In particular, a one-standard deviation improvement in each dimension
of the business environment is associated with substantial growth in employment as well as proﬁtability (Ibid).

Note: SOE estimates for Tajikistan exclude an outlier. The graph is truncated for comparison with Moldova and Tajikistan, but Hsieh and Kleow (2014) show
that older U.S ﬁrms (i.e. those 40 years or older) are about 8 times larger than start-ups.

    Hsieh and Kleow (2014) construct a synthetic panel using two years of surviving manufacturing ﬁrms ﬁve years apart and grouped in ﬁve-
    year age bins. They assume that every cohort experiences similar rates of exit and growth over the life cycle. They compare these results to
    the average size of the ﬁrm by age in a cross section. Results using both methodologies are similar for emerging economies while growth of
    the typical ﬁrm in the U.S. is lower in the cross section approach. We use the cross section results here.
 64
    We regress size of ﬁrms (log of employment) on dummies for age categories.
 65
    Manufacturing sector ﬁrms in Moldova come close to U.S. ﬁrms in this regard.
 66
    Although post-1994 behavior suggests relatively modest growth over the life cycle in comparison to other countries, the pre-1994 pattern
    suggests that by the time the ﬁrm is 35 years old, average plant size was just one fourth of the plant size at birth.

                                                                                                                                                            62

Job creation appears concentrated in larger firms, while small firms saw job losses
The limited data suggests that smaller ﬁrms tend to see job losses, while jobs are being created in
larger ﬁrms. While the data is limited, it is important to assess which ﬁrms have experienced net employment
gains versus net employment losses. The data for 2014-2015 suggests that smaller ﬁrms with fewer than 10
employees and, to some extent, those with 10-19 employees, regardless of how long they have been in business,
have laid off some employees while larger, older ﬁrms saw job gains (Figure 68). If this is part of a consistent
trend and is not due to biases in the data,67 it could point to barriers to jobs growth in small and young ﬁrms.
Across a large number of OECD and emerging countries, young and small ﬁrms, rather than small ﬁrms as a
whole, are net job creators (Criscuolo et al. 2014). Controlling for ﬁrm age, Haltiwanger, et al., (2013) ﬁnd that
there is no systematic relationship between ﬁrm size and growth in the United States manufacturing sector;

      Smaller and younger ﬁrms may also have less capacity or fewer incentives to accurately report their employment information. More con-
      sistent eﬀorts to check the data reported, including automatic cross-check with other government databases such as the Tax Committee,
      is needed to provide more reliable information for policymaking.

                                                                                                                                                                          63
they highlight the importance of business start-ups in U.S. job creation. Firm startups account for only 3 percent
of employment but for almost 20 percent of gross job creation in the U.S. In contrast, startups account for 3
percent of private sector formal employment in Tajikistan, but account for only 13 percent of gross jobs created.
As regards job creation by sector, only the agricultural sector saw job losses, while other sectors saw positive
net job creation. Only the agricultural sector saw net job losses from 2014 to 2015 (Figure 69) among small
and very small ﬁrms, but older small ﬁrms appear to have been particularly affected. Net employment gains
among the large registered ﬁrms (or farms) were not enough to compensate for job losses among smaller ﬁrms
or farms.68 Other sectors saw positive net job creation even though some of small ﬁrms in those sectors had to
lay off some employees. It is important to note again that the data only covers employment in registered legal
entities, and hence is not the same as aggregate employment trends.


PRODUCTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT
There is a wide dispersion in labor productivity by type of firm, suggesting possible
allocative inefficiency69
It is important to examine the relationship between employment and productivity in Tajikistan in order to ﬁnd
out if larger ﬁrms are more productive and if more productive ﬁrms hire more labor. This information could help
assess whether markets in Tajikistan operate in a way that helps creation of good jobs. This analysis is for the
manufacturing sector, where information on output per worker is available for 2012-2014.
SOEs appear less efﬁcient than the private sector manufacturing ﬁrms. Overall, based on ﬁrm level data, labor
productivity (average output per worker) in the manufacturing sector adjusted for inﬂation, experienced very little
growth between 2012 and 201470 (Figure 70). Compared to ﬁrms in the private sector, SOE productivity appears
to be somewhat lower and more dispersed around the mean than private ﬁrms’ productivity (Figure 71). In
particular, there is higher density toward the left of the productivity distribution among SOEs. A basic regression
analysis conﬁrms that SOEs are less productive than private sector manufacturing ﬁrms, controlling for size, age,

    The reasons for this are not clear especially considering potential measurement issues. In general, this could be related to migration,
    which peaked around 2013. There could also be some restructuring in the sector in terms of ownership, perhaps in part due to the new
    Tax Code. Oﬃcial statistics on individual entrepreneurs show that between 2013 and 2014 there was a large increase in individual dekhan
    farmers, not included in the data on legal entities: there are between 69,000 and 97,000 active registered individual farmers. Some small
    farms registered in the Business Register may have reorganized into individual entrepreneurs/dekhan farmers. The data does not allow for
    further testing of this hypothesis.

    Productivity analysis is limited to the manufacturing sector since information on output is only available in the industrial data. Labor pro-
    ductivity is measured as output per worker since information on labor costs is not available to estimate value added per worker.

    In logs, average output per worker increased from about 9.4 in 2012 to 10.4 in 10.4 in 2014 in the private sector
    and from 8.8 to 9.8 among SOEs.

sector and location.71 While this result should be taken with caution,72 it is nevertheless consistent with ﬁndings
in the region that labor productivity among private ﬁrms tends to be higher than among SOEs operating in the
same sector (Arias et al. 2014).
There are no signiﬁcant differences in labor productivity by size of ﬁrm, but there is a wide dispersion
in output per worker (Figure 72 and Figure 73). Dispersion of labor productivity is higher among small and
medium SOEs. All types of ﬁrms exhibit a long low productivity tail in the distribution, but also higher density
along the high productivity tail, especially for smaller ﬁrms. This suggests large variation in productivity, especially
in small private ﬁrms. Large differences in productivity across businesses, even within narrowly deﬁned sectors,
are a persistent feature in both developed and developing countries (Haltiwanger 2011), which may suggest
allocative inefﬁciency, i.e., the inability of the economy to shift resources from low- to high-productivity activities.

      The pooled OLS regression of log (output per worker) as the dependent variable was run using size, age, region, and location controls.

      Because the measure of productivity used (output per worker) is less preferred than measures that can take into account the value of
      inputs (labor and capital used in production), such as value added per worker or total factor productivity. These measures were not possi-
      ble to construct due to the data limitations.

                                                                                                                                                              65
Larger firms are not more productive in Tajikistan and they increase productivity by
laying off workers73
Using regression analysis to control for ﬁrm characteristics like industry and location (Table 1), private ﬁrms in
the same sector have similar productivity regardless of size (except for very large ﬁrms that are more productive).
Larger SOEs tend to be less productive, suggesting that SOEs may not be utilizing labor efﬁciently. Table 2 shows
the average effects on employment of “within ﬁrm” changes in productivity. The overall impact of changes in
productivity is negative for both private sector ﬁrms and SOEs. If a quadratic term74 for productivity is introduced,
the relationship between increasing productivity and employment is positive, but only for small ﬁrms. Above
this threshold, improving productivity is associated with lay-offs. Small ﬁrms are limited in how many jobs they
can create, and it is those larger ﬁrms that are able to increase productivity and hire additional labor who are
contributing to sustained creation of good jobs in Tajikistan. Similar to the results above, it appears that there
are signiﬁcant barriers to employment and productivity growth in Tajikistan, suggesting that productive ﬁrms
do not grow their employment levels, either because of barriers or disincentives to do so.

SUMMARY
The analysis of available ﬁrm data provides a snapshot of the formal private sector in Tajikistan in comparison
with SOEs and with other countries. The main ﬁndings of the analysis suggest that:
∫ The formal private sector, squeezed by large public and informal sectors, is still very underdeveloped and entry
  of new ﬁrms is relatively low.
∫ Private sector ﬁrms in the formal sector tend to be small and relatively young, and most formal private sector
  employees are employed in larger and older ﬁrms.
∫ SOEs are signiﬁcantly larger than private sector ﬁrms and are still present in many economic sectors, potentially
  undermining competition and entry of private companies.
∫ Older private sector ﬁrms are smaller in Tajikistan than in comparator countries, which may indicate barriers
  to growth. SOEs may not experience similar barriers as they are signiﬁcantly larger across the ﬁrm life-cycle.
∫ Short-term trends indicate that job creation is concentrated in older, larger ﬁrms, while smaller, younger ﬁrms
  have a higher rate of job losses. Smaller and younger ﬁrms form the basis of job growth in countries such as
  the United States, but contribute signiﬁcantly less to job creation in Tajikistan.
∫ There is a wide dispersion in labor productivity by type of ﬁrm, suggesting possible allocative inefﬁciency.
∫ Larger ﬁrms are not more productive in Tajikistan, but they increase productivity by laying off workers,
  suggesting that productive ﬁrms do not grow their employment levels, either because of barriers or
  disincentives to do so.

4 STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
4.
FOR JOBS IN TAJIKISTAN
This section presents an organizing framework to address Tajikistan’s jobs challenges in the short and medium
term, based on the analysis of outcomes presented in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report.
The broad objectives of the Jobs Strategy in Tajikistan are to: i) facilitate the creation of more jobs; ii) improve
the quality of existing jobs; and iii) ensure access to jobs among vulnerable population groups (Figure 74). These
three objectives are important for Tajikistan:
∫ Facilitating the creation of new jobs: economic growth in the last decade has not translated into a sufﬁ-
  cient number of jobs for a growing workforce in Tajikistan. Between 2003 and 2013 the economy has added
  less than 500,000 net jobs, while the working age population increased by 1.3 million. While migration will
  remain an important jobs strategy for many households, the government should prioritize improving policies to
  facilitate job creation in the domestic private sector for the growing young population. Hence, a Jobs Strategy
  should include measures and interventions to remove constraints to the creation and expansion of formal busi-
  nesses —in general, policies that promote investments and innovation.
∫ Improving the quality of jobs: The quality of jobs in Tajikistan is a concern, as many people have jobs,
  but of temporary, seasonal, or occasional nature without a regular source of income. These are jobs with
  low labor productivity and earnings and often poor working conditions. A large share of the employed have
  informal (39 percent) or unpaid (18 percent) jobs, and do not have access to basic social protection. There is
  an important agenda therefore to improve the quality of jobs, with a focus on poor and vulnerable workers,
  especially in rural areas.
∫ Connecting individuals to jobs: There are many working age people in Tajikistan who are not employed:
  employment rates vary by gender, age, and, to some extent, region of residence. Almost 650,000 youth (15-24
  year olds) are inactive and the female labor force participation rate is 36 percentage points below the male
  labor force participation rate of 63 percent. Also, the types of job that different people have vary dramatically:
  the poor, in particular, are much more likely to have worse quality jobs. A Jobs Strategy, hence, should include
  measures to facilitate labor market transitions: from inactivity or unemployment into jobs; from low to high
  productivity jobs; or from regions or areas with fever job opportunities to areas with more potential—whether

   domestically or abroad. Finally, diversifying migration destinations and improving skills and preparation of
   migrants is an important avenue to improve living standards in Tajikistan.

To address these objectives, the jobs strategy is organized around three pillars (Figure 75).
∫ Promoting private sector growth: Sustainable job creation relies upon growth of a competitive private
  sector. Accordingly, this pillar focuses on the reforms needed to ensure an effective enabling environment at
  the macro and micro level that will enable entrepreneurs to create new businesses, and current ﬁrms to invest,
  expand, and hire workers. Part of the agenda requires trade facilitation, infrastructure and logistics given the
  country’s small size and landlocked position.
∫ Improving productivity and earnings, and access to formal jobs: This pillar focuses on measures that
  could help improve productivity, such as strengthening local value chains and connecting small producers and
  rural SMEs. It also involves policies and interventions to either improve incentives for formal jobs or reduce
  incentives for informal jobs, including enabling access to core social insurance programs.
∫ Connecting people to jobs: This pillar focuses on connecting potential workers to jobs through a set of
  supply side policies and programs aimed at increasing labor force participation through enabling policies,
  improving access to jobs through labor market programs, and better leveraging the beneﬁts of migration.
The jobs strategy will contribute to objectives set out in the Government of Tajikistan’s National
Development Strategy 2030. The National Development Strategy 2030 (NDS) sets ambitious goals to improve
the living conditions of the population. Within the NDS there are four key objectives: i) ensure energy security;
ii) develop the country’s communication opportunities; iii) ensure food security and nutrition; and iv) enhance
productive employment. The latter, in particular, aims to both increase the quantity of jobs created and improve
the productivity and quality of these jobs through expanding access to social protection. In this regard, the pro-
posed objectives of the Jobs Strategy and NDS are well aligned. Moreover, there are many other synergies with
different pillars of the NDS (Annex D). The key difference is that in the strategic framework for jobs, jobs could
be an outcome of many policies—not just those directly aimed at job creation or employment.

PILLAR 1: PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH
A pre-requisite for Tajikistan to increase job creation is to create conditions for private sector growth,
which implies much higher private sector investments. This requires increasing expected rates of return
on investments, ensuring that entrepreneurs and ﬁrms can ﬁnance these investments, and eliminating barri-
ers to entry and distortions that might preclude private investments in particular sectors. Some of the most
urgent reforms to achieve these objectives involve improving macroeconomic management and governance
to reduce risks and uncertainty; upgrading business regulations and facilitating trade and logistics, in order to
reduce transaction costs; reforming institutions that govern capital markets to improve access to ﬁnance; and
rethinking investment incentives. It is important to note, however, that the link between these reforms and
jobs is quite complex: higher investments and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources across sectors can create
but also destroy jobs. In addition, the private sector alone might not be able to internalize social externalities
related to jobs, or create sufﬁcient jobs for vulnerable population groups, particularly in lagging regions. Thus,
the discussion in this section identiﬁes key interventions to promote private sector investments but also raises
issues that would need to receive attention in the context of the jobs agenda.
The discussion is organized around the following set of policies: i) Macro fundamentals; ii) Business environment
and economic governance; iii) Trade facilitation, transport and logistics; iv) Access to ﬁnance; and v) Investment
Policy and Promotion.

Ensure macro fundamentals are conducive to private sector growth
From a jobs perspective, Tajikistan faces three challenges when it comes to macro-economic policies:
being able to address external vulnerabilities, which can adversely affect employment and earnings; reducing discre-
tion in the implementation of the tax code, which can reduce job creation and/or encourage entry into the informal
sector; and creating ﬁscal space to be able to protect workers and stimulate the economy during a downturn.
Addressing external vulnerabilities. As a country still dependent on commodity exports (cotton and alumi-
num), Tajikistan has to contend with the effects of commodity price volatility. Hence, strong macroeconomic
management is needed to smooth ﬂuctuations in prices and dampen the impact on other sectors of the
economy. There are also some concerns that signiﬁcant inﬂows of remittances may have led to a real exchange
rate appreciation (the Dutch disease) which could penalize the export sector, a likely important source of jobs in
the future. In general, volatility in foreign transfers, if not managed effectively, can result in the volatility of real
exchange rates. These can have spillover effects on the tradables sector, reducing the predictability and stability
of proﬁts, and therefore lowering incentives for ﬁrms to invest and growth.
Reforming the budget formulation process and reducing tax discretion. Fiscal policy and, in particular,
revenue collection and related tax administration can have important implications for private sector investment
and job creation. Research shows that higher tax rates on businesses are associated with fewer formal businesses
and lower private investment (Djankov et al. 2010.). In Tajikistan, despite signiﬁcant improvements in tax policy
and administration in recent years (Box 6), substantial shortcomings are still present in the administration of
revenue collection and, in particular, ambiguity in the interpretation of the tax code and VAT refund procedures.75
Overall, the most serious issues with taxation stem from the budget formulation process, which benchmarks
expenditures as a starting point. This, in turn, results in undue revenue collection targeting, largely ignoring tax
base, rate and business cycle changes. Especially, during economic downturns taxpayers are required to make
hefty pre-payments and face excessive cameral audits. At the same time, the system retains some discretions
which need to be addressed more effectively. Inconsistent approaches to tax exemptions erode budget revenues
and undermine the level playing ﬁeld, which is essential for a conducive business environment and for new ﬁrms
to enter the market on competitive terms. Reform of the budget formulation process can address these problems.
Creating ﬁscal space. Given debilitated infrastructure and social and demographic developments, the pres-
sure on total public spending is intensifying even as the ﬁscal space narrows in the wake of slowing global and

 75
      The process of obtaining VAT refunds is very slow, a situation that the authorities attribute to insuﬃcient coordination between the Tax
      Committee and the Ministry of Finance and to a lack of available liquidities at the Tax Committee (UNCTAD).

                                                                                                                                                 70
regional growth and fragility of the domestic economy. Despite low reported ﬁscal deﬁcit and a moderate debt
level, ﬁscal and debt positions are fragile given upcoming debt amortization payments, heightening quasi-ﬁscal
risks, and thin international and ﬁscal buffers. Soft budget constraints primarily in the energy sector, frequent
ﬁnancial bailouts, insufﬁcient strategic orientation and inefﬁciencies of public expenditures (especially capital
expenditures) are compressing ﬁscal space and the buildup of ﬁscal buffers. These result from soft budget con-
straints on SOEs (largely in the energy sector), continued directed lending by banks, and other quasi-ﬁscal risks.
SOEs’ debts continue rising along with operating losses and emergency interventions to keep critical operations
aﬂoat. The absence of a solid sovereign debt market and low conﬁdence in the banking sector impede the healthy
development of the ﬁnancial sector. Liquidity in the system is distributed unevenly, while systemically-important
banks are now facing solvency issues. Thus, the state budget is heavily burdened by loss-making enterprises and
frequent ﬁnancial bailouts, which limits the ability of the government to conduct countercyclical ﬁscal policies.

BOX 6: PROGRESS MADE IN TAX POLICY AND TAX ADMINISTRATION

TAX POLICY
The new Tax Code (in effect from January 1st 2013) simplified the tax system to enhance incentives for private
sector growth while reducing incentives for tax avoidance. The number of taxes was reduced from 21 to 10 by
merging some taxes. For instance, land tax and property tax were merged into a single property tax, sales tax on
primary aluminum and cotton fiber and tax on aluminum processing were merged into a single sales tax, royalty
from water and tax on subsurface users were merged into a single tax on natural resources.
To make the business environment friendlier, (i) the VAT threshold was raised from 200,000 to 500,000 somoni, (ii)
corporate income taxes will be cut from the current statutory rates of 25 and 15 percent to 23 and 13 percent in
2017, and (iii) road user tax will be phased out by 2017. The revisions also streamlined tax concessions, by exempt-
ing all imported technologies and equipment from VAT and customs duties. While the simpliﬁed tax rate for small
businesses was increased from 4 percent to 5 percent, small businesses were exempted from paying the VAT. In
order to limit tax pressure on taxpayers, the personal income tax brackets were revised. Additionally, the social tax
levying methodology was simpliﬁed to promote formality.

TAX ADMINISTRATION
Government has taken significant steps to improve tax administration. The Government’s Tax Reform Program
issued in December 2010 is being supported by a new World Bank grant that plans for a comprehensive set of
improvements in business processes, organizational structure and functions. According to DB 2014, Tajikistan
made paying taxes easier and less costly for companies by reducing the corporate income tax rate, merging the
minimal income tax with the corporate income tax and abolishing the retail sales tax. At the same time, Tajikistan
increased the land and vehicle tax rates. In Doing Business 2015, Tajikistan was cited among top 10 reformers,
mainly because of improvements in the tax administration. In paying taxes, Tajikistan improved its ranking by 15
places from Doing Business 2014 due to the reduced number of payments. Its position is, however, still low: 172th
out of 189 countries (Doing Business 2016).
Over the past year, the Tax Committee has undertaken several activities to improve tax administration: (i) taxes
can be paid through banks; (ii) a self-reporting system is in place; (iii) the Large Taxpayers Inspectorate (LTI) is in
operation and is organized along functional lines; (iv) business registration has been greatly simplified; (v) internal
control has been improved and a performance evaluation system of local inspectorates has been developed; (vi)
development of communication networks is in progress; (vii) electronic kiosks to simplify tax payments have been
introduced; (viii) the functional reorganization has been piloted; (ix) the department of medium size enterprises
has been initiated; and (x) the system for the taxation of small enterprises has been simplified by increasing the
VAT threshold and exempting them from road tax. The Tax Committee is developing a basic model of Risk Based
Audits, replacing manual selection of audit planning with computer-driven selection based on taxpayer data and
a set of 20 risk indicators.

Improve the business environment and governance to promote firms’ entry and growth
A competitive business environment that promotes the creation and growth of businesses is critical
for the creation of private sector jobs. It is also important to encourage the formalization and growth of
current Informal micro and small enterprises. Where the regulatory environment is onerous, ﬁrms will have a dis-
incentive to register (e.g., where there are high costs or bureaucracy to register a business, or where registration
puts the ﬁrm in a position where they will face burdensome taxes and regulation, inspections, and corruption)
and to expand (e.g., where accessing ﬁnance and land or obtaining construction permits is costly and burden-
some). Overall, evidence shows that higher employment growth is correlated with better corruption control,
better regulation, more government effectiveness, and greater voice and accountability (Van Eeghen et al. 2014).
During the last decade, the Government of Tajikistan has introduced several reforms to enable devel-
opment of the private sector. Since 2008, the Government has eased barriers to new businesses by eliminating
unnecessary procedures, lowering minimum capital requirements, and centralizing government functions related
to registration of new businesses (creating a one-stop-shop). The government has also changed the insolvency
law to streamline bankruptcy proceedings, lowered corporate income tax rates, passed new laws calling for the
creation of a credit bureau, and is developing an e-permit system, which should make it easier for businesses
to obtain permits.
Recent reform efforts highlight the importance of addressing the quality of reform implementation
alongside adoption of new reforms. While in recent years much attention has been given to developing
high quality framework legislation, the private sector has not responded to these reforms with greater levels of
investment. The private sector representatives often cite the limited or inconsistent level of implementation of
previous reforms. The lack of a consistent approach to ensuring proper implementation of normative legal acts
(NLAs) and the absence of an effective mechanism to monitor implementation were identiﬁed as main obstacles
for proper law implementation. This is not to say that the issue of implementation is entirely neglected; a number
of concrete actions to train government ofﬁcials, raise legal awareness of businesses, and monitor compliance are
being taken, but on an ad-hoc basis with great variability among regions and agencies (IFC 2013).
However, Tajikistan still struggles to improve various aspects of the business environment (Table E1,
Annex E). While there have been improvements, Tajikistan ranks 132nd in Doing Business—signiﬁcantly below its
Central Asia neighbors. The private sector continues to struggle with getting reliable access to electricity (ranked
177th), paying taxes (172nd), dealing with construction permits (152nd), resolving insolvency (147th), trading
across borders (132nd), getting credit (109th), and registering property (102nd) (Table E1, Annex E). Enterprise
surveys (WBG Enterprise Survey 2013) also reveal that approximately 20 percent of ﬁrms in Tajikistan identiﬁed
access to ﬁnance as a major constraint, followed by tax rate (17.9 percent), tax administration (11.2 percent),
electricity (10.4 percent), and practices of the informal sector (10.1 percent) (Figures E1, E2, Annex E). A variety
of indicators point to remaining weaknesses in overall regulatory quality in Tajikistan, and business regulations
in particular, including WB Governance Indicators (Figure E3, Annex E). Cumbersome regulatory requirements
increase chances of corruption: a third of ﬁrms say they are expected to give gifts in meetings with ofﬁcials and
37 percent expect to have to give gifts to public ofﬁcials “to get things done”, including government contracts,
licenses, permits, etc. (World Bank Enterprise Survey 2013).
While business registration requires few procedures, the cost of the process remains high. Tajikistan
has recently reduced the number of procedures necessary to start a business from 14 to 4. However, the cost of
registration (1,150 somoni or about 21.5 percent of income per capita) is very high (compared to about 4 percent
of income in Moldova and Kyrgyz Republic) and remains the highest among comparator countries (Table E2,
Annex E). This high cost may discourage ﬁrm creation and formalization of informal enterprises. Furthermore,
closing a business has also been reported as challenging and cumbersome (UNCTAD 2016).
Further simpliﬁcation of permit procedures is ongoing. Beyond registration, businesses need to obtain a
number of authorizations before they may start operations, including licensing and permitting requirements.76


76
     Only certain activities are subject to licensing requirements, but all businesses need some type of permit or authorization (UNCTAD 2016).

                                                                                                                                                  73
Some progress has been made with the adoption of the Law on Permits in 2011 with the goal to simplify the
business permitting process, standardize procedures and reduce the total number of permits (UNCTAD 2016,
(World Bank 2013b). To simplify permit issuing procedures and reduce the cost for businesses, an E–permit
system has been introduced in two pilot ministries (the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the Ministry
of Transport, which issue 31 types of permits or 35.6 percent of the total number of permitting documents).
Tajikistan has also modernized the regime for business inspections, but has yet to improve the coordi-
nation between inspectorates. While there has been signiﬁcant progress, the area of business inspections,77
which includes safety, environmental, labor, and other checks, remains a major obstacle to ﬁrms in Tajikistan, as
they often present an excessive burden to ﬁrms and opportunities for unofﬁcial payments. To further improve
inspection practices, the new Law on Inspections of Business Entities was adopted in December 2015. The
new Law, which entered into force on July 1, 2016, envisages that inspection bodies provide consultations to
economic entities on compliance of their activities and reduction of risks, instead of detection of violations. In
addition, the Law sets up new criteria for inspection bodies on reporting and performance appraisal and provides
for greater transparency in carrying out inspections and training inspectors. The crucial strength of the new
Law is the establishment of the Coordination Council under the Government to: i) coordinate the activities and
plans of inspection bodies, ii) ensure uniform implementation of the Law by entire inspection bodies, iii) approve
criteria for risk level assessment and operational performance appraisal, iv) review annual reports of inspection
bodies, and v) make recommendations to the Government on inspection system reforms. As noted above, the
key challenge going forward would be to ensure proper implementation of the new law and continuing involve-
ment of the private sector in monitoring and improving the implementation of new legislation.
In addition, competition remains very weak in Tajikistan. According to the 2014 EBRD index of competition
Tajikistan has one of the lowest scores (1.67) among comparison countries in ECA (Figure E7, Annex E). Research
shows that better competition policy and improved governance lead to higher employment creation among
late modernizers (Richter and Witkowski 2013). While basic competition legislation is in place,78 Tajikistan now
needs to improve the implementation of the competition law. There are important exceptions to antimonop-
oly rules, since a large number of activities in different sectors are listed as natural monopolies.79 As discussed
in Chapter 3, despite privatization, SOEs, which are active in various sectors in Tajikistan, continue to play an
important role in the economy. Private ﬁrms cannot compete with SOEs under the same conditions, which
undermines competition to a large extent.
All these constraints result in a low level of business density and high rates of informality, and the
overall small size of the private sector (as shown in Chapter 3). The private sector is dominated by small
ﬁrms that are often informal, and this makes it harder for formal businesses to compete because they face higher
relative tax burdens and fewer counterparts with whom they can document fair transactions for purposes of VAT.




77
   Tajikistan’s 2006 inspections law requiring inspectors to present an inspection order and ID contributed to a sharp decrease in the number
   of inspections: the average Tajik private ﬁrm was inspected just twice in 2007, compared to 10 times in 2002, while small and medium
   companies went through an average of ﬁve inspections in 2007, less than half the number they endured in 2005 (IFC 2009).
78
   The Law on Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic Activities on Markets of 2006 sets the basic principles and procedures of the Tajik
   competition regime and applies both to the regulation of private markets and to natural monopolies, including public utilities Amendments
   to the antimonopoly law were adopted in 2012. Among other changes, they lowered the threshold used for the deﬁnition of a dominant
   market position for a single company (UNCTAD 2016). The State Agency for Anti-Monopoly Policy and Enterprise Support is responsible for
   providing support for entrepreneurship; preventing and eliminating monopolistic activity, abuse of dominant market position, and unfair
   competition; and regulating prices for products of monopolistic enterprises.
79
   These are listed in article 5 of the Law of 2008 on Natural Monopolies (amended in 2013) and include: transportation of oil via pipelines;
   procurement and transmission of natural gas through main and/or distribution pipelines, exploitation of gas distribution systems and
   related gas distribution pipelines; production, transmission, and/or distribution of electricity (or) heat; rail transport services; services of

POLICY OPTIONS
Improve business regulations and overall regulatory quality:
∫ Lower further the costs of business registration procedures and adopt measures to simplify procedures for
  the closing of businesses; and
∫ Create an effective mechanism to ensure full and proper implementation of business inspection reforms and
  other reforms.
Improve SOE oversight and competition policies:
∫ Facilitate the exit of inefﬁcient SOEs to make room for the entry of new, dynamic ﬁrms, and introduce gov-
  ernance structures that serve to promote greater efﬁciency in SOEs. This would also require assessing the job
  impacts of privatizations and preparing programs to compensate workers and facilitate transitions to new
  jobs or early retirement; and
∫ Improve the implementation of the competition law. This includes conducting a systematic review of all
  exceptions to the antimonopoly rules and focusing the mandate of the antimonopoly agency on sanctioning
  anticompetitive practices.80


Reduce transport and logistics costs and improve facilitation to expand trade
Developing tradable sectors and promoting exports in Tajikistan is key for sustainable growth and job
creation. Indeed, Tajikistan has a relatively small domestic market, and so, for ﬁrms to expand to a competitive
scale and create jobs, they will need to serve wider markets. Further, trade offers ﬁrms access to technology and
knowledge that drive labor productivity growth. Recognizing potential signiﬁcant gains from trade, Tajikistan was
the second Central Asian country to be admitted to the World Trade Organization, in 2013. But the challenges
the country faces are considerable.
First, Tajikistan is Central Asia’s least accessible, most isolated country, with only limited regional and
international connectivity. This is partly a function of the country’s geography and topography: internal and
regional communications and transportation are problematic, especially in winter. As a result, logistics costs are
very high, accounting for about 23 percent of exported value and 18 percent of imported value (World Bank
2013). These costs greatly impact trade, the competitiveness of domestic products, and the potential for eco-
nomic diversiﬁcation, because they increase the costs of both inputs and exports. While railways could be more
cost-effective, given the mountainous topography and small rail network, the share of road transport in overall
trafﬁc ﬂows has been continually increasing. Roads are the country’s dominant mode of transport, carrying 90
percent of all passengers and almost 70 percent of cargo trafﬁc.81 Overloading of trucks is a major problem in
Tajikistan, increasing road deterioration and overall transportation costs.82
Second, regulations for international trade are extensive and border compliance is time consuming.
Compared to neighboring countries, Tajikistan requires more associated time and cost for both exporting and
importing goods (Table E3, Annex E). In line with WTO commitments, the Government has introduced parliamen-
tary amendments to the Customs Code aimed at reducing the number of documents required for trade activities.
Recently, Tajikistan made customs procedures more efﬁcient by making it possible to submit customs declarations
electronically. Existing clearance processes are generally consistent with regional practice and minimum inter-
national convention obligations, albeit with a high degree of physical interventions in cross-border movements.

   Ministry of Transport (MoT) is currently in the process of reviewing the rules, regulations and standards of axle load control, which are
   currently enforced by the State Service on Control and Regulation. The State Service uses mobile scales located at border posts and at
   its regional oﬃces to enforce current regulations, and a ban on travelling during the day has been issued for overloaded trucks with some
   limited results. The scales available in the country are old and require the vehicles to stop for the control of weight and inspection.

Tajikistan has been working on the development of the national Single Window83 for several years.84 However,
the necessary technical capacity is lacking, and ITC infrastructure is inadequate among the agencies that should
be connected to the private sector.
Third, Tajikistan, along with its neighbors, faces the challenge of connecting peripheral areas with
regional and global economic centers of activity. At the core of this challenge is the need to rebuild a
regional framework of connectivity that links population centers and economic hubs across borders in the Central
Asia region, in particular in the highly populated Fergana Valley.85 Relatively small investments in cross-border
transport links could potentially have a higher impact than the simple economic value added from reduced
transportation costs. However, this is a longer term agenda and can only be achieved if reforms in other areas
are addressed, including in trade facilitation.


POLICY OPTIONS
Reduce logistics costs:
∫ Address the issue of overloading of trucks with the weight-in-motion technology. While the upgrade of the
  existing axle-load-control system is planned, the introduction of weight-in-motion technology is needed to
  help address the issue of truck overloading; and
∫ Invest additional resources to develop procedures as well equipment to evaluate the road network data. This
  would be beneﬁcial at both the project and network levels.
Further improve the trade facilitation regime:
∫ Continue to develop the national Single Window approach for exports, imports and goods in transit. This would
  address systemic issues, such as lack of technical capacity and insufﬁcient ITC infrastructure, and thus improve
  the level of trade facilitation; and
∫ Further improve customs processes and procedures such as valuation and pre-arrival information to increase
  efﬁciency and transparency. For instance, it would be desirable to ensure that customs valuation is based
  on the value of the goods that are being imported (not a predetermined amount of duties) and introduce
  pre-arrival information to enable the customs administration to assess the risk of an incoming consignment
  before it even arrives at the border.




83
   The Single Window is a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a
   single entry point to fulﬁll all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. It facilitates the exchange of trade relevant infor-
   mation between traders and government agencies, and amongst government agencies, for obtaining permits and licenses, certiﬁcates
   and necessary approvals, http://tﬁg.unece.org/contents/single-window-for-trade.htm

Expand access to finance, especially for SMEs, to enable firms to grow
There is a growing body of evidence that shows that access to ﬁnance is important for job creation,
especially among small and medium enterprises. For instance, a recent cross-country study of 50,000 ﬁrms
across 70 developing countries found that increased access to ﬁnance results in higher employment growth,
especially among micro, small, and medium enterprises (Ayyagari et al. 2016). While it is difﬁcult to attribute job
creation effects entirely to access to ﬁnance, there are two important channels through which access to ﬁnance
positively affects jobs: i) external ﬁnance can increase the number of start-ups and facilitate entrepreneurship;
and ii) access to formal ﬁnancial sources allows higher investments in capital, new technologies, research and
innovation. Thus, improving access to ﬁnance could have positive effects on employment via the creation of
new ﬁrms and sustained growth of the existing ones (World Bank 2013).
Tajikistan’s ﬁnancial inclusion indicators are weak by regional standards (Table E4, Annex E). Financial
intermediation is low for several reasons, including low conﬁdence in the banking sector, which decreased
further in 2015-2016 following signs of a developing ﬁnancial crisis, the weaknesses in the outreach of the
banking sector to the regions,86 risk aversion of ﬁnancial service providers due to non-transparent ﬁnancial
operations of SMEs and/ or lack of transparent ﬁnancial statements, and a lack of bankable projects. Banking
penetration is low (deposits as a share of GDP were 14.2 percent in 2014), with less than 650,000 banking
accounts and the availability of ATM and point of sale (POS) infrastructure very limited.87
Access to ﬁnance was reported as the biggest obstacle to operations by 22.6 percent of ﬁrms in
Tajikistan in 2013.88 Moreover, access to ﬁnance remains unequal: only 15 percent of small ﬁrms and 11 percent
of medium-size ﬁrms have a bank loan/line of credit, compared to 28.5 percent of large ﬁrms. Access to credit
is more limited in rural areas (Tilekeyev 2014). Credit to the private sector increased from 20.2 percent of GDP
in 2014 to 23.2 percent in June 2015, though this likely reﬂects a potentially problematic trend of aggressive
credit growth in a ﬁnancial sector marked by weak governance and a high non-performing loans (NPL) ratio.
The reported NPL ratios (more than 60 days overdue) increased to around 30 percent of total loans by the end
of 2015 from 9.5 percent at the end of 2012. Government interference and state-directed lending had also
contributed to the deterioration of loan portfolio quality for many years (World Bank 2015c). The low level of
access to credit and ﬁnancial sector vulnerabilities may be partly responsible for the slow growth of small ﬁrms
in Tajikistan, as observed in Chapter 3.
Maturity mismatches between SME ﬁnancing needs and the ability of ﬁnancial institutions to provide long-term
ﬁnancing, as well as high interest rates, prevent SMEs from accessing credit. Most loans are issued for a period
of 6 to 18 months, 80 percent of loans are for less than one year, and the maximum maturity is three years.89
Interest rates and average interest rate spreads in Tajikistan remain the highest in the region (Table E5, Annex E).90
The high spread is often interpreted as a signal of inefﬁciency, low competition in the banking sector, and/or
funding constraints and high operational costs. Both banks and microﬁnance institutions (MFIs) rely heavily on
collateral rather than cash ﬂow and business sustainability projections for lending decisions. That is why the
average Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio (or in other words, requirements for collateral) is above 120 percent, which
limits access to ﬁnance for SMEs due to insufﬁcient collateral. Most MFI lending is focused on urban centers,
especially Dushanbe, Khujand and Kurgan Tube, but MFIs are expanding into rural areas more actively than the
banks. Regulations on agent banking place limits on branchless banking services that MFIs can offer in rural
areas. Finally, prolonged directed lending practices, as well as discriminatory bank forbearance, have undermined
the level playing ﬁeld in the ﬁnancial sector.

POLICY OPTIONS
Stabilize and develop the banking sector:
∫ In the short run, prevent further deterioration of the banking sector. In addition to having an effective ﬁnancial
  crisis preparedness and management mechanism in place,91 the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) should take
  urgent steps to resolve NPLs, put a new bank resolution framework in place and improve the ﬁnancial stability
  of the system, and improve risk management and governance practices in the ﬁnancial sector; and
∫ To improve the banking sector in the medium to long run, enhance enforcement of regulatory norms, strengthen
  credit practices and culture, and develop new lending mechanisms focused on SMEs’ ﬁnancing needs.
Expand access to credit, particularly for small and medium enterprises and small-scale entrepreneurs:
∫ Diversify collateral requirements and proceed with secured transaction reform to reduce lending risks, so as
  to expand access to ﬁnance for the SME sector;
∫ Further develop ﬁnancial institutions’ footprint across the whole country and
∫ Develop payment systems and alternative delivery channels to deliver ﬁnancial services to rural areas of
  Tajikistan; and
∫ Support SMEs’ growth through ﬁnancing new equipment and technologies. This can be done through the
  effective development of leasing as a ﬁnancing mechanism and of lending products for equity and equipment
  ﬁnancing. In addition, support can be given to ﬁnancial institutions in developing new products speciﬁcally
  focused on SME ﬁnancing.


Attract foreign direct investments to enable more jobs
Attracting higher levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important part of the proposed jobs
strategy. FDI can help create better (higher-skilled) and better-paid jobs, promote the transfer of knowledge,
raise labor productivity, and diversify and upgrade the value-added component of exports—all of which affect a
country’s ability to integrate with global value chains and grow. Research shows that, to mobilize FDI and max-
imize potential beneﬁts, appropriate investment policies are required (Echandi, Krajcovicova and Qiang 2015).
Foreign and domestic investments in Tajikistan remain low (Figure E8, Annex E) and are concentrated in a few
large projects, with the extractive sector attracting more than half of the inﬂows since 2009 (UNCTAD 2016).
One of the key obstacles to attracting greater foreign investment is the relatively low level of protection92
afforded to investors in Tajikistan (Table E6, Annex E). The weak business environment and poor protection for
investors leads to exceptionally low levels of overall investment in Tajikistan and undermines the government’s
ability to invest in infrastructure because of difﬁculty in mobilizing public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Tajikistan’s legislation on investments has not been sufﬁciently detailed, which affected its clarity
and predictability (UNCTAD 2016). The Law on Investment (2007) created a uniform regime for both local and
foreign companies grounded on the principle of non-discrimination.93 A new Law on Investment was passed
in March 2016 and deﬁnes FDI through a minimum threshold of 10 percent foreign ownership of ﬁrms. It also
provides for setting up a one-stop shop for investors. Despite some improvements, the deﬁnition of investment
remains very broad as it extends to portfolio investments, which are typically regulated by separate legislations
due to the speciﬁc regulatory challenges that they pose. The Law on Investment Agreements (2013) does
not identify priority sectors or provide established eligibility criteria for special treatment (e.g. size of invest-
ments, impact on employment creation) (Ibid). Until recently, foreign investors faced additional costs to register


 91
    Speciﬁcally, Financial Stability reports should be published on regular basis and be available for the market.
 92
    This protection includes equal treatment under domestic law, appeals and procedures to deal with expropriation, remittance of proﬁts,
    contract enforcement, currency convertibility, rights for foreign citizens to own land and other assets, and other sector-speciﬁc issues.
 93
    In addition, Law of 2013 on Investment Agreements regulates investment contracts concluded between the State and investors on
    projects identiﬁed as priorities. The Concept on State Policy for Attraction and Protection of Investment of 2012 provides a strategic vision
    and context for investment attraction. Other laws containing FDI-related provisions include Law of 2012 on Public-Private Partnerships,
    Law of 2012 on Production Sharing Agreements and Law of 2011 on Free Economic Zones (UNCTAD 2016).

companies, linked to translation and notarization requirements. To address this issue, in February 2015 Tajikistan
acceded to the Apostille Convention.94
Tajikistan also has a number of tax incentives to attract investment and established four Free Economic Zones
(FEZ), located in Sogd, Dangara, Panj and Ishkoshim, which provide reduced taxes and customs fees.95 The overall
effect of these measures remains limited and results vary by FEZ.96 Currently, investment promotion policy rests
with the State Committee on Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM) and implementation with
an investment promotion agency “TajInvest.” In addition, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade
designs policies related to investment in the free economic zones. Tajikistan has also put in place a public-private
dialogue (PPD) mechanism at the level of the President (the Consultative Council on Improvement of Investment
Climate), which is tasked to discuss and prepare recommendations for submission to the President and the
Government on issues related to private sector development and investment promotion. However, TajInvest’s
capacity to carry out pro-active and targeted investment promotion campaigns is low. Moreover, coordination
mechanisms between the agency and other stakeholders should be further developed in order to enhance the
effectiveness of FDI promotion efforts (UNCTAD 2016).


POLICY OPTIONS
Improve investment policy coordination and implementation:
∫ Authorize a relevant state body (e.g. SCISPM) to coordinate all state bodies responsible for granting or mon-
  itoring investment incentives;
∫ Streamline the control and monitoring of procedures related to the awarding and subsequent application of
  investment beneﬁts, which will make it possible to assess the effectiveness of those incentives;
∫ Reassess the incentive policy in terms of costs and beneﬁts, which will enable state authorities to study how
  provision of the incentives contributes to achievement of their priority objectives and evaluate various costs
  related to those incentives.
∫ Publish cohesive, consistent and consolidated information about investment incentives available in Tajikistan
  on the ofﬁcial websites of state bodies; and
∫ Move forward with reforms to create a single window for foreign investors (UNCTAD 2016).


Getting the future workforce off to a good start now is key to success in the future. While this pillar
primarily focuses on getting the fundamentals right in terms of enabling more private sector investment, a key
ingredient of success in the future would be to have a workforce that is equipped for the new type of jobs
that such investments might bring. Therefore, a long-term strategy should also involve long-term investments
in human capital. While human development policies such as early childhood and basic education are outside
the scope of a Jobs Strategy, it is, nevertheless, an important fundamental to ensure that the jobs created in
the future have the workers with the necessary skills. The successful policies to help ensure this are highlighted
in Spotlight 2.

SPOTLIGHT 2: GETTING THE FUTURE WORKFORCE OFF TO A GOOD START
The creation of quality jobs depends critically on the levels and relevance of skills in the workforce. To meet the
expected growing demand for better higher-order skills in the workplace, policy makers need to address skill for-
mation across all stages of life (Figure 1): from conception to preschool (or early childhood development [ECD]);
general education; higher education; and in-work training for members of the workforce. At all levels of education
and training, a broad focus on cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation is crucial to ensure that skills are valued in
the current and future labor market. The market needs a comprehensive skills development strategy that improves
the quality and relevance of education and training in a way that everyone is able to build market-valued skills.
The importance of skills for employment outcomes is clear, yet Tajikistan’s skill-formation track record for education
and training is mixed. Workers with higher educational attainment generally have higher cognitive and non-cognitive
skills, while there is considerable variation in these skills across workers within educational attainment categories,
which means that there are too many low performers in each educational attainment level.
Although the education system in Tajikistan provides universal access to education and enrollment at primary and
secondary education is comparable to regional averages, skills gaps emerge at early ages given the low coverage
of early childhood education (ECE) programs. In Tajikistan, only 12 percent of preschool age children attended ECE
programs in 2014 (compared to 34 percent in Uzbekistan). In addition, the eﬀectiveness of the existing public
pre-school education is a concern in light of the 2011 USAID the Early Grades Reading Assessment (EGRA) ﬁnding
that primary school children who had attended pre-school did not have better reading skills than children who had
not attended pre-school.
Given that the foundations of cognitive and behavioral skills are formed early in life, the early childhood period is
critical in the development of these skills, and this includes having adequate nutrition and stimulation. With respect
to the former, approximately 15 percent of all children under the age of ﬁve suﬀer from malnutrition and moderate
and severe stunting is prevalent, aﬀecting 39 percent of all children under the age of ﬁve (UNICEF 2013, WHO 2013).
Malnutrition and stunting severely, and often irreversibly, aﬀect children’s physical and cognitive development, which
in turn limits their capacity to learn. In general, rural children and children born to mothers with less education are
more likely to be stunted.
While coverage for general education is relatively high (more than 90 percent enrolled in grade 9), performance
of the general education system in terms of learning achievements could be improved. 30 percent of girls and 31
percent of boys in Grade 2 did not meet national standards for reading ﬂuency, rising to 45 percent and 56 percent,
respectively, in Grade 4 (EGRA). Students also struggled with inferential questions, indicating low levels of cognitive
development in terms of critical thinking and reading comprehension.

POLICY OPTIONS
The following suggestions must be prioritized if the skills attainment among the future Tajik workforce is to be
improved. These measures are unlikely to impact new labor market entrants in the short- to medium-term, but
are important for preparing future cohorts for the labor market.
Getting children oﬀ to the right start by expanding access to quality ECD programs which are critical to ensuring
that all children acquire the cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are conducive to high productivity and ﬂexibility
in the labor market. This entails:
¬ Supporting access to quality pre-school services through expansion of half-day pre-school programs; and
¬ Developing a multi-sectoral policy to ensure a holistic approach to ECD. This needs to include measures to
      provide multi-sectoral services to children 0 to 3 years old and to reach their parents with educational
      support on feeding, child development, curriculum and other issues of concern.
Ensuring that all students learn eﬀectively by modernizing the curriculum and improving teaching quality, in order
to strengthen the link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-cognitive skills. This entails:
¬ Continuing the reforms to move from knowledge- to competency-based learning in general education and
      incorporating life skills in the basic education curriculum
¬     Updating teacher preparation and/or professional development to ensure the pipeline and current supply of
      teachers is well prepared to implement the revised ECD programs, and other changes to the curriculum.
      These changes are necessary but will have no impact if teachers are not prepared.
¬     Ensuring that updating of the curriculum is a continuous process based on substantive and sustainable feed-
      back between the labor market and professional education.
¬     Establishing or enhancing a Quality Assurance System for all levels of education.

PILLAR 2: IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EARNINGS, AND ACCESS TO FORMAL JOBS
The quality of jobs in Tajikistan is a concern, as many people have jobs, but of a temporary, seasonal,
or occasional nature without a regular source of income. These are jobs with low labor productivity and
earnings, and often poor working conditions. The majority of these jobs are informal, not offering basic social
protections in case of job loss, injury or sickness. There is an important agenda therefore to improve the quality
of jobs with a focus on poor and vulnerable workers. The quality of jobs is a particular issue outside of Dushanbe,
especially in rural areas, where a large part of the population still relies on agriculture as the main source of
employment. With poor access to national and international markets, farmers are forced to operate on a sub-
sistence level or trade in thin local markets where returns could be suppressed by low demand.
This second pillar of the strategy focuses on strengthening selected value chains, connecting small
producers and ﬁrms, and improving incentives for formal jobs. Developing and integrating value chains97
offers the potential to create and improve the quality of jobs in rural regions and in urban areas alike, both to
wage earners and the self-employed (small producers and microenterprises). This requires provision of tools and
mechanisms for managing market failures (such as access to markets or ﬁnance, in particular for small producers)
and risks and vulnerabilities (through social insurance for vulnerable workers, e.g. informal wage employees
working without a contract, self-employed not contributing to social insurance, unpaid family workers). It is
important to improve the incentives for both ﬁrms and workers to formalize.
The following discussion is organized around the following set of policies: i) Strengthening local value chains
and support to rural SMEs; and ii) Improving incentives for formal jobs.

      A value chain consists of the activities needed to bring a product from the initial idea and conception to its ﬁnal market. These activities
      include design, production, marketing, distribution and support services, up to the ﬁnal consumer.

                                                                                                                                                     81
Strengthening local value chains and support to rural SMEs
The market organization (value chains) in the agriculture sector remains fragmented, which limits the
country’s ability to respond effectively to market opportunities. On the demand side, issues range from
poor access to credit for working capital and investments to weak market links. Along with barriers to entry and
expansion, all of these constrain the demand of agro-processors and traders for agricultural commodities. As
a result, processing companies and traders struggle to secure a reliable supply of raw material, lack investment
ﬁnance to modernize their equipment, and have limited knowledge of improved technologies, modern product
standards and food safety. On the supply side, low farm productivity— resulting primarily from poor access to
investment and working capital ﬁnance and technological knowledge—limits value added. Farmer capacity to
market their products is also constrained by inexperience with market activity and low economies of scale. Only
one-third of crop producers currently sell their output and, of those, more than half (52 percent) sell at the farm
gate (World Bank 2013a). An estimated 32 percent sell in local markets and 15 percent in national or export
markets. Farm input markets are also weak. Strengthening the competitiveness of agricultural value chains is crit-
ical to providing sustainable, productive earnings opportunities for households outside of the metropolitan areas.
Rural SMEs tend to face a double challenge of distance from markets and small size. This is compounded
by lack of access to critical services that support market access and the exploitation of scale economies. While
rural SMEs in Tajikistan are not restricted from access to ﬁnance, their options are often limited only to what
is available from microﬁnance institutions with rural outreach. On the other hand, SMEs in urban areas enjoy
access to a much wider variety of ﬁnancial products. Similarly, while urban SMEs can take advantage of multiple
information networks that ﬂow from urban agglomerations, rural SMEs could be dislocated from such infor-
mation and business networks, and often lack the ICT infrastructure to access information through alternative
sources. Thus, supporting rural SMEs will require targeted support for market information and access to ﬁnance
that may be qualitatively different, both in the nature of the service and its delivery.
The policy options below have broad applicability. While the focus is on rural areas, given that this is where
the majority of people still reside, and the agricultural sector, where a large share of people work, these policies
could be equally applicable to other sectors of the economy and areas of the country. Spotlight 3 provides further
discussion of the agricultural sector and measures that can support the creation of better jobs in the sector.


POLICY OPTIONS
Promote value chain development:
∫ Support the links between small producer and lead ﬁrms in the value chains;
∫ Facilitate opportunities for value addition (processing); and
∫ Pilot comprehensive value chain development strategies in speciﬁc sub-sectors and regions, including, for
  example, interventions to raise skills and productivity at the farm/ﬁrm level, investment in logistics infrastruc-
  ture and services, access to ﬁnance, and market access support.
Increase support to rural SMEs for access to new technologies, information, networks, and ﬁnance:
∫ Consider piloting subsidized access to new technologies, ICT, and innovative platforms for information deliv-
  ery, and opening up new channels for SME ﬁnance; and
∫ Ensure the availability of products that are relevant to rural business needs (e.g. agriculture), business incu-
  bation, and promoting business networks.

Improve incentives for formal jobs
Informality is pervasive In Tajikistan. The decision to operate formally vs. informally involves costs and bene-
ﬁts for both employers and workers. The formal sector brings the potential for higher productivity and earnings
and greater worker security. But the costs are not negligible, such as taxes on proﬁts and earnings; social security
contributions; and the costs of registration and compliance with government regulations.
The social security system is not well designed to promote formalization. Tajikistan has a formal social
security system composed of old-age, disability, and survivorship pensions as well as unemployment, sickness,
and maternity insurances, and other beneﬁts. The system is funded by a contribution of 25 percent levied on the
wage bill of the formal sector and 20 percent applied to net revenues of the self-employed. The current social
insurance system does not provide incentives for the informal sector to join and does not explicitly cater to them,
apart from the reduced contribution rate; no other special schemes are offered for informal sector or agriculture
workers. Furthermore, high labor taxes may be pushing employment to the shadow economy/informal sector.
The current total rate of social security contributions is 26 percent99 (compared to 10 percent in Kazakhstan) and
may be prohibitively high, especially for small and medium-sized ﬁrms, operating in low productivity sectors.
Coverage of the informal sector by social security schemes remains low. The Tax Administration is in
charge of collecting all social security contributions; however, underpayments and underreporting are prevalent.
This results both in underfunding of the pension scheme and in the inability of some workers to accrue pension
rights. More efforts need to be put in place to expand the coverage of the informal sector, through enhanced
design and implementation which takes into account current constraints such as the low productivity of informal
businesses/the self-employed.


POLICY OPTIONS
Consider strengthening incentives to formalize jobs and expand social security coverage:
∫ Assess whether the current system of labor taxation may be discouraging formalization; for example: Is the
  rate of social security contributions too high especially for SMEs in low productivity sectors? Is the current
  regime for the self-employed providing sufﬁcient incentives for them all to contribute?
∫ Research options for effective engagement with rural workers, utilizing various forms of presumed taxation
  for assessment of contribution liabilities.

     Employer pays 25 percent of gross salaries to ﬁnance old age, disability, and survivor pensions. Employee pays 1 percent, which is meant
     to ﬁnance a notional deﬁned contribution account introduced in 2013. The employer’s contributions also ﬁnance sickness and maternity,
     unemployment beneﬁts and family allowance. Self-employed persons pay 20 percent of declared income; certain categories of self-em-
     ployed pay a ﬂat-rate contribution of 15 somoni.

                                                                                                                                                83
SPOTLIGHT 3: AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY IN TAJIKISTAN
Sector Overview
93 percent of Tajikistan is covered in mountains; arable land accounts for only 6 percent of the total land area.
Despite this, the agricultural sector accounts for more than 24 percent of GDP and up to 66 percent100 of total
employment. The sector has a strong impact on the country’s overall economic performance, and it plays a major
role in poverty reduction, as more than 75 percent of the poor live in rural areas (World Bank 2014a).
The Agricultural Sector in Tajikistan is important for:
¬ Employment, mainly in rural areas. Agricultural employment accounts for nearly 40 percent of total rural
                    employment, around 38 percent of which comes from salaried jobs in non-farm activities (World Bank
                    2013a).
¬                   Poverty reduction. Crop, and livestock production, along with remittances, are the top three most common
                    sources of income for poor households (World Bank 2013a).
¬                   Exports. Overall agricultural exports amounted to US$206 million in 2012, representing around 20 percent of
                    total exports. Raw cotton dominates agricultural exports, with dried fruits and onions coming a distant
                    second and third (World Bank 2014a).
¬                   Food security. Growth in the agricultural sector also contributes to improved food security. As much as 75
                    percent of agricultural output could be consumed on-farm (World Bank 2014a). At the same time, almost a
                    third of the population suﬀers from malnutrition. Tajikistan’s households spend a large share of their income
                    on food: more than around 50 percent on average, and the poorest households spend even more than 60
                    percent of their income on food.
The sector has been undergoing continuous structural reforms, especially since the 2007 Freedom to Farm Reform.
The improved performance of the agricultural sector in the country has been stimulated by the land privatization
and agriculture reforms of the last 20 years, in particular the Freedom to Farm Reform (Figure 1).
The reforms have promoted a dramatic increase in the share of private and individual farming. Small-
scale, private dekhan farms101 with an average of 2.8 hectares (Ha) of arable land and 4.9 Ha of agricultural land, have
increased in number to more than 125,000 (2014). Dekhans now control agricultural production with 80 percent of
arable land and 70 percent of agricultural land, and they continue to grow in number as the land reform continues to
progress. Today, private farms contribute 91 percent of the Gross Agricultural Output (GAO), up from 36 percent in 1991.

                     Which tend to be owned by multiple shareholders, such as extended families. In most cases, the land plot owned by one such farm share-
                    holder is 0.2Ha.

Although farm productivity and labor productivity have increased signiﬁcantly in response to this
reform, they still lag other countries in the region and elsewhere. Even though such reforms have increased
farm output, the scale of farm operations has fallen as a result of the breakup of the collective farms, thus hindering
economies of scale in production and sale of agricultural products. Labor productivity, although improving, lags
behind some of the comparator countries (Figure 2).
Weak agricultural commercialization has limited the sector’s ability to beneﬁt from the growth in
demand for agricultural products in domestic and export markets. Only one-third of crop producers
currently sell their output, and more than half of these (52 percent) sell at the farm gate (World Bank 2013a). In
domestic markets, the volume of food retail trade grew by 39 percent in real terms from 2007-2012, in response
to increased personal disposable income and continued population growth. Yet, most of this increased demand
has been met by imports, which grew by 11.6 percent annually during 2006-2011. Exports of Tajik food products
grew at a much slower rate, by an average of only 4.7 percent during the same period. Market organization (value
chains) in the agriculture sector remains fragmented and disjointed, and this limits the country’s ability to respond
eﬀectively to market opportunities.
The investment climate does not fully support competitive agribusiness development. The Enabling
Business of Agriculture Survey evaluates three cross-cutting categories: (i) Operation indicators: these identify and
measure the requirements for local companies on how to enter the market and start business activities; (ii) Quality
control indicators: these measure the regulations governing plant protection, the safety standards for users of agri-
cultural machinery and quality control associated with seeds and fertilizer products; and (iii) Trade indicators: these
measure trade restrictions on exporting agricultural products; importing fertilizer and tractors; and transporting
goods across borders. While Tajikistan is doing quite well in the areas of markets and transport, access to fertilizer
is diﬃcult, and access to ﬁnance seems to be particularly constrained. It should be noted, however, that assess-
ments of market access and transport are regulatory-based and may not capture the diﬃculties on the ground.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
¬ Promote agricultural sector linkages and organization by removing demand and supply side
  constraints along the value chains. On the demand side, issues to be addressed range from poor access
  to credit for working capital and investments to weak market links. Barriers to entry and expansion constrain
  the demand of agro-processors and traders for agricultural commodities. On the supply side, lack of skills
  needs to be addressed through assessments, followed by provision of training and advisory services neces-
  sary to support increased commercialization of farm and agribusiness products for producer associations,
  farmers, agro-processors, agribusiness enterprises, and agro-input dealers.
¬ Improve the capacity to identify and respond to market opportunities. This is particularly important
  now, given that regional export markets are expected to grow strongly in response to improved rail links
  through southern Tajikistan into Turkmenistan; this is a route that also aﬀords access to markets in the
  Caucasus, the Middle East, and Europe. Market intelligence should be developed as part of training, as well as
  the establishment of a virtual stock market for
  agro-based products.
¬ Refocus the education system (in particular in agriculture and food technology) to respond to the
  future market demand of a highly skilled labor force in agriculture and agribusiness. This would need
  to include curriculum modernization and re-orientation to the issues faced by the new generation of mixed,
  small-scale farms, and commercial agribusiness enterprises. Moreover, the expansion of farmer training pro-
  grams should be supported by ﬁnancing measures to update their curricula, teaching materials, equipment,
  and facilities.
¬ Further promote agro-processing in both rural and urban areas. The expansion of the agro-process-
  ing sector and the promotion of high value agriculture could support the creation of on-farm and oﬀ-farm
  agricultural employment in both rural and urban areas (as large-scale agro-processers tend to locate their
  plants in or near urban areas). This could involve niche products such as ﬂowers, which is usually more
  labor-intensive and requires a highly qualiﬁed labor force.
¬ Improve productivity. Productivity gains can be realized through improved access to agricultural inputs and
  better on-farm management techniques, such as better soil preparation, optimum fertilizer and chemical use;
  wider use of improved varieties and certiﬁed seeds; increased fodder production; and better livestock husbandry.
¬ Support rural non-farm SMEs. Although the developed supply chains will create new opportunities, it will
  not fully compensate for the jobs lost in primary agriculture. New jobs and opportunities need to be generated
  in rural non-farm sectors (services and manufacturing).

PILLAR 3: CONNECTING PEOPLE TO JOBS
Chapter 2 outlined a number of problems with the labor market, namely: i) there are too many potential workers
outside the labor force, especially women and youth; ii) there are signiﬁcant differences in labor market outcomes
of individuals depending on their educational attainment, region of residence and gender; and iii) migration is
an important jobs strategy for many Tajik households.
This third pillar of the strategy therefore focuses on a set of supply side policies and programs aimed at: i)
increasing labor force participation through a set of enabling policies; ii) improving access to jobs through labor
market policies; and iii) increasing and leveraging the beneﬁts of migration.

Promote enabling polices to increase labor force participation
As Chapter 2 shows, women and youth are highly represented among potential workers who are
outside the labor force and thus, are not contributing to the economy. Female labor force participation
(and employment) rates are lower than male labor force participation (and employment) rates at all age groups,
indicating that there may be signiﬁcant barriers for women to enter the labor market (including, childcare duties,
lack of education and skills, legislative barriers, social norms and discrimination). However, those women who
would like to enter the labor force and have gainful employment are likely to face more barriers than men.

                                                                                                                      86
A lack of affordable, high-quality childcare and day-care facilities and family support are important
barriers to labor market participation, especially among young women (Davalos et al. 2016). In Tajikistan,
there was a steady deterioration in access to pre-schools following independence and the civil war.102 Several
studies have established the positive effect that affordable childcare options can have on boosting female labor
supply.103 Early childhood education programs can also be part of Tajikistan’s long-term jobs strategy because
they ensure that all children acquire the cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are conducive to high productivity
when those children grow up and join the labor market (Spotlight 2).
Finally, some of the barriers to female labor force participation are legislative. Tajikistan’s labor legislation
has a number restrictions that bar women from participating in some occupations or sectors (Spotlight 1). These
could dissuade women from undertaking studies in certain ﬁelds and entering the labor market. Conversely, law
abiding entrepreneurs will be reluctant to hire women to carry out tasks if they are legally prohibited from doing
so. The two reinforcing actions lead to segregation, and in many cases, wages get inﬂated in gender segregated
industries (World Bank 2016e). Removing these legislative barriers to female employment is not expensive and
other countries have done so successfully.104
There are a number of factors that keep youth out of the labor force. Although more work is needed in
this area, the key determinants of inactivity appear to be high reservation wages in anticipation of migration
opportunities, low educational attainment, and location of residence.


POLICY OPTIONS
Increase childcare and early childhood education access:
∫ Expand good-quality and affordable childcare and expand access to early childhood education, thereby helping
  to bring women into the labor market.
Remove legislative restrictions to sectors and occupations:
∫ Remove unnecessary gender based restrictions to increase the employment opportunities for women and
  reduce occupational segregation. These legislative changes have the potential to improve women’s earnings
  potential, since many restricted jobs are often in higher-paying sectors.
Consider interventions to overcome and inﬂuence social norms:
∫ Shift aspirations and expectations through role models and mentoring, or media interventions (e.g. TV,
  campaigns, radio), to expose people to information and role models;
∫ Disseminate information on increased job opportunities for young women.

Use labor market policies to improve access to jobs
There are information asymmetries in the Tajik labor market. For example, more than two-thirds of all
working age adults (68 percent) indicated that they face signiﬁcant constraints in learning about job vacancies
in Tajikistan (Arias at al. 2014). Similarly, there is no information system, such as a labor market observatory,
that offers students information about labor market outcomes to help them make informed choices about what
topics to specialize in. Labor market intermediation and labor market observatories can facilitate movement
across geographic areas and can provide the information needed to help students make more informed choices,
because they provide information about job vacancies and wages for workers. A number of countries have

102
    With the collapse of the Soviet system and the destruction during the civil war, the network of pre-schools in Tajikistan deteriorated.
    From 1991 to 2009 the total number of pre-schools fell from 944 in 1991 to 467 in 2009. There was also a misallocation of pre-schools
    geographically; by 2009, there were 350 pre-schools in urban areas compared to 137 in rural areas. For a country that is about 27 percent
    urbanized, the disproportionate distribution of pre-schools in urban areas shows that the existing pre-schools are not strategically
    positioned (ILO, 2014).
103
    See, for example, Attanasio, Low, and Sanchez-Marcos (2008); Nollenberger and Rodríguez-Planas (2011); Sánchez-Mangas
    and Sánchez-Marcos (2008).
104
    Hungary and Belarus are two examples of countries in the Europe and Central Asia region where reforms were introduced to remove or
    reduce the number of gender based employment restrictions.

                                                                                                                                                87
successfully implemented labor market information systems to reduce information asymmetries. In Poland, for
example, an employment observatory was introduced to provide information on job availability, wages, career
prospects, and hiring expectations (Arias et al. 2014). Employment observatories have also been established in
Chile and Colombia. The rationale behind employment observatories is that information about major industries,
recent growth areas, occupations experiencing shortages, qualiﬁcations needed for jobs, and other relevant
information, can help people make better-informed choices about their education and careers. Access to this
type of information is widely available in the United States, the EU countries, and Australia.
Active labor market programs can be used to help people transition from inactivity to work or to
access better jobs, but the current range and scale of programs is very limited. Active labor market pro-
grams (ALMPs), which are usually a combination of policy tools that support and incentivize job-searching and
job-ﬁnding, have been used effectively in many countries. ALMPs can strengthen the motivation, the capabilities,
and the opportunities of a targeted population. ALMPs cover a wide range of interventions that can target labor
supply with, for example, training programs, and labor demand through, for example, public works projects or
employment subsidies. They can also foster the matching of workers and jobs through intermediation services.
The current range and scope of programs offered in Tajikistan remains limited, however.
Educational attainment is a key determinant of employment outcomes but skills mismatches persist
in Tajikistan (Ajwad et al. 2014). Problems include: the relevance of results from a predominantly supply-driven
orientation to skills development, weak linkages between education institutions and the labor market, obsolete
education standards, and curricula that are not based on occupational and functional analysis. The lack of a
functioning and independent qualiﬁcations system exacerbates the challenge of reducing inefﬁciencies due to
unnecessary or irrelevant education and training provision. The issues of the quality and relevance of TVET and
higher education are high on the Government’s agenda, and there are two simultaneous donor-supported efforts
aimed at modernizing both sectors in improving the skills and labor market outcomes of youth in Tajikistan.105 In
recent years, Tajikistan’s TVET system has been beneﬁting from support from international development partners.106
These partners are now seeking to address past constraints, including: i) insufﬁcient involvement of local authorities;
ii) weak capacity and experience of TVET staff; iii) limited resources to modernize facilities and teaching materials;
and iv) weak mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating implementation of the TVET strategy (ETF, 2015).
In addition, there are limited opportunities for relevant training and retraining opportunities, even
on the job. While there is a perception that the skills being taught at TVET institutions and universities are
poorly aligned with the needs of employers, very few employers offer on the job training (OJT) to employees. In
Tajikistan, only one third of ﬁrms offer their employees formal training, while small ﬁrms are least likely to offer
training (21. 7 percent) compared to medium (43 percent) and large ﬁrms (52.6 percent) (World Bank Group
Enterprise Survey 2013).


POLICY OPTIONS
Improve information on education and training and labor markets available to labor market participants:
∫ Scale up labor market information systems and labor market intermediation services to help improve the
  job search;
∫ Enhance the Employment Agency’s capacity to provide information to clients (graduating students, ﬁrst time
  jobseekers, women, etc.) and better match them with services and vacancies; and
∫ Provide professional orientation in the school system and early in the school-to-work transition to provide
  youth with information that can inform their educational and labor market choices.

     The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports a $32 million project, approved in November 2015, to promote a demand-driven, quality-as-
     sured, and ﬂexible technical and vocational education and training (TVET) delivery system in Tajikistan. The project aims to modernize
     the TVET system by developing industry-endorsed standards, and competency-based training and assessment tools for 17 priority
     occupations. Additionally, in June 2015 The World Bank Board approved a US$15 million Tajikistan Higher Education Project with a goal to
     develop mechanisms that improve and monitor the quality and labor-market relevance of higher education.
 106
     Partners include the European Training Foundation (ETF) and the Asian Development Bank.

                                                                                                                                                88
Pilot targeted active labor market programs to activate the inactive population and connect job
seekers to better jobs:
∫ Consider the “public works plus” model,107 which in addition to providing income support, links beneﬁciaries
  to employment and community services; and
∫ Proﬁle beneﬁciaries before offering these programs. Tailoring programs to target groups, carrying out monitor-
  ing and evaluation, and in general providing integrated services can be more effective than individual services.

Implement integrated training programs and promote on the job training
to upskill potential and current workers:
∫ Consider integrated programs that combine training (i.e., job and/or life-skills training), job search assistance,
  entrepreneurial services, and a range of other social and employment-related support services (Sanchez Puerta
  et al. 2015); and
∫ Leverage international experience, which suggests that the key to making training programs successful is to
  put in place incentives for training, such as placing beneﬁciaries in jobs through performance-based contracts
  (Ibid).
∫ Consider short-term subsidies or matching grants to ﬁrms to invest in on-the-job training: To address
  under-provision of OJT, consider providing short-term subsidies or matching grants to ﬁrms to incentivize
  them to invest in training of their employees. Such grants could be targeted to ﬁrms with growth potential,
  such as young innovative start-ups, rather than focusing only on ﬁrm size. Other ﬁrm characteristics that could
  be used as proxies for targeting include the ﬁrm’s sector of activity, the frequency of technology adoption, or
  the gaps between wages and productivity (Sanchez Puerta et al. 2015).

Consider programs targeted at youth taking into account lessons learned:108
∫ Integrate interventions/services: youth are likely to face multiple constraints affecting their likelihood of getting
  a job and the associated earnings. Thus, offering an integrated package of services increases the likelihood of
  success of a given program, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, there do not seem to be
  any strong patterns of speciﬁc interventions that perform better than others. It depends on the characteristics
  and challenges faced by the targeted population, as well as the country context;
∫ Proﬁle beneﬁciaries: proﬁling is the identiﬁcation of individual factors that represent a risk in the labor market
  and assigning appropriate services based on this, which allows a better understanding and response to the
  constraints faced by individuals, and thus they can be directed to the services that best ﬁt the challenges they
  face and their needs;
∫ Provide incentives for private sector providers: Programs implemented solely by the private sector seem to
  perform better than joint public-private implementation or sole implementation by the government. The
  rationale may be that such providers are better positioned to respond to the needs of both employers and job
  seekers. Therefore, outsourcing services to competitively selected private sector providers paid by performance
  and results may contribute to improved outcomes; and
∫ Establish strong monitoring systems: a monitoring system that continuously tracks beneﬁciaries’ performance
  during the program increases the likelihood that they complete and/or reach better results; such a system
  aims to ensure that the intervention is delivering the expected results, and to obtain feedback on whether
  adjustments are needed both in the composition and intensity of services.

Scale up policies and programs to better leverage migration
Migration has become and will continue to be an important component of Tajikistan’s jobs strategy.
Migration has alleviated the pressure on the Tajik labor market by giving workers opportunities to earn higher
incomes, sometimes many multiples of the wages that they would receive in Tajikistan. In addition, many of the

       Kluve at al. (2016).

                                                                                                                          89
returning migrant workers believe that the international work experience they received has a positive impact
on current work opportunities in Tajikistan. Tajik preference for work in the Russian Federation is not surprising
given the historical ties and the signiﬁcant wage differential between the two countries (in 2014, formal sector
construction wages were US$800 per month in the Russian Federation and US$400 in Tajikistan).109 However,
in the absence of established alternative destinations, Tajikistan’s sole reliance on the Russian Federation for
migration exposes it to economic shocks.
Reintegration of return migrants presents a challenge. In addition, returning migrants face challenges
as they reintegrate into the domestic economy. There are only two functioning migration integration centers
in Tajikistan and they have limited capacity. As a result, few return migrants pass through these centers and
certiﬁcation and recertiﬁcation of skills occurs infrequently. Finally, it is also important to ensure that migrants
have access to social security and are able to access their beneﬁts in old age.


POLICY OPTIONS
Diversify migration destinations:
∫ Tajikistan could consider South Korea as an alternative potential destination for its migrants. For example,
  South Korea has established the General Employment Permit Program, in which Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz
  Republic already participate, and Tajikistan could consider applying to the program; and
∫ Tajikistan’s young and growing population can be a source of labor for a number of Eastern European
  countries, most of which have aging populations and have low population growth rates in need of low and
  unskilled labor.
Upgrade migrant skills and improve pre-departure services:
∫ Implement skills upgrading or offer complimentary courses to improve skills needed in receiving countries.
  Thereby, the demand for Tajik labor can be increased abroad; and
∫ Improve pre-departure services to provide information as well as “life skills” training to potential migrants.
  Programs around the world vary in length and scope, but should be shaped by the needs of the migrants and
  their awareness of the laws in the countries to which they are going.

Certify skills of returning migrants:
∫ Support skills assessment for returning workers so they can reintegrate and make maximum use of their
  new skills; and
∫ Provide institutional support to migration centers and Adult Education Centers so they can play a bigger
  role in this effort.
Strengthen advisory services for returning migrants:
∫ Expand and strengthen advisory services (business advice and ﬁnancial services) to assist returnee migrants
  so they can invest their capital wisely.
Improve social security options for labor migrants:
∫ Provide options of social security participation for workers overseas, especially where Tajikistan has not signed
  social security agreements.

ANNEX B. FINAL SAMPLE AND DATA
USED IN LABOR DEMAND ANALYSIS
Business Register
Final sample includes only private sector ﬁrms/commercial farms and SOEs. The sample excludes public insti-
tutions (which are not ﬁrms). The analysis primarily uses 2014 data when the number of private ﬁrms with
employment information is 21,888 and the number of SOEs is 869 including one particularly large outlier (Table
A2, Annex A). As expected, the latter are different in terms of employment levels and have many more employ-
ees (Table A2 and A3, Annex A). Most of the analysis is therefore performed separately on SOEs and private
ﬁrms. Domestic and foreign ﬁrms are included within private ﬁrms, although there are only 226 observations
for foreign ﬁrms.

Age Calculation in the Business Register
Data cleaning revealed the following pattern: even though the data technically covers ﬁrms registered up to
01/01/2015, around 400 ﬁrms registered between January and March of 2015. In previous years, more compa-
nies registered during this period than in other months, possibly reﬂecting delayed data/entry registration from
the previous year. As a result, if a ﬁrm is registered between January and March, the reported registration year
is changed to the previous year. For all other ﬁrms, the year of registration was kept as reported in the data.

Industrial Production—Cross Section
In 2014, there were 1,488 ﬁrms in the industrial dataset: 1,312 in manufacturing, 145 in mining and 31 in
utilities. Of these, the number of ﬁrms with available information on employment is very small for mining (120)
and utilities (14), so these sectors were left out of the analysis. In total, there are 919 ﬁrms with valid employ-
ment information in manufacturing. Of these 35 are classiﬁed as “manufacturing” according to ISIC version
3.1 but not according to ISIC version 4.110 The ﬁnal sample used is 884 ﬁrms classiﬁed as manufacturing based
on ISIC version 4.

Industrial Production—Panel Data
Panel data was used for productivity and employment growth regressions. There are 2,852 observations for the
private sector, distributed unevenly across the 3 years: 2012 has 816 observations, 2013 has 929 and 2014 has
1,107. There are 539 observations for state-owned enterprises: 191 in 2012, 168 in 2013, and 180 in 2014.
After calculating the growth indicators between the years and taking into account data availability by region,
size, sector and year of observation the ﬁnal sample for the panel is: private ﬁrms: 1,267 observations; SOEs:
171 observations.




 110
       The ISIC codes are: 2211, 2212 and 3710—in ISIC 3.1 corresponding to 5811, 5813, 3830 respectively in ISIC 4. Manufacturing is classi-
       ﬁed between 1000 and 3500 in ISIC 4.

                                                                                                                                                99

without restriction. Such an ideal country would receive a score of 100 on the investment freedom index.”
