RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations which the POE intends to be binding in terms of the Concession
Agreement are indicated as “[Binding]”. (See Section 1.1).
                                                                                                                      Page No.
The POE recommends that:
      1/24     The GOL and NTPC continue to survey resettler household incomes on
      at least an annual basis employing QSEM methodology and with another survey
      on full LSMS methodology in 2017. [Binding] ....................................................... 6
      2/24     Surveys be supplemented by a mix of quantitative and qualitative
      inquiry into income sources at household and village levels, particularly
      identifying factors such as location, ethnicity and generational status that may
      affect both sources and levels of income. [Binding] ................................................ 6
      3/24    The GOL and NTPC work with Village Development Committees to
      discuss and respond to the development gaps indicated by these surveys............. 6
      4/24     Early consideration be given to providing for an annual external audit of
      the allocation and use of SERF funds. .................................................................... 8
      5/24    Given the high rate of natural increase, the Nakai health service put
      more emphasis on family planning, and especially on raising annually the
      current contraceptive use rate............................................................................... 13
      6/24     Priority be given to resolving existing land conflicts identified by
      Lestrelin and the POE during its latest mission before further allocation of
      additional land with a view to resolving the more serious conflicts no later than
      the first quarter of 2016. [Binding] ....................................................................... 17
      7/24  NRO, RMU and District staff start working with and training Land
      Management Committees during the fourth quarter of 2015. [Binding] ............ 17
      8/24    The newly established District and Village Land Management
      Committees prohibit further inward migration except in special individual cases
      before RIP is ended, as required under the CA.................................................... 17
      9/24    NRO, RMU and District staff pay special attention to the situation in
      Phonpanpek and in other hamlets with recent but pre-resettlement immigrant
      households such as in Nam Nian, Nong Boua Kham and New Sop Hia which may
      be attracting new post resettlement, and hence unqualified, immigrant
      households. ............................................................................................................. 17
      10/24 Lestrelin’s additional proposals for strengthening LMCs as functional
      and legitimate local organizations and for setting up a monitoring and
      information-sharing institution on CLT area management be implemented
      without delay.......................................................................................................... 17
      11/24 NRO upgrade and intensify the institutional development and training of
      each hamlet’s VFG by the end of 2016 while GOL simultaneously provides the
      necessary policing and legal support for enforcing the fishing and trading rules...
              ................................................................................................................... 19




                                                                   vi
12/24 The GOL change boundaries and rules so as to allow the Thalang
peninsula resettler villagers reasonable and legal access for fishing in the area
downstream from the Thalang Bridge. [Binding] ................................................ 20
13/24 Until boundary changes occur, change rules so as to allow Thalang
peninsula resettlers to fish the waters between the downstream Nam Theun
channel on the East, the entrance to the Nam Malou waters, and the downstream
reservoir area adjacent to the Nam Malou land subsequently included within the
resettlement zone. [Binding] .................................................................................. 20
14/24 Biological/ecological studies of the reservoir be broadened to determine
which parts of the reservoir and which seasons need to be closed to fishing and
other foraging activities to protect areas and/or times that are biologically
important for reproduction of fish and maintenance of other natural resources. ..
        ................................................................................................................... 21
15/24 NRO extend the program of fish processing for women from three
villages to all hamlets which express an active interest in this program. [Binding]
         ................................................................................................................... 21
16/24 The GOL, at a high level, review the present state of the NT2 forestry
sector and restate the commitment of Ministers to a renewed effort by all
stakeholders to meet the requirements of the Concession Agreement in this vital
sector, to countering illegal activities such as unlawful logging on hamlet forest
lands and to renegotiating a more equitable basis for sharing NT2 forest
revenues between the GOL and the resettlers. ..................................................... 24
17/24 The necessary steps be taken by the Nakai District Governor, through a
participatory process, to reactivate Hamlet Forest Management Committees in
the 16 hamlets as envisaged in the Concession Agreement, their initial functions
being to take an active part in the forest inventory exercise in their forest areas,
set up systematic patrolling of the forests, help plan and implement silvicultural
programs and oversee the collection of NTFPs. [Binding] ................................... 25
18/24 In the second phase of the forestry rehabilitation program, beginning in
2018, there should be a gradual devolution of further roles as appropriate to the
HFMCs in such activities as planting, reforestation, logging, extraction,
processing and manufacturing. Employment generation for villagers will be a
key objective. ......................................................................................................... 25
19/24 The NTPC, with the GOL’s authority, initiate the forestry sector’s
rehabilitation by providing a suitably qualified and carefully selected manager
on its Nakai-based staff to help set up and begin training the HFMCs in each
hamlet in their initial tasks and to coordinate the work of the externally funded
technical assistance team whether working in the hamlets or with the VFDC.
[Binding] ................................................................................................................ 26
20/24 The GOL formally seek technical assistance for the first phase of the
rehabilitation from the IFIs as outlined, including short or longer term
specialists as appropriate in the areas of forest inventorizing, sawmill operation,
forest management planning, marketing and financial management. [Binding] 26
21/24 A forest inventory be formulated as soon as feasible, with technical
assistance and advice as specified provided by the IFIs (or NTPC, as agreed
between the parties) and again through a consultative process involving the

                                                             vii
villagers, for each hamlet’s forests and a consolidated version for the forest
estate as a whole. [Binding] ................................................................................... 26
22/24 A similar participatory process be followed in formulating an overall
Forest Management Plan with technical assistance from the forest management
planner, species and marketing specialist (who needs expertise in NTFPs and
their domestication as well as in timber species) and a community forest
management specialist. [Binding] ......................................................................... 26
23/24 The Provincial Governor and the Nakai District Governor consult with
the resettlers on whether the existing VFDC Board might usefully be converted
into a Plateau-wide Communal Forestry Management Board made up of HFMC
nominees, the VFDC manager and the recommended NTPC Forestry Manager,
to discuss matters of common interest, settle conflicts and make decisions on
matters of collective importance such as approving a consolidated Nakai
Forestry Plan and managing collective assets. Such a reconstituted Board, if
agreed upon, would also inherit the functions of the existing Board. A new
Decree would presumably be required to authorize the setting up of the new
Board. ................................................................................................................... 27
24/24 GOL Ministers review the inappropriately high level of taxes, fees and
levies imposed on the village forestry program and impose a lesser and fairer
burden on the resettlers by either setting a cap on total taxes, levies and fees,
establishing a limited tax exemption, or agreeing on tax relief or a lower tax rate.
         ................................................................................................................... 29
25/24 NRO and DAFO concentrate on achieving their target of 65% of
irrigable land having systems in place and operating for the 2016/2017 dry
season, while aiming for the CA target of having all households with access to
irrigated land by the end of 2017. [Binding] ......................................................... 33
26/24 The Irrigation Task Force ensure the presence of functional water user
associations for each operational irrigation system. [Binding] ............................ 33
27/24 During the 2015-16 dry season and following the harvest, two monitoring
studies be completed in each hamlet on functioning irrigation systems, water
user associations, crops grown and yields. [Binding] ........................................... 33
28/24 RMU staffing and budget play a major role in ensuring, with DAFO and
the NRO, that these irrigation objectives are achieved. [Binding] ...................... 33
29/24 GOL reach a decision no later than the end of 2015 on whether the old
Army base land downstream from Thalang could be used for agricultural
purposes by natural growth households in Thalang and Sop Phene. [Binding] . 34
30/24 Proposals to solve the arable land issue pay special attention to
encouraging and training natural growth households to become leaders in the
agricultural sector inter alia by using unutilized but repairable NRO irrigation
systems. [Binding] .................................................................................................. 34
31/24 At least one such system per hamlet be operating by carefully selected
natural growth households for use during the 2015-2016 dry season. [Binding] 34
32/24 In the meantime, natural growth households be surveyed to identify,
recruit and begin training appropriate irrigation candidates no later than the
fourth quarter of 2015. .......................................................................................... 34

                                                             viii
33/24 Candidates for irrigation training be both women and men since the
former are apt to be the principal farmers on smaller irrigated plots. [Binding]34
34/24 The provincial officials involved in promoting cassava cultivation, DAFO
in Nakai District, and NTPC meet before early in the fourth quarter of 2015 not
just to establish a general cassava policy but also, with the resettler growers, to
agree upon an environmentally and economically acceptable system of
cultivation. [Binding] ............................................................................................. 35
35/24 NRO and DAFO investigate the extent to which women who are active in
agricultural activities in each hamlet would be interested in a program breeding
pigs, as one example, as a cash crop for meeting the rising demand for pork in
Laos and in China especially. ................................................................................ 36
36/24 NRO and DAFO utilize one of the three agricultural research stations
for small stock breeding and extension purposes for women. [Binding] ............. 36
37/24 As part of the CA required Livestock Improvement Program (CA 9.7), a
coordinated program of training in achieving enhanced soil fertility and plant
nutrition and well supported field work and husbandry improvements be
undertaken as part of a sustained effort to lift large animal production to a
higher income-earning level over the years ahead. [Binding] .............................. 39
38/24 NRO help bring together the various players – local and international
NGOs, Tourism Ministry, the ADB specialists, District authorities, VDCs and
the private sector – and work more proactively with the ADB and others to
explore local interest in tourism development, encourage preparation of a
tourism development plan and set up village-level training programs in concert
with the ADB. Proposals for tourism training and ventures in the resettlement
villages may well emerge from the “bottom up” development approach now
being fostered by NTPC. [Binding] ....................................................................... 41
39/24 Resettler control of islands within their hamlet boundaries including use
for tourism ventures be clarified by an Order from the Prime Minister’s Office. .
        ................................................................................................................... 41
40/24 As emphasized by IFI comments on this report, “off-farm training
should be closely linked to the village development planning process, taking into
account the local and national labor market opportunities and capacities of
resettlers.” .............................................................................................................. 43
41/24 NTPC not only continues to sponsor and fund vocational training under
the Off-Farm Pillar, but that additional training be based on a further analysis
of needs and opportunities at the village level and on the relationship between
past training, income generation and skills use with special emphasis on
upskilling female and male resettler youth. [Binding] ......................................... 43
42/24 Such training include a substantial program of less formal training,
being designed specifically to meet real and immediate needs for upskilling
among the resettlers, relevant to and reflecting the opportunities available to
them, conducted wherever feasible in the villages themselves and including small
loans or grants where required to enable the villagers to equip themselves
initially to set up business (treadle sewing machines, weaving looms, sets of
motorcycle/outboard motor/vehicle repair tools, lifejackets for boats etc.). ....... 43


                                                             ix
43/24 NTPC accept that a more dynamic approach to off-farm activity training
in general is called for in the year or two immediately ahead and to this end set
themselves an ambitious target of recruiting for training during the remainder of
2015 to be increased proportionately during 2016 and again during 2017.
[Binding] ................................................................................................................ 43
44/24 The Resettlement Implementation Period be extended for two years to
December 2017 and, as the CA requires, activities performed in the intervening
period be reviewed and reassessed by the POE before the expiry of that period to
determine whether the Resettlement Objectives and Resettlement Provisions
have been achieved in accordance with the Concession Agreement. [Binding] .. 46
45/24 In accordance with the analysis and recommendation in this report
relating to the CA Objectives and Provisions, the further reviews proposed in
2017 include a QSEM/LSMS survey reporting by May 2017, an IMA compliance

       INTRODUCTION
1.1   The POE mission and its purpose
        This is the Twenty-Fourth Report of the International Panel of Environmental and
Social Experts for the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Multipurpose Project in Lao PDR (POE). The
Panel is a Standing Body for the period covered by the Concession Agreement for the
Project. The report covers the POE’s visit to Lao PDR in April/May 2015. The members of
the Panel are D. K. McDowell (consultant, Otaki, New Zealand), T. Scudder (Professor
Emeritus, California Institute of Technology, USA) and L. M. Talbot, (Professor, George
Mason University, Virginia, USA). While Dr. Scudder was unable to participate in person in
the mission to Laos on this occasion, he was fully informed of the findings of the field team
and was actively involved in the writing of this report. The team was joined for the mission
by R. G. Laking (consultant, Wellington, New Zealand) in an advisory capacity.
        This mission was not the usual monitoring and advisory exercise. It had a special
purpose. This was to meet the legal requirement in the Concession Agreement1 (CA) that at
least six months before the expiry of the intended Resettlement Implementation Period (RIP)
the POE review activities performed during the RIP, analyze whether the Resettlement
Objectives and Provisions spelled out in the CA have been achieved in accordance with the
CA, and make a recommendation to the GOL accordingly on whether the RIP should be
ended in December 2015 or extended for a designated period.
       Should an extension be recommended, then the GOL may require that POE
recommendations designed to achieve the Objectives and Provisions be implemented at the
Company’s cost. (See CA Sched.4, Part 1, para.2.4 (b), reproduced in Annex II appended.)
The CA (para. 30.7(a)(iii)) makes it clear that this requirement is not a Limited by Cost
Environmental and Social Objective.
        It should be noted that the CA gives the POE both an implicit and an explicit role in
interpreting the Resettlement Objectives of the CA (viz. Section 30.4(b) (i) of the CA).
       The Objectives are extensive, ranging from a requirement on all parties to provide for
the construction of designated infrastructure across the Resettlement Area, to ensuring that
the Resettlers have their income earning capacity enhanced and their livelihoods “materially
improved…on a sustainable basis”, and to the application of special measures towards ethnic
minorities and vulnerable persons - inter alia to improve their socio-economic status. Special
consideration is also to be given to gender and natural growth households.
        The Resettlement Provisions are similarly extensive, spelling out, for example, who is
eligible for Resettler entitlements, the Company’s responsibility for providing prompt and
adequate compensation for lost assets or livelihoods, and the responsibility of all parties to
protect the social and cultural cohesion of villages. Relevant excerpts from the CA are set out
in Annex II attached.
       The CA sets a Village Income Target (VIT) for the resettler villages, to be reached by
the end of the RIP. As well as reporting on all the other CA requirements discussed below,
the POE is mandated specifically to consider whether it is necessary to extend the RIP to
achieve the VIT. We discuss the VIT in Section 2.1. It should be noted that a decision on
extension rests with the GOL, but this is subject to the qualification set out below. The POE



        1
          Made between the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) (“Government” in the Agreement) and the Nam
Theun 2 Power Company Ltd (NTPC) (“Company” in the Agreement).
                                                     1
makes a recommendation to the Resettlement Committee on extension (or otherwise) and the
decision is then the responsibility of the Government. The written concurrences of the IFIs
(International Financial Institutions: World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB))
are required, however, for a GOL decision against extension to be made.
1.2   Panel activities
        To be in a position to make well-informed decisions on the range of issues before it,
the POE spent time in both Vientiane and the field, devoting the best part of four productive
days in the resettlement villages discussing plans, problems, and prospects with the Village
Development Committees, Village Fisheries Groups and resettlers in the streets and fields.
We visited twelve of the sixteen hamlets for this ground-truthing exercise and held extensive
talks also with NTPC staff, with the District authorities and agencies which will in due course
take over management of the various livelihood and community development activities, and
with both Company and District technical people. We held helpful discussions with Nakai
District Governor Somphong Phayvanhthong and the Khammouane Provincial Governor
Khambay Damlath, and briefed Minister of Mines and Energy Soulivong Daravong and
Deputy Prime Ministers Asang Laoly and Somsavat Lengsavad on our conclusions and
recommendations. We are most grateful to them all for their advice and views, freely shared.
We also spent two days with a highly representative group of project stakeholders
exchanging views on the planning document on the way forward entitled the Road Map. This
promising initiative on the part of NTPC management grew out of a List of Measures initially
drafted by the POE in a largely successful endeavor to help create a consensus among the
stakeholders on the way forward.
        Since returning from Lao PDR, we have reviewed and analysed several major reports
and documents which we received while on mission and which have materially assisted us in
reaching our conclusions. We have also had further exchanges with the GOL, NTPC and the
IFIs on our findings and on draft reports circulated in July and September. All these
documents and exchanges have helped us complete our final report.
1.3   Extension of the Resettlement Implementation Period
        The POE has over the years acknowledged the efforts made by the stakeholders to
achieve the objectives and provisions for the project set out in the Concession Agreement.
The latter is itself an innovatory document which details for the first time a program of
compensation and development for the people downstream of a large dam as well as covering
the needs of the resettlers, initiates a health program for all project affected people which has
proved highly effective, creates a valuable precedent in setting aside long-term funding for a
protected area - the NT2 catchment - as an offset for the loss of land and biodiversity to
inundation and resettlement requirements, and establishes an ongoing contribution to the
costs of maintaining the impressive project infrastructure well into the future. This is all
worthy of renewed recognition and appreciation here.
        At the same time it has to be said that management of many of the developmental and
human elements of the project has been less assured. The reasoning behind this conclusion is
set out in detail below. In essence the reality is that fostering the development process in a
context like that found on the Nakai plateau is a time-consuming and demanding task which
cannot be achieved within a restricted timeframe. The POE’s finding is that a substantial
proportion of the Resettlement Objectives and Provisions has not been fully achieved as
yet and hence the Panel recommends a two year extension of the RIP to the end of 2017.



                                                   2
1.4   New management initiatives by NTPC
        The POE argues in the body of the report below that fostering development in an area
like the Nakai Plateau is difficult, relatively costly and above all requires time. To do this in
partnership with a wide range of ethnic minorities, some of whom are not far removed from
hunter/gatherer and swidden cultivation cultures, compounds the problem. To their credit, the
new management in NTPC has recognized this and accepts at least implicitly that there
remains much to be done before sustainability of the livelihoods can be adjudged a reality.
Indeed, they have started putting together a Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP) to
address what remains to be done and are to engage with other stakeholders in widening its
scope and trying to define the outcomes sought in the medium and long term, not least
enhanced sustainability. That is a significant step forward.
        In the view of the POE the MTDP process offers a convenient, timely and inclusive
opportunity to address the inadequacies remaining, notably in livelihood development. The
two year plus period to the end of 2017 is a timeframe which will enable much to be
accomplished in terms of achieving the remaining Resettlement Objectives and Provisions so
long as the process is well managed, well-resourced by the GOL, the NTPC and the IFIs and
is pursued with vigor. The POE is firmly of the view that the early engagement of the GOL
and its agencies at the District level and representation of the IFIs and the Village
Development Committees (VDCs) in a substantive way in the process are important next
steps in generating buy-in for the MTDP process and its planned outcomes.
         Furthermore, the NTPC shareholders have now offered to substantially expand the
resources made available to the project, extending to the end of the Concession Period in
2035. The object is to boost further the development of the resettled villages and at the same
time to promote villager initiatives and encourage autonomy. Managed effectively and
sensitively this initiative will accelerate the steps toward sustainability. The POE welcomes
this as a most worthwhile step forward and applauds the shareholders for making this far-
sighted move.
1.5   Status of recommendations in this report
        Because of the special role that this report plays, and the potential binding nature of
the POE’s advice relating to the Objectives and Provisions, we have made it as clear as
possible when we intend our comments and recommendations to have this force. In
particular, we have highlighted those recommendations which, subject to the consideration of
the GoL and IFIs, would be binding on the Company. Each of them has “Binding” in
brackets at the end. Furthermore, Annex I of the Report summarises our analysis and advice
on RIP closure for each major topic in the Report: it indicates where we see gaps, what we
think are necessary outcomes to demonstrate compliance, and what binding recommendations
we have made towards achieving those outcomes.
        There are other recommendations which we regard as sound advice, but are not
specifically directed at achievement of conditions for closure of RIP. They are nevertheless
important and the POE will be actively monitoring and reporting on their implementation.

        CA TARGETS REACHED
2.1   Income Targets in the CA
2.1.1 Fulfilment of the CA provisions
        The CA sets two income targets to be achieved during the RIP:
             Household Income Targets are a minimum income level, related to the Lao
              national poverty line, to be achieved by every resettler household (CA Schedule 4
              Part 1 Clause 1.2 and Clause 3.1(b)); this is one of the Objectives that must be met
              as a condition of RIP closure;
             Village Income Targets (VIT) are equivalent, for each of the 16 Resettler
              Hamlets, to an average income per person in the village equal to the average rural
              income per person in Lao PDR; this is also a condition for RIP closure.
        In January 2014, as recorded in POE Report 22, the Resettlement Committee declared
that the Resettlement Household Income Target had been achieved "in accordance with the
Concession Agreement" (POE 2014a). This decision was based on the report on the Nakai
Socio-Economic Survey Round 7 survey of March 20132. That survey found that “not only
have 97% of the resettler households achieved the Household Income Target (above the
poverty line), but in fact their average consumption levels are nearly 3 times higher than the
poverty line.” (Fredericks 2013). In our report we did not question this decision but recorded
our reservations about the survey information on which it is based. Our principal concern was
that information on sources of income reported by households is both limited and unreliable.
        We are mandated to rule specifically on achievement of the Village Income Targets,
as a condition for closure of the RIP (Schedule 4 Part One Clause 1.2 and Clause 3.4(a)). A
special household survey on the more limited methodology of the Nakai Quarterly Socio-
Economic Survey (QSEM), conducted in December 2014-January 2015 specifically to
determine achievement of the VIT (Bouapao 2015c), concluded that all Resettler Villages
and their constituent Hamlets had achieved the Targets. Again, we do not question this result
but our concerns are similar: that we don’t know enough about income sources and
livelihoods to be confident that the estimated income levels are sustainable.
         Most of these concerns derive from our analysis of the livelihood pillars discussed
later on in this report and of the capacity of the Company, the Government and the Resettlers
themselves to provide the necessary support for these livelihoods. These issues are discussed
in later sections of the report. What follows here is a more detailed discussion of the Village
Income Targets results themselves.
2.1.2 Observations on the survey results
       First, the survey is not directly of reported incomes. It used consumption as reported
by householders as a proxy for income. This is common practice in developing rural
economies because of the evidence that income is usually significantly underreported. As a
proxy measure it is valid if change in household net worth (net debt and real and financial
savings) is zero or positive over the measurement period. Based on the reported results for
debt and savings in LSMS7, QSEM93 and the VIT surveys, this seems a reasonable first

         A household survey conducted according to the methodology of the World Bank’s Living Standards
Measurement Study (LSMS).
        3
            Conducted in third quarter 2014. (NTPC 2014)
                                                           4
approximation. There is some increase in net household debt reported in QSEM104, but
probably not enough to affect this overall conclusion.
       Second, as the Chart shows, while all villages and hamlets exceeded the targets with
reasonable error margins, some achieved much better results than others. The four poorest
hamlets, Nong Boua, Phonesavang, Boua Ma and Sop On have about half the per capita
income of the four richest, Naka Tai, Sop Phene, Nong Boua Kham and Thalang. Rankings
have changed considerably over time for some hamlets, also.




        There are two implications from this disparity in performance. One is that further
analysis of the sources of variance in incomes within and between hamlets is important, for
better targeting of support for livelihoods. Size and location appear important as does
ethnicity. A re-analysis of results into those for original resettler and natural growth
households also added some useful information about how well the children of the resettlers
are faring. But the drivers of economic performance need further study. The Nakai
Resettlement Office (NRO) reports that it is giving special attention to individual poor and
lagging households; both Company and GOL also need to focus on performance at a hamlet
level and work with VDCs on measures for capacity building and strengthening.
        Second, we need to know more about incomes. Sustainability of incomes depends on
each household having a menu or portfolio of income-generating activities that do not depend
on depletion of natural assets and is reasonably robust overall to fluctuations in any of its
component activities. We know that some sources of household income are illegal: mainly
from illegally acquired hardwood timber or fish. A study in six hamlets, which was based on
group workshops in April 2015 (Bouapao 2015a), told us something about the relative
importance of different sources of income, including some idea of the importance of poached
rosewood in the income of some hamlets. But a more comprehensive survey would have
helped understand why there is such a large variance between hamlets and to form a


       4
           Conducted in first quarter 2015. (NTPC 2015b).
                                                            5
judgment as to whether these incomes are sustainable. The cash expenditure information in
the QSEM series indicates that consumption was relatively stable over 2012-14 but there was
a drop in this statistic in QSEM10 and some increase in household debt. This outcome does
not invalidate the VIT results but the volatility in the various measures is enough to suggest
that neither consumption nor income have settled down enough to be reasonably predictable
from year to year.
2.1.3 Continuation of social and economic monitoring essential
        A consequence of this volatility is that regular social and economic monitoring is an
important component of assessing progress towards sustainable livelihoods. The List of
Measures (LOM) proposed that NTPC step up its capacity to analyse the drivers of poverty
and vulnerability based on its monitoring. We recognize that poverty can arise from the
complex interaction of many factors, which complicates statistical modelling, but continued
efforts to understand these drivers are vital. A program of investigation by qualified social
scientists should be part of the monitoring program.
        The POE considers that NTPC needs to continue its monitoring with an emphasis not
only on consumption and other indicators of well-being but also on sources of income.
Further efforts should be made to improve the quality of estimates of income sources, which
are important for assessing sustainability. Monitoring reports should be complemented by
investigation of the main drivers of consumption and income and the effects of personal,
social and institutional factors.
2.1.4 Conclusion
        The POE accepts that, on the available evidence, the Village Income Targets
were met at the time of the survey, albeit with a wide variance in performance between
the hamlets. Because of the paucity of information on how these incomes have been derived,
there is however very little evidence on whether these Targets can be sustained in the future
and will be robust to changing circumstances on the plateau, Further monitoring and analysis
in each of the main livelihood pillars is required to make a judgment on these factors. We
discuss these issues in a following section.
         The POE recommends that:
      1/24       The GOL and NTPC continue to survey resettler household incomes on at
         least an annual basis employing QSEM methodology and with another survey on
         full LSMS methodology in 2017. [Binding]
      2/24       Surveys be supplemented by a mix of quantitative and qualitative inquiry
         into income sources at household and village levels, particularly identifying
         factors such as location, ethnicity and generational status that may affect both
         sources and levels of income. [Binding]
      3/24      The GOL and NTPC work with Village Development Committees to
         discuss and respond to the development gaps indicated by these surveys.
        In the light of their involvement in earlier surveys the POE suggests that the
assistance of David Fredericks, Nina Fenton and Lilao Bouapao be sought by the NRO
Monitoring Unit in designing and interpreting the appropriate surveys.
2.2     Project Infrastructure
       It is not the POE’s intention to make any further assessment in this report of the
attainment of the multitudinous infrastructure requirements set out in the CA. The Panel has
made clear several times that the infrastructure work has been largely completed and to a
                                                  6
generally acceptable level of competence. Historically the POE has queried in some of its
earlier reports the roading work done by project sub-contractors and has drawn attention to
the often excessive width of tree clearance for roads indulged in by these companies to the
detriment of the environment and the topography in general. The Panel has also had to draw
deficiencies in the water supply and irrigation systems to the NTPC’s attention on several
occasions. There are remaining inadequacies on these fronts but the Company is aware of
them and is working on them. But the standard of work on resettlement housing and most
other buildings, for example, has been generally high and is appreciated by the Resettlers.




                    Dam on the Nam Theun, western end of the reservoir
                                 (©NTPC/Stanislas Fradelizi)
        It appears from the recent report of the Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA) that
some of the community buildings and amenities built were short on specified requirements.
Thus, some primary schools were found to have been built at around 80% only of a specified
floor area and health centres at three quarters of the area specifications. NTPC has said in
response that the Company was required by the GOL to follow the standard GOL
requirements for such buildings and did so. The GOL has confirmed to the POE that the
standards are uniform across the whole country. It would seem accordingly that the NTPC
had no alternative but to adhere to the Government’s wishes in this instance and cannot
therefore be held responsible for the apparent failure to meet the CA specifications.
2.3   Use of SERF
         In the POE’s view, if any remedial action arising from the failure to meet certain
infrastructure specifications is required, the costs should not be met from the Social and
Environmental Remediation Fund (SERF). This highly innovative and precedent-setting
initiative by the NTPC is essential for ongoing maintenance and some operational purposes.
        The POE has learned that the SERF management has not agreed (quite correctly in
our view) to take responsibility for irrigation systems not functioning because of poor system
specification, design or construction, which costs are the responsibility of NTPC. The POE
has consistently interpreted the Terms of Reference of this useful Fund, whose full title is the

finance for maintenance of the NT2 assets and for some operational costs. It should in our
view be largely reserved for these purposes and not drained off to fund projects unrelated to
them. Pressure on SERF to become a source for any work not otherwise funded will mount,
including from the resettlers’ own institutions like the VDCs.
        The POE will continue to check that SERF funds are not diverted for remedial capital
and infrastructural works meant to have been funded from other sources. It seems prudent
also to consider a regular annual audit of the allocation and use of SERF funds.
         The POE recommends that:
      4/24       Early consideration be given to providing for an annual external audit of
         the allocation and use of SERF funds.
2.4     Schedule 35 Interpretation
        The POE notes that some NT2 documents infer that in the Schedule 35 assessment
exercise undertaken in 2010 the POE “certificated” (which has been interpreted by some as
“completed”) a high proportion of CA obligations. This is not accurate. The DEB in fact
requested the NTPC at the time to remove the “substantial ambiguities” in the Certificate of
Completion by stating clearly that the POE has expressed reservations of one sort or another
about fifteen major items and many minor items in the “obligations completed” list and
required that these items be moved to the “partially completed” list. To their credit NTPC
immediately agreed and its Board Chairman added that the Company was “keenly aware that
the Concession Agreement schedule 35 objectives represent a contractual milestone but in no
way imply that the Resettlement Objectives have been met”. Five years on there remain
serious questions about many of the issues raised by the POE in 2010.

        SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES AND ISSUES
3.1    What is sustainability?
        Sustainable livelihoods are a basic objective of the CA, but it contains no adequate
definition of sustainability or how it may be measured. We therefore have to look for its
commonly accepted meaning. There is extensive discussion of the concept in general terms in
development literature which enables the identification of a common core of relevant
principles. In addition, one former World Bank NT2 expert, one POE consultant and one
POE member have attempted, independently and in broadly similar ways, to define
sustainability in ways that have applicability to the large dam Resettlement Implementation
Process.
       The most widely known and one of the earlier formulations is that of the Brundtland
(UN) Commission on Environment and Development, which defines sustainable
development as the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By the early 2000s a
common high-level definition was that: "A sustainable livelihood is commonly accepted as
comprising: …the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) for a
means of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses
and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future,
while not undermining the natural resource base.”5 The development literature also
commonly assumes that sustainability focusses on the requirements of poor people and
incorporates some notion of equity of access between this and future generations.
        The POE consultant was the late Robert Goodland who was the World Bank’s leading
ecologist and environment expert for 23 years. According to Goodland and the equally
eminent Bank economist Herman Daly: “The four types of sustainability – human, social,
environmental and economic – are clearest when kept separate. While there is overlap among
the four in the goals of economic development, and certainly major linkages, the four are best
disaggregated and addressed separately by different disciplines.” As for sustainable
development, it is assumed by Goodland and Daly to be “development without throughput
growth beyond environmental carrying capacity and which is socially sustainable.”6
        The consultant is Peter Rogers, Harvard’s Professor of Environmental Engineering.
He has been a POE water resources consultant on NT2 and is the senior author of Harvard’s
2006 book, An Introduction to Sustainable Development. Rogers and his two co-authors
wrote, granted the state of the world today, that “…we just cannot keep on expanding and
using resources, because something will be exhausted in the end. But in the short run, we can
rely on human ingenuity to get us through the next 30 to 50 years. After that all bets are off.
Our definition, therefore, of sustainability is time-bound to a couple of human generations.
Along with the journal Science7, we believe this is the most scientifically supportable
position to take.” Also (from a study of attempts to operationalize sustainability in

agricultural systems): “The majority of methodologies for sustainability assessment of
agroecosystems do not go beyond a couple of decades."8
       The POE member is Thayer Scudder whose definition of a successful (hence
sustainable) resettlement process involves a four stage process “that brings the resettlement
process to a successful end as project areas and populations are integrated into the political
economy of a region or nation. Three conditions must be met … The first is a handing over
process whereby specialized project agencies hand over assets to resettler institutions and to
line ministries.
       The next two conditions relate directly to the second generation of resettlers. On the
one hand, their living standards must continue to improve at least in line with improvements
in neighbouring areas. On the other hand, community members must have the institutional
and political strength to compete for their fair share of national resources.”9
        In effect, this is again a time bound definition of sustainability dealing with two
generations only. Pragmatically also two generations is probably a realistic “event horizon”.
It avoids the philosophical problem of a more general concept of “care for future
generations” since it focuses on what the first generation of resettlers is likely to want for
those children born after physical removal; that is the second generation.
3.2    Summary
        In summary, longevity, intergenerational justice, resilience and development without
growth beyond environmental carrying capacity are key elements of most definitions. But
there is no “one fits all” formula so the common practice in seeking sustainable
development is to work towards a coherent aggregation of practical measures
incorporating targets, indicators and timelines relevant to particular sectors and
circumstances. That is the course being pursued by the POE in the case of the NT2
project. It is the pragmatic way forward.
        In addition to meeting the four key but broadly stated elements above, sustainability
measures specific to NT2 after RIP closure include the availability of NTPC and GOL funds
as appropriate to cover major resettlement deficiencies, new problems and unexpected events
through to the end of the Concession Period, ongoing or new livelihood programs such as
reservoir stocking with appropriate indigenous species, the establishment of a multi-hamlet
marketing system and product processing facilities, the building up of capacity building
programmes at hamlet, village and District levels and the strengthening of institutions at all
three levels. Measures such as these should be included in the Company’s Medium Term
Development Plan, which we welcome, and discuss further later in this report.
3.3    When will sustainability be achieved?
        Livelihoods are sustainable not when decisions are made to do certain things but
when it appears – ultimately as a matter of judgement after allowing for all the attendant risks
and uncertainties of looking into the future – that they meet the conditions of productive
value, non-depletion, intergenerational equity, resilience and longevity.

         Sustainability of livelihoods on the Plateau will be achieved when the natural
resources of the plateau are being replenished and its built assets are maintained to support
the living standards of the people who draw upon them and the law and governance
institutions enable them to protect their property rights and resolve disputes. This requires
evidence that natural resources such as soil, forests and fish, are not being depleted by human
activity; that the built assets necessary for livelihoods are being properly maintained; that the
formal and customary institutions are protecting the commons and giving fair access to them;
and that estimates of future population growth do not indicate a growing unmanaged risk in
the immediate future.
        Sustainability is also to be found when District, village and hamlet organizations are
protecting the personal and community property of villagers, enabling them to decide
collectively on village development priorities, providing them with the knowledge and help
they need to develop their own livelihood activities, and helping them resolve their disputes.
        So we would look for evidence that villagers are not suffering significant losses to
personal and community property, that they participate in village decision-making and
believe that the choices made are the best ones for themselves and their village, that they
value the learning they get from technical assistance and apply it in practice, and that they
believe that their disputes are being fairly resolved. We would expect every village household
to have a portfolio of income-generating activities that do not depend on depletion of natural
assets and is reasonably robust overall to fluctuations in any of its component activities. And
we would seek evidence that household incomes do not depend on illegal or resource-
depleting activities or are exposed to significant and unmanageable risks of production or
marketing.
3.4   GOL and NTPC views
        We should comment here specifically on views expressed by the GOL and NTPC on
the definition of “sustainability”.
       In the context of the CA, the GoL and NTPC have argued that it can be defined as the
achievement of the Household and Village Income Targets, provided there is an additional
agreement, made outside the CA, for the company to continue funding development projects
and institutions.
        We note that the GoL have since said that they are still in discussion with NTPC on
the definition. It seems quite clear to us, however, that, on any reasonable definition of
sustainability current at the time the CA was being drafted, it cannot be limited to
achievement of target incomes at a specific point in time. The definition should incorporate
the additional qualities of generation of productive value, non-depletion of natural resources,
equity between at least the first two generations, and resilience to likely stresses and shocks
over some reasonable period of time in the future.
       As to the side agreement between the GOL and NTPC on continued funding: the
company’s proposals are a welcome additional support for development, but the POE would
make the following comments:
          We cannot see that a side agreement to the CA, made without explicitly amending
           the CA, can legally constitute a fulfilment of the terms of the CA;
          As the minute of agreement acknowledges, the parties are also taking comfort for
           their view of sustainability from a number of possible commitments – by GOL,
           NTPC and the IFIs – which are so far by no means concrete and confirmed.


                                                   11
        In addition, responding to our draft, NTPC have criticized what they believe to be our
view on sustainability and have made some related comments on participatory development.
We believe that these comments are largely based on a misconception of our argument.
Nevertheless the comments raise some important questions about both issues and deserve a
direct response, which we have set out in Annex III of this report.

         POPULATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
4.1     Population pressures on land
        Pressures on land on the plateau will most likely increase in the next 5-10 years as the
population continues to rise. The main issues have always been how to make better use of a
diminished amount of land for agriculture and livestock as well as finding living space for a
rapidly growing population. The NTPC census of all households on the Plateau (NTPC
2015c) shows a 66% growth in total population from 2003-2014, an annualized rate of 4.7%
p.a. which, as the POE has pointed out in earlier reports, is well above the national average.
Most of this is due to natural increase although some is the result of new people, some of
them related to the resettlers, moving into the District. There is no sign of significant outward
migration – quite the opposite. As proposed in earlier reports, the POE is of the view that
further efforts aimed at family planning are called for.
         The POE recommends that:
      5/24      Given the high rate of natural increase, the Nakai health service put more
         emphasis on family planning, and especially on raising annually the current
         contraceptive use rate.
        The population growth has resulted in an increase in the housing stock. From 2008,
when NTPC’s rehousing program was completed, new dwellings (all non-NTPC) grew by
388, or more than a third. Of these, 328 were occupied by natural growth households - CA
3.2 (a)(i). The age pyramid of the current population suggests that the natural rate of increase
will slow somewhat in the next decade but without allowing for migration may contribute a
further third or more to total population. Many of these young men and women will also be
seeking to form new households in the coming 5-10 years.
        People will respond to these pressures in different ways. They will build more new
houses on whatever land is made available to them. More of them may be able to support
themselves by more intensive and productive use of the available land. Ultimately, some may
simply leave the plateau in search of better opportunities elsewhere. At some future stage, the
children of Nakai, as in many other rural communities, may simply leave and likely move by
stages down towards the Mekong, where they hope to find other employment and send
money back home to support their relations. The probability, however, is that a majority of
the ethnic minorities in up to seven hamlets on the Nakai Plateau will not be able to find
sustainable employment off the Plateau.
4.2     Adequacy of arable land
        The growth in population and emerging conflicts over arable land (discussed further
below) raise the fundamental question of whether there is enough land available for all
resettlers on the Plateau.
        Prior to their resettlement, resettler households in the 16 hamlets were supported by
diversified production systems based on agriculture, livestock management, fishing and
various aquatic products, and collection of non-timber forest products of which some were
the major source of income for women as were buffalo for men (though primarily sold in
emergency situations). The importance of the various components tended not only to vary
seasonally but also from year to year depending on climatic conditions, labor resources, and
discussion among household and village members.
       Such a diversified household and hamlet production system is just as important to
ensure sustainability now and in the future. That fact (a fact based on the analysis of other
production systems in the mountainous areas of Southeast Asia) has tended to have been
                                                   13
neglected as more emphasis has been placed on specific pillars as opposed to the linkages
between them that vary through time as well as various cross-cutting issues such as ethnicity,
gender, hamlet institutional capacities, and the differing needs and value systems.
        In a diversified production system, the land must be adequately fenced as required by
the CA to keep out domesticated animals, women would benefit from tending small livestock
(pigs being the logical animal as women were responsible for them pre-settlement), there
would be crop sales from irrigated agriculture, and so on. A minimum of 0.16 ha would need
to be irrigated per household with sufficient water, natural growth and natural growth
households would be targeted for participating in irrigated agriculture and other
agricultural/horticultural activities, more gully dams per hamlet would be built, drawdown
areas and islands utilized, and productivity gradually intensified and increased on an annual
basis.
         The distribution and adequacy of land varies between households and between
hamlets. At meetings in Sop On and in Khon Kaen, the POE was told that land availability,
though of poor quality, was sufficient. On the other hand, there are land disputes between
Phonsavang and Bouama, between Phonpanpek and Nong Boua and between Sop Hia and
Nong Boua Kham. The Sop Hia/Nong Boua Kham and Phonpanpek/Nong Boua situations
are especially serious and point up the extent to which hamlets vary in size, histories,
resources and influence. Phonpanpek,. for example, was a BPKP resettled village in the
1990s on the outskirts of Oudomsouk; hence with the advantage of not only being the closest
hamlet to the district headquarters, market, hospital, and first secondary school but also the
first to be resettled.
4.3   Findings
       The POE’s view has consistently been that there is sufficient land and other resources
available to attain an acceptable level of livelihood sustainability for the NT2 resettlers
provided agriculture and livestock management are intensified as the CA requires and as the
Social Development Plan specifies.
        The POE remains of this view. Current available agricultural land per household is
0.88 ha (most natural growth households do not yet have this area allocated to them – see
comments below on this situation). There are 3,641 ha of “additional land” available of
which only 241 ha have thus far been allocated (NTPC, 22 April 2015 briefing). Were much
of this land distributed, it would be possible in theory to allocate around an additional
1.5 hectares in total to each of the 1,155 original resettler households and a similar area
to the 441 natural growth ones. While such distribution goes well beyond CA specifications
and cannot be regarded as a requirement, the POE’s view is that, given the generally poor
soils, often steep slopes and distance from accessible water sources of the available land, an
allocation of extra land per household on more generous lines is required and would be more
than adequate to sustain households if incorporated and fully used within a diversified
production system. It would also leave some land for the next generation, thus helping meet
the longer term sustainability objective.
       This further distribution, to be a fair one, would have to take account of the great
degree of variation in soils, slopes, access to water and proximity to hamlets.
       There are some surrounding conditions. The allocation of land for agriculture
requires, as the IFIs have emphasized in comments to the POE, “that appropriate and
functioning institutions are in place to address land conflict and land allocation issues during
the RIP and after RIP closure,” as well as official discouragement of the illegal and excessive
inward migration and effective law enforcement to protect village forests and fisheries.

                                                  14
Finally, our constant proviso is that achievement of this new production mix still carries
substantial risks, requires ongoing support in the form of technical assistance and institutions,
ongoing monitoring and adaptive management, and firm commitments from the other
development partners.
       If these conditions are met, then the POE considers that the sustainability objective
can be achieved. This prospect has been enhanced by the positive decisions on additional
resources through to the end of the Concession Period made over the past year by NTPC
management and shareholders.
4.4       Governing and managing the land
       Arising from the growing pressure on land there are some immediate issues,
addressed elsewhere in the report, relating to land use and property rights:
          The pressure to find space for new families: both for their houses and for their
           livelihood activities;
          The growing competition for land as its use intensifies, both among the resettlers and
           with outsiders;
          The need for equitable allocation, or reallocation, of land for individual and
           community use;
          The definition and protection of existing property rights and the settlement of land-
           related disputes.
4.5       Defining and protecting property rights
        The growing pressure on land is leading not only to shortages of housing land and
growing competition for productive agricultural land but also to further illegal or informal
occupation of land and to a rising number of disputes between and within hamlets about
occupancy of land. A useful recent report on land management (Lestrelin 2015) observes the
factors identified above and identifies some issues:
          Hamlet boundaries “are often not well known by the villagers, poorly monitored by
           the hamlet authorities, delimited by unobtrusive white markers and, consequently,
           often not respected by villagers and outsiders alike."
          "Encroachments by neighbouring villagers have been reported in some hamlets (e.g.
           Bouama residents encroaching on Phonsavang land); Outsiders are also reserving land
           (jap jong) belonging to resettled hamlets (e.g. district centre residents in Nong Boua)"
           (p 10).
        We also note that the occupants of some of the additional houses may be there in
breach of the CA provision (Schedule 4, cl.8.7.3) that “no establishment of households other
than bona fide Resettlers should be permitted in the Resettlement Area". The IMA reports
"92 unauthorized settlers as of 2014" and recommends that action be taken by the District
authorities. We agree. Though flexibility is necessary, immigrant households need be
primarily restricted to hardship cases involving individuals who are close kin such as a non-
resettler widow, divorced woman or an invalid joining a resettler household. The POE is
especially concerned about the situation noted above in Phonpanpek where immigrants
outnumber resettlers and where immigrants may involve able-bodied households obtaining
land and other resources that rightly belong to Nong Boua. Hence as a rule of thumb
immigrants, except under extreme conditions approved by Village and District Land
Management Committees and by the RMU, should be restricted to individuals.

                                                      15
       There is also some evidence of outside speculative interest in acquiring land on the
Nakai plateau. There is a small but still disturbing number of reports of villagers selling their
0.66 ha land to outsiders, despite the current moratorium on transfer of title until the end of
RIP, as further indication of pressure on land.
        Another issue which may already have arisen, and surely will arise after RIP, is where
a resettler household agrees to sell its land to another resettler household. The POE notes that
in the NT2 case such sales may well be at the expense of a family’s natural growth
households (hence risking an increase in vulnerable households) for whom arable land on the
Nakai Plateau is an invaluable, if not the most valuable, resource. The GoL has, however,
advised that preventing land sales after the special conditions of the RIP would be
unconstitutional. Both GoL and IFIs see advantages in a free market in land after the end of
RIP.
       We are also concerned that a new land policy currently in draft may make it easier for
concessions to be obtained on village community land, without villagers having decided for
themselves how that land should best be used.
        The identification and protection of land rights should be the responsibility of local
Land Management Committees (LMCs). Lestrelin makes a strong case that they often have
not been up to it: “An internship report … assessing the [additional land] allocation
procedure between February and June 2014 pointed towards the limited skills and experience
of district staffs and village leaders as key constraints. In most cases, LMCs were virtually
not involved in the process and had only very basic ideas about their roles and responsibilities
in local land management." Lestrelin also criticised the “lucky draw” system of the District
Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO) of allocating additional agricultural land and argued
for a more decentralised hamlet-based process for allocation.
       As a contribution to the draft NTPC Road Map, Lestrelin identifies three objectives:
          Resolving existing inter- and intra-hamlet land conflicts.
          Establishing LMCs as functional and legitimate local organizations.
          Setting up a monitoring and information-sharing system on Community Land
           Titles (CLT) area management.
       He further suggests that it is essential that the current disputes over land ownership
and use be resolved before embarking on further additional land allocation. We agree. One
obvious problem is that at least some of the land to be allocated has already been occupied
and fenced off by villagers. Untangling this situation must be a priority.
        The POE further agrees that in the current situation of growing pressure on land a
strong and competent local land management capability is an urgent requirement. It is good
to see that training of districts and villages has started in Sopma and Bouama and that it will
be extended to the rest. We were pleased to see also that the District Governor is setting up a
District Land Conflict Management Committee which, we hope, will provide a means of
settling disputes between villages and a backstop for land allocation decisions in the village
committees.
       Overall we endorse Lestrelin’s statement of the priorities for the period ahead.

6/24      Priority be given to resolving existing land conflicts identified by Lestrelin
   and the POE during its latest mission before further allocation of additional land
   with a view to resolving the more serious conflicts no later than the first quarter
   of 2016. [Binding]

   Management Committees during the fourth quarter of 2015. [Binding]
8/24      The newly established District and Village Land Management
   Committees prohibit further inward migration except in special individual cases
   before RIP is ended, as required under the CA.
9/24      NRO, RMU and District staff pay special attention to the situation in
   Phonpanpek and in other hamlets with recent but pre-resettlement immigrant
   households such as in Nam Nian, Nong Boua Kham and New Sop Hia which may
   be attracting new post resettlement, and hence unqualified, immigrant
   households.
10/24     Lestrelin’s additional proposals for strengthening LMCs as functional
   and legitimate local organizations and for setting up a monitoring and
   information-sharing institution on CLT area management be implemented
   without delay.

       FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE FIVE PILLARS
5.1   SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FISHERIES PILLAR
5.1.1 Fish caught and traded, legally and illegally
        The legal catch of reservoir fish and consequent contribution to the livelihood of the
resettlers appears sustainable at the present population and fishing level. However, new or
improved institutional arrangements, some of which involve legal issues such as boundary
changes, are essential to ensure more equitable opportunities for resettler fishers, to control
the extensive illegal fishing activities, and to ensure that long term management is consistent
with the biological needs of the fish resource. Achieving those arrangements will require
action by the Central and two Provincial Governments before the end of the RIP.
       As the POE noted in Report 23 (POE 2014b), at present the reservoir fisheries are the
most successful and most important of the livelihood pillars for the resettler villages. They
provide the highest consistent income as well as a significant food source. Recognizing the
importance of fisheries, the GOL recently declared a ten year extension of the resettler
hamlets’ ownership of the reservoir fishery beyond the initial 10 years stipulated in PM
Degree 24.
        The foundation for fisheries yield is the stock or biomass of the target fish. Fish
catches in the Nakai Reservoir have followed the classic pattern. After extremely high yields
shortly after the dam was closed, the catch more or less stabilized at a much lower level.
Most villages reported to the POE that fish catches had decreased in recent years, although
Ban Done reported an increase in 2014. However, the NTPC Fishery Research Unit reports
that the catch, and presumably the fish stock on which it is based, has remained relatively
level for roughly four years up to 2013 with some increase through 2014 and the start of
2015. The Reservoir Fishery Association (RFA) reported to POE that they had recorded a
similar pattern, with gradual reductions to 2013 and an increase in 2014.
        These figures refer to the legal catch only. It appears that there is also a very
significant illegal off-take of the reservoir fish by outsiders as well as by resettlers
themselves. Some resettlers fish in protected areas (areas reserved for reproduction of the
reservoir fish) and some sell their catch to outside traders, thus avoiding the seven percent tax
on catches that otherwise would go to the RFA to help manage the reservoir fishing for the
resettlers.
        Most resettlers reportedly fish for home consumption, mostly from village boats, and
women and children also catch some fish from shore. Many resettlers also catch fish to sell to
augment their incomes. Those who bring their catch to the landing at Thalang usually find
available traders from other parts of Laos. However, a common complaint from the villages
farther away from Thalang is that traders who buy the fish only come to those villages
irregularly, and some Khon Kaen villagers said “never”, so that the villagers often have
trouble selling their catch even when smoke-dried for further preservation.
        The RFA calculates that about 40 per cent of the total catch is illegal. They base this
on fish brought past the check points on the Lak Sao road and at Oudomsouk. The NTPC
Fishery Research Unit calculates that 20 to 25 per cent of the total catch is illegal but this is
probably minimal since it is based only on the fish landings at or near the dam. Consequently
the total illegal catch is probably between 25 and 40 per cent.
5.1.2 Sustainability findings
        It appears to POE that the legal catch and consequent contribution to the livelihood of
the resettlers is sustainable at the present population and fishing level. The legal and illegal
                                                   18
catch combined do not appear to be overfishing the reservoir fish stock yet. If overfishing
were to be a problem it would be indicated by reduced size of the individual fish in the catch,
but the Fishery Research Unit reports that the size of fish caught has not decreased.
Consequently overfishing would not appear to be a problem. Thus this pillar is presently
sustainable and complies with the CA objectives in this respect.
       At the same time it should be observed that the outsiders’ illegal catch, the untidy
boundary and administrative situation north of the Thalang Bridge and the problem with
some villagers having restricted access to traders are examples of issues which need
addressing with despatch.
5.1.3 Measures to be taken
        To ensure that the reservoir fishery contributes effectively to the resettlers’ livelihood,
there is an urgent need to substantially improve the resettler fishers’ feeling of ownership of
the fish resource, and with it, recognition of their self-interested responsibility to watch for
and report or apprehend those conducting illegal activities that undermine their livelihood.
        The RFA has made a good start on registering and providing clear identification on all
boats on the reservoir, so that illegal activities can be more easily identified, and this
important work needs to be completed and maintained. But more effective patrolling in the
reservoir and along parts of the shores is essential to further reduce the illegal fishing and
trading by outsiders. The key to effective patrolling must be more support for, and training
of, each hamlet fishing group (Village Fishing Group (VFG) in past reports). More active
efforts by the hamlet fishing groups and resettlers in general will require GOL to provide the
necessary policing and legal support for enforcing the fishing and trading rules.
       The POE recommends that:
   11/24     NRO upgrade and intensify the institutional development and training of
      each hamlet’s VFG by the end of 2016 while GOL simultaneously provides the
      necessary policing and legal support for enforcing the fishing and trading rules.
5.1.4 Problems North of the Thalang Bridge
         The most serious threat to the sustainability of the fishery is the illegal fishing and
fish marketing that reportedly takes place in the Khamkeut portion of the reservoir. This area
is particularly vulnerable because of the ease of access via the dam road for illegal fishers and
traders coming from Lax Sao, Bolikkamsai and other places. Most of the area falls under
ineffective WMPA jurisdiction and straddles Khammouane and Bolikhamxay Provinces. It is
this serious inter-province and inter-jurisdictional (DAFO, RMA and WMPA) situation that
requires attention of the Central Government and the two Provincial Governments.
        This is particularly the case with the section of the reservoir between the Thalang
bridge and the dam, most of which is in Bolikhamxay Province’s Khamkeut District rather
than Khammouane Province’s Nakai District. The resettler villages on the peninsula leading
to the Thalang bridge have very small areas of the reservoir south of the villages legally
available for their fishing. In fairness to these villages consideration need be given to opening
part of the now-protected area of the reservoir downstream of the Thalang bridge to resettler
fishing - at least that Nam Malou area adjacent to the villages which GOL has added to the
resettlement zone.
        In the WMPA section of this report (Page 74) we have recommended the
establishment of a permanent outpost at Old Sop Hia to strengthen fisheries protection but
action is also required on access and jurisdiction.

       The POE recommends that to resolve the problem of split jurisdiction of the
reservoir fishery and before the end of the RIP, the Office of the Prime Minister
immediately assume responsibility for devising and implementing a solution along the
following lines:
   12/24    The GOL change boundaries and rules so as to allow the Thalang
      peninsula resettler villagers reasonable and legal access for fishing in the area
      downstream from the Thalang Bridge. [Binding]
   13/24      Until boundary changes occur, change rules so as to allow Thalang
      peninsula resettlers to fish the waters between the downstream Nam Theun
      channel on the East, the entrance to the Nam Malou waters, and the downstream
      reservoir area adjacent to the Nam Malou land subsequently included within the
      resettlement zone. [Binding]

        Additional areas for improved fisheries’ contribution to the resettlers’ livelihood
should include alterations to the existing areas closed to fishing and better definition of what
is needed to protect the reproduction of the fishes. To maintain and expand the reservoir
fishery there is a need for broad biological/ecological studies to determine which parts of the
reservoir need to be maintained as Special Conservation Areas closed seasonally or
permanently not just to fishing but to all foraging activities to protect areas that are
biologically important in the reservoir and impinging on dry lands. The NTPC Fishery
Research Unit’s plans to undertake scientific studies to address these issues need to be
broadened in their scope.



                                                   20
       The POE recommends that:
   14/24     Biological/ecological studies of the reservoir be broadened to determine
      which parts of the reservoir and which seasons need to be closed to fishing and
      other foraging activities to protect areas and/or times that are biologically
      important for reproduction of fish and maintenance of other natural resources.
        There is also a need to develop more effective mechanisms for fish trading to make
sure that the fish that are landed are purchased efficiently. Perhaps one answer would be cold
storage facilities (simple insulated cold boxes, not ice-making facilities which have proven
impractical) at the more remote fish landings combined with arrangements to telephone
traders when a load of fish is available for sale.
        Some resettlers, almost always women, are adding value to the catch by various forms
of processing including dried fish and fish sauce. The NRO is currently supporting this
activity in three hamlets. Processing could be extended more widely. It is an important means
for women to supplement household income and increase their influence in the household
economy.
       The POE recommends that:
   15/24      NRO extend the program of fish processing for women from three
      villages to all hamlets which express an active interest in this program. [Binding]

5.2   SUSTAINABILITY OF THE VILLAGE FORESTRY PILLAR
5.2.1 Sustainability a long way off
         For the villagers the chronic weakness of this sector means that at this time they are
having to find additional sources of income from other sources. Encroachments, often by the
villagers themselves, onto forest-designated lands, and inappropriate uses, like ill-planned
and costly burn-offs, have resulted. Meanwhile the absence of a systematic program of
fostering naturally regenerating seedlings, for example, undermines sustainability well into
the future. As pointed out above, all stakeholders have an active role to play in rescuing this
vital livelihood pillar.
        Some steps forward have been taken. Avoiding further waste has been headed off by
reducing the annual cutting quota from 6,000 cu.ms to 2,000 cu.ms.in the current year. There
has been more emphasis on producing high quality/high return logs for the Japanese market,
in part because the overall high official royalties and taxes provide a disincentive to process
timber for the local or regional lower value markets, the tax/royalty on higher value products
being proportionately lower. Thai markets are nevertheless taking Nakai timber and a
contract for manufacturing 2,000 timber doors per month for Thailand has been signed.
        A proportion (only) of the outstanding arrears owed the VFDC by the former sawmill
operator/wood seller have been recovered and a proportion of that has been distributed to the
resettlers in the form of dividend payments.
         However, the dividend, paid two and a half years after the last one, is a paltry
LAK150,000 per VFDC shareholder (each member of a resettler family). One angry Naiban
commented to the POE that he could make more out of one night’s fishing. He also asked
what had happened to the revenues from the many logs removed from the hamlet forests over
the past three years, cited the long decline over the years in the size of the dividend, lamented
its infrequency and recalled that the forests were supposed to produce much of the resettlers’
income but had not and the villagers ask why.
5.2.2 Fundamental change required
         Achieving sustainability in the village forestry sector requires a fundamental change
of approach by the major stakeholders. The failure of this critical sector to produce the one
third of resettlers’ incomes originally planned, the maladministration over a decade of the
harvesting, processing, marketing and sales of a valuable resource, the crippling level of
levies, fees and taxation, and the inadequate support for the whole operation in recent years
by the relevant GoL agencies and NTPC are all factors affecting the POE’s conclusion that
the state of this sector is a major reason for extending the RIP beyond 2015. One reality
is that the resettlers have been forced by this sectoral failure to seek elsewhere the income
needed and have resorted to illegal or unwise practices to do so. It is clear that the village
forestry pillar requires additional support which could come from GoL agencies, NTPC
and/or the IFIs.
        While it would be possible to outline a series of steps through to 2035 to attempt to
right the situation it is clear that some prior decisions have to be taken if such courses of
action are to have a chance of being successful. The GOL at a high level, NTPC and the IFIs
all need to rethink their approaches and level of commitment to meeting the CA’s objectives
in village forestry. And the villagers themselves have to be convinced that their active
participation in helping manage some aspects of the operation will bring more substantial
rewards than have been forthcoming thus far.


                                                   22
5.2.3 GOL political support needed
        The single most important action needed is the provision of overt and public GOL
political support at a high level for a renewed effort by all parties to address the still valid CA
requirements. The historical record of GOL agencies in providing constructive advice and
assistance to the endeavour to set up a productive Community Forest Program on the Nakai
Plateau is not impressive. There appear to be strong bureaucratic and commercial interests
working against the concept and practice of such a venture. A renewed affirmation at
Ministerial level of the Government’s commitment to the Village Forestry concept as set out
in the CA would be a large step forward. An instruction to the relevant GOL agencies to help
foster the process would be invaluable and a formal invitation to the NTPC and the IFIs to re-
engage in the process of rehabilitating the venture would be most helpful. The POE
underlines that without this support the pillar will continue to be non-performing, with
serious consequences for sustainability of the project overall.
        Beyond such action at the political level, a stepped up effort by GOL law enforcement
agencies to counter illegal activities in terms of encroachment on resettler forest (and other)
land and illegal logging is called for. Such illegal activities will go on jeopardizing the efforts
to raise income levels and achieve sustainability unless they are more effectively brought
under control. Similarly, there is an urgent need for more equitable sharing of NT2 forestry
revenues between the Government and the resettlers.




                    Illegally harvested rosewood under resettled houses

       There are two other calls for action by Government. The first is to authorize the
Provincial and District authorities to widen the membership of the largely ineffective existing
Village Forestry Development Corporation (VFDC) Board in order to convert it to a Nakai-
wide and representative Board with strong representation from the village institutions and

                                                    23
sources of independent expertise to provide inter alia advice and direction for the VFDC. The
second, referred to above, is to persuade both the NTPC and the IFIs to become engaged in
the upskilling and upgrading of forest management institutions at VFDC and village levels, to
undertake a long overdue forest inventory and to help lift the performance of the VFDC
sawmill. There is a crying need for expertise in these and several other fields (see below).
The role of the NTPC and the IFIs will be a key factor if the present situation is to be righted.
      These and other proposals requiring enhanced Government action and a re-
engagement by the NTPC and the IFIs are set out in detail in the text which follows.
       The POE recommends that:
   16/24      The GOL, at a high level, review the present state of the NT2 forestry
      sector and restate the commitment of Ministers to a renewed effort by all
      stakeholders to meet the requirements of the Concession Agreement in this vital
      sector, to countering illegal activities such as unlawful logging on hamlet forest
      lands and to renegotiating a more equitable basis for sharing NT2 forest
      revenues between the GOL and the resettlers.
5.2.4 A two-phase approach
          On the assumption that GOL Ministers respond positively to the call above for a
renewed commitment to the rehabilitation of the village forestry sector on the lines set out in
the CA, what should follow? A two-phase approach is called for. The immediate priorities
are to engage both the resettlers and the stakeholders actively in the rehabilitation processes,
to adjust the taxes and levies so that a more equitable revenue sharing system is in place and
to lift the performance of the VFDC across the board so that pre-tax revenues are lifted and
the confidence of resettlers in particular in the forest sector begins to be restored. That phase
is likely to take a minimum of two years. The second phase, post 2017, would address the
further strengthening of the administrative and technical capacity of the hamlet institutions
and a gradual transfer of additional management functions to the proposed Hamlet Forest
Management Committees (HFMCs), the appointment of a trained Lao manager of the VFDC,
the extension of the sales and manufacturing activities of the VFDC and the initiation of long
term forest regeneration and restoration programs at village level.
5.2.5 Community ownership and participation in management
    The most demanding part of the first phase will the creation from scratch of working
HFMCs in each hamlet.
        It is the POE’s firm view that moves toward heeding the CA’s calls for “forest
development and management by villagers, for villagers” and for a sustainable forest plan
based on the principle of community ownership of the resource are overdue. The 16
individual hamlet communities, who are the legal owners and users of the former VFA land,
should eventually undertake many of the tasks involved. The logic of the Participatory Land
Use Planning (PLUP) process, which followed the CA guideline by transferring legal title of
the village forest lands to the communities themselves, should be followed through in due
course. This would be partially achieved by transferring several key planning and
management functions in the sector to reactivated Hamlet Forest Management Committees
when the capacity to handle these functions has been created. In the interim the HFMC
members, who should desirably be elected to their position and should be consulted on their
role, should become involved in such initial tasks as overseeing the collection of NTFPs and
silvicultural work, patrolling and actively protecting the forest areas, taking a gradually


                                                   24
expanding part in the planning for reforestation/regeneration activities and providing local
knowledge for the forest inventory exercise.
        Getting the Committees at the hamlet level operational and beginning to be effective
will take considerable time and investment in capacity building. It is unrealistic to expect that
the HFMCs will be in a position to formulate and maintain their own forest inventories or
individual Forest Management Plans for each hamlet within the next two years, assuming that
this further step of decentralization is judged advisable in the course of time. They will
nevertheless have an informed and active input, as noted above, in putting together an overall
inventory and should participate in the drawing up of an overall Forest Management Plan for
the resettlement forests as a whole over the next two years. Beyond that period the pace and
direction of devolution of further tasks to the HFMCs - planting, reforestation, logging,
extraction, processing and manufacturing - will be determined by progress in taking over
successfully the initial tasks.
       The POE recommends that:
   17/24      The necessary steps be taken by the Nakai District Governor, through a
      participatory process, to reactivate Hamlet Forest Management Committees in
      the 16 hamlets as envisaged in the Concession Agreement, their initial functions
      being to take an active part in the forest inventory exercise in their forest areas,
      set up systematic patrolling of the forests, help plan and implement silvicultural
      programs and oversee the collection of NTFPs. [Binding]
   18/24     In the second phase of the forestry rehabilitation program, beginning in
      2018, there should be a gradual devolution of further roles as appropriate to the
      HFMCs in such activities as planting, reforestation, logging, extraction,
      processing and manufacturing. Employment generation for villagers will be a
      key objective.
5.2.6 Who does what?
        Management of the more technical processes in the interim, plus capacity building on
the harvesting, production and processing sides, will need to be in the hands of Technical
Assistants (TAs) provided either by NTPC or the IFIs. A primary function will be to help
select and train their Lao successors in these roles. The TAs should be required to operate as
a coordinated team, working within the overall Forest Management Plan, working alongside
VFMCs and reporting and providing expertise through a team leader to the expanded
Forestry Board.
        This raises the questions of what technical assistance is called for, where such
technical assistance may come from and where oversight authority may lie during the first
planning and capacity building phase of rehabilitating the hamlet forestry sector. The POE’s
view is that the logic of the situation is that the capacity building and forest management
advice roles at the hamlet level rest most easily with the NTPC, which now has some
experience of working with village bodies. It is also true that the above roles are assigned to
the Company in the CA, though they have not, for a variety of historical reasons not always
NTPC’s fault, been adequately handled. Consulting with the HFMCs on the way forward and
developing with them a consensus on this sensitive subject would be a first task. Setting up
and providing administrative and technical back up to the HFMCs would follow. A new
senior NTPC staff position, filled by a qualified manager with extensive experience in
helping establish communal forest management systems in the developing world, would be
required. It would make sense, in the interests of continuity, for this appointee to be the
overall team leader of the rehabilitation exercise, responsible inter alia for providing advice

                                                   25
to the Forestry Board and overseeing the work of the TAs including those working with the
VFDC manager.
        The more specialized roles in the first two year phase, when the village forests will
most logically be managed as a whole, should be filled by World Bank - and/or ADB - TAs
as they become available. These roles would include producing, in consultation with HFMCs,
an up to date overall forest inventory, formulating – also in consultation with the resettlers –
an overall Forest Management Plan, strengthening the operations of the sawmill by provision
of a short term mill operations manager to train a VFDC sawmill operations manager and
building up marketing capacity in the VFDC through recruitment of a forest species and
marketing specialist. Additional expertise will be called for, including a financial
management specialist to advise on how funding inputs and revenues should be managed and
fairly distributed, given the considerable variation of timber and NTFP resources among the
16 hamlets.
       The POE recommends that:
   19/24      The NTPC, with the GOL’s authority, initiate the forestry sector’s
      rehabilitation by providing a suitably qualified and carefully selected manager
      on its Nakai-based staff to help set up and begin training the HFMCs in each
      hamlet in their initial tasks and to coordinate the work of the externally funded
      technical assistance team whether working in the hamlets or with the VFDC.
      [Binding]
   20/24     The GOL formally seek technical assistance for the first phase of the
      rehabilitation from the IFIs as outlined, including short or longer term
      specialists as appropriate in the areas of forest inventorizing, sawmill operation,
      forest management planning, marketing and financial management. [Binding]
   21/24      A forest inventory be formulated as soon as feasible, with technical
      assistance and advice as specified provided by the IFIs (or NTPC, as agreed
      between the parties) and again through a consultative process involving the
      villagers, for each hamlet’s forests and a consolidated version for the forest
      estate as a whole. [Binding]
   22/24     A similar participatory process be followed in formulating an overall
      Forest Management Plan with technical assistance from the forest management
      planner, species and marketing specialist (who needs expertise in NTFPs and
      their domestication as well as in timber species) and a community forest
      management specialist. [Binding]
        Assessing what external expertise will still be required in the post-2017 phase will be
better undertaken during 2017 but it seems likely that there will be an ongoing requirement
for external forest management and marketing expertise, at least, for several years of this
phase.
5.2.7 The VFDC’s future
        The emphasis above on the eventual transfer of several basic planning and
management functions to hamlet level does not imply that the VFDC should be restructured
out of existence. An upgrading of VFDC planning, management and financial skills and
probably the replacement of some mill equipment will be involved if the villagers decide
eventually – as “economies of scale” would seem to dictate - that pooling of harvesting and
milling resources, information exchange and large scale transport and marketing functions in
this way would continue to make good sense well into the future.

                                                  26
        It is on this basis that the recommendations above for technical assistance to the
VFDC be provided. In an appropriately phased program, other technical expertise will be
required in due course. Thus, from a medium term perspective (a year or more ahead) there
may well be a need for a sustainable forest management adviser, a strategic planning adviser
to look at the range of options available to the villages for forest land use and development in
the longer term and possibly a team to undertake a Sustainable Forest Management
Certification Audit. But these are issues for further down the track. The focus at this point
should be on establishing the beginnings of a communal forest management system on the
Plateau as envisaged in the CA and lifting the returns to the villagers to a more encouraging
level. Those are the most effective ways of attracting resettler buy-in to the strengthening of
the forestry pillar and to preventing misuse of the forest resources.
5.2.8 VFDC Board reconstitution
        The POE has considered whether there is a case for maintaining a VFDC Board at this
juncture. On balance the Panel feels that a communal village forestry operation does not
require a national or even Provincial level oversight mechanism and would be inconsistent
with the GOL’s decentralization philosophy. The resettlers may well feel that a renamed and
remandated Communal Forestry Management Board, made up largely of HFMC nominees
plus the VFDC manager and the proposed NTPC Forestry Manager, would contribute to a
coherent approach across the District to forestry pillar matters. Such a Board would address
issues which span hamlet boundaries, approve an overall Forest Management Plan and
provide a basis for other collective action.
       The POE recommends that:
   23/24      The Provincial Governor and the Nakai District Governor consult with
      the resettlers on whether the existing VFDC Board might usefully be converted
      into a Plateau-wide Communal Forestry Management Board made up of HFMC
      nominees, the VFDC manager and the recommended NTPC Forestry Manager,
      to discuss matters of common interest, settle conflicts and make decisions on
      matters of collective importance such as approving a consolidated Nakai
      Forestry Plan and managing collective assets. Such a reconstituted Board, if
      agreed upon, would also inherit the functions of the existing Board. A new
      Decree would presumably be required to authorize the setting up of the new
      Board.
5.2.9 Re-engagement by stakeholders
        It is understood that proposals for the provision of expertise, somewhat along the lines
of those set out above, are now before World Bank decision-makers. A move by the Bank
will, we are assured, immediately stimulate further help from NTPC which has a big stake in
ensuring the success of potentially the second largest income earner for resettlers. The POE
cannot overstate the necessity for substantial progress to be made over the next two years in
rehabilitating the Nakai village forestry sector. The sector has attracted little support from
either domestic agencies or international assistance over recent years and has gone downhill
rapidly as a result. It is time for the GOL, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank to step up and re-engage in this vital sector for the future of the resettlers and the
project.
        The task is no easy one. Achieving a unified approach among 16 hamlets will be a
challenge. The POE is well aware that potential problems will arise because of inequities
among hamlets over the extent of both forest and NTFP resources held by them. Some
conflict between hamlets or within a village of two unequal hamlets will arise because the

                                                  27
value of their forest resources varies significantly. But given that future forestry depends on
the hamlets working together, these conflicts must be resolved. The mechanisms for such
resolution are being established at District level. This is encouraging.
       It should be stressed that the courses of action envisaged above are not only CA-
mandated but, equally important, accord closely with the bottom up approach to
development now being introduced into the NT2 project by the Company, as well as
with the decentralized model of the GOL itself and with the Community Land Title
regulations, which have themselves been developed and approved by the District and
Provincial authorities. The actions recommended are thus more orthodox in their
direction than the existing dysfunctional arrangements.
5.2.10 Inventorizing and long term prospects
         Some informal reports from qualified observers suggest that there are more
substantial reserves of exploitable timber in the hamlet forests than has been supposed.
Putting together an authoritative inventory is thus an essential first step in formulating a
realistic forest-wide Management Plan. Again the history of unimplemented or failed forest
inventory exercises in Nakai suggests that this needs to be a well-planned and participatory
operation conducted by independent and experienced outsiders. The experts would advise on
what species of tree – and, with villager knowledge, what NTFPs – might be grown in which
location, who would be responsible for managing specific tree or NTFP stands, whether
production would be for domestic use or sale, and in the latter event, whether and how
production would be taxed. They also need to advise on how the funding inputs and revenues
can be managed and fairly distributed, given the considerable variation of timber and NTFP
resources among the 16 hamlets likely to be revealed by the inventorizing. Final decisions on
what forest land should be designated for what purpose should be however made by villager
agencies, notably the new HFMCs.
        A case has been made for revisiting the land use planning now in place on the Plateau,
the argument being that the requirements of the original resettlers and the natural growth
households for more agricultural land would be more surely met by redesignation of some of
the forest land, especially more fertile and well-watered strips, for cultivation. Whether
recommendations for such a partial rezoning - where supported by the hamlet people - might
be incorporated in the inventorizing operation is worth investigating by those designing the
inventory exercise.
        Projections of returns from regenerated and reforested areas and an analysis of the
distribution of returns will be required for longer term planning decisions to be made. How
important the initiation of a program of planning and planting trees and NTFPs to promote
regeneration of existing forests and reforest cutover areas, as contrasted with relying on
natural regeneration, is a matter of debate among foresters who are familiar with the South
East Asian forest scene. Looking to sustainability in the longer term, however, it is not too
early to be making decisions within the next three to four years about hamlets planting, for
example, plots of slower growing high value tropical hardwoods like teak, mahogany and
rosewood. But natural regeneration will occur in the interim so accelerated reforestation may
not be a priority area for investment of scarce funds at this point.
5.2.11 Fees, taxes and levies
         Several prominent villagers called the POE’s attention to the very substantial cut the
GOL, Province and District take from the earnings on every log. According to information
provided from an authoritative source to the POE on this mission, at present the combined
total of taxes, fees and levies imposed on the VFDC’s operation represents upwards of 70%

                                                   28
of the total income received by the Company’s sales. Adding administrative and transport
fees brings the total to well over 80%. “Unofficial” and illegal fees add to the burden. This
means that the VFDC operations are providing the various levels of government and to
unofficial quarters a substantial unearned income instead of providing the designated
contribution to the sustainability of the resettlers’ livelihood income that was the original
purpose of the program. Clearly some Government revenue payment is appropriate but the
above is a truly unsustainable proportion of earnings and should again be addressed by GOL
at a high level.
        Officials, who have not favored this endeavor to establish a community forest
program, headed off the last attempt by DPM Somsavat Lengsavad to inject more fairness
into the situation.
       The POE recommends that:
   24/24      GOL Ministers review the inappropriately high level of taxes, fees and
      levies imposed on the village forestry program and impose a lesser and fairer
      burden on the resettlers by either setting a cap on total taxes, levies and fees,
      establishing a limited tax exemption, or agreeing on tax relief or a lower tax rate.
5.2.12 Getting the right people in place
        The POE would wish to underline that recruitment of technical assistance is not only
about the appropriate technical background of candidates. The personality and relevant field
experience are even more important. The sort of technical assistance needed in this
rehabilitation of the NT2 communal forestry program should not require large inputs of
capital or extensive use of expatriate expertise. What is needed is people with rural
development and community forestry experience who can adapt to the different hamlet
situations, who can work alongside and with the villagers and who are committed to actively
encouraging them to take over planning and management functions at the local level. The
POE strongly urges both the Banks and NTPC to re-engage by contributing to what is a long
overdue series of changes in the sector in the ways set out in the set of recommendations
above.

5.3   SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU
5.3.1 Introduction
        Sustainability of livelihoods on the plateau depends on the relationship between the
land, other natural resources, and its people. This is nowhere more marked than in the case of
the agricultural sector. Although the POE continues to believe that there is sufficient land on
the plateau to support mixed-production livelihoods, that depends, in the case of both
agriculture and livestock, on efficient and productive use of the land.
5.3.2 An upsurge in agricultural activity
        POE hamlet and village interviews during April 2015 confirm NTPC’s April 22, 2015
briefing of the POE that an upward trend in resettler agricultural intensification and
production is underway in the resettlement area. As will be apparent from what follows
below, the sector is still a long way from having reached a sustainable point - and there are
question marks over the continued problems developing and maintaining working irrigation
systems. In that sense the CA requirements have not yet been complied with, though there
has been encouraging progress in the past year or so.
        What is now necessary is sustaining that upward trend. According to the debriefing,
following a significant drop in households cultivating their 0.66 ha holdings in 2014, 0.66 ha
plot use has increased slightly during the first quarter of 2015 with a record 912 households
(70%) now “committed to cultivate in 0.66 and 0.22 plots” during the current rainy season. In
regard to CA required fencing, NRO has made available at resettler request 11,024 rolls of
barbed wire for fencing 947 0.66 ha plots.
        The most promising agricultural development over the last few years has been the
increasing take up of agroforestry opportunities by resettlers. According to a recent report on
the state of agroforestry (Furuoc-Paelmo 2015), 346 households are currently involved in
agroforestry. The first agroforestry crops have been sold, experimentation is proceeding with
inter-cropping, and the Agroforestry Team is involved in an effective Participatory
Agroforestry On-farm Monitoring (POFM) program. What is especially gratifying is the
range of resettler initiatives in response to the Agroforestry Team’s work. However, because
of the delayed initiation of the Agroforestry Program until 2013, Furuoc-Paelmo concludes
that “the program still needs 5-7 years before a full adoption is realized and has prepared the
community for a full turn over. The adopters still require technical guidance to build their
skills and competence on the management of agroforestry farms.” More specifically,
strategies “that should be implemented” include “provision of continuing technical assistance
until productive fruiting stage of the farmers” and “establishment of [a] market network for
the agroforestry products.”
        During this visit to Laos, the POE was able to confirm that resettlers were indeed
beginning to pay more attention to the use of NT2 project provided 0.66 and 0.22 ha plots.
This was in contrast with a previous visit only six months earlier when the POE had to record
that agriculture remained a disappointing sector with low utilization of most plots and many
resettlers preoccupied with more remunerative and usually less labor-intensive pursuits like
fishing and timber poaching.
        Why the new enthusiasm for agriculture? It appears that a number of factors are at
play. First, the illegal timber trade has fallen off in part because of lower prices and in part
because of the over-harvesting of the most accessible hardwoods. Fish catches have also not
been as remunerative as in some earlier years. So many of the pragmatic villagers have
turned back to agriculture and, precluded by the District from expanding their areas under

                                                   30
swidden rice cultivation, have come upon another apparent bonanza: the planting of cassava
for processing by a new Chinese-owned factory in Gnommalath. There was also an incentive
being provided by NTPC: free barbed wire was being provided to accelerate the use of better
fenced 0.66 ha plots. The spread of agroforestry was thus enhanced and additional lands
provided to villagers were also being converted to paddy - the sustainability of which needs
to be carefully monitored, given concerns about the suitability of some soil structures for
paddy.
        All of this new interest in the neglected agricultural lands was observed by the Panel
in the course of its interviews with villagers in 12 hamlets. Perhaps the most pleasing finding
was that the household initiative, productivity and income that the POE has been
documenting over the years have been slowly increasing. In regard to livelihoods that trend
must continue throughout the RIP.




                         Madame Eng in Phonsavang with garden

        As noted, in a number of hamlets some households on their own initiative are already
using their land, or preparing it, for paddy. Presumably associated with paddy development
as well as with other irrigated crops, a number of hamlets wanted more gully dams. That
request is strongly supported by the POE which repeatedly has stressed the importance of
gully dams being built where appropriate sites exist. Wherever possible they should be sited
sufficiently below the reservoir’s full storage level so that they will fill annually as the
reservoir fills. Gully dams are multi-functional, providing water for irrigation, water fowl and
fish production, and livestock.
       In a number of hamlets, the POE found elderly women using available irrigation
water to grow a number of crops for sale. One woman, in NTPC’s agroforestry program, has
sold produce on two occasions during the current dry season and her activities are having a
demonstration effect with other women. Only in Khon Kaen were no agricultural sales


                                                  31
reported and that was due, as explained in a group meeting, to Khon Kaen being the furthest
hamlet from a market and with no traders coming even for fish.
         Especially gratifying was the situation in Nong Boua which recently has been the
poorest village. Originally resettled as a pilot village, Nong Boua’s women had begun to
benefit from the sale of irrigated dry season crops to the nearby Oudomsouk market. The
irrigation program, including a functional Water User Association (WUA), was unfortunately
stopped by NTPC in 2006 with the result that poverty increased. According to POE village
interviews this April, however, irrigation is again producing vegetables with some
households using their own pumps to access water from the irrigation system.
       Nonetheless, customary agriculture continues to predominate on additional lands
which constitute 80% of land under cultivation. But on those additional lands the POE has
seen the beginnings of paddy, vegetable and agroforestry plots.


5.3.3 Irrigation
        Irrigation is the key to the essential conversion of the resettlers’ former system of
swidden agriculture to the more intensive multi-purpose system of household production
required if existing land resources are to sustain resettler livelihoods. Under the CA and
before the end of the RIP, NTPC is required to provide “0.66 ha of cleared and irrigated land
per household, of which at least 0.16 ha is developed and can be used for paddy rice
production” (CA Vol.2A, Sched.4.15.1). Meeting this requirement includes, at NTPC
expense, rehabilitating or replacing whatever poorly designed, constructed and/or located
non-functional irrigation systems are needed for meeting the above CA requirement.
         Since the POE’s last report in December 2014, major progress has finally begun with
irrigation due to the formation of a POE recommended irrigation team that now draws on
RMU, district, provincial and NRO expertise. According to NTPC, 82 of a total of 228
irrigation systems “are operational for 149 plots” representing 36 percent of the total
irrigation schemes and 12 percent of the total irrigated area (NTPC 2015a). It is expected that
of the total schemes, 176 will be prepared in time to be operational for cultivating 787 0.66
ha or 0.22 ha plots during the 2015-2016 wet and dry seasons or approximately 65 percent of
the area that can be irrigated.
        That important goal is unlikely to be reached, however, since SERF is expected to
fund the repairs and, according to NRO’s August 13, 2015 Weekly Memo, SERF only “has
agreed to repair 159 irrigation systems (69% of total) ‘based on farmer proposals of more
than 700hhs’.” Though 15 hamlets now have improved irrigation system regulation books,
there is very little information available to the POE on how many households in how many
hamlets are actually practicing irrigation on 0.66 ha and 0.22 ha plots or adjacent to gully
dams; on what proportion are working together within functional WUAs or only as separate
individual households; and on crops grown, yields and sales. In effect to date emphasis has
been on the physical systems as opposed to their use by resettlers. Nonetheless, after many
years of unsatisfactory irrigation development, progress is occurring.
       It will be important for continued progress, that the Irrigation Task Force is
maintained. The RMU through the activities of RMU irrigation expert Chanthapanya has
been an active and major participant in the current program and it is vital that the RMU is
funded to continue that leadership.

       The POE recommends that:
   25/24     NRO and DAFO concentrate on achieving their target of 65% of irrigable
      land having systems in place and operating for the 2016/2017 dry season, while
      aiming for the CA target of having all households with access to irrigated land
      by the end of 2017. [Binding]
   26/24     The Irrigation Task Force ensure the presence of functional water user
      associations for each operational irrigation system. [Binding]
   27/24     During the 2015-16 dry season and following the harvest, two monitoring
      studies be completed in each hamlet on functioning irrigation systems, water
      user associations, crops grown and yields. [Binding]
   28/24    RMU staffing and budget play a major role in ensuring, with DAFO and
      the NRO, that these irrigation objectives are achieved. [Binding]
        In the next section we recommend a specific role for natural growth households in the
further development of irrigation.
5.3.4 Natural Growth Households and Agriculture
        In past reports the POE has stressed the importance of natural growth households as
one of the NT2’s most important assets. Their livelihood development is essential if CA-
required sustainability is to be achieved. Well over half of such households, regardless of
their current preferences, are liable to find their livelihoods more dependent on Nakai Plateau
opportunities, with agriculture and fisheries being the most important, than they might prefer.
        This situation is because, as with other resettlers impacted by dams built in isolated
areas, members of natural growth households will not have had the education and experience
to compete with the large majority of their age mates elsewhere in Laos. For that reason, and
because they are, on the other hand, better educated and more familiar since childhood with
what is a new lifestyle for their parents, natural growth households should be actively
encouraged and trained to play an enhanced role in the agricultural pillar.
        While the POE welcomes NTPC’s recent agreement to emphasize the development of
natural growth households, their increased involvement in agriculture requires access to
adequate and owned arable land, including irrigated land, as well as land for housing and
household gardens. At present they do not own such land though some have access to their
parents’ land.
         The NTPC’s survey of such households (Bouapao 2015b) showed that many of them
do not appear to be receiving the full benefit of housing and services. Only 30% said they had
their “own” housing land; many are sharing plots with their extended families though entitled
to their own plots; and the rest seem to be settled on “free land” that the village has found for
them. They are similarly often (riskily) sharing access to electricity connections with other
households; their access to toilets seems significantly inferior to resettlers, with many having
no direct access to toilets; and in some cases women complained that they are a considerable
distance from a pump for their household water.
        While visiting four hamlets in the northern cluster, one POE team found the access of
natural growth households to land inadequate in each case. In Sop Phene only 5 of 12 married
natural growth households owned their own houses but none owned the land on which their
houses were built. Though the Naiban (hamlet headman) noted that some land could be
reallocated for agriculture, he expected that there might be opposition to this. In Thalang, the
land situation is desperate with all 34 natural growth households apparently sharing their

                                                   33
parents’ land. Though some have their own houses, no home plot land has been allocated.
Use of unoccupied Lao Army land north of the Thalang Bridge would be of major help if
GOL was agreeable.
       The POE recommends that:
   29/24    GOL reach a decision no later than the end of 2015 on whether the old
      Army base land downstream from Thalang could be used for agricultural
      purposes by natural growth households in Thalang and Sop Phene. [Binding]
        For the 24 natural growth households in Nam Nian, all arable (and most housing) land
is currently occupied by others. Though Nakai District help will be needed for dealing with
the natural growth land problem, assistance requested from DONRE a year ago has not been
received. In New Sop Hia, the 14 natural growth households all share agricultural land with
their parents since the only available land is in the drawdown area. The hamlet land situation
is worsened because of land conflict with Nong Boua Kham which requires GOL
intervention.
        Seeking solutions to providing arable land for natural growth households must be a
priority. In that regard, the POE will be seeking greater clarity in ongoing negotiations with
NTPC and Nakai District about the area of land, including irrigated land, proposed for natural
growth households.
       The POE recommends that:
   30/24     Proposals to solve the arable land issue pay special attention to
      encouraging and training natural growth households to become leaders in the
      agricultural sector inter alia by using unutilized but repairable NRO irrigation
      systems. [Binding]
   31/24    At least one such system per hamlet be operating by carefully selected
      natural growth households for use during the 2015-2016 dry season. [Binding]
   32/24     In the meantime, natural growth households be surveyed to identify,
      recruit and begin training appropriate irrigation candidates no later than the
      fourth quarter of 2015.
   33/24    Candidates for irrigation training be both women and men since the
      former are apt to be the principal farmers on smaller irrigated plots. [Binding]
5.3.5 Contract farming of cassava
         It is far from clear what the net effect of the rapid growth of contract farming of
cassava noted above will be though it will bring short term returns to a proportion of the
cultivators. Cassava has long been a “hunger relief” crop on the Nakai Plateau and still is in
the catchment. Some years ago Khammouane Provincial officials looking for industrial crops
for villagers to grow suggested that cassava be cultivated in Gnommalath along Route 12 at
the foot of the Nakai escarpment. That idea was implemented in 2014 at which time the POE
visited in February a Chinese-owned cassava processing factory under construction in the
suggested area.
        During the POE’s current visit to Laos, resettlers in a majority of the villages visited
had begun to grow cassava as a cash crop for the Chinese factory with most having signed on
to a five year contract. In Sop On 85% of households had signed on, while 5 to 28 households
were growing cassava in eight other villages. In Sopma, Lestrelin 2015 reported 60 of 67
households had started growing cassava in 2015 in their 0.66 ha fields which had been under
fallow for several years.
                                                  34
        Taking up cassava could not be a better example of the willingness of resettlers to try
new ideas and hence of the need for NTPC and GOL to work much more closely with the
population of the 16 hamlets in the implementation of the five pillars and essential cross-
cutting issues. However, far more attention needs to be paid to whatever risks may be
involved.
        At least some resettlers have been told that risks are involved in growing cassava. The
Naiban and others in Sop Phene were aware that cassava production may decline during the
period of their five year contact. They said they would adapt and use the land for other
purposes. The Chinese factory has explained to some that soil fertility will be adversely
affected in 2-3 years, hence the need for factory-provided fertilizer, while Sop On farmers,
alerted to the risks, plan to alternate and/or combine cassava with legumes and other crops.
How the provision of fertilizer will be funded is unclear, as is information on alternative
crops once the fertility of the soils has been eroded. The POE is informed that in
neighbouring Thailand the cassava yields fell after three years and only heavy fertilization
has enabled a switch to growing sugar cane and pineapples as a substitute. So there are
potential sustainability problems ahead in relation to cassava.
       The POE recommends that:
   34/24      The provincial officials involved in promoting cassava cultivation, DAFO
      in Nakai District, and NTPC meet before early in the fourth quarter of 2015 not
      just to establish a general cassava policy but also, with the resettler growers, to
      agree upon an environmentally and economically acceptable system of
      cultivation. [Binding]

5.4     SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LIVESTOCK PILLAR
5.4.1 Livestock as an income source
         Livestock is a livelihood pillar that shows as yet unrealized promise for the
sustainable improvement of livelihood of the resettlers on the Nakai Plateau. If the villagers
are willing to embrace new techniques, livestock production could become a profitable
contributor to village incomes. While the changes required for cattle and buffalo will involve
a shift in mind-set which will take a longer time to achieve and will require continued
expertise dealing with pasture development in particular, planning and developing a
successful small stock program for women should be feasible by the end of 2017. In the
interim, compliance with the CA’s sustainability goal is not in sight.
        Small livestock on the plateau includes pigs, ducks, and chickens, which are primarily
the responsibility of women some of whom already raise pigs for sale. An ongoing small
livestock vaccination program already exists. The most recent figures are that 41.3% of
poultry and 38.7% of pigs had been vaccinated through March, 2015.
         The POE recommends that:
      35/24      NRO and DAFO investigate the extent to which women who are active in
         agricultural activities in each hamlet would be interested in a program breeding
         pigs, as one example, as a cash crop for meeting the rising demand for pork in
         Laos and in China especially.
      36/24     NRO and DAFO utilize one of the three agricultural research stations for
         small stock breeding and extension purposes for women. [Binding]
        Large livestock including cattle and buffalo are the responsibility of men. Because of
their potential contribution to the livelihood of the resettlers and their importance as a source
of cash for emergencies, large livestock have been of primary concern both to the resettlers
and in the Livestock Pillar. Currently the number of livestock has been increasing, and
according to the LTA, it is close to the carrying capacity of the Nakai Plateau with the
present husbandry practices. In the past many buffalo and cattle have died, apparently of
starvation as well as disease. This does not appear to be happening at present although the
animals are very thin and are expected to remain so until the rainy season brings new fodder.
        Most of the large livestock are managed in the same cultural traditions that existed
prior to resettlement. They are maintained as walking bank accounts, for prestige and for
insurance, not as a cash crop that will add to the resettlers’ cash incomes. They are usually
only sold for emergency or special purposes, such as family celebrations. They are allowed to
roam freely, grazing and browsing in the forests and, unless excluded by fences, in cultivated
areas such as gardens and crop lands.
         The 2014 report on Pasture and Livestock Development for NRO (by Bruce Cook)
concluded that “Current practices in relation to crop and stock management are seen as
unsustainable and will continue to result in land degradation and weed invasion. Farmers will
need to change their attitudes.” (Cook 2014). There is a clear need for pasture development to
provide for increased forage and higher stocking rates, but only a very few resettlers have
tried to raise pasture forage. One problem cited is that the livestock or even, in limited cases,
wildlife, invade the growing pasture plants. In one village the POE was told that the recent
provision of barbed wire by NTPC would allow them to fence and raise pasture, and several
of them are already doing so. We observed one such endeavor in Sop Hia, for example (see
photo). The owner said that there was a catch in the new fencing operations: a much greater


                                                   36
area of pasture than he has planted would be required to adequately feed his stock, which
were now being excluded from open grazing lands around the village by the wire fencing.
        So while the larger livestock are near the carrying capacity, they are not at present
contributing to the sustainable livelihood of the resettlers and, on the contrary, are degrading
unprotected forage resources. As Cook noted in his earlier report: “There needs to be a clear
incentive for farmers to invest time, money and effort in moving from the currently
unsustainable system that can only result in widespread land degradation and entrenched
poverty among the people.” He noted that there seems to be few prospects for beneficial
change, and as for the likelihood of such changes, Cook concluded during his 2014 visit: “I
have not seen anything during this mission to alter this view.”




                           New forage planting for cattle, Sop On

        As recommended by Cook, a participatory extension specialist input took place in
December 2014 which resulted in “Increasing Income from Cattle Raising” workshops being
conducted in all villages (with 80% of participants being female). In these workshops
participants set a target for increased income, assessed the current level of income (profit),
analysed current practice for strengths and weaknesses, and developed household action
plans for changing behavior to increase income. Reportedly as a consequence of these
workshops, the uptake of sowing dedicated pastures has increased, along with night feeding,
provision of water, and attention to selection of breeding animals.
5.4.2 Disease and Health
      In addition to Cook’s views on large livestock currently being an unsustainable
component of the livestock pillar, the POE has repeatedly emphasized the risk of epidemic


                                                   37
disease being introduced from the watershed and from Khamkeut and Gnommalath Districts
due to previous epidemics there and low vaccination rates.
        Already on three occasions the POE has been in locations where haemorrhagic
septicemia or unidentified epidemic diseases have devastated buffalo herds. Early in the
POE’s existence, Nakai Plateau villagers in Old Sop Hia lost most of their buffalo to
haemorrhagic septicemia, while several years ago the POE travelled through villages in the
catchment’s Nam Pheo river basin where large numbers of both buffalo and cattle had died.
In February 2014, villagers told the POE that epidemic disease devastated buffalo herds in
the PIZ village of Pakatan in Khamkeut District. In spite of higher levels of vaccination than
in surrounding areas resettlers’ large livestock may well be more at risk because the large
majority continue to graze outside larger villages that are situated in what has become a semi-
urban environment.
        Nevertheless the health status of large livestock appears to be improving. An ongoing,
comprehensive vaccination program is now being carried out on the Nakai Plateau by village
veterinarians and village extension workers with support of NRO. By early 2015 good
progress in vaccinations has been reported with 37 per cent of the large livestock (48 % of the
cattle and 20% of the buffalo) vaccinated. Although these figures are low relative to
international standards, this vaccination rate is two per cent higher than the current national
average.
        As noted above, villagers are said to maintain large livestock, primarily buffalo, as
“walking savings banks” but not as income producers. However, it appears that there are the
significant beginnings of a shift to raise cattle for income. People in several villages reported
that they were making this shift. For example, in late 2014 in Ban Done we were told that
many villagers increasingly prefer cattle to buffalo. They felt that the cattle were more
disease resistant, but significantly, they reported that their cows could expect a calf a year,
which, after three years, could be sold for 2.5 to 2.8 million Kip. Buffalo are less prolific
producers. Another example is Nakai Tai village where people were shifting rapidly from
buffalo to cattle and noting that the cattle provided “a stable income.” These are two of the
largest villages on the Plateau so the livestock situation in them may be an indicator of trends
in other villages also. Alone among the resettler villages, Nong Boua Kham has been setting
up livestock raising as a near commercial operation, initially for the army, since before NT2.
5.4.3 Better fodder needed
        Most of the buffalo and cattle owned by the resettlers feed on rather sparse grasses
and other vegetation, often in the degraded forest areas. They are adapted to this rather rough
diet and they show moderate productivity on it. However, if the livestock are to be managed
for maximum profit they require substantially more nutritious fodder. To achieve higher rates
of productivity they would require well managed pasture development, improvement in
livestock feeding practices and better animal husbandry. Better pasture development will
require application of fertilizers, probable introduction of more nutritious feed species, and
active management of the livestock. Above all, it will require understanding by the villagers
of the importance of the livestock development activities. Throughout much of the world
farmers are reluctant to spend resources on pasture development for beef (as opposed to
dairy) cattle. Such expenditures are totally foreign to most resettlers, and achieving their
active cooperation and participation would require a significant educational effort.
        The consultant’s report on pasture and livestock development sets out an ambitious
four part program to attain sustainability based on provision of a productive and stable feed
base, control of livestock and development of a commercial approach to livestock production.

                                                   38
As with a switch to intensive farming on the 0.66 plots this will require a whole new
approach, new technology and new farming and husbandry practices. If the Nakai Plateau
villagers including women are willing to embrace the new techniques livestock production
could become a profitable contributor to village incomes. But as noted above, the changes
required will involve a shift in mind-set - the greatest challenge, will take time to achieve and
will require continued expertise not least on the extension side.
       The POE recommends that:
   37/24     As part of the CA required Livestock Improvement Program (CA 9.7), a
      coordinated program of training in achieving enhanced soil fertility and plant
      nutrition and well supported field work and husbandry improvements be
      undertaken as part of a sustained effort to lift large animal production to a
      higher income-earning level over the years ahead. [Binding]

5.5   SUSTAINABILITY OF THE OFF-FARM PILLAR: TOURISM AND
      TRAINING
5.5.1 The potential of tourism
        Tourism is potentially an important and sustainable contribution to resettler
livelihoods, as it has proven to be in several other regions across Laos and elsewhere in
Khammouane Province itself. However, while there are some encouraging developments
substantial work remains to be done before the sector even begins to achieve its potential.
NTPC is encouraged to be more proactive as a facilitator.
        The opportunities are opening up elsewhere in the country. In Lao PDR as a whole
the average annual growth in tourist arrivals between 2010 and 2013 was 25%. International
arrivals are growing at 19.8% per annum compared to 31.5% for the domestic market. In
2014 Lao PDR received 4.2 million international tourists who generated $620 million in
foreign exchange from spending on accommodation, food, transport, shopping, entertainment
and other services. The main drivers of growth are the recent opening of the third Mekong
Friendship Bridge that links Thakhek with Thailand, and strong demand for culture and
nature-based tourism.
         The resettlement experiences and cultures of the various ethnic groups complement
the potential of the NNT-NPA and the WMPA for nature-based tourism. By the time a
tourism program gets underway, each hamlet will have developed a unique educational
experience to attract tourists to visit within their community boundaries. That experience
would be greatly enhanced by GOL’s clarification through an Order of the Prime Minister
that islands within hamlet boundaries belong to the resettlers to use for agriculture, grazing,
tourism and other livelihood activities.
        The pillar’s potential for growth is substantial. Khammouane Province received about
425,000 tourists in 2014. In recent years increasing numbers of these tourists, currently about
1,000 per month, have come across the Nakai plateau. Many of these are making the loop
from Thakhek across the Nakai to Lak Sao, then west to route 8 and returning to Thakhek.
Many of these are backpackers and motorcyclists, in part because a section of this route
remains rough to traverse by tourist bus. However, this section is scheduled to be sealed by
the end of 2015. So while the total numbers of tourists in Khammouane Province has been
rising each year, it is anticipated that with a good through road there will be a greatly
increased number of tourists coming across the Nakai Plateau in the years immediately
ahead, especially from China, Vietnam, Thailand and overseas. However, the reality at
present is that tourism is far from contributing to compliance with the CA’s off-farm
sustainability goal.
        If adequate facilities can be provided, the Nakai Plateau, reservoir and watershed
could become important and economically productive tourist objectives. With training and
preparation the anticipated increased tourism could provide many resettlers with substantial
off-farm income. In November 2014, a workshop was held by the district and provincial
tourism office, with a French NGO involved in tourism, to explore local interest in tourism
and new potential tourism sites. The ADB already has an active tourism program that
includes the Nakai District and can provide training as well as other assistance to the
development of Nakai tourism. This source of expertise and contacts should be tapped into. If
there is agreement between the government bodies and others, including NGOs, a tourist
development plan is created, and training is provided for interested villagers, there is a
potential for tourism to contribute significantly to the sustainability of resettler off-farm
livelihoods in due course.

                                                   40
5.5.2 Training for tourism
        There is a pronounced gap in knowledge and know-how about the industry in the
villages but a growing interest in its potential. As a Thalang woman put it: “we like the idea
of setting up tourist ventures but we do not know where to start.” One idea discussed was that
a group of villagers work together to set up local boat trips on the reservoir and up one of the
tributaries, arrange guides for bird watching and bush walks, provide a Lao food lunch and
return the visitors to the village, perhaps for cultural performances or dinner – or even an
overstay. There are some lingering cultural reservations about charging visitors for services
which traditionally were a Lao gift to the visitor but the younger resettlers do not have
inhibitions about this. With a growing market for nature-based tourism including wildlife
viewing, cultural and off the beaten track experiences, the Nakai area and nearby NPA have
attractions which will bring in those seeking different adventures.
        Some different approaches to training will be called for. Women in the villages were
keen to become involved but are reluctant to go outside the immediate area for training. So
long as courses were held in, or close to, their home village, and were during school hours
they were enthusiastic about the possibilities. Basic training in advertising the availability of
ventures, in safety practices – life jackets on boats, for example – food preparation, pricing,
and so on will be called for.
       The POE recommends that:
   38/24      NRO help bring together the various players – local and international
      NGOs, Tourism Ministry, the ADB specialists, District authorities, VDCs and
      the private sector – and work more proactively with the ADB and others to
      explore local interest in tourism development, encourage preparation of a
      tourism development plan and set up village-level training programs in concert
      with the ADB. Proposals for tourism training and ventures in the resettlement
      villages may well emerge from the “bottom up” development approach now
      being fostered by NTPC. [Binding]
   39/24     Resettler control of islands within their hamlet boundaries including use
      for tourism ventures be clarified by an Order from the Prime Minister’s Office.
5.5.3 Vocational training
        Having referred to “a limited increase in the number and relevance of training
activities in the off-farm sector” during 2014, POE Report 23 stated that “There are simply
not enough resettlers taking such courses.” (POE 2014b). Nor, it seems, are the skills being
fully used.
        Though the POE commends the growing strength of the Community Living Well
Program that now includes “Mobilization of village youth for vocational training ,” that
activity did not involve NTPC but was implemented by the Lao Revolutionary Youth Union.
As far as may be ascertained, NTPC itself sent 68 persons to Thakhek and Vientiane in 2014
for training in income generation skills. That is a considerable number but for reasons which
need analysis only 60% of those trained in the previous year have since applied their newly
learned skills. Furthermore, NTPC has only limited funds set aside for vocational training in
2015 and appears to have been little involved in vocational training under the Off-Farm Pillar
to date during 2015.
        This is most disconcerting at a stage in the project development where vocational
training should be being most actively pursued. It is accepted that initiating off-farm
activities, notably those demanding entrepreneurial skills, in a new semi-urban environment

                                                   41
is far removed from the traditional way of life of the older generation. Most resettlers have
had some personal experience in working in the other four livelihood areas, but vocational
training is breaking new ground; which underlines how important well researched and
focused training is provided it is in building up the off-farm pillar. Again it seems likely that
the new generation of resettlers may have a unique contribution to make.

5.5.4 Training in general
        The capacity building at the village level requires further efforts to identify needs and
opportunities. Funding is apparently available but a further analysis on the ground is called
for. Our general impression about training is that it is most likely to be effective if it is
conducted on site and closely linked to employment opportunities. On the first point, as
pointed out above in relation to tourism industry training, there is a marked aversion among
the resettlers to going well beyond the Plateau for training. The women in particular much
prefer tailor made courses, designed for their level of need and the opportunities immediately
available to them, conducted in family-friendly hours and preferably in their own or
neighbouring villages. That is an administration-intensive system in some ways – bringing
the trainers to the learner rather than the reverse - but may be more appropriate at this point
than training in distant venues, and may prove less expensive to arrange. NTPC has recruited
a Lao woman who seems to have the drive, the motivation, the knowledge, and the
personality to make a success of setting up a series of ad hoc village courses across a range of
disciplines. With adequate funds assigned to the operation and priority accorded to the work,
the training deficit can be made up relatively rapidly. However, as with tourism, training is
far from contributing to compliance with the CA's off-farm sustainability goal.


                                                   42
   The POE recommends that:
40/24     As emphasized by IFI comments on this report, “off-farm training should
   be closely linked to the village development planning process, taking into account
   the local and national labor market opportunities and capacities of resettlers.”
41/24     NTPC not only continues to sponsor and fund vocational training under
   the Off-Farm Pillar, but that additional training be based on a further analysis
   of needs and opportunities at the village level and on the relationship between
   past training, income generation and skills use with special emphasis on
   upskilling female and male resettler youth. [Binding]
42/24      Such training include a substantial program of less formal training, being
   designed specifically to meet real and immediate needs for upskilling among the
   resettlers, relevant to and reflecting the opportunities available to them,
   conducted wherever feasible in the villages themselves and including small loans
   or grants where required to enable the villagers to equip themselves initially to
   set up business (treadle sewing machines, weaving looms, sets of
   motorcycle/outboard motor/vehicle repair tools, lifejackets for boats etc.).
43/24     NTPC accept that a more dynamic approach to off-farm activity training
   in general is called for in the year or two immediately ahead and to this end set
   themselves an ambitious target of recruiting for training during the remainder of
   2015 to be increased proportionately during 2016 and again during 2017.

     SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY IN LIVELIHOODS
AND RECOMMENDATION ON EXTENSION
6.1   Adequacy of land and other natural resources
        As recorded above, the POE’s finding is that with equitable resolution of present land
conflicts, with official discouragement of illegal and excessive inward migration and
effective law enforcement to protect lands, forests and fisheries, and with further distribution
of additional agricultural lands there will be sufficient land and other natural resources
available to sustain livelihoods for the resettlers and the natural growth households and their
successors for the years through to the end of the Concession Period. A review of the present
and future land allocation and use system to ensure enhanced equity and to take into account
topography, soils and water resources is called for at this point. The above finding assumes
that further livelihood development will be fostered within a diversified household
production system, that ongoing support through technical assistance from development
partners will be maintained and that effective District, village and hamlet-level institutions
will be supported and thrive.
6.2   Other factors affecting sustainability
         The delays in initiating several of the key social programs has led to a belated
achievement of social objectives and sustainability. With the benefit of hindsight it can be
seen that the livelihood programs in general should have been started up earlier than in fact
happened. There were a variety of reasons for this, not all of NTPC’s making – the prolonged
delay in getting fundamental programs like soil surveys undertaken can be instanced as
largely an NTPC failing but the similar delay in getting the key land allocation (PLUP)
Process underway and completed owes more to the innovatory nature of the exercise in the
Lao context. Beyond these examples the tardiness in getting Village Development
Committees up and running and seriously involved in planning and implementation, still at
an experimental stage in most hamlets, and the inadequacies in capacity building in general,
held back progress. So did the ongoing problems with building and introducing appropriate
irrigation technologies accessible to the average villager, the late provision of fencing
materials, delayed provision for the natural growth households and so on.
        It has to be said also that the insistence of the Lenders on the inclusion in the CA of
ceilings on some program expenditure, while understandable enough, proved in the end to be
as damaging as the POE and others had feared. This was particularly so in the cases of the
Forestry and Downstream Programs, the withdrawal of NTPC support once the sums laid
down in the CA had been expended proving to be highly disruptive, though some flexibility
was eventually shown on funding in both cases.
        A further factor was the Company’s occasional lack of appreciation of the importance
of putting people with appropriate background and expertise in strategic positions. The
tendency, especially in the first years of the RIP, was to appoint managers with engineering
experience to head up the NT2 social programs like fostering livelihood development. Those
appointed were well motivated but they were engineers expected to plan and oversee social
engineering in a remote part of a developing (and tropical) country – and in a project whose
intended beneficiaries were largely from ethnic minorities unused to a sedentary life and
occupations. Such appointments amounted to attempting to fit round pegs into square holes.

6.3   Summary of livelihood findings
       The list below is not intended to be comprehensive and should be read alongside the
sections above on the five pillars, the section below on cross-cutting issues and the attached
Table summarizing what remains to be done to achieve RIP closure:
                  The POE finds at this point in time that the Fisheries Pillar is the most
                   successful of the livelihood pillars and that the legal catch is sustainable at
                   the present population and fishing level. Further increase, however, in the
                   current illegal fishing and fish trading could undermine current
                   sustainability.
                  The POE finds that, by way of contrast, the Village Forestry Pillar has
                   failed to produce more than a fraction of the one third of resettlers’ income
                   planned, has been maladministered for a decade and heavily overtaxed,
                   has little involvement by the villagers in any element of managing the
                   resource they own, is inadequately supported by GOL agencies, the NTPC
                   and the IFIs, and is thus unsustainable as at present run.
                  The POE finds that the Agricultural Pillar, while experiencing this year
                   an encouraging upward trend in resettler agricultural intensification and
                   production with an expanding use of previously underutilized land
                   allocations and an increasing take up of agroforestry and cassava planting
                   opportunities has yet to reach the point of sustainability in terms of
                   providing the planned level of agricultural intensity, resettler income and
                   household sustenance. The challenge is to sustain the upward trend.
                  The POE finds that the Livestock Pillar has not yet realized its potential
                   as a contributor to household incomes, with current practices in pasture,
                   forage and stock management regarded as unsustainable and much of the
                   Plateau reaching or exceeding its carrying capacity for large livestock
                   while not realizing its capacity to expand the husbanding and sale of small
                   livestock.
                  The POE finds that the Off-farm Pillar, which has boiled down in
                   essence to tourism development and to training/capacity building, calls
                   for further attention. Thus, the tourism potential of the Nakai Plateau and
                   the associated National Protected Area is considerable particularly in the
                   ecotourism dimension and is expected to evolve fairly rapidly once there is
                   a sealed road from Nakai to Laksao. But at this time it is only slowly
                   evolving and the project’s contribution is minor. The POE also finds that
                   there is an ongoing but largely unmet requirement for vocational training
                   in a range of areas, notably at the village level, and seeks a further needs
                   analysis.
6.4   Recommendation on extension of the RIP
       The sections which follow on cross-cutting issues (Section 7), like providing for the
Natural Growth households and ethnic minorities, protecting the vulnerable, addressing
gender and women’s issues and the handing over of responsibilities for managing the project
to Lao agencies are obviously directly related to fostering and maintaining the welfare and
socio-economic status of the Resettlers and merit attention and resources accordingly.
       The emphasis among the Resettlement Objectives in section 3.1 of Schedule 4 in the
CA focuses in particular on the sustainability of livelihoods. The recommendation set out
below is therefore primarily but not solely related to this issue and takes into account the

                                                   45
finding that only one of the five livelihood pillars can be said to have achieved the
Resettlement Objective of sustainability.
       The POE recommends that, taking into account its findings in this report – notably
the conclusion that only one of the five livelihood pillars can be said to have attained
sustainability and maintained it for a reasonable period of time:
      44/24     The Resettlement Implementation Period be extended for two years to
         December 2017 and, as the CA requires, activities performed in the intervening
         period be reviewed and reassessed by the POE before the expiry of that period to
         determine whether the Resettlement Objectives and Resettlement Provisions
         have been achieved in accordance with the Concession Agreement. [Binding]
6.5       Evaluating conditions for closure
        It follows that, if the analysis and advice in this report is accepted, there will need to
be a further evaluation of achievements before the review date of the end of 2017. The two
key questions will be whether the outcomes for 2017 have been achieved and the
recommended actions have been implemented.
        A key test is whether, by the end of 2017, development on the plateau will have
reached the point where informed observers would agree that it is sustainable. Because this is
a prediction at that point about an uncertain future, it will inevitably be a matter of
judgement. The POE envisages that this judgement would be made on the basis of a range of
evidence:
          Official statistics and reports: statistics on land use; production, consumption and
           incomes related to the specific pillars; QSEM/LSMS and supporting qualitative and
           statistical analysis; Company and GOL reports on inputs of staff and budget, and on
           plan achievements);
          Consultant evaluations: including as required repeats or updates of the more salient
           consultant reports on pillar developments and institutional support, LTA and IFI
           missions, and monitoring reports on specific projects in agriculture, forestry and the
           other pillars as required;
          Missions by monitoring agencies covering:
               o Review of the above reports and evaluations;
               o Discussions with key stakeholders;
               o Meeting with, polling and interviewing villagers;
               o Direct observation of conditions on the Plateau.
         None of this agenda is new. The main issue is timing. In order to allow as much time
as possible for recommended remedial action to bear fruit in the intervening period, reviews
of the RIP achievements by the IFIs and POE should take place in the third quarter of 2017. It
will be important to get the sequencing of reporting right and to avoid a repetition of the
situation faced this year where the IMA compliance review took place after the POE Mission
and a major review of project agriculture was not available before this report of the POE
went to the printer. A logical sequence would be for a QSEM/LSMS survey to take place in
the first half of 2017 with its analysis produced by May at the latest, followed by an IMA
compliance review to report by the end of June, an LTA visit in July and an IFI Review team
visiting in September. There would be logic in a brief overlap between the IFI and POE
visits, with the latter occurring in October. This assumes that all three major monitoring
missions remain in place with mandates and roles roughly akin to their present ones. The

                                                     46
object of the exercise would be to have a decision on RIP closure by November/December
2017.
       The POE recommends that
   45/24     In accordance with the analysis and recommendation in this report
      relating to the CA Objectives and Provisions, the further reviews proposed in
      2017 include a QSEM/LSMS survey reporting by May 2017, an IMA compliance
      report available by the end of June, an LTA visit in July and an IFI mission in
      September, preferably overlapping with a POE mission in early October. A
      decision on the closure issue would follow in November/December 2017.

       CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
7.1   NATURAL GROWTH HOUSEHOLDS
7.1.1 Status and role
        Natural Growth Households, as discussed in the CA, refer to households of first
generation children who marry after resettlement but before the end of the RIP. In various
documents (including some POE reports) they have been referred to as the second generation
which is an error since the term ‘Second Generation’ should refer to those who are born after
their parents had moved to the resettlement hamlets.
        The status and role of natural growth households has been a long-running source of
confusion and disagreement between the main stakeholders and the POE. There is now
positive progress to report but settling the outstanding issues and recording – and more
importantly, actioning – the agreements arrived at remain to be completed. This matter is
among the top priorities of the POE, given that it is an equity issue, has implications for
livelihood sustainability of all resettlers and has dragged on for too long.
         The root of the problem has lain in a fundamental difference of view over how to
perceive natural growth households. The Panel, drawing on its global experience of other
dam projects, has seen them as one of the project’s greatest assets. We view the contributions
of this better educated group, more familiar than their parents with the nature of the national
political economy and technological advances in which resettlement has incorporated them,
as critical for the implementation of a successful resettlement process.

7.1.2 Ongoing negotiations
        In part because a consultant has undertaken some overdue but helpful research and
report writing about natural growth household numbers and situation, GOL, NRO and the
POE got together in April and engaged in a dialogue based on realities. The consultant, Lilao
Bouapao, produced several 2015 reports detailing the number of households, their ethnicity,
their educational status, their assets, their present livelihood activities and so on. On the basis
                                                    48
of this new information the POE met with senior NTPC staff, Bouapao and the Governor and
Vice Governor of Nakai District on 27 April to consider proposals advanced by both sides to
resolve the problems. The presence of the Governor and his Deputy was vital, since the most
difficult matters still faced revolve around the identification and allocation of housing plots
and arable land, functions which only the District has the authority to handle and settle.
         Thereafter, benefiting from a number of informative studies by consultant Lilao
Bouapao, discussions continued between GOL and NTPC. A progress report received in
early September shows that the RMU, Nakai District and NTPC have made a major effort not
just to identify the number of natural growth households and to survey and collect data on
those households in July, 2015, but also to plan and begin the complex and time consuming
implementation of the following 12 benefits that GOL, NTPC and the POE had agreed upon
in April:
      Ownership of 0.66 Ha & 0.22 Ha plots and room for a household garden
      Access to and preferably ownership of additional land
      A house plot provided and owned by the G2 resettler
      Ready access to electricity
      Ready access to clean water supplies
      Sealed Toilets
      Eligibility for access to a community and farmer assets-seed processing and fertilizer
       factories, seedling nurseries, and cattle crushes, for example - and services including
       agricultural and livestock extension services and micro-finance services within the
       resettlement area
      Eligibility for other livelihood support in relation to livelihood choices made eg.
       SERF
      Access to reservoir fisheries
      Entitlements to a share of VFDC dividends, and to employment in reforestation and
       other VFDC programs.
      Access to health centre services
      Eligibility to attend NTPC training courses
        A total of 441 natural growth households were agreed upon to receive the above 12
listed benefits.10

7.2     STRENGTHENING THE VILLAGE SAVINGS AND CREDIT FUND
       The POE recommended in Report 23 that “Having flexible, viable and sustainable
VSCFs11 in each village and hamlet is fundamental to strengthening all five livelihood pillars,
and should be a high priority.” (POE 2014b)
        Since the Funds were set up in 2012 they have become the main source of loans in the
resettlement hamlets. Reasons for going into debt vary widely between hamlets but currently
the most important is livelihood activities, followed by consumer goods, medical expenses
and food.
        Borrowing as a source of credit varies widely between hamlets with some tendency
for the wealthier hamlets to have higher debt levels and make more use of the Fund. A
preliminary report on characteristics of natural growth households concludes that the average
second-generation household borrows about as often as other households but borrows less
than half the amounts of other households.
      The consultant on village micro-finance (Behrle 2015) reported that
            Overall growth in the Funds was at a modest rate; they were yielding a good
             return for shareholders; the rate of disbursement was still low; and the portfolio at
             risk rate (a measure of credit delinquency) “was not high for the specific context”;
            Governance and management was poor in some villages; there were some
             conflicts of interest and difficulties in enforcing loan conditions;
            A custom-built funds management system developed by an NRO Advisor might
             not survive his departure;
            There were opportunities to improve the return on the Funds’ overall assets,
             particularly by higher-return financial investments;
            There was limited capacity in the DRDPEO (District Rural Development and
             Poverty Elimination Office: the local District GOL office designated to assume
             responsibility for the VDFs in the handover) to provide supervision and support.
             The consultant advised the creation of Network Support Organization instead and
             also strongly advised against the establishment of an umbrella Savings and Credit
             Union “as it will take out the power and responsibilities from the hand of
             villagers, this can be dangerous.”
       A recent report for NTPC on institutional capacity (Gebert 2014) also observed that
there was limited capacity in villages to manage funds and noted the low and uneven rate of
uptake between hamlets.
        NTPC’s response to the LOM addresses the handover arrangements, advising that the
NRO, RMU and DRDPEO had agreed to move to a Network Support Organization
“consisting of the 16 VDF, that will organize monthly supervision visits to the VDF, report to
the district and be externally audited annually”. This proposal is picked up in the Road Map
which refers to “Set up of self-governing VDF Network Support Organisation with
employment of professional field staff and linking to external support and audit.”.
      The Road Map states that the Province is promoting a Savings and Credit Union.
Along with NTPC, we favour the proposal for retaining the village-based governance of the
VDFs. Many micro-credit facilities end up with mass defaults. So far the VDFs have a



         11
            Subsequently renamed Village Development Funds (VDFs) and placed under new regulations
granting them autonomy in governance.
                                                       50
reasonably good default rate, and this seems in part due to the fact that villagers own the
Fund and get dividends from it, so they have an interest in its continued viability. The
proposal for a Network Support Organisation, with one or two staff to visit each VDF
committee regularly to monitor and advise and help resolve problems, seems cost-effective.
        The Road Map draft does not respond to the LOM recommendation that the VDF be
more accessible to natural growth households, and poor and vulnerable villagers. NTPC
reports that “Village Development Fund is accessible by all (resettlers or non resettlers);
Vulnerable and elderly can withdraw their share as per request to village committee and after
review and agreement of advisory committee)”. The consultant’s view was that
               … the low disbursement rate should not be seen as a problem. It simply
       reflects the abundance of funds, the obviously reasonable cash flow situation in the
       resettler villages, their respect of the VDF regulations and, probably, also a lack of
       investment opportunities that would qualify for debt financing. Under no
       circumstances should people be pushed into debt by officials that do not have an
       understanding of the villagers’ situation. (Behrle 2015)
        This is a reasonable conclusion: finance does not drive real investment: the
relationship if anything is the other way around. If villagers are reluctant to go into debt to
develop their livelihoods, the answer lies in improving their opportunities and appetite for
further investment rather than in artificially stimulating demand on the Funds.
       The POE recommends that:
   46/24    There be established a self-governing VDF Network Support
      Organisation with professional field staff, external support and audit.
   47/24      In principle, further efforts be made to ensure that the VDF is accessible
      to all resettlers subject to there being genuine demand for credit based upon
      opportunities and appetite for further investment.

7.3   ETHNIC MINORITIES ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU
7.3.1 Introduction.
       The Concession Agreement pays special attention to the resettlement of ethnic
minorities:
               The GOL and the Company shall ensure that at all times during the
               Resettlement Implementation Period, appropriate steps are taken to mitigate
               against the additional risks to ethnic minority groups…and will ensure that
               plans addressing the issue of culturally sensitive development of Project
               Affected People (‘Ethnic Minorities Development Plans’) are implemented,
               having due regard to the SDP [Social Development Plan]. In addition to six
               other actions, ensuring the above requirement will include:
                       • additional training and options for livelihood development where a
               lack of understanding of new technology and methods has resulted in poor
               performance or a return to unsustainable pre-resettlement activities.
                      • training and support for village facilitators to raise sensitivity to local
               languages and traditions in order to overcome barriers to full participation by
               ethnic minorities in the consultation process.
                                                        (CA Section 9.1.4 of Schedule 4 Part 1)
      To date, except for the Ethnic Minority Development Plan in the 2005 Social
Development Plan and with the partial exception of the Ahoe, virtually no “Ethnic Minority
Development Plans” have been developed, let alone implemented, nor appropriate GOL and
NRO staff training undertaken.
        Another serious problem has been that the NT2 LSMS and the derived QSEM
monitoring systems were not designed to deal with either ethnic or inter-village distinctions,
both of which have been seriously underemphasized.
        A major inadequacy of the LSMS reports was to use Lao as one’s major language
(“mother tongue” in the LSMS) as an indicator of ethnicity. That mistake - only recently
corrected in QSEM9B QIII 2014 - seriously under-represented the proportion of ethnic
minorities in the resettler population. For example, NTPC’s 2005 Social Development Plan
calculated the Brue [Brou] (32.7 %), the Tai Bo (31.8%) and the Vietic-speakers (2.9%) as
approximately two-thirds of the resettler population (67.4%) in the 2002-03 dry season. Yet
as more educated resettlers through time referred to Lao as their mother tongue, the last
LSMS report (March 2013) stated that “The three main ethnic groups within the resettler
population are the Lao Lum [actually not an ethnic group as such; hence another confusion]
(58%), the Thai Bor (19%) and … the Brou (11%)” with “other ethnic minorities, including
the Ahoe” totaling less than 5%.
        The POE believes that such a serious confusion between ethnicity, language, and
population stereotyping (Lao Lum) has caused significantly less NT2 project emphasis on the
welfare of the ethnic minorities who were two thirds of the resettler population at the time of
resettlement.
       GOL consolidation of the original 22 villages into the current 10 villages has also had
an adverse effect on ethnic minorities in at least four villages (in which the four dominant
hamlets are controlled by Lao Lum households while the four weaker hamlets - Sop Phene,

                                                   52
Sop Ma, Nong Boua, and Phonsavang - contain less educated and more inexperienced ethnic
minorities).
        In terms of participation in hamlet and village governance at all levels, minorities are
often sidelined or held back by shyness (especially in regard to ethnic minority women),
inadequate training and experience. Thus, a recent survey showed that the three most
effective hamlet fishery groups are in communities dominated by Lao Lum while three of the
five least effective are in ethnic minority villages.
         The weakness of the training component of the Off-Farm Livelihood component
indirectly has adversely affected the less educated ethnic minorities as has been the inability,
for example, of poorer Brou in Phonsavang to take advantage of secondary education either
because of inability to finance travel to an existing secondary school or lack of boarding
facilities (government or kin-based) in places where Nakai Plateau secondary schools are
currently located.
       Granted the above major constraints facing ethnic minorities and the delay in
addressing them, it will be necessary during the remainder of 2015 to get on with planning
and implementing an appropriate (and sustainable after Handing Over) Ethnic Minority
Development Program during the remainder of the RIP.
       The POE recommends that:
   48/24      Henceforth ethnicity be a priority, proportionate to the numerical
      representation of ethnic minorities (including natural growth households) in
      villages and hamlets, in selecting resettlers for training in important committees
      such as the VDC and Land Management Committees, in institutions such as
      Village Fishery Groups, in irrigation system membership, in activities under the
      Off-Farm Pillar, and in receiving educational scholarships. [Binding]
   49/24      NTPC recruit an appropriately trained and experienced Lao-speaking
      expert to commence surveying, no later than the end of 2015, the current
      livelihoods, expectations and problems (including alcohol and drug abuse) of
      newly married natural growth ethnic minority households in Sop Phene, Sop
      Ma, Nong Boua, and Phonsavang in order to use the information gained to plan
      and implement their training for committees, institutions, livelihood pillars and
      receipt of scholarships as mentioned under the previous recommendation.
      [Binding]
   50/24     The NRO monitoring unit design a more appropriate monitoring system
      for tracking the welfare of ethnic minority households from the four sample
      hamlets.
7.3.2 The Vietic-speaking Ahoe
        The Concession Agreement paid special attention to the Ahoe in Section 9.1.4 where
“Ethnic Minority Development Plans: include “relocation of Vietic or other vulnerable
groups into separate administrative village units with clearly demarcated boundaries and
rights to resources…”
      We set out below, as an introduction for those who may be unaware of the history of
POE’s involvement in Ahoe and other Vietic speakers’ issues, some brief excerpts and
comments from earlier POE Reports.
       2003: POE Report 6 (March 21).


                                                   53
        The POE’s first major reference to ethnic minorities was in this report where the POE
proposed that the Watershed Management Protection Authority (WMPA) Board include “a
representative from the Lao Front for National Construction granted the Front’s responsibility
for carrying out the Government’s 1992 Ethnic Minority Policy.” Justification for such an
appointment was the need to learn about “the economic potentials and comparative
advantages of Lao ethnic minority groups” involved in government projects as recommended
by Chamberlain in a 2002 report to the ADB. The relevance of that proposal remains just as
relevant today granted the relevance of the Vietic speakers’ biodiversity and cultural
knowledge to a range of development issues.
       2004 -2006: POE Report 7 (March 2).
         In this report the POE recommended “That Vietic speakers [on the Nakai Plateau]
have the option of their own Vietic Village.” This recommendation applied especially to
Nakai Plateau Ahoe living in Ban Sop Hia, Ban Nam Nian and Ban Nakai Tai. That
recommendation was favorably received at least by some high GOL officials but was never
implemented. According to the POE’s 10th Report (October 30, 2006), “Where the problem
lies is in NTPC and GOL’s failure to complete the necessary consultation in a timely fashion.
Part of the problem lies in NTPC’s delayed recruitment of an ethnic adviser.”
        Because the above situation and further delays were unacceptable, the POE
recommended that “the World Bank recruit an ethnic specialist no later than September 2006
to carry out the necessary consultations and to make recommendations based on those
consultations as to the siting of a Vietic village on the Nakai Plateau if so desired by Vietic
households and procedures for enabling those Vietic households who so desire to return to
the NPA.”
       2007: POE Report 11 (23 February 2007)
        In this report the POE recommended “that a permanent all Vietic village be
established at a location within their spirit territory acceptable to the concerned Vietic
households in [old] Ban Sop Hia. To avoid dam-related flooding, those households should be
moved temporarily uphill before the start of the 2007 rainy season. Such temporary
resettlement will allow the time necessary for identifying and assessing an acceptable site for
a permanent Vietic Village.”
        “After elaborate consultations, the large majority of Vietic households in Ban Sop Hia
have emphasized first, that they want to be resettled within their current spirit territory,
second, that they want their own Vietic village, third that temporary or permanent
resettlement in either Area 8 or Area 7 on the Nakai Plateau is unacceptable to them, and
fourth, that temporary resettlement above their current houses in [old] Sop Hia to avoid dam-
related flooding during 2007 is acceptable.”
        The wording of the Concession Agreement clearly states that the Government and
NTPC are obligated to accept the decision of a majority of the Sop Hia Vietic households as
outlined above. The Constitution of Lao PDR also is fully supportive of CA requirements.
For example, Articles 1, 2, 3, 8 and 22 emphasize the equality of all ethnic groups in the
political process and protect their rights to preserve and improve their cultures. More
specifically Article 8 prohibits discrimination against any ethnic group that divides the
group.”
       2009: POE Report 15 (30 April).
        Ignoring the requests of the Ahoe to be allowed to remain in Old Sop Hia just above
the reservoir when filled and in Khamkeut District rather than being resettled with the other

                                                  54
15 hamlets on the Nakai Plateau, the project authorities resettled the spiritual leader and
matriarch of the Ahoe, along with 13 other households, in a corner of New Nam Nian
overlooking the main road along which the 16 hamlets had been resettled.
      The Ahoe matriarch, however, refusing to remain in New Nam Nian, moved back to
Old Sop Hia with various relatives to look after her welfare.
       2010: POE Report 16 (25 February).
       Vietic Issues
       “Khamkeut and Nakai District officials, the RMU and NTPC have not provided CA
required attention to Vietic communities in spite of the POE, the LTA and the GOL IMA
drawing attention to this inadequacy in report after report. In their January 2010 Nakai
Resettlement Report, the IMA noted, for example, “that no training in ethnic sensitivity [as
required by the CA Schedule 4: 9.1.4] has been provided to the implementing agencies so no
supplementary training in this issue is found in the training planned” (Page 82).
       2010: POE Report 17 (22 November)
      The POE endorses the August 10 Report of the Consultant on Ethnic Minority
Support to the Nakai Resettlement Office. Especially important are Recommendations 2a and
2b.
       Recommendation 2a states that:
        “Ahoe villagers have a spiritual and ancestral connection to the old Sop Hia Site, and
they should be permitted to establish a permanent village there; the village should be
officially classified as a NNT NPA village, and accordingly NTPC and WMPA should
approach the issue of development and livelihoods in this settlement just as they would for
any other village in the NNT NPA, where the agreed upon emphasis is on balanced
conservation and development.”




                                 Aerial view of Old Sop Hia

      To comply with the intent of World Bank Guidelines for such Ethnic Minorities and
GOL’s NT2 Resettlement Policy to provide “special measures” for such people,

                                                   55
Recommendation 2a should be implemented to the extent that Ahoe who so wish can
maintain a permanent presence at the old Sop Hia Site.
       Recommendation 2b states that:
       “The WMPA should consider setting up a permanently staffed outpost at the old Sop
Hia Site to facilitate patrols and monitoring of the site itself and of the ‘surrounding’ corridor
area. This should be used as an opportunity to work closely together with Ahoe villagers, to
take advantage of their indigenous knowledge of WMPA activities, and to provide them with
relevant employment and training opportunities with WMPA and NTPC.”
7.3.3 POE’s current view
        By June 2015 the POE had come full circle on the Ahoe of Old Sop Hia. In our first
report (February 7, 1997) we noted that four of what were then 22 resettler villages (which
GOL first consolidated into 16 villages and then into 10 villages) requested to be resettled on
the north shore of the reservoir; that is, close to what was the pre-resettlement site of Old Sop
Hia. At that time we suggested that several gatekeeper villages on the north shore of the
reservoir warranted consideration “from a conservation as well as [a] socio-economic
standpoint.” Subsequently three of the four villages decided to join the other 18 villages to be
resettled on the reservoir’s south shore. The fourth village of Old Sop Hia was inhabited by
Ahoe who at the time lived in the Corridor over which the WMPA had jurisdiction. They
continued to request remaining at what was their current north shore site.
       The June 2015 death in Old Sop Hia of the Ahoe matriarch may have a bearing on
whether the large majority of current Old Sop Hia households would still prefer to return to
Old Sop Hia or make New Nam Nian their major residence so long as visitation (including
over-nighting) rights to Old Sop Hia remain.
       The POE recommends that:
   51/24     The right of the Ahoe to continue to live at Old Sop Hia be reaffirmed and
      Ahoe households surveyed as to their current preference for place of permanent
      residence. [Binding]
   52/24    Should the site of Old Sop Hia continue to be the Ahoe’s preference, all
      Ahoe resettled households who so desire be allowed to return to the current Old
      Sop Hia site with a WMPA office established there. [Binding]
        As mentioned in the section on fisheries, we have recommended the establishment of
an office at Old Sop Hia in the section on WMPA.
        Such an arrangement, if fully implemented, could be a “win-win” NT2 achievement
for three reasons. First, it would provide the WMPA with the first NT2 office to oversee
conservation and development issues in Khamkeut District’s portion of the NT2 reservoir.
Second, more specifically, it would strengthen the ability of the WMPA to work closely with
the resettlers’ Village Fisheries Groups, Reservoir Fisheries Association and Nakai District to
manage the reservoir fishery and to patrol the adjacent terrestrial portion and islands of the
Corridor. Third, it would restore the Ahoe’s rights under the Concession Agreement and the
Lao constitution to maintain their culture as well as to make available to the WMPA and
other GOL agencies their indigenous knowledge as its relates to the conservation and
development of the Nakai Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NNT-
NBCA).

7.4     VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS
        The CA emphasizes in several places that the vulnerable receive special attention
along with ethnic minorities and gender issues. Hence under 3 General Obligations of the
Parties, the parties agree under 3.1.(f) to “ apply special measures as required towards ethnic
minorities and vulnerable persons…” and under 3.2, that deals with implementing the
Resettlement Provisions, “(l) special consideration will be given to gender issues, vulnerable
households and ethnic minorities during detailed planning, design and implementation of the
social plans.”
        The major weakness of current documents is that they do not adequately recognize
that who the vulnerable are, and hence their number, can change through time throughout the
resettlement implementation process. Yet in April 2015 the number of vulnerable people had
changed little over the years (26 households in 20 families in 11 hamlets which is a
suspiciously small number). Initially emphasis was correctly placed on the elderly,
households with insufficient labor including incapacity of one or more adult members or
female headed households of widows or divorced elderly women. As the resettlement process
proceeds, however, a wider variety of households can be expected to meet Nakai District
government criteria for being vulnerable in addition to those mentioned in Annexure 2 of the
2015 Social Safety Net. Examples would include less educated and experienced ethnic
minorities as in Phonsavang, other previously isolated villages, and natural growth
households that have yet to receive arable land and/or other resettlement entitlements.
       This situation presents both an identification problem, the solution of which requires
adequate monitoring and adaptive management, and a budgetary problem in terms of district
funds for a larger number of vulnerable households. There is also a nomenclature problem in
NTPC documents where the vulnerable are separated from “lagging” households (see April
POE briefing under Social Monitoring which identifies “28 lagging hhs from three hamlets”)
and “high risk” households mentioned under the CLWP briefing.
        Neither the NTPC 2015 Annual Implementation Plan nor the NRO 22 April briefing
for the 18 April – 9 May 2015 POE visit deal adequately with the dynamics involved in “the
vulnerable” issue. The same is true with NTPC’s 2015 Social Safety Net report. According to
the AIP, formulation of a new safety net support system for the vulnerable had been handed
over to the district Social Welfare Office for preparing a new kinship system approach to be
tested during 2015. Though a new Social Safety Net report had been drafted during 2015,
such testing was not mentioned in the April 2015 briefing for the POE. Rather the
Community Living Well Program (CLWP) was implementing more restricted special health
and educational programs for the vulnerable as well as voluntary programs for village youth
and elders to provide physical help and counseling for 152 “high risk” households between
May 2014 and February 2015. Just recently the POE has learned that NTPC has a new
“special program for lagging households.” Provided that the emergence of such households
are identified and carefully monitored as possible vulnerable households, the new program
could play a major role in formulating and dealing with a more realistic definition of
vulnerable individuals and households now and in the future.
         The POE recommends that:
      53/24     GOL’s Social & Welfare Department with the assistance of NRO and
         RMU, develop by the end of the first quarter in 2016 a more expansive definition
         of vulnerable households and monitor high risk ethnic minority and lagging
         households that meet current agreed upon criteria of assistance in cash and/or
         kind (including possible hamlet kinship support).

7.5   IMPLEMENTING THE CA PROVISIONS ON GENDER
        The CA (Cl 9.1.5) requires that the “GOL and the Company shall ensure that at all
times during the Resettlement Implementation Period, the gender resettlement strategy
(“GRS”) and specific gender strategy plans are implemented.” (GOL and NTPC 2005). The
CA Clause lists 22 targets for a gender strategy. They are mostly process objectives and few
include explicit outcomes for improving women’s lives. We have focused here on targets
which go to women’s relative authority in the governance and planning of their hamlets and
villages and on their empowerment in the household.
        In the LOM the POE observes that “During the RIP there has been only limited
professional assessment of the implementation on the ground of the CA's comprehensive
gender policy provisions” and recommends “Implementation of the resettlement gender
strategy and of how specific gender strategy plans are assessed, as now agreed, by a NTPC
appointed gender specialist”. NTPC reports that the assessment has been completed and work
is “ongoing with follow up of recommendations of gender expert” and “POE to monitor”.
7.5.1 Assessment of strategy
       An assessment of the gender strategy was completed for NTPC in mid-2014 (Esser
2014). Some comments on the findings follow. The overall assessment gives a reasonably
favourable view of progress, but a more nuanced view of the findings suggests that village
women still have some distance to travel to play their full part in development decision-
making.
       The picture on gender balance in institutions is mixed. The report finds that most
Gender Balance Targets have been achieved but it appears that women still lag a long way
behind in influence in formal decision-making and positions of leadership. Women are a
small minority on most Village Authorities. They are 36% of the membership of the Village
Development Committees but men chair all the Committees. There are big improvements in
gender balance in the NRO but virtually no senior female staff.
        The Road Map draft sets the objective to “improve gender balance and empowerment
of women at all levels (district and villages)”. The focus is through the Community Living
Well Program. Issues are “[l]imited understanding and ownership of concerned district
authorities, entrenched traditional gender inequalities, limited education levels.” The draft
also reports a divergence of views on “Gender quotas vs qualified influence in decision-
making.” Translated, this reflects our concern that, while the numbers may have improved
somewhat, the opportunities for leadership have lagged behind.
        In the household economy, it appears that there have been some significant
improvements in women’s lives, particularly in significant reductions in women's workloads
due to improvements in infrastructure and household assets. Overall however it is not clear
that women have improved their relative position significantly in terms of control over
resources. Men remain in charge of the main resource-winning activities for the family, as is
clear from the different patterns of activities reported in the QSEM. In some respects,
resettlement may have actually reduced women’s access to natural resources, particularly in
the reduced opportunities for gathering NTFPs.
        It is not clear either that resettlement planning has yet made much difference to the
economic empowerment of women within the household. Although off-farm training has
been provided to help women expand their opportunities for new sources of income this has
rarely been translated into successful new businesses for women. That is why, elsewhere in

                                                  59
this report, we have recommended tailoring training opportunities more specifically to the
needs and wishes of women, and proposed further measures in small livestock, fish
processing and irrigation. It may also be that women are reluctant to borrow to make the
initial investment in business opportunities, which calls for attention in the management of
the VDFs. This sort of issue calls for further monitoring by trained professionals.
7.5.2 Hearing the voice
         A recurrent theme of our mission has been observation of whether women’s voices
are properly heard in the villages. In some meetings several women were outspoken and
vigorous contributors to the discussion, not least older women. In others, only one woman
would speak or sometimes none, although women usually outnumbered men in their
attendance at the meetings. Partly this may be a general reticence about speaking in front of
outsiders but it may also reflect a reluctance to challenge men directly in public meetings. It
is certainly clear from our less formal conversations with women that they are sharp and
perceptive about livelihoods and social conditions in their villages. Provided they can feel it
is safe to contribute, they often have perspectives which are very different from male
authority figures.
        As foreigners and male, the Panel members could not claim to fully understand Lao
women’s perspectives or situation. But it seems clear to us from the contacts we do have, and
the many reports we receive from Lao women, that there is still a long way to go before
women of the Plateau are enabled to play a full part in the governance and planning of their
villages. Simply getting more women onto village committees may not change this situation,
given that it is the result of longstanding values and beliefs in village society. But continuing
to increase women’s representation will give more women experience of participation in
village decision-making and, with the support and encouragement of the Lao Women’s Front
and other organisations, may eventually increase their role in village leadership.
       The POE accepts that, based on the partial progress in achievement of Gender
Balance Targets in the CA, implementing a gender strategy and plans, there has been
substantially improved compliance with the specific requirements of the CA on gender. It
however endorses further efforts to increase the proportion of women in village governance
and believes that there should be a greater focus specifically on preparing women for
leadership positions in villages.
       The POE recommends that:
   55/24      Support for women from outside organisations like the Lao Women’s
      Front focus on preparing them for positions of leadership in the hamlets and
      villages.
   56/24     As discussed elsewhere in this report, livelihood programs pay special
      attention to the specific income needs, wishes and talents of women.

       HANDING OVER
8.1   Introduction
        One of the most important components of the resettlement process, and one of the
least successfully completed world-wide, is the handing over of control from the project
authority to government and resettler institutions. At this point in time, NT2 risks joining that
large majority of global projects where handing over fails because GOL has not provided the
necessary budget and GOL and the resettlement hamlets have yet to have sufficient capacity
to maintain whatever institutional and livelihood development has occurred. The POE
considers that, in the context of a proposed formal release of the Company from its
responsibilities, there has to be stronger evidence that the District authorities and the
ten resettler villages are equipped and ready to embark on this handover process.
        The situation is unsatisfactory for two major reasons. First, because the budget and
capacity of district governments are so low that they have to rely on poorly paid volunteers to
carry out even routine tasks, let alone the more complex tasks as required for the community
resettlement process. No one is more aware of, or concerned by, this reality than the District
managers themselves. To be successful the hand over would require a GOL commitment over
the next two to three years at least.
        Secondly, to date the government has not carried out its undertakings to the IFIs
whereby various NT2 revenues “are to be used to finance eligible projects or GOL
obligations related to the Project”12. Granted the close linkage between the Nakai District
government and the 10 resettler administrative villages in completing the handing over
process, continued failure of the government to carry out its responsibilities will require
NTPC and the IFIs not just to extend significantly the length of the RIP, but also to increase
significantly their own involvement, staffing and budgets included, in order to further
improve resettler institutional capacity to manage their affairs as required by the CA.
        The need for increased NTPC and IFI involvement in the Nakai handing over process
warrants special emphasis at this point. The additional funds now to be available to NTPC
will help fund capacity building at both the District and Village level. An IFI input into
strengthening District agencies will certainly be called for as well.
8.2   District staffing and capabilities
         There is a major problem looming for the project as a whole if the District budget
monies, not yet approved, are not forthcoming. It is not exaggerating the situation to state that
without these resources the District will not be able to carry out adequately its new
responsibilities. District management itself is apprehensive about the outcome. The problem
is particularly acute in key sectors like fisheries and agriculture. DAFO does not have a
single fisheries expert on its staff even at this stage. Its extension service, a fundamental
requirement at this point in such a project, is staffed by underpaid volunteers with very little
field experience, yet their role in convincing farmers to adapt to new circumstances and
demands is crucial.
       The POE is aware of the country’s overstretched budgetary situation. Indeed it is a
contributory factor to the Panel’s decision to recommend an extension of the RIP. Our
thinking is that if the worst comes to the worst and the GOL is unable to fund the full cost of
the Handover then, subject to the views of the GOL itself and the approval of the NTPC, an

                                                        61
arrangement along the lines of the existing one whereby the GOL staff are co-located with
their NTPC counterparts, continue to work with them closely and are paid from NTPC
resources may be acceptable as an interim measure until the GOL is in a position to meet its
obligations. The POE does not wish to propose this temporary solution but would be prepared
to go along with it on an interim basis.
         The NRO, together with the Resettlement Management Unit and the District Working
Group (DWG), have put much time and effort into supporting both local government
institutions and new villagers’ institutions as well as the five pillars. Nonetheless, despite
measurable accomplishments, a recent institutional assessment concludes that “these
institutions will still require intensive capacity building at least through 2015, and then for
another two to three years beyond this to ensure greater sustainability of resettler
livelihoods.” (Gebert 2014).
         District officials are expected to begin to take over a number of responsibilities where
the NRO currently plays a large role: directly on support for livelihood development and
more generally with support for the community development model envisaged for the
resettler villages. Nevertheless, the blunt conclusion of the institutional assessment is that at
present the "gap between what the District can do with, and without, NRO support is very
large, indeed." If this handover was to get underway at the end of 2015, preparations to close
the gap should have been well underway by now. A step has been taken in the right direction
with the co-location of NRO and District officials, hopefully working in counterpart roles.
But we have received no comfort from either District or NTPC that they will be equipped to
start a handover by the end of this year. The risks to a successful handover remain great.
        If the Nakai District is to take over responsibility from the NRO, it will require both
more and better-trained staff. In 2014 the POE wrote, “Adequate ongoing funds and trained
staff [must be] allocated by GOL and NTPC to livelihood, institution and capacity building
programs to ensure their viability into 2015 and throughout the handover period and beyond”
and there must be a “systematic program of formal and informal upgrading courses and,
where required, recruitment of additional staff, during the balance of 2014 and into 2015”
(POE 2014a: Annex 1: 14-15).
         The District is approaching the GOL for a special quota of additional staff but with
little prospect of success. The GOL has made it clear that there is unlikely to be any increase
in the number of staff in key District roles such as extension work, community development
or community asset maintenance. District operating budgets also remain almost derisorily
small, again with little chance of being increased. The draft Road Map says also that capacity
building remains a major challenge, referring to “Lack of motivation”, “Lack of adequate
staff” and “Lack of skills.”
       The POE will continue to argue for increased funding and staffing for the District. But
the broad conclusion is that the District will be not be ready to assume full responsibility for
many of the functions now performed by the RMO for several years yet. Gebert’s conclusion
can be endorsed:
      NRO/NTPC – with the active support of RMU – will need to work out a longer
      handover period with the District that includes an intensive phase of support until the
      end of 2015, followed by at least two to three years of a transitional phase in which
      necessary processes are handed over to the District. (Gebert 2014:9).




                                                   62
8.3   The village and hamlet situation
         The implied expected outcome is that villagers are able to work together effectively
for the development of their hamlet. Villagers should have contributed to a Village
Development Plan, understand the activities it includes and agree with its priorities and that
its activities are making a valuable contribution to their well-being and to the village as a
whole.
       Similarly with the District situation, VDCs are being asked too soon to lead a
complex structure of village committees in all development activities and need intensive
support to perform their roles. Although NTPC believes that “VDCs [are] working well
[although] some need to be more representative on gender and minorities,” Gebert was less
optimistic than NTPC that the VDCs would be able to take a leadership role in village
development without “significant follow-up efforts”. The VDPs for 2016-20 were based on
one-day meetings between District staff and VDC members (and a few others) in
administrative villages. At our meetings in villages, some villagers were not clear that there
was a plan in place for 2016-2020.
        The resultant VDP has been described as a “21.7 billion kip wish list” of specific
requests on the District – which is most unlikely anyway to be fully funded by the GOL. The
process of developing it certainly does not seem firmly based on a detailed discussion among
villagers themselves, with representation of all groups, of how they would best like to use
their land and other resources to support their preferred mix of livelihoods.




                 Village Development Committee and POE, Phonsavang

         NTPC’s Road Map does not directly address the findings in Gebert 2014 but
implicitly assumes that future village planning will require a lot of external support. The
Road Map proposes setting up a District program implementation committee and hiring an
expert program manager, with donor support, and strengthening the capacity of District staff
and of the VDCs themselves to manage implementation. In practice, this proposal suggests
that village planning will continue to be driven from outside the villages themselves which
would be undesirable, even if the District had the capacity after handing over, because
ultimately the villagers need to be responsible for managing their own affairs.

                                                  63
8.4     How coherent a structure?
        The plans for livelihood development, maintenance of common assets and
management of common property resources have consistently assumed a model of
development based on village self-government built around a number of specific groups –
particularly on fishing, forestry, water use and micro-finance – under the overall leadership of
the VDC. As a result, village governance seems to the outsider to be a complex structure of
interlocking committees and groups including the Village Authority, the VDC and its sub-
committees, and specific functional groups including the VDF and LMC, together with local
representatives of the Party and mass organizations such as the Lao Women’s Union and Lao
Youth Front. We were assured by Lao officials that it is a coherent structure and that
everybody understands their roles in it. That seems unlikely to the POE given how short a
time the system has been in place. We suspect that its effectiveness will depend on strong
leadership from the VDC and that this leadership in turn will require ongoing support from
the appropriate District departments. For planning matters, this is the DRDPEO, which at
present is severely understaffed and underfunded.
         The POE recommends that:
      57/24    GOL make available substantial additional funds for implementing the
         government’s management, capacity building and wider support requirements
         during the NT2 Handing Over Process. [Binding]
      58/24      NTPC and the IFIs maintain their support roles in helping strengthen the
         ability of the villagers to manage their own affairs. [Binding]
8.5     Strengthening the Resettlement Management Unit (RMU)
       Under CA Article 6: Implementation, the Resettlement Committee “will instruct the
Resettlement Management Unit.” (6.1). GOL through the RMU “shall be responsible for: (i)
coordinating the planning and implementation of the resettlement process jointly with the RO
[NTPC Resettlement Office]; (ii) jointly with the RO, the day to day management of the
Resettlement Process in accordance with the general policies and specific directions of the
Resettlement Committee; … (v) managing the designated GOL implementation budget for
the Resettlement Process; (vi) obtaining and allocating operational budgets to the DWGs, and
through them to Project Affected Persons”; as well as carrying out 13 other important tasks.
        In recent years the RMU has been unable, first at the expense of Xe Bang Fai
Downstream Program project affected people and now at the expense of Nakai resettlers as
well, to carry out the above critical functions because of receiving delayed and inadequate
annual budgets and support from the Central Government. This is an issue which the POE
has continued, without success, to bring to the attention of the Central Government as well as
to the Khammouane Provincial Government.
        Hence in the POE’s 2011 report, the first item on handing over dealt with
strengthening “both the coordination and budgeting role of the Resettlement Management
Unit.” (POE 2011: Part B, Section 2.3.1). Inadequate RMU funding was again emphasized in
Report 22 quoting a section of the draft LOM that stated under “Issues: Where CA requires
the setting up of institutions like the RMU, adequate funding to carry out their RIP
responsibilities is essential.” (POE 2014a:23).
       In sum, the CA expects the RMU to be the main GOL institution working with the
RO and the Nakai resettlers to ensure that stakeholders plan and implement a sustainable
Nakai resettlement process during the RIP. For this requirement to occur, the POE is not
recommending that the RMU be fully reconstituted as in the past. Rather that its staff be

                                                  64
restricted to a relatively small number of personnel whose skills are relevant to the
completion of the RIP and to the Handing Over Process. Hence it is essential that GOL at
Central, Provincial and District levels give RMU Manager Sivixay full support to work
closely on a full time basis with the NTPC Environment and Social Manager throughout the
RIP.
        Furthermore, as was expected in the case of the XBF Downstream Program (but not
implemented because of inadequate GOL support and budget), the RMU should continue to
be the main GOL coordinating agency throughout the handing over process to Nakai District.
Since the handing over process will continue beyond the end of the RIP, so too should the
RMU continue to be the key GOL agent providing budgetary support to the Nakai District
Office (especially weak sections of DAFO and the DWG) and to key aspects of resettler
training such as irrigation WUAs under the agriculture pillar and Village Land Management
Committees.
         The POE recommends that:
      59/24     The RMU be reconstituted as a functional organization with the
         necessary staff and budget to carry out during the remainder of the RIP, and
         during the Handing Over process, the most important functions listed under
         Article 6.1. [Binding]
      60/24     Full time staff include, in addition to irrigation specialists, specialists who
         can work with improving District and Village Land Management Committees,
         and such additional staff as recommended during RMU meetings with the Nakai
         District Governor and the NTPC E and S manager.
      61/24     The RMU’s functions continue throughout the Handing Over Process at
         the end of which the RMU will be disbanded.
8.6     NRO staffing and budgeting
        Because of the critical importance of staff continuity, the POE was concerned to read
in the 2015 AIP that nine NRO officers had resigned during 2014 including two agricultural
officers as well as one fisheries and two livestock officers. Though all had been replaced, it is
not so easy to replace the experience of those who resigned. The POE suspects that one
reason for resignations was the expectation of at least some staff that the RIP would end by
December 2015. In that case, future staff continuity may remain a serious problem.
         The POE recommends that:
      62/24     NTPC pay special attention in the future to developing conditions of
         service, such as contracts extending to the end of an extended RIP and bonuses
         for completing such contracts, that will help in reducing the problem of staff
         turnover.
      63/24     NTPC provide sufficient budget, trained extension staff and consultancy
         services to ensure that resettler productivity and use of available land and water
         resources can continue to increase on an annual basis until and beyond the end
         of the RIP. [Binding]

    SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF CA OBJECTIVES AND
PROVISIONS
9.1   Advice in previous POE Reports
        The summary of achievement of sustainability in livelihoods (section 6 above) is
incomplete in that it does not cover CA Objectives other than livelihood promotion nor the
accompanying CA Provisions. Since reviewing these measures is also important in the
present assessment we summarize implementation of the latter requirements here. Reference
should again be made to the annexed quotes from relevant clauses of the CA document and to
fuller details in the body of this report, including the section on cross-cutting issues.
        The POE should explain that it does not intend to traverse ground already covered
extensively in its earlier reports. Other reports have adjudged that the Provisions covering the
setting up of Regional and Resettlers’ Health Programs have been met in full, the Programs
having been an outstanding success and models of their kind. The company has also
supported, for example, the PLUP process by which the initial allocation of land to resettlers
was accomplished. There is no case for revisiting such elements of the project at this stage
though this report does suggest that a further look at the land allocation process – taking
greater account of soils and topography, for example - may be merited in the case of
additional lands now being distributed to both the original resettlers and the natural growth
households. Similarly, the POE retains reservations about aspects of the Downstream
Program outcomes and will address these further in later reports.
9.2   Summarised findings
       These clarifications made, we summarize our findings and conclusions on some major
remaining CA Objectives and Provisions as follows:
          The POE accepts that the Household and Village Income Targets in the CA
           have been met though with more enthusiasm for the latter. The Panel has serious
           reservations about the methodology employed in the calculations, the use of
           consumption rather than reported income in the survey and the legality and
           sustainability of some income-generating activities.
           The POE accepts that the standard of work on the many infrastructure
           requirements in the CA has been generally of a high standard, notably in
           housing. There remain relatively minor problems in ensuring the durability of
           project roading in the wet season and consistent water supplies in the villages and
           a more substantial problem in completing the irrigation systems for dry season
           cultivation and ensuring that the resettlers make use of this new technology.
          The POE is of the view that a variety of reasons have contributed to a failure on
           the part of NT2 stakeholders to fully apply CA requirements to the advancement
           and equitable treatment of ethnic minority resettlers, including the effect of
           the GoL’s village consolidation policy, NTPC’s lack of expertise in addressing the
           sensitive social problems involved in such work and the deficiencies of the
           project’s training and capacity building components aimed at ethnic minorities.
          The POE recognizes that NTPC has accomplished useful work in giving the
           vulnerable special attention and help over the years, as required by the CA. There
           remain, however, identification, monitoring and budgetary problems at the
           District level and these need addressing given the prospect that the numbers of
           vulnerable are likely to rise in the years ahead.
          The POE is encouraged by the progress made in recent months in seeking
           solutions to the long running debate over which CA benefits the natural growth

                                                  66
           households are entitled to receive. The high level of agreement attained is
           gratifying but identifying and distributing fairly the land for agriculture and house
           plots is a demanding task, as is determining the total number of households
           legitimately to be included in the process. Translating the agreements at an early
           point into action on the ground is a priority issue for the POE.
          The POE supports the reasonably favorable assessment of the NTPC consultant
           in 2014 on implementation of the resettlement gender strategy and plans but
           agrees that women still lag a long way behind in being in a position to influence
           formal decision-making and to exercise leadership in the villages. This report also
           suggests ways in which women would be enabled to play a wider role in both
           governance and the economic activities of the resettlement villages and their
           households.
          The POE acknowledges that “traditional organizational structures, religious
           beliefs and resource use” have been largely recognized and respected by the
           stakeholders and where there has been a need to move or replace structures this
           has been done with sensitivity.
          It is not so apparent that “utilizing local knowledge in developing production
           systems that suit the Resettlers’ needs and environment and which results in a
           self-sustained livelihood” has been followed. The prolonged delay in setting up
           viable village institutions including the VDCs has meant that the opportunity for
           substantive villager input into the development planning cycles has been
           negligible until the past two years or so. The planning processes are still only at a
           rudimentary stage. This has been a contributory factor to the POE’s
           recommendation to extend the RIP. The VDCs must be fully involved in MTDP
           planning and implementation.
          The POE’s finding – backed up strongly by NTPC’s own authoritative consultant
           - is that the handing over process, a key part of a development project like NT2,
           is quite inadequately prepared at this stage. It is clear that the District authorities
           have neither the human nor financial resources to handle the responsibilities
           which will devolve upon them when the RIP is declared closed and the villages
           and hamlets are, like the District management, apprehensive about a premature
           handing over process. They are not equipped nor ready to take this next and
           decisive step.
          The POE is of the view that to be running down the funding and staffing of the
           key GoL Unit – the Resettlement Management Unit – at this time is an unwise
           and untimely move. The CA accords this Unit a special place in the resettlement
           and handing over process. It needs reconstitution as a functional outfit with the
           necessary staff and budget to carry on for the remainder of the RIP and beyond
           into the handing over phase.

9.3   Conclusion on extension of RIP
       The POE’s conclusion is that the several key aspects of the CA’s Objectives and
Provisions which have been found wanting in the summary above underline the conclusions
reached in regard to achievement of the CA’s requirements relating to livelihood
sustainability, notably that the project and the resettlers would benefit from an extension of
the RIP by a further two years. Reference should be made to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 above,
together with their recommendations, for a spelling out of the extension case and what
follows thereafter. There are serious deficiencies in implementation thus far of other key
Objectives and Provisions like advancement of ethnic minorities, providing project benefits

                                                   67
especially land to the natural growth households and not least the substantial further
strengthening of District and village institutions and the reconstitution of the RMU. Many of
these exercises cannot be brought to anywhere near completion in the next three months, for
they are time and resource intensive activities. A further two years of work is required before
closure of the RIP can realistically be contemplated.

    IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANNING, FUNDING, TIMING AND
MONITORING
        Clearly the implications of the above conclusions and recommendations are
substantial. All parties are involved in an extension of the RIP; in a change of approach to
fostering development; in detailed planning stretching over two decades; and in the extension
of additional funding for the project until the end of the Concession Period. All of these
changes will call for hard decision-making, adaptive management, and much political will on
the part of the main parties to the CA.
        There will also be a need for careful planning of how to present to the public the
significance of the extension of the RIP and the maintenance of funding. Certainly most
aspects of the new departures are good news and should be portrayed and seen as such.
        At the same time it should be recognized that these several and parallel actions are
also a recognition of reality. Whether or not the RIP was to be ended on 1 January 2016, the
situation on the Plateau will not change. Thus, for example, the challenges of making a living
on thin and infertile soils and on slopes, largely distant from accessible water sources, are
many and demand considerable adaptations of customary agricultural techniques and the
acceptance of new technologies and new attitudes by the resettlers.
         The associated challenge of the District, village and hamlet institutions being able to
handle the handover of big responsibilities with quite inadequate resources will remain. None
of this situation will change overnight if there were to be a change of status of the RIP. The
present unsustainability of four of the five pillars would still be there and hence, in the firm
view of the POE and others, the CA procedures for extension of the RIP will come into play
and the RIP should be extended for two years.
        This is supported implicitly at least by the main parties involved. There is a consensus
among stakeholders that much more needs to be done to complete the resettlement tasks set
out in the CA. Thus, the draft Road Map, supported by all parties, records that only a third of
the forty or so resettlement activities yet to be completed are expected to be so completed by
the end of 2016 and many of the other planned activities will not be completed until several
years beyond that. Under the CA they must be not only achieved but “ maintained for a
reasonable period of time" afterwards. (See CA Sched.4, Part 1, para.5.3 (b)).
10.1 New procedures and mechanisms
        It must also be said that making up the leeway in the struggle towards sustainability of
the livelihood pillars is now being addressed – with the exception, as already underlined, of
the village forestry sector. The planning procedures, the mechanisms for plan implementation
– the NT2 Development Fund (NT2DF), and the Medium Term Development Program
(MTDP), as far as it goes - and the undertakings regarding new approaches to development
and long-term funding are currently being thought out.
        Subject to adequate provision being made for enhanced representation of villagers at
all levels of decision-making and administration - and adequate representation of women at
all levels - the Panel is impressed with much of the substance of the proposals in the draft
MTDP. There is an urgent need to involve not only the resettlers but the other stakeholders,
notably the IFIS, in this fundamentally important planning process. The POE largely supports
the contents and direction of the MTDP as far as it goes but awaits an update and further
development by an expanded group of stakeholders. The Panel would question, as it did at
the Working Group, the need for three draft plans at this juncture – the LOM, the Road Map
and the MTDP. The first two are essentially an amalgam already and should be merged into

                                                  69
the MTDP. Incorporation of annual updates and five year reviews to coincide with the
national planning cycle would presumably be involved.
10.2 Inadequate District budget and the NT2DF
         The POE does have a comment or two on the workings and scope of the NT2DF.
First, we have had the opportunity to comment on the need for village level representation –
beyond Naibans – at the decision-making level in the new Fund’s structure. Beyond this
institutional aspect there is, as set out in the Handover section above, a major financial
problem looming for the project as a whole if the District budget monies, not yet approved
and apparently unlikely to be, are not forthcoming.
        It is not exaggerating the situation to state that without these resources the District
will not be able to carry out adequately its new responsibilities. No one is more aware of this
probability than the District management itself. They are apprehensive about the outcome.
The problem is particularly acute in key sectors like fisheries and agriculture. DAFO does not
have a single fisheries expert on its staff even at this stage. Its extension service, a
fundamental requirement at this point in such a project, is staffed by underpaid volunteers
with very little field experience, yet their role in convincing farmers to adapt to new
circumstances and demands is crucial.
        The POE is not unaware of the country’s overstretched budgetary situation. Indeed, it
is a contributory factor to the Panel’s decision to recommend an extension of the RIP. What if
GoL is unable to fund the full cost of the Handover? Then an arrangement along the lines of
the existing one whereby GoL staff are co-located with their NTPC counterparts, and
continue to work with them closely, may be acceptable as an interim measure until the GoL is
in a position to meet its obligations. Obviously adequate NTPC staff would have to be
maintained and paid by the Company in the meantime, perhaps from NT2DF resources.
        The POE does not wish to formally propose this temporary solution but would be
prepared to go along with it on an interim basis. It would also serve the utilitarian purpose of
not losing trained Lao NTPC staff from the project and might well provide a device for their
long-term retention by the GoL itself, again a desirable outcome.
        On a wider level the Panel is proposing that the scope of the NT2 Development Fund
not to be made too restrictive in general about what it can finance and how it can operate.
With a planned life over two decades the Fund will face an evolving set of needs, not all of
which may be foreseen at this stage.
       The POE recommends that:
   64/24     The new NT2 Development Fund’s terms of reference and scope generally
      not be made too inflexible, at least in the initial years of its existence, and that it
      not be precluded, for example, from funding initially the provision of
      counterpart workers on the GoL side should that prove necessary.
10.3 Getting the right people in place
         The POE has welcomed the new thinking about how to further stimulate local
initiatives and new ventures in the villages and hamlets – the so-called bottom up approach.
We see this as an essential approach which may prove a more effective way of identifying
new thinking and new talent in the villages. We would, on the basis of experience elsewhere,
make the case for very careful recruitment of the people who are to manage this process. The
same consideration applies also to recruiting those who will help train the villagers in the
range of administrative and management skills to actively manage a truly community-based
village forestry input.
                                                   70
        It is not often effective in such cases to recruit people who are competent in their own
fields but have had no experience of working in small and remote hamlets like those on the
Nakai Plateau. Those who have made the adjustment to village conditions, and have some
understanding of village attitudes toward development tasks, can be doubly effective
compared with those without this level of understanding. To give one example, there are
some highly experienced and well-adjusted people working on communal forestry projects in
Vietnam. It would be worthwhile turning to them for sources of expertise in this work rather
than bringing in foresters from developed countries with little overseas background to help
introduce Nakai villagers to communal forest management.
       The POE recommends that:
   65/24      In implementing the new “bottom-up” approach to stimulating new
      ventures and initiatives in the villages on the Plateau the NTPC pay special
      attention to recruiting advisors who are experienced in fostering development in
      small and remote rural villages, are prepared to live and work in the villages,
      and understand how to help motivate and build self-reliance among the
      resettlers.
10.4 Review of monitoring
        The final point to be made is that monitoring of the project in the years ahead calls for
the maintenance, indeed the upgrading, of the overall monitoring operation. It is not
inaccurate to say that with better quantitative and qualitative monitoring in place years earlier
than was the case, the socio-economic side of the project would have progressed faster and
more surely. The POE has made the point before that effective monitoring is a major adaptive
management tool on a complex multipurpose development project like NT2. It took too long
to put an improved system in place – and its utility has often been ignored by the major
parties. This year alone, for example, it would have been extremely useful to have had an
LSMS survey undertaken in order to further inform, and help track progress, in a key period
of the project’s life. There has in addition arguably been too much monitoring of the project
by too many agencies. That has often diverted time and energy from implementation. So
some streamlining is called for. The monitoring process also needs further strengthening and
enhanced relevance to the needs of management and the villagers themselves. We cannot
recall having seen in seventeen years a Lao language version of monitoring reports in the
hands of a villager. So the reports are not getting to people who need to see them. These
deficiencies need correcting.
      The POE recommends that, in addition to the Household and Village monitoring
recommendations:
   66/24     At this stage in the evolution of the NT2 project, a review of the level and
      relevance of all monitoring work on the project be undertaken by stakeholders,
      covering all agencies involved, including the IFIs, the POE, the LTA and the
      GoL IMA.

        WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION AUTHORITY
         As the POE and others have repeatedly emphasized, the successful management and
protection of the biological and social diversity of the Nakai-Nam Theun Watershed area and
National Protected Area is essential to the success of the NT2 Project as a whole. As such it
is critical to the sustainability of the livelihoods of the resettlers. To assure the success of this
endeavor the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA) was created in an
attempt to set up an innovative conservation organization that would have a special status
within the GoL and would serve as a model.
       Unfortunately it was staffed and managed as a normal GoL agency and has not
achieved its special status or success. Because of the extremely serious problems with
WMPA (see POE Report 22) GoL created a Task Force to restructure the organization. The
POE has met with the Secretariat of the Task Force both on its 23rd mission in 2014 and the
present mission in 2015.




                            Fires on the Nam On inside the WMPA

11.1 Critical tasks
        A critical initial task of the Task Force is to clearly define a new role and functions
for the WMPA, because these will determine what capabilities and positions will be required
for the restructured staff. The Secretariat must then develop new terms of reference for all
staff accordingly. The initial work of the Secretariat includes advertising and selecting
candidates to replace the present staff and recommending needed changes to PM Decree 471.
        All the present WMPA staff are to resign, with the ability to reapply for WMPA
positions except for the director, deputy directors and, according to the Secretariat, “all those
involved in and accustomed to the current financial structure.” The Secretariat has already
advertised the top positions and created a selector group including representatives of NTPC
and three international environmental NGOs working in Laos. Ultimately all positions will be
advertised and candidates selected since getting the right people in the right places is


                                                     72
fundamental to successful restructuring. There should be a probationary period for all new
staff to see that they are qualified and perform their duties well.
        At the time of the POE visit, only 20 candidates had applied, four for the top position.
Because of the importance of the director to the success of the restructured WMPA, the POE
has strongly recommended that the application period be extended and the position be widely
advertised, to try to obtain the most qualified applicants. It appears desirable to have only one
deputy director from the standpoint of management efficiency. It is also economically
desirable because salaries and expenses of the past directors and deputy directors have been
responsible for an inordinately large proportion of the WMPA budget.
        The WMPA was originally created to have a special status and to be of particularly
high national importance, but until now it has not been managed to achieve that. In this
regard the POE welcomes the stated strong and active interest of Deputy Prime Minister
Asang Laoly in the restructuring. We are also pleased to see the reported reassignment of the
chairmanship of the WMPA Board to the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment.
The WMPA should become a model for protected area management combining environment
and development, for the Lao PDR and for other nations worldwide.
11.2 Reconstituted Board
        In order to provide technical capacity and broader experience with protected areas the
POE strongly recommends that the reconstituted WMPA Board of Directors include at least
two outside members, preferably from international environmental NGOs in Laos, the
university, and/or international organizations active in Laos. If the Board is chaired at
ministerial level the Lao tradition is that the Board members will not oppose the authority of
the chair. Consequently there should be arrangements for the Board to have internal
discussions, possibly through technical committees, leading to provision of advice to the
chairman. To effectively oversee the WMPA secretariat and provide closer monitoring and
input to it, the Board should meet relatively frequently, several times a year.
        Until the new structure and staff are in place the Task Force should assign one of their
members to supervise the WMPA to make sure that the current activities follow the work
plan, and should have a senior fiduciary advisor to secure proper use of the WMPA funds,
since the WMPA currently still has the same people in place as in the past when the problems
were created.
11.3 An independent IMA and partnerships
       The Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA) for WMPA should be appointed and paid
by the Board of Directors, not by the WMPA Secretariat, and should be given adequate time
and resources on its visits to monitor the WMPA activities thoroughly.
        We recommend that the WMPA seek to establish an ongoing partnership or other
relationship with a qualified international NGO, like the Wildlife Conservation
Society(WCS). On its research side the WMPA should also seek such a relationship with the
National University of Laos and with appropriate NGOs such as Analouk.
11.4 Further Revise Decree 471
       There are several important changes required in the revised Decree 471. For example,
the decree should cement in place WMPA’s special status. Also, WMPA should be
responsible for the conservation and protection work in the watershed while District staff,
primarily DAFO, would handle the development work. For this work DAFO would report to
WMPA, and WMPA management must define the work and oversee the implementation.

                                                   73
        The decree should also clarify the relationships between Khamkeut and Nakai
Districts on the reservoir, and deal with the issues of fishing use by resettlers in the reservoir
area north of the Thalang peninsula and adjacent to the villages.(See further proposals in this
regard in the section of this report on fisheries.) It should also establish procedures for arrests,
confiscations (without return to previous owners), fines, etc. and establish the rules for
prosecution and role of the courts. The decree should specify the Board makeup and
procedures, as noted above.
       The POE recommends that:
   67/24     The application period for the new WMPA director be extended and the
      position be widely advertised, to try to obtain the most qualified applicants.
   68/24     The reconstituted WMPA Board of Directors include at least two outside
      members, preferably from international environmental NGOs in Laos, the
      university, and/or international organizations active in Laos.
   69/24     The Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA) for WMPA be appointed and
      paid by the Board of Directors, not by the WMPA Secretariat, and be given
      adequate time and resources on its visits to monitor the WMPA activities
      thoroughly.
   70/24     The WMPA seek to establish an ongoing partnership or other
      relationship with a qualified international NGO, and establish research
      partnerships with the National University and appropriate NGOs.
   71/24      The WMPA, with Khamkeut DONRE involvement, be authorized to
      establish a permanently staffed outpost at the Old Sop Hia site, whose duties
      would include working closely with the resettlers’ Reservoir Fishery Association,
      Village Fishery Groups, and Nakai District to manage, protect and patrol the
      reservoir fishery between the dam and the upper Nam On and to patrol the
      adjacent terrestrial portion and islands of the Corridor. [Binding]

ANNEX I: SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS AND ADVICE ON RIP CLOSURE
       The POE’s analysis and advice
        In its 24th Report, the POE has recommended an extension of the Resettlement
Implementation Period (RIP) for two years to December 2017, with a review and decision on
further extension before that date. The Report recommends actions that should be taken with
a view to achieving closure by the end of 2017.
        This Annex to Report No 24 summarises the analysis in that report on achievement of
the conditions necessary for closure of the Resettlement Implementation Period, and suggests
some indicators that the conditions have been met and the actions in the report recommended
specifically to attain these conditions.
        Under the Concession Agreement, the GoL shall engage the POE at least six months
before the end of the expiry of the intended Resettlement Implementation Period to analyse
the activities performed during the RIP and report on whether the Resettlement Objectives
and Provisions have been achieved. The GoL may also require that the Company implement
the POE’s recommendations designed to achieve the Objectives and Provisions.
       The Table is not a comprehensive analysis of achievement of all the Objectives and
Provisions. Section 9.1 of the main Report identifies those requirements of the Objectives and
Provisions which the POE has discussed in previous reports, and which it considers have
been met. This Table summarises matters discussed in this report that are still require action.
       Nor is the Table a comprehensive inventory of everything in the report: it is confined
to matters which, in the POE’s view, are material to closure and to the recommendations
which intends to be binding in terms of the CA.
       Organisation of the Table
        The Table is organized vertically as a series of topics for analysis (having regard to
this “exceptions” approach) and horizontally into achievements, risks, targets for 2017, and
recommendations.
   Achievements: key points from the discussion in the text of progress towards fulfilment
    of the CA conditions.
   Risks: a summary of the POE’s conclusions on what issues need to be addressed if the
    conditions are to be met.
   Outcomes for 2017: some largely qualitative statements of what would give the
    stakeholders reasonable comfort that the conditions of the CA will be met.
   Recommendations: the recommendations summarized in the table are those in the main
    report which the POE considers are most important for the achievement of the CA
    conditions. The table includes cross-references to the relevant recommendations and
    supporting analysis in the main body of the report.

       and
       (b) analyse whether the Resettlement Objectives and Resettlement Provisions have
       been achieved in accordance with this Part.
       2.4 If the Company is unable to demonstrate to the Panel of Experts that the
       Resettlement Objectives and Resettlement Provisions have been achieved in
       accordance with this Part, the GoL may require that:

9 Livelihood Development: Planning Stage
Planning for sustainable livelihoods
“9.1.1 The parties will plan and implement the livelihood program with the objective of
ensuring that beneficiaries are able to derive a reliable income by engaging in activities that
are within their capacity, taking into account the availability of resources on the Nakai
Plateau and the type of enterprises that they are already engaged in, and thereby contribute to
achievement of the Household Income Targets, the Village Income Targets, the Resettlement
Objectives and the Resettlement Provisions.” (GoL and Company)
Protection of Resettler forest and fisheries rights
“9.1.2 The GoL will take appropriate steps to ensure that: the forest resources in the
Resettlement Area are for the exclusive use and benefit of the plateau Resettlers for seventy
(70) years from the establishment of the NPVFA; and • the fisheries resource in the Reservoir
(and trading of that resource) will be for the exclusive benefit of the Plateau Resettlers, those
currently fishing in the inundation zone (and their respective descendants) for a period of ten
(10) years after the Commercial Operations Date and after that period, consideration will be
given to granting other parties right but after consultation with and having due regard to the
Resettlers’ need.” (GoL)
Mitigating development risks for ethnic minorities and vulnerable households
“9.1.4 The GoL and the Company shall ensure that at all times during the Resettlement
Implementation Period, appropriate steps are taken to mitigate against the additional risks to
ethnic minority groups and vulnerable households and will ensure that plans addressing the

ANNEX III: NTPC COMMENTS ON SUSTAINABILITY AND PARTICIPATORY
DEVELOPMENT: POE RESPONSE
       Introduction
        In its response to the POE’s draft Report no 24, the Company made a number of
specific comments, which we have addressed as appropriate in the edit of this final report. It
also made some more general comments on its interpretation of the POE’s position on
“sustainability” and “participatory development”. As this general discussion goes
fundamentally to two of the central concepts in the CA and the development process on the
plateau, we respond specifically to it here.
       Timeline of sustainability
       NTPC position
       “Report 24 defines ‘sustainable’ as an end point state and assesses resettled
communities on whether they have arrived at that end point of the process, not whether they
are undergoing a development process that has a sustainable basis”.
        In contrast, according to NTPC: “The CA clearly indicates that the RIP closure is to
be assessed NOT on the achievement of end point sustainability, but on the implementation
of a development process that has a sustainable basis. The CA clearly does not require
communities to have achieved complete sustainability within the RIP, but requires that the
process the communities undertake has a sustainable basis, as against a non-sustainable
basis.”
        NTPC considers that “development is an evolutionary process” on which the resettler
community has only recently embarked and that “a more logical expectation would be that
the resettled communities have achieved the CA income goals and, within the bounds of
current knowledge, have been equipped with the basic skills that will help the communities
attain a sustainable future.”
       POE response
       The POE’s task for this report was to “analyze whether the Resettlement Objectives
and Provisions spelled out in the CA have been achieved in accordance with the CA, and
make a recommendation to the GOL accordingly on whether the RIP should be ended in
December 2015 or extended for a designated period”.
        Under the Concession Agreement, the Resettlement Objectives include to “(c)
materially improve Resettler livelihoods on a sustainable basis”. We do not see any
ambiguity in that: to enable closure of the RIP, one of the conditions is that livelihoods of
Resettlers must have been materially improved on a sustainable basis. We cannot find any
significant qualification of that criterion in the CA. Furthermore, it is not “the development
process” that is required to have a sustainable basis, but the material livelihoods of the
resettlers.
        The argument turns on what “a sustainable basis” for material livelihoods means. We
have suggested some general criteria for sustainability in the report but our specific
recommended conditions recognise that it is a matter of judgement based on observations of
activity on the Plateau. In the Table attached to the Report we include some observable
outcomes: “largely qualitative statements of what would give the stakeholders reasonable
comfort that the conditions of the CA will be met”. The emphasis is on “reasonable comfort”:
not that there must be certainty that the future material livelihoods of the Resettlers will be


                                                  91
resilient to all conceivable shocks but that the conditions for “a sustainable basis” are more
likely than not to be in place.
       The appropriate basis for argument is therefore not a general definition of “a
sustainable basis”, but what it would look like in each relevant field of Resettler activity.
       Participatory development
       NTPC position
      The POE’s definition of “sustainability” implies the “imposition on resettled
communities of benchmark standards” and that many POE recommendations “make
assumptions as to what the resettlers need or want, now and in the future”;
        This definition and these recommendations are contrary to the principles of
participatory development, which both have “overwhelming acceptance by development
practitioners” and are specified by the CA.
        “By recommending the extension of the RIP, the POE is delaying the point at which
the resettled communities and the GoL take over full responsibility for managing and
resourcing their development plans.”
       POE response
       We welcome the NTPC’s acknowledgement that the development process on the
plateau ought to be on a participatory basis. The delays in setting up the Village Development
Committees and involving them in a substantive way in drawing up Village Development
Plans postponed such participation for too long.
       The principle of self-governance and self-development by Resettlers does not
proscribe extensive advice and assistance for villagers to help them take charge of their own
development. It also requires a legal and institutional framework for the protection of the
commons and property rights and support for village institutions.
        It is evident from the POE’s own discussions with villagers that by and large the
Resettlers value the assistance and support they receive from the Company and believe quite
strongly that it must continue for some time in the future. Senior GoL officials on the plateau
share this view - indeed they express apprehension at the prospect of a handover for which
they believe neither they nor the villagers have adequate resources or expertise.
        We agree that all our recommendations should be discussed with the Resettlers and
subject to their endorsement. A good start would have been to have included representatives
of the Resettlers in the planning meetings of the last several years attended by the POE. No
such representation occurred. It would certainly be useful now to ensure that this POE report
is translated immediately into the Lao language, is widely circulated in the villages and is
freely discussed at village meetings.
       Conclusion
       NTPC position
     The CA does not envisage that “absolute sustainability” should be achieved by
December 2015.
        The interpretation of “sustainable” should take into account that the implementation
of the provisions of the CA will be supported by the long-term commitment of the NTPC
shareholders to the NT2 Development Fund.
       The main CA targets have been met.

                                                   92
        Additionally, “MDG measurements on the Nakai Plateau are positive and confirm
that the Nakai Plateau is better than the national average for 10 out of 11 indicators”.
       POE response
       The expressions “absolute sustainability”, "entirely sustainable” and “complete
sustainability” used in the NTPC paper to depict the POE’s position on sustainability do not
appear in the POE text. It is to set up straw men to suggest that they do.
        The POE is not arguing that a golden age of sustainability must be reached before
closure of the RIP, only that there must be evidence that, on the balance of probabilities, it is
likely to be attained.
        The POE welcomes the commitment of the shareholders to the long-term
development of the plateau in the form of the NT2DF following closure of the RIP but in the
light of the above, considers that there is a prior legal commitment of the parties to the CA to
ensure that the Objectives and Provisions of the CA have been met.
       While it is encouraging to see that in many respects the Nakai Plateau is doing better
than average on most MDG indicators, the CA incorporates specific objectives which are the
standard by which development on the Plateau is measured.
        The POE does not agree that the “main CA targets” have been met. Most of the
discussion in Report 24 is of the evidence for that contention. As of December 2015, our
view is that the requirements of the CA expressed in the Objectives and Provisions are
probably not being met in several significant aspects but that there is a reasonable chance
that, given concerted action in the next two years, they could be.
