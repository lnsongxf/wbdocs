CASE STUDIES

Successful examples of recently financed private sector projects

with support from multilaterals, governments, and donors come

from across the African Region.

CEC Africa Power: The World Bank Group combined its

financial and advisory products into a package for Sierra Leone,

which is still recovering from a decade-long civil war and a

recent Ebola outbreak. The result is a $134 million power

generation facility, launched in 2016 in an industrial zone about

four kilometers east of Freetown, for development, construction,

and operation of a 57 megawatt heavy oil fuel fired power plant

sponsored by CEC Africa Investments.


Azura-Edo Power Project: The World Bank Group worked

with more than a dozen financial institutions, including

commercial banks and development finance institutions, to

support Azura, a greenfield gas-fired power plant that will

provide electricity to an estimated 14 million people in Nigeria.

Azura is Nigeria’s first privately-financed independent power

project and draws from the country’s reserves of natural gas, a

clean-burning transition fuel, to address critical electricity needs

and move toward a less carbon-intensive economy.

To break that cycle the World Bank Group combined its financial and

advisory products into a package for the West African nation, which is

still recovering from a decade-long civil war and a recent Ebola outbreak.

The result is a $134 million power generation facility, launched in 2016 in

an industrial zone about four kilometers east of Freetown, the country’s

capital. The project covers development, construction, and operation of a

57 megawatt heavy oil fuel fired power plant. It is sponsored by CEC Africa

Investments, a private sector pan-African energy company, and Abu

Dhabi energy company TCQ Power Limited. Electricity generated by the

facility will be sold to the national off-taker EDSA under a 20-year power

purchase agreement.

Given private investors’ limited risk appetite for projects in fragile and

IFC support through financing and advisory services was key to helping

Rawbank reach SMEs. The bank lacked capacity in its risk management

Medium Enterprise Finance Program facility, Rawbank set up its SME

lending program, including Lady’s First, a lending program that targeted

  Developed, financed, and constructed by private-sector investors and lenders, its 100 MW parabolic trough CSP design has been supplying clean,

  baseload energy to the country’s grid since February 2015.

  The project created 4,500 jobs during construction and 80 permanent jobs during operation. It supplies energy to approximately 80,000 homes.

  Sponsors are Abengoa, IDC, and Kaxu Community Trust.

  Structured by IFC, Clean Technology Funds offered innovative concessional financing to the project. Blended with IFC funds, it played a critical role

  in making the project’s financial structure viable for the financiers while keeping the cost of generated energy acceptable to end-consumers.

regulators through a Zambezi bond issuance in 2013. The development

bank then used its extensive experience with capital markets

transactions—both in Zambia and more broadly—to help Bayport plan

its own issuance that could be appropriately structured and launched in

a timely manner.

IFC and African Local Currency Bond Fund, a unit of the German-

government owned development finance institution KfW, also made

funding commitments: IFC committed to purchase 35 percent of the

issue as an anchor investment in the Bayport bond and ALCB Fund

promised to buy 13 percent. Those investments were catalytic, as IFC’s

Securing Agricultural Supply through Loans to Farmers and Coops

Cote d’Ivoire is among the world’s largest producers of cocoa beans and their export is a mainstay of the West African nation’s economy. Nearly all cocoa

production in the country comes from small farmers, many of whom belong to farming cooperatives. Yet logistics has historically been a major challenge

for these farmers, as bad roads lead to damaged vehicles, the proper maintenance and repair of which have often proved to be prohibitively expensive.

A Risk Sharing Facility was provided to secure agricultural supply through loans to farmers and coops in Cote d’Ivoire, with similar efforts observed in

Cameroon.

In September 2015, 43 cocoa cooperatives in Cote d’Ivoire took delivery

of new trucks at a ceremony in Abidjan. Medium-term financing is now

available to 70,000 underserved smallholder farmers through 100

cooperatives. For Cargill that means a stronger cocoa value chain and a

more reliable supply of cocoa beans.


Similarly, in Cameroon, a joint World Bank-IFC Program was launched in

March 2015 to improve the competitiveness of producer organizations of

farmers growing cassava, maize, and sorghum. Banque Internationale

Kenya Tea Development Agency
Improving Tea Farmer’s Yields with Better Fertilizer and Training

Tea is a major cash crop in Kenya, the world’s third largest tea producer. And as the leading provider of foreign exchange, the tea industry is a critical source

of employment and economic growth for the East African nation. Over 60 percent of Kenya’s black tea production—or 13 percent of global production – is

grown by 560,000 Kenyan smallholder farmers. They are the owners of the Kenya Tea Development Agency Ltd., which operates 67 tea factories.




K
           TDA operates across the entire tea value chain, from the

           procurement of fertilizer for farmers to the transportation,

           processing, and marketing of the tea produced. Each factory

purchases and processes the tea grown by its member farmers.

Tea farmer revenues depend primarily on tea prices, the cost of inputs,

and the ability of farmers to maximize yields. KTDA has made substantial

efforts to address the first two elements. Yet there is significant potential

for further productivity improvements to boost yields. Currently, KTDA

smallholder yields average two tons per hectare, lower than the average

three tons per hectare achieved by Kenya’s large-scale tea plantations.

The main obstacle to better smallholder yields is nutrient management:

KTDA’s tea factories apply uniform fertilization across all estates based on

soil analyses from the 1950s and 1960s, leaving some tea estates nutrient

Africa Improved Foods
Nutrition on a Larger Scale in East Africa

In a project that addresses chronic malnutrition, DSM, a Dutch multinational, established a nutritious food processing plant in Rwanda. This project

     n 2015, IFC agreed to provide a $26 million financing package. It

     comprised $21.5 million in loans from IFC and mobilized from other

     sources, and $4.5 million in equity to Africa Improved Foods Holding.

The donor-funded Global Agriculture and Food Security Program private

the $26 million financing package intended for the construction and

operation of a 45,000 tons-per-year processing plant to produce fortified

cereals to treat malnutrition in nearly one million children.

This project created a partnership involving several parties: DSM; the UK’s

and the Netherlands’ development finance companies CDC and FMO;

the World Food Program; the government of Rwanda; and the Clinton

cooperatives in Rwanda and through the government, thereby providing

a stable market for farmers’ produce.

GLS Liberia and SME Ventures
Providing Risk Capital and Technical Assistance to Entrepreneurs

As the Ebola epidemic overwhelmed Liberia in 2014, foreign logistics companies largely withdrew from the West African country. But GLS Liberia, a

growing, locally-owned logistics company, stepped into the void and became a critical player in the country’s defense against the disease. As urgently

needed medical supplies arrived in Liberia, GLS had a fleet and distribution network ready to move shipments from the airport to sites across the country,

alleviating the impact of the crisis.

Tanzania Interoperability Standards
Pioneering Mobile Money

Sub-Saharan Africa has undergone a technological revolution during the past 15 years. Africa has leaped from less than one percent mobile telephone

penetration in 2000 to over 70 percent today. Change has been fueled by progressive regulatory measures, supported by advice from the World Bank in

at least 40 governments, and substantial investments in rollout of new mobile operations and in regional fiber networks to connect Africa globally. IFC,

for example, has financed 32 technology, media, and telecoms projects in 12 African countries, and provided advice to encourage new technologies to

flourish.

different mobile financial service providers as well as mobile wallet-to-

bank transfers. Through an interoperable switch, service providers can

more effectively reach the unbanked. The lack of interoperable services

is an impediment to the expansion of mobile financial services.

The process by which the interoperable standards were developed in

Tanzania was facilitated by IFC and supported by the Bill & Melinda

Gates Foundation and Financial Sector Deepening Trust of Tanzania,

which provided $2.8 million funding to develop the Scheme Rules for

Mobile Financial Services in Tanzania.

Tanzania’s interoperability standards allow registered users at

participating mobile financial services providers to receive and send

money directly to one another’s wallets under rules developed at the

industry level that govern how those payments flow. It is the first phase

of a longer term vision of interoperability across the entire mobile

financial services ecosystem.

Despite the obvious advantages of interoperability, great industry

interest, and some ambitious initiatives, success has generally been

elusive outside of bank-to-wallet integrations in most markets.
