I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Belarus perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Belarus
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Belarus
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From November to December 2015, 248 stakeholders of the WBG in Belarus were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the presidential administration; cabinet of ministers;
parliament; ministries/committees; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/
programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the
financial sector/commercial banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the
media; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 142 stakeholders participated in the survey (57% response rate).

Respondents received and returned the questionnaires either via email or mail. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Belarus; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Belarus; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 61%, N=115). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 95).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/commercial banks were
       combined with those from private sector organizations. Few respondents from the
       presidential administration, cabinet of ministers, parliament, bilateral/multilateral
       agencies, media, and other organizations were included in the “Other” category. There
       were no respondents from the trade unions or the judiciary branch.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

        correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Belarus, the extent to

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey indicated that
       they most often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to the
       following: “the World Bank is not sensitive enough to political/social realities on the
       ground” (32%) and “lack of/inadequate levels of capacity in Government” (30%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from PMUs and
       consultants on the WBG projects were significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow
       WBG assisted reform efforts to that “the World Bank Group is not sensitive enough to
       political/social realities on the ground” compared to respondents from other stakeholder
       groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Belarus, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty three specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Belarus. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Belarus, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

of the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Belarus? (Choose no more than TWO)

 A4. The World Bank Group’s “Shared Prosperity” goal captures two key elements, economic growth
 and equity. It will seek to foster income growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s
 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the
 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Belarus? (Choose no more than
 TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  10   Better employment opportunities for young people
  11   Better employment opportunities for women
