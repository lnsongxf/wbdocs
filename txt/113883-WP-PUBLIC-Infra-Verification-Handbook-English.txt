FOREWORD


The Local Government and Decentralization            On conducting the verification of outputs,
Project (LGDP) aim to improve the                    initially, BPKP faces many challenges which
accountability and reporting of the                  one of them are on the technical knowledge
Government of Indonesia Specific Purpose             and capacity to support quality of reports and
Grants (DAK) for infrastructure sub-sectors          the decision. Therefore, this book serves as
(road, irrigation, water and sanitation) in          supporting document to determine the critical
selected 30 local governments in Indonesia.          items for the verification process. Considering
This project is considered straetgically             the fact that BPKP auditors in the field
appropriate to support the local governments         have different education backgrounds, this
on improving the implementation of DAK               handbook is presented in a simple and concise
infrastructure.                                      way, while keeping the main message clear
                                                     with intact and unbiased definitions.
The third component of LGDP is verification of
outputs for DAK activities at the participating      Each chapter of this handbook is illustrated

several criteria including: technical aspect         We hope that the content of this handbook
on the implementation of DAK in the field;           would be useful for the readers, especially
procurement for DAK infrastructure sub-              BPKP auditors in the field on reviewing DAK
sectors; financial management related to DAK         infrastructure outputs. The book should also
transfer in infrastructure sector, reporting         be part of a learning process which focuses
of DAK results from the field, and social and        on improving the delivery of public services
environmental safeguards criteria.                   and taking lessons learned from the field as a
                                                     reference.
This handbook aim to provide guidance
for BPKP team in the field on conducting
the verification of outputs for DAK
infrastructure. This handbook is created as                            Thank you,
part of collaboration between the Ministry
of Public Works and the BPKP at the central
level, to improve the effectiveness of BPKP                            Local Government and
technical verification. It describes all the basic                     Decentralization Project
infrastructure objects that are financed by

Technical observation is ideally assessed
along the verified road.

Perfect timing for observation is during
low-traffic hour (not during peak hour) with
sufficient daylight (not additional lighting).

Necessary equipments for technical obser-
vation are:
•	 Traffic safety signs.
•	 Map of road network.
•	 Walking measure.
•	 Tape measure.
•	 Waterpass.
•	 Color Camera.
•	 Stationery.
•	 Project vest and helmet.
•	 Marking/Stationing blocks.
