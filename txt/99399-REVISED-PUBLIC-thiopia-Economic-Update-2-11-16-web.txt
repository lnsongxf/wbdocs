EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


This report addresses two questions: What explains Ethiopia’s growth acceleration? How can it be sustained?
In brief, we find that Ethiopia’s rapid economic growth, concentrated in agriculture and services, was driven
by substantial public infrastructure investment and supported by a conducive external environment. To sus-
tain high growth, three policy adjustments are proposed, including: identifying sustainable ways of financing
infrastructure, supporting private investment through credit markets, and, tapping into the growth potential
of structural reforms.

PART A: EXPLAINING GROWTH

The Growth Acceleration

Ethiopia’s economic growth has been remarkably rapid and stable over the past decade. Real GDP
growth averaged 10.9 percent in 2004–2014, according to official data. By taking into consideration popula-
tion growth of 2.4 percent per year, real GDP growth per capita averaged 8.0 percent per year.1 The country
moved from being the 2nd poorest in the world by 2000 to the 11th poorest in 2014, according to GNI
per capita, and came closer to its goal of reaching middle income status by 2025. This pace of growth is the
fastest that the country has ever experienced and it also exceeds what was achieved by low-income and Sub-
Saharan African countries in that period. Recent growth was also noticeably stable, as the country avoided
the volatility by spells of drought and conflict which had plagued growth in the past.
     Accelerated economic progress started in 1992 with a shift to an even higher gear in 2004.
Econometric analysis supports a story of two growth accelerations as average growth increased from 0.5 percent
in 1981–92 to 4.5 percent in 1993–2004 and to 10.9 percent in 2004–14. The first ‘gear shift’ took place
shortly after the political and economic transition of 1991 with the downfall of the communist Derg regime
and the introduction of a more market-oriented economy. The subsequent Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF) government, in turn, implemented a series of structural economic reforms dur-
ing the 1990s which paved the way for the second growth acceleration starting in 2004 (the subject of this
report). Interestingly, structural economic reforms have been largely absent from Ethiopia’s recent story of
success, though they offer a promising growth potential if implemented.
     The recent growth acceleration was part of a broader and very successful development experience.
Poverty declined substantially from 55.3 percent in 2000 to 33.5 percent in 2011, according to the interna-
tional poverty line of US$1.90. Despite rapid growth, Ethiopia remained one of the most equal countries
in the world with a Gini coefficient of consumption of 0.30 in 2011. But progress went beyond monetary
dimensions. Life expectancy increased by about one year annually since 2000 and is now higher in Ethiopia

      than the low income and Sub-Saharan Africa averages. In fact, Ethiopia also surpassed these peer groups in
      several other key development indicators, including child and infant mortality. As a result, the country has
      attained most of the Millennium Development Goals. That said, Ethiopia faces a challenge in promoting
      shared prosperity as the poorest 15 percent of the population experienced a decline in well-being in 2005–11
      mainly as a result of high food prices.
           Growth was concentrated in services and agriculture on the supply side, and, private consumption
      and investment on the demand side. While agriculture was the main economic sector at the beginning of
      the take-off, the services sector gradually took over and was complemented, in recent years, by a construc-
      tion boom. Out of an average annual growth rate of 10.9 percent in 2004–14, services contributed by 5.4
      percentage points followed by agriculture (3.6 percentage points) and industry with 1.7 percentage points.
      Private consumption contributed to most growth on the demand side with public investment becoming
      increasingly important.
           Growth decompositions reveal relatively high contributions from total factor productivity and
      structural change. While capital and labor accumulation was important for growth, Ethiopia stands out
      from other non-resource rich fast-growing Sub-Saharan African countries (SSA5) by its very high total fac-
      tor productivity growth of 3.4 percent per year.2 Similarly, while most labor productivity growth came from
      within sectors (as in other countries), inter-sectoral labor shifts (structural change) explain a quarter of decadal
      of Ethiopia’s recent per capita GDP growth (which is higher than in most other countries). Still, Ethiopia
      remains at an early stage of development as reflected by continued high returns to capital.

      Economic Strategy – ‘The Ethiopian Way’

      Ethiopia stands out in many ways, including in the economic strategy that paved the way to success. In
      brief, economic strategy focused on promoting agriculture and industrialization while delivering substantial
      public infrastructure investment supported by heterodox macro-financial policies. Ethiopia’s strong commit-
      ment to agricultural development is noteworthy as reflected by high government spending and the world’s
      biggest contingent of agricultural extension workers. While a strong push for infrastructure development
      at the early stage of development is far from unique, the way in which Ethiopia achieved this sets it apart.
           Heterodox financing arrangements supported one of the highest public investment rates in the
      world. Even if Ethiopia generally did not follow the recommendations of the Growth and Development
      Commission (2008), it did deliver the recommended impressive rates of public investment with the purpose
      of crowding-in the private sector. Despite low domestic savings and taxes, Ethiopia was able to finance high
      public investment in a variety of orthodox and heterodox ways. The former include keeping government
      consumption low to finance budgetary public infrastructure investment as well as tapping external conces-
      sional and non-concessional financing.
           Three less conventional mechanisms stand out: First, a model of financial repression that kept interest
      rates low and directed the bulk of credit towards public infrastructure. Second, an overvalued exchange rate

        The IMF (2013) identifies six fast-growing Non-Resource Rich Sub-Saharan African countries, including Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
      Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Excluding Ethiopia, we refer to this group as SSA5. Although natural resources
      is becoming increasingly important in some of these countries they were not natural resources dependent at the relevant period
      of analysis (1995–2010).
                                                                                            List of Abbreviations   xiii




that cheapened public capital imports. Third, monetary expansion, including direct Central Bank budget
financing, which earned the government seignorage revenues.
     Ethiopia’s economic strategy was unique. Although Ethiopia gradually moved in the direction of a
market-based system, it continued to intervene in most sectors of its economy thereby not adopting some
of the key recommendation of the Growth Commission of ‘letting markets allocate resources efficiently’.
Indeed, apart from market oriented reforms implemented during the 1990s, structural economic reforms
have been absent from Ethiopia’s growth strategy in part because of initial economic success. Although it
was inspired by the East Asian development state model and shares some common features, it is also differ-
ent from these countries both in conception and outcomes. Agriculture, for instance, features much more
prominently in the Ethiopian strategy than in East Asia. Critically, also, Ethiopia’s economic success thus
far has not been derived from the success of numerous firms drawn from the private sector as in East Asia.

Explaining Growth: The Role of Structural, External and Stabilization Factors

Using a cross-country regression model, we are able to distinguish between key drivers of growth. Our
approach avoids tweaked Ethiopia-specific results because we use an existing regression model originally con-
structed to investigate growth elsewhere. The model is estimated on 126 countries for the 1970–2010 period,
including low income countries. Ethiopia’s per capita real GDP growth rate is predicted using Ethiopian
values of the underlying growth determinants for three different periods: Early 2000s, Late 2000s, and Early
2010s. We distinguish between structural, external and stabilization factors. The model predicts Ethiopia’s
growth rate quite accurately thereby underscoring its relevance as a useful analytical tool for our purposes.
    Economic growth was driven primarily by structural improvements. When measured at Purchasing
Power Parity (PPP), the model predicts a real GDP per capita growth rate for Ethiopia of 4.3 percent in
2000–13 compared with an observed rate of 4.8 percent. The contribution of structural factors is estimated
at 3.9 percentage points. The growth acceleration was also supported by a conducive external environment.
Exports quadrupled in nominal terms, while volumes doubled, reflecting a substantial positive commodity
price effect. Macroeconomic imbalances in the form of exchange rate overvaluation and high inflation held
back some growth.
    Public infrastructure investment, facilitated partly by restrained government consumption, was the
key structural driver of growth. In contrast to many countries in the region, the government deliberately
emphasized capital spending over consumption within the budget and this was key for supporting growth,
according to the model. This shift was facilitated by declining military spending following the 1998–2000
war with Eritrea giving rise to a ‘peace dividend’. Increased openness to international trade also supported
growth as did the expansion of secondary education, though these effects were less pronounced.
    The strong contribution of infrastructure investment arises from a substantial physical infrastructure
expansion combined with their high returns. Ethiopia stands out during the 2000s for having registered
very rapid infrastructure development. Using the data for 124 countries over four decades, the country was
among the 20 percent fastest in terms of infrastructure growth over the past decade. Although this is partly
the result of starting from a very low level, these infrastructure growth rates also exceed those of fast grow-
ing regional peers with comparable income levels. As we do not know the true economic return to infra-
structure investment in Ethiopia, their average returns are estimated from the country sample. Given that
xiv   ETHIOPIA’S GREAT RUN – THE GROWTH ACCELERATION AND HOW TO PACE IT




      public investment was concentrated in providing basic infrastructure, such as energy, roads, and telecom,
      this growth effect seems plausible.
           Macro-financial policies held back some growth, though the effect was small. Based on the expe-
      rience of other countries, the model predicts growth to fall when credit to the private sector declines, the
      exchange rate appreciates and inflation is high. Ethiopia experienced all three trends over this period and
      this gives rise to an estimated negative macro-financial growth effect. What stands out, however, is that the
      quantitative effect is quite small (0.44 percentage points). This result helps explain how Ethiopia was able to
      achieve high economic growth in the presence of seemingly sub-optimal macro-financial policies. In fact, it
      raises the question of whether growth was able to accelerate precisely because of this heterodox policy mix,
      which supported growth-inducing infrastructure investment. Although it is hard to conclude firmly either
      way, Ethiopia’s experience supports the impression that ‘getting infrastructure right’ at the early stage of
      development can go a long way in supporting growth.

      The Role of Structural Change

      A modest shift in labor from agriculture to services and construction can explain up to a quarter of
      Ethiopia’s per capita growth in 2005–13. This result illustrates the strong potential of structural change as
      a driver of economic growth as discussed in the literature (e.g. McMillan et al. 2014). Although Ethiopia has
      experienced high economic growth and some structural change in production away from agriculture towards
      services, the similar shift in employment has been much more modest. Nevertheless, agricultural employment
      did decline from 80 to 77 percent between 2005 and 2013 and because agricultural labor productivity is so
      low, this shift gave rise to static efficiency gains as relative labor shares increased in construction and services
      where the average value added of a worker is up to five times higher.
           The nature of structural change taking place in Ethiopia differs notably from the vision of government
      policy. Specifically, economic strategy in Ethiopia aims to promote the kind of structural change first described by Sir
      Arthur Lewis (1954) in which workers move out of agriculture and into manufacturing. Ethiopia has followed this
      ‘trodden path of development’ only partially as economic activity (output and jobs) have shifted from agriculture and
      into construction and services, largely by-passing the critical phase of industrialization. In response, the government
      has strengthened its institutional, legal and regulatory framework focusing on promoting light manufacturing FDI,
      especially in the form of industrial parks (see World Bank 2015 for details).
           The growth acceleration period marked the rise of the services sector in Ethiopia. Services overtook
      agriculture to become the largest economic sector, the biggest contributor to economic growth, and is the
      second biggest employer. Within services, commerce, ‘other services’ and the public sector were the most
      important contributors to output and jobs. On the other hand, the Ethiopian services story is predominantly
      one of a rise in traditional activities, which require face-to-face interaction, rather than modern activities
      such as ICT or finance.
           Ethiopia’s growth acceleration was also supported by positive demographic effects. The economic
      take-off coincided with a marked increase in the share of the working-age population giving a positive boost
      to labor supply. Up to thirteen percent of per capita growth in 2005–13 can be attributed to this ‘demo-
      graphic dividend’ effect. A continued rise in the working age population will support potential economic
      growth in the coming decades, but for the country to fully reap these benefits it must accelerate the ongoing
                                                                                               List of Abbreviations   xv




fertility decline and equip workers with marketable skills to be attractive to prospective employers. Both the
manufacturing and services sectors would play an important role in absorbing this additional labor.

Drivers of Agricultural Growth

Ethiopia’s agricultural sector has recorded remarkable rapid growth in the last decade and was the
major driver of poverty reduction. The sector is, by far, the biggest employer in Ethiopia, accounts for
most merchandise exports and is the second largest in terms of output. The sector also contributed to most
of the employment growth over the period of analysis. Although some labor shifted out of agriculture, sub-
stantial shifts are likely to take a long time. Critically, agricultural growth was an important driver of poverty
reduction in Ethiopia: Each percent of agricultural growth reduced poverty by 0.9 percent compared to 0.55
percent for each percent of overall GDP growth (World Bank, 2015). For these reasons, the report takes a
deeper look at the drivers of agricultural growth.
     Agricultural output increases were driven by strong yield growth and increases in area cultivated.
Yield growth averaged about 7 percent per year while area cultivated increased by 2.7 percent annually. A
decomposition of yield growth reveals the importance of increased input use as well as productivity growth.
As in the Green Revolution, increased adoption of improved seeds and fertilizer played a major role in sus-
taining higher yields. While starting from a low base, these inputs more than doubled over the last decade.
Total factor productivity growth averaged 2.3 percent per year.
     The factors associated with agricultural production growth include extension services, remoteness
and farmer’s education. A regression model was used to identify the likelihood of adopting modern tech-
nology. Farmers that received extension visits, less remote households and more educated farmers were more
likely to adopt improved agricultural technologies.
     Recent agricultural growth is largely explained by high government spending on extension services,
roads, education as well as favourable price incentives. First, Ethiopia has built up a large agricultural
extension system, with one of the highest extension agent to farmer ratios in the world. Second, there has
been a significant improvement in access to markets. Third, improved access to education led to a significant
decrease in illiteracy in rural areas. Fourth, high international prices of export products as well as improv-
ing modern input—output ratios for local crops have led to better incentives. Other factors played a role as
well, including good weather, better access to micro-finance institutions in rural areas, and improved tenure
security. Recent poor rains in Ethiopia during 2014 and 2015 pose a major challenge to the country and
the impact of climate change stresses the importance of continued investment in irrigation to reduce reli-
ance on rain-fed production.

PART B: SUSTAINING GROWTH

Managing Growth Expectations

What should we expect in terms of Ethiopia’s growth rate over the next decade? Following a decade-long
spell of double digit growth on the back of a strategy and performance that seemingly emulates the East Asian
developmental states, including China, one might assume that such high growth rates can be sustained in
xvi   ETHIOPIA’S GREAT RUN – THE GROWTH ACCELERATION AND HOW TO PACE IT




      the future on the back of the same strategy that worked so well in the past. The second part of this report
      takes a deeper look at this issue on the basis of available international and country-specific evidence.
           We begin by highlighting the exceptional nature of the past decade performance by drawing upon
      the objective statistical experience of growth accelerations elsewhere. According to Pritchett and Summers
      (2014), cross-country experiences of per capita GDP growth since the 1950s has been an average of 2 per-
      cent per year with a standard deviation of 2 percent. Episodes of per capita growth of above 6 percent tend
      to be extremely short-lived with a median duration of nine years. China’s experience from 1977 to 2010 is
      the only instance of a sustained episode of per capita growth exceeding 6 percent and only two other coun-
      tries come close (Taiwan and Korea). In other words, these country experiences are statistically exceptional.
           A country specific analysis of growth head- and tailwinds suggest a balance of factors at play in
      Ethiopia. These factors were derived on the basis of the stylized facts and conceived wisdom emanating from
      the most recent growth and economic development literature. The likelihood of continued high growth in
      Ethiopia is buoyed by five factors: productivity-enhancing structural change, within-sector productivity gains
      (including agriculture), technological catch-up, urbanization, and FDI. The demographic transition and a
      large domestic market offer important potential. These factors would need to be balanced against a number
      of ‘growth headwinds’ factors. Exogenous factors include geographical disadvantages and a slowdown of
      world trade. Endogenous factors include: lagging agricultural productivity, low export size and diversifica-
      tion, a small financial sector, low levels of human capital and poor trade logistics. Most of these ‘inhibitors’
      do not pose insurmountable hurdles but collectively they could dampen Ethiopia’s chances of maintaining
      its growth rate over the course of the next decade.
           Cyclical analysis suggests that a slowdown is pending. By the very nature of having experienced a
      growth acceleration, Ethiopia’s real GDP per growth rate has exceeded the potential rate of GDP growth for
      the past decade. Potential GDP growth, in turn, is a function of capital, labor and TFP growth. Investment
      has been exceptionally high the past years and is thus likely to slow down. A rising working age population
      provides some growth impetus, but total factor productivity growth will be hard to sustain at its current
      high levels. Additionally, economic activity has been strongly supported by a construction boom in the past
      3 years (2011/12–2013/14). Even if government policy drives part of this boom, the private component is
      cyclical in nature and will not last indefinitely.
           Regression model simulations indicate a growth slowdown under alternative policy scenarios. We
      use the abovementioned regression model to identify growth drivers and simulate three scenarios. The first
      scenario assumes continued infrastructure investment that comes at the cost of private sector crowding-out
      in the credit market, the buildup of inflationary pressures due to supply constraints, and, a policy of con-
      tinued real exchange rate appreciation to keep capital imports cheap. The second scenario aims to promote
      accelerated private sector investment and reduce macroeconomic imbalances. Specifically, the pace of public
      infrastructure investment slows down but is partially substituted by private sector involvement. The third
      assumes an acceleration public infrastructure investment at the cost of growing macroeconomic imbalances.
      All three policy scenarios yield comparable annual real GDP per capita growth rates of about 4 percent in
      PPP terms, which is well below the rate of 6.5 percent observed in the Late 2000s.
           Put together, alternative approaches suggest a likely range of GDP growth between 4.5 and 10.5
      percent over the next decade. In per capita terms, this is equivalent to a range of 2.0 to 8.0 percent assum-
      ing a population growth rate of 2.5 percent per year. The lower bound is given by international experience
      of growth accelerations and Ethiopia’s 1993–2004 growth rate. The upper bound is given by the maximum
                                                                                               List of Abbreviations   xvii




achieved in Ethiopia and elsewhere. We note that a decadal growth projection based on Ethiopia’s level of
Hausmann-Hidalgo concept of ‘economic complexity’ is at the lower range at 4.4 percent per year. The
challenge confronting policy makers is to make sure that growth remains at the higher end of this range.
    To sustain high growth, three policy adjustments are proposed. This includes (1) supporting private
investment through credit markets; (2) identifying sustainable ways to finance infrastructure, and; (3) tap-
ping into the growth potential of structural reforms. We discuss each of these in turn.

Supporting Private Sector Led Growth with Credit

While public infrastructure investment helps firms to become more productive, Ethiopian firms appear
more concerned with getting access to credit. According to six different survey instruments, credit is men-
tioned as the more binding constraint for firms. This matters, because it suggests that the government may
have made progress in addressing the infrastructure constraint and now needs to pay more attention to alle-
viating other constraints important to firms. It is indicative that the marginal return to private investment
may be higher than the marginal return to public infrastructure investment. Indeed, empirical estimates of
these relative returns presented in this report support this assessment. This results arises from the fact that
Ethiopia has the third highest public investment rate in the world and the sixth lowest private investment
rate combined with the economic logic of diminishing marginal returns.
     Arguably, the Ethiopian economy would benefit from a shift of domestic credit towards private
firms. If the aim of government policy is to enhance the productivity of private firms, then it is important
to understand what the firm-level constraints are. If firms really need credit more than access to new roads or
better telecommunication to grow and prosper, then government policy would need to support the allevia-
tion of the credit constraint at the firm level. Since public infrastructure investment is partially financed via
the same domestic savings pool, it is clear that infrastructure financing competes directly with the financing
of private investment projects.
     Two policy reforms could potentially address the challenge of private sector credit. The first would
be to continue the existing system of financial repression, but to direct more credit towards private firms.
In that way Ethiopia’s financial system would become more similar to Korea, where the bulk of credit was
directed towards private priority sectors. A second reform involves a gradual move towards a more liberal-
ized interest rates that better reflect the demand and supply for savings/credit and encourage more savings.
     Policy reforms should be informed by two criteria: the relative returns of public and private invest-
ment, and, the savings rate. This insights were derived from a simple theoretical model developed for the
purposes of this study. Financial repression with more private credit is attractive in situations where the mar-
ginal return to private investment is much higher than the marginal return to public investment. Interest
rate liberalization is attractive if the saving rate of the country is low as welfare would rise by increasing the
deposit rate towards more market-determined levels. The report presents evidence that both constraints are
binding in Ethiopia.
     Ethiopia needs to provide more access to credit to the private sector and this can be done either
within or outside the existing policy paradigm. The theoretical analysis and the empirical evidence suggest
that there are welfare enhancing effects of either option. Given Ethiopia’s preference for financial repression,
the less substantive reform would be to maintain this system, but to follow South Korea’s footsteps and direct
the bulk of domestic credit to priority private sectors.
xviii   ETHIOPIA’S GREAT RUN – THE GROWTH ACCELERATION AND HOW TO PACE IT




        Identifying Alternative Infrastructure Financing Sources

        Continued infrastructure development remains one of Ethiopia’s best strategies to sustain growth, but
        the current financing model is not sustainable. Infrastructure was the most important driver of economic
        growth during the growth acceleration. This is because the economic returns to infrastructure were high and
        the physical infrastructure expansion in Ethiopia was substantial. Since Ethiopia continues to have the 3rd
        largest infrastructure deficit in Africa, it is not surprising that the cross-country regression model also predicts
        this policy to be the best going forward. However, the past infrastructure expansion was financed via a range
        of mechanisms that will begin to show their limits in the future in terms of external debt sustainability, private
        sector crowding out in the credit markets and a strong exchange rate that undermines external competitive-
        ness. Going forward, Ethiopia needs more infrastructure, but it would need new mechanisms to finance it.
             There are a range of alternative financing mechanisms to continue and the report briefly discusses
        their merits. Some options are consistent with current government strategy and thinking. This includes
        raising tax revenues, increased private sector involvement (including PPPs) and improved public investment
        management. Other options deviate from the existing paradigm, including: increasing domestic savings and
        developing capital markets via a higher real interest rate; greater selectivity and prioritization of investments;
        securitization of infrastructure assets, and; improved pricing, including higher electricity tariffs.

        The Growth Potential of Structural Reforms

        Ethiopia lags behind Sub-Saharan African peers in most reform dimensions. This is especially the case
        for domestic finance, the current account, the capital account, and services trade restrictiveness. On the posi-
        tive side, Ethiopia has done well in reducing trade tariffs and is at par with peers here. What would be the
        impact on growth if Ethiopia closed the reform gap with its peers? To address this question, we perform a
        benchmarking exercise using an existing regression model that links reform with growth (Prati et al., 2013).
              Even modest structural reforms that close gaps with peers would potentially have considerable impact
        on GDP per capita growth. The results presented are only indicative and do not constitute a comprehensive
        appraisal of reforms that have actually been introduced. If Ethiopia were to catch up with the average Sub-
        Saharan Africa country in terms of financial liberalization, its per capita GDP growth rate would be boosted
        by 1.9 percentage points per year. These substantial effects arise because this type of reform is highly potent
        for growth and owing to a substantial reform gap. Similar reforms of the current account and opening the
        capital account are estimated to increase real GDP growth rates by 0.8 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively.
              There are considerable firm level gains to be reaped from services sector liberalization in Ethiopia,
        especially in credit access, energy and transport services. For example, if the access to credit conditions
        of Ethiopia were to match those of Rwanda, then firm labor productivity would increase by 4.3 percent,
        keeping all else equal. Similarly, if electricity conditions were to also match those of Rwanda, the labor
        productivity gains would be close to a 2.2 percent. Finally, matching China’s transportation services would
        imply productivity gains of 4.2 percent. These results were derived using a similar benchmarking method
        based on an existing regression model.
              In terms of reform sequencing, Ethiopia has already followed international best practice through
        its ‘trade-first’ approach, although it has proceeded very slowly. Economic theory, country experience and
        best international practice would generally suggest the following sequence of reforms: (1) trade liberalization;
                                                                                               List of Abbreviations   xix




(2) financial sector liberalization, and (3) capital account opening. That said, every country experience
has been unique and reforms have to be customized to their specific country setting. It is noteworthy that
Ethiopia has so far liberalized its merchandise trade, but not yet its services trade. The next possible step on
the reform path may be to engage in services trade and financial sector liberalization.
     Although there are economic benefits to reforms as well as an emerging consensus about their
sequencing, policy makers are often concerned about risks. While the average longer term net benefits
seem to be positive, there is no guarantee that all countries will automatically benefit from reforms. Ethiopia
has the added advantage of being in a position to learn the lessons of successful as well as painful experiences
of other countries. Still, there are important pitfalls on the reform path (e.g. regulatory frameworks need to
be well developed before liberalizing domestic finance) and these would need to be studied more carefully
if Ethiopia were to re-initiate the structural reform agenda.

Monitoring Growth Model Sustainability

Finally, the report propose a series of indicators that would be worth monitoring going forward to
capture the many trade-offs that are embedded in the current growth strategy. At some point, we argue,
the costs of pursuing the current policy would outweigh its benefits. For example, the loss of external com-
petitiveness associated with an overvalued exchange rate may outweigh the benefits in the form of cheaper
public capital imports. A deterioration in these indicators may precede a slowdown in growth and provide
early warning to policy makers that the current growth model has run its course. Policy makers are encour-
aged to be proactive and initiate reform efforts now as opposed to waiting until growth slows down.
     With the recent launch of the Second Growth and Transformation Plan and the recent appointment
of a new economic team, the timing is right to consider the proposals of this report. Encouragingly,
the GTP2 envisions a strong increase in the tax revenue to GDP ratio in a bid to raise domestic savings and
identifying alternative and more sustainable ways to finance infrastructure. In a similar vein, the private sector
is expected to play an important role in supporting infrastructure provisions in ways that reduced the need
for public borrowing. The new strategy also stresses the role of the private sector as the ultimate engine of
growth and emphasizes the need to maintain a competitive real exchange rate. Moreover, domestic savings
are to be mobilized by ensuring that the real interest rate remains positive. The analysis and proposals put
forward in this report are aimed to support the Government of Ethiopia in achieving these goals in its quest
towards becoming a lower middle income country by 2025.
PART A: EXPLAINING GROWTH
Part A is structured as follows: Chapter 1 highlights the key characteristics of the growth accel-
eration. Chapter 2 describes the economic strategy that supported high growth. Chapter 3 identi-
fies key growth determinants distinguishing between structural, external and stabilization factors.
Chapter 4 explains the take-off of the agriculture sector. Chapter 5 utilizes a structural change
framework to gain further insights about the determinants of growth.

BOX 1.1: When Did Ethiopia’s Economy Take Off?
The concept of an economic take-off was conceptualized by Rostow (1960). He proposed a historical model of growth
whereby economies undergo five stages of growth as follows: (1) traditional society; (2) preconditions for take-off; (3) take-off;
(4) drive to maturity; and (5) age of high mass consumption. Although Rostow’s theory has faced much criticism, the concept he
introduced remains useful as it identifies a point in time in the early stages of development where an economy starts growing at
high and self-sustained rates. Subsequently developed econometric methods help identify and analyze sustained growth take-
offs (e.g. Hausmann et al. 2005)).
   Two alternative years emerge as candidates for a take-off in Ethiopia: 1992 and 2004. To motivate the discussion
consider the following average annual growth rates: (1981–1992: 0.5%), (1993–2004: 4.5%) and (2004–2014: 10.9%). This
box briefly discusses the arguments in favor of either of these two interpretations and attempts to reconcile them. We follow
the definitions of Hausmann et al. (2005): (a) a growth acceleration should be sustained for at least 8 years and the change
in growth rate has to be at least 2 percentage points; (b) a country can have more than one instance of growth acceleration as
long as the dates are more than 5 years apart; (c) trend breaks were selected at the 1% level of significance (α = 0.01) in the
Autometrics options in the software package OxMetrics 7 (Doornik et al., 2013). The test results illustrated below are sufficiently
robust to changes in these specifications.
   Econometric tests reveal a break in GDP growth in 1992 when the focus is on the 1980–2014 period and
extreme observations are taken into account. This result is derived using the algorithm developed in Doornik et al. (2013)
which identifies the existence, timing and significance of breaks in mean growth rates. In the years 1998 and 2003 GDP growth
witnessed sharp contractions, which coincide with the war with Eritrea and a period of severe drought, respectively. Accounting
for these two extraordinary observations, statistical tests singled out the year 1992 as a period marking a turning point in growth
performance (see Figure 1.5.1). This essentially reflects the fact that Ethiopia’s GDP growth rate surged from 0.5% in 1981–92
to 7.7% in 1993–2014.
   Identifying 1992 as a break point is consistent with the hypothesis that the economy took off around the
time of political and economic regime change. The shift in growth performance around 1992 is associated with the
introduction of market-oriented economic reforms that ensued the demise of the socialist Derg regime (1974–1991). In
addition, the period since 1992 was preceded by political regime change and the end of a major civil war. Note, however,
that economic growth was relatively unstable in 1992–2004 compared to 2004–2014. This prompts the need for studying
the period since 1992 separately.
   Econometric tests identify 2004 as the turning point in growth performance when the focus is on the 1992–2014
period. The result, illustrated in Figure 1.5.2, unveils that that the period 1992–2014 comprises two ‘distinct’ growth regimes:
1993–2003 (when GDP growth was significantly higher than that in 1980–1992), and 2004–14 (when growth accelerated
further and exhibited more stability).
   In sum, it can be argued that the economy changed to higher gears in both 1992 and 2004. The year 1992
marked the shift from a command economy to a more market-oriented economy. Growth was higher, but somewhat unstable.
2004, in turn, marked the first year of an unprecedented sustained high-growth period.

TABLE 2.1: Key Characteristics of the Ethiopian Economic Model
 Role of Government Intervention
 Production         The government produces some goods and services and its rationale include: (a) to encourage competition
                    (e.g. wholesale markets), (b) there is ‘insufficient capacity’ in the private sector (e.g. sugar production), and (c)
                    to meet social objectives (e.g. keeping some retail prices low).
 Credit and         The State channels the majority of credit and foreign exchange through state-owned banks, mainly the Com-
 foreign            mercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE). The former largely supports public
 exchange           investment and the latter supports long term private investment.

 Protected          Key services sectors (finance, telecom, trade logistics, retail) are protected from foreign competition on the basis
 sectors            of ‘infant industry’ arguments that the domestic private sector is too underdeveloped to withstand foreign com-
                    petition (e.g. retail) or the government regulator insufficiently prepared (e.g. financial sector).
 State monopoly Despite privatization of some SOEs, major state monopoly companies remain, including electricity production
 enterprises    (EET) and distribution (EES), telecoms (Ethio Telecom), railways (ERC), sugar (Sugar Corporation), trade logistics
                    (ESLSE), and air transport (Ethiopian Airlines). Sometimes profits are transferred between SOEs (e.g. from tele-
                    coms to railways).
 Capital account Closed. This implies that domestic residents and banks do not have access to foreign capital markets. More-
                    over, repatriation of profits from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is difficult.
 Land               The Government owns all land. Land users can buy and sell lease rights.
 Promoting          A key objective of government intervention is to promote ‘value creation’ and minimize ‘rent seeking’. To il-

 ‚rent-seeking‘.    If, on the other hand, the land is not put into productive use and the investor sells the land use rights at a profit
                    five years later then the activity is termed ‘rent seeking’. An alternative term for the latter may be ‘speculation’.
 Economic Development Policy
 Public investment Substantial public investment is facilitated through a heterodox policy mix of: low or negative real interest rates,
                   credit and foreign exchange allocations, real currency appreciation, recurrent expenditure restraint, and low
                   international reserves.
 External           In addition to the concessional multilateral credits, Ethiopia is relying substantially on bilateral non-concessional
 borrowing          credits, especially from China. Sovereign bond financing is also used.
 ADLI               Agriculture Development Led Industrialization (ADLI) which emphasizes smallholder agricultural growth to
                    stimulate growth in other sectors of the economy, most notably industry.
 Sectorial          Emphasis is put on the development of agriculture and manufacturing. The services sector receives less atten-
 policies           tion (except exports). Key sectors (leather, textile, metal, cut flower and agro industry) are actively favored owing
                    to their potential comparative advantage (labor intensive production drawing upon domestic resources base).

  BOX 2.1: The Banking Sector in Ethiopia
  Ethiopia’s banking sector consists of two state-owned commercial banks, one state-owned development bank
  and 16 private banks. Three public banks constitute 77 percent of total assets of the banking sector. Within this group are the
  Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE). CBE holds 80 percent of the total outstanding
  loans and DBE is a large holder of treasury bills. There are no foreign-owned banks.
     On average, banks appear to be well capitalized and profitable. The system-wide capital adequacy ratio was
  17.2 in June 2014 compared to the 8 percent minimum requirement. The profitability of the banking sector remains high with
  return on assets and return on equity at 3.1 and 44.6 percent, respectively and well above regional averages (2 and 17 percent,
  respectively). Asset quality is also good with nonperforming loans at less than 3 percent of banks’ total loan portfolio (March
  2014). The system-wide liquidity ratio, however, is only slightly above the 15 percent minimum requirement.
     Ethiopia’s banking sector is characterized by ‘financial repression’. The term financial repression was initially
  coined by McKinnon (1973), who defined it as government financial policies strictly regulating interest rates, setting high reserve
  requirements on bank deposits, and mandatorily allocating resources. Economists are divided as to whether financial repression
  is good or bad for economic growth (see Chapter 7, Box 7.1, for a discussion). In Ethiopia, the key characteristics include: (1)
  below market-clearing deposit rates; (2) relatively high reserve and liquidity requirements of banks; (3) allocation of the bulk of
  credit by state-owned banks, especially CBE and DBE.
     Nominal interest rates are low and rigid. The minimum deposit rate, regulated by NBE, has remained constant for
  the past five years at 5.0 percent. The lending rate is fully liberalized, but has been relatively unchanged over the same period
  with minimum and maximum observed lending rates unchanged at 7.5 and 16.25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the spread
  between the minimum deposit rate and the observed maxiumum lending rate has been constant at around 11 percent. As a
  result, changes in the real interest rates have exclusively been a product of changes in inflation (Figure 2.1.3).
     Domestic credit has declined over time, as a share of the economy, as a result of low real interest rates. Figure
  2.1.1 reveals a substantial reduction in domestic credit as a share of GDP over the past decade from 35.7 percent of GDP in
  2004 to 28.6 percent of GDP in 2014. This demonetization trend is mirrored in a similar decline of broad money (M2) as a
  share of GDP  , which declined from 38.5 percent in 2004 to 28.4 percent in 2009. The most plausible explanatory factor for this
  trend has been the low real interest rate observed over this period.
     Credit growth has been increasingly concentrated in public projects rather than private ones. This is reflected in
  the composition of domestic credit stock (Figure 2.1.4). The share of private credit in total outstanding credit has declined from
  37 percent in 2007/08 to 28 percent in 2014/15. Conversely, the share of loans to State Owned Enterprises increase from 21
  to 62 percent over this period.
     Private sector credit, as a share of GDP          , has declined because of declining domestic credit and a policy
  preference for financing SOEs. Put differently, the private sector has been taking a smaller share of a shrinking cake. Private
  sector credit declined from about 16 to 11 percent of GDP in 2004–14, according to the NBE definition, which counts all DBE
  loans as private.
     In sum, Ethiopia’s credit market is characterized by financial repression with an emphasis of financing
  public infrastructure projects. Figure 2.1.5 illustrates this in a simple investment-savings diagram. The savings curve slopes
  upward as a higher real interest rate encourages households to save. The investment curve is downward sloping because more
  investment projects are profitable at low real interest rates. In a market-based system, the real interest rate is determined where
  the two curves intersect. In the case of Ethiopia, the minimum deposit rate is effectively set by the Government (NBE) and this will
  have a strong bearing on the level of the real interest rate. Since it is set below the market rate, the market clears via quantity
  rationing. Some agents get access to credit at the below market rate. Other agents are completely excluded from credit access
  giving rise to ‘unsatisfied demand’.

  BOX 4.1: The Demographic Dividend
  Ethiopia’s growth acceleration was supported by positive demographic effects. The economic take-off coincided with
  a marked increase in the share of the working-age population giving a positive boost to labor supply. Up to thirteen percent of
  per capita growth in 2005–13 can be attributed to this demographic effect. A continued rise in the working age population will
  support potential economic growth in the coming decades.
     The demographic dividend describes the interplay between changes in a population’s age structure due to the
  demographic transition and rapid economic growth. Declines in child mortality, followed by declines in fertility, produce a
  ‘bulge’ generation and a period when a country has a large number of working age people and fewer dependents. Having a large
  number of gainfully employed workers per capita gives a boost to the economy (World Bank, 2014). The economic benefits of a
  demographic dividend, however, are not automatic. For the youthful workforce to add value they must be equipped with education
  and skills and the business environment must be such as to generate jobs sufficient to productively absorb the available labor.
     Ethiopia experienced rapid demographic change over the past three decades. Child and infant mortality started
  declining in the mid-1980s while the total fertility rate fell rapidly a decade later in the mid-1990s, partly in response to lower
  death rates. Population growth rates declined and life expectancy increased. In 1980, Ethiopia was doing worse on these indicators
  than the average Sub-Saharan African country. By 2010 this situation was reversed.
     Declining mortality followed by declining fertility produced a shift in the age-structure of the population
  as more people were able to work. According to UN data, the share of the working-age population started increasing in
  2005—at the same time when the economy took off. Having been constant since 1985 at about 50–51 percent, the working age
  population share increased to 52.3 percent in 2010 to 55.1 percent in 2015 with a projected peak of 67.5 percent in 2055. A
  similar pattern is observed for the dependency ratio which remained relatively constant in 1990–2005 at around 97–98 percent,
  but then declined to 91.3 in 2010 and 81.5 in 2015.
     A rising share of the working age population accounts for thirteen percent of Ethiopia’s per capita growth
  in 2005–13. This result is illustrated in the decomposition of value added per person presented in Figure 4.2.4. Changes in the
  demographic structure had a negative effect on growth in 1999–2005 (by 8.0 percent) as a consequence of a rising dependency
  ratio. However, during the 2005–13 economic boom period, a rising working age population can account for 13.0 percent
  of per capita growth. By comparison, demography accounted for 20 percent of per capita growth in the Republic of Korea in
  1970–90 (Martins, 2014; 2015).
     Ethiopia’s demographic transition is taking place faster than in the rest of Africa. Africa’s share of the working age
  population started rising in 1990, but will not peak until ninety years later in 2080. The same process will take only 50 years in
  Ethiopia (2005–55). This is the result of a more rapid decline in mortality and fertility in Ethiopia compared to the rest of the region.
     Improvements in female education had a particularly important impact on rapidly declining fertility in Ethiopia.
  The 1994 education reform removed school fees, instituted school lunches in rural areas, increased the education budget, and
  allowed classes to be taught in the local language rather than Amharic (World Bank, 2014). This lead to a substantial increase
  in female education by 0.8 years, on average. This, in turn, reduced the probability of teenage birth and teenage marriage (by
  7 and 6 percentage points, respectively, per year of additional schooling).
     For Ethiopia to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend it must put in place policies to further accelerate
  the fertility decline and for the economy to absorb a rapidly increasing labor force. Speeding up the fertility decline
  require policies to reduce child mortality and improve child health, support female education and empowerment, addressing
  social norms on fertility, reducing child marriage and expanding comprehensive family planning programs. Reaping the ensuing
  economic benefits, in turn, require measures on the labor supply and demand side. Workers must be endowed with marketable
  skills to be attractive to prospective employers and employment of women outside the home must be encouraged. Demand for
  labor can be boosted by attracting foreign direct investment through an improved business environment (Galor and Weil, 1996;
  World Bank, 2014).

       BOX 6.1: Stylized Facts about Growth Accelerations and their Aftermath
       What to expect about growth accelerations:
       •	 Cross-country experience of per capita GDP growth has been an average of 2 percent per year with a standard deviation of
          2 percent (using Penn World Tables data since the 1950s).
       •	 Episodes of per capita growth of above 6 percent are extremely short-lived with a median duration of 9 years.
       •	 China’s experience from 1977 to 2010 is the only instance of a sustained episode of per capita growth exceeding 6 percent
          for more than 32 years (1977–91: 7.61 percent and 1991–2014: 8.6 percent). Only two countries come close: Taiwan
          (1962–1994: 6.8 percent) and Korea (1962–1982: 6.3 percent).
       •	 The end of an episode of super-rapid growth is nearly always a growth deceleration. Of the 28 episodes of above 6 percent
          per capita growth, only 2 ended with a shift to higher growth: Korea (1982) and China (1991).
       •	 Since 1950, only 24 economies have notched up a 4.5 percent per capita growth over 30 years (Rodrik, 2013).
       •	 Six non-resource rich economies have experienced decade long rates of per capita growth exceeding 7 percent: Japan, Korea,
          Hong Kong, Singapore, and China (Virmani, 2012).
       •	 Six African countries experienced GDP per capita growth of more than 3 percent in 1995–2000 without that growth being
          driven by the exploitation of natural resource wealth: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda
          (IMF, 2013).
       •	 The Commission on Growth and Development (2008) analyzed 13 economies that had grown at an average rate of 7 percent
          a year (total—not per capita!) or more for 25 years or longer since 1950.

       What to expect after a growth acceleration:
       •	 The single most robust and striking statistical fact about cross-national growth rates is regression to the global mean of 2
          percent per capita growth.
       •	 Past growth is not a good predictor of future growth. The R-squared of decade-ahead predictions of decade growth varies
          from 0.056 (for the recent decade) to 0.13. The best coefficient prediction is around 0.3 for decade-ahead predictions.
       •	 The median of the growth episode that follows an episode of super-rapid growth is 2.1 percent per year.
       •	 The reason for the low growth on average of developing countries versus developed countries is not the lack of rapid growth—it
          is the lack of the growth persistence and the very low growth rates during their periods of negative growth (North, Wallis,
          and Weingast, 2009).

       BOX 7.1: Literature Review: Does Financial Repression Inhibit or Facilitate Economic Growth?
       Economists are divided on the impact of repressive financial policies on economic growth. A large number of studies
       identify possible mechanisms through which financial liberalization promotes growth, including facilitating financial development,
       improving allocative efficiency, inducing technological progress and enhancing financial stability (Shaw, 1973; Levine, Loayza
       and Beck, 2000). Many empirical analyses also confirm this positive correlation (Levine, 2005; Trew, 2006). Other studies,
       however, cast doubts on this relationship. Kose et al. (2009) find no clear-cut relationship between financial globalization and
       economic growth in a global dataset of emerging market economies. Stiglitz (2000) attributes increasing frequency of financial
       crisis during past decades to financial liberalization in the developing world. He argues that developing countries might be more
       able to manage money supply and financial stability under repressive financial policies.
          While repressive financial policies would reduce economic efficiency, they might enable the authorities to
       better deal with problems of market failure and financial risks. This lead some authors to argue that this is essentially
       an empirical question, influenced by a list of factors such as conditions of financial institutions, markets, regulators and the
       government.
          Case study analysis, especially of East Asian countries tend to be supportive some financial repression,
       especially at the early stages of development. In China, Huang and Wang (2011) find empirical evidence that repressive
       polices helped economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to the prudent liberalization approach. However, the effect
       turned negative in the 2000s as lending to the state sector, interest rate regulation and capital account controls constrained
       growth. Demetriades and Luintel (2001) develop a theoretical model which predicts a positive association between financial
       development and the degree of state control over the banking system and mild repression of lending rates. They use data from
       Korea to derive empirical findings that are consistent with this theoretical prediction. Ang (2009) studies the links between financial
       policies and private investment. In the case of Malaysia, high reserve and liquidity requirements exerted a positive influence on
       private investment. However, in the case of India, the effect was negative.
          Recent cross-country panel regression results are largely supportive of financial sector reforms. A large body
       of literature suggests that a well-developed financial sector promotes economic growth (e.g. Levine, 2005). However, relatively
       few studies tries to assess the impact of financial sector reforms on economic growth. Bakaert, Havery, and Lundblad (2005)
       finds that foreign equity ownership increases growth. Quinn and Toyoda (2008) document that capital account liberalization is
       positively associated with growth. Prati et al. (2013) finds strong positive effects of financial sector reforms on growth. Finally,
       Cristiansen et al. (2013) find that domestic financial reforms are robustly associated with growth.
          Some authors argue that a time series approach is more fruitful than a cross-section approach, though the
       use of instruments could potentially overcome this methodological criticism. Arestis and Demetriades (1997) worry that
       the question of causality cannot be satisfactorily addressed in a cross-section framework. Their criticism, in turn, has given rise to
       the series of cases studies mentioned above. They show uni-directional causality in Germany from financial development to real
       GDP   , but insufficient evidence of such effects in the US, with abundant evidence of reverse causality. While modern econometrics
       has developed in recent decades, the problem of causality (or more generally, endogenity) continues to be a challenge in this
       sub-set of the cross-section / panel approach in this literature, which implies that it often refers to association rather than causality
       between variables. The work by Prati et al. (2013) represents an attempt to overcome this challenge as the authors use the
       Difference GMM estimator which relies on internal instruments in the form of lagged dependent variables.

BOX 7.2: A Theoretical Model of Financial Repression and Interest Rate liberalizationa
A theoretical framework was developed to support the analysis of Ethiopia’s financial sector reform options.
This approach has the advantage of ensuring logical consistency of argument, clarifying the underlying assumptions while also
yielding additional insights that may not be immediately intuitive. To illustrate the key ideas, we utilize the two period version of
a more general model developed by Eden (2015) for this report. The main features of the model are described below.
   The model has two periods and four agents: Households, firms, government and the government bank.
   Output depends positively on private capital and infrastructure (as complementary inputs) and exhibits diminishing returns.
   Private capital is produced by firms. They borrow from the government bank in the first period to finance capital in the
second period and maximize profits given the borrowing interest rate and the returns to capital (which depend positively on
infrastructure).
   Supply of savings. Households receive income from firms and pay taxes. Utility is derived from consumption in both periods
and is maximized taking into account the subjective discount rate and the deposit interest rate. In equilibrium, household savings
depend positively on the deposit rate.
   The government has four policy instruments: infrastructure, taxes, the policy deposit rate, and, the lending rate. The
government objective is to maximize household welfare. It collects lump sum taxes in both periods and there is a cost associated
with collecting taxes.
   The model has three interest rates. The policy rate is an upper bound on the deposit rate faced by households. The deposit
rate is the return on household saving and represent the borrowing cost to the government bank. Under financial repression, the
policy rate is equal to the deposit rate. If there is no financial repression then the policy rate can be higher than the decentralized
equilibrium rate. The borrowing rate is what firms pay to borrow and it represents a revenue for the government bank. The spread
is equal to the borrowing rate less the deposit rate and is a net revenue for government.
   The optimal policy consists of some financial repression because this reduces the costs associated with
collecting taxes. The lower deposit interest rate (equal to the policy rate) associated with government debt allows the government
to economize on tax collection costs, in both periods. In optimum, the marginal return to private capital is equal to the returns
of infrastructure, net of the marginal costs associated with raising taxes (in period 2). The model abstracts away from costs
associated with the collection of private debt. If these costs are equal to tax collection costs, then it is optimal to equalize the
returns to government and private capital, as in Eden and Kraay (2014ab). Optimality requires that the marginal costs of taxation
are also equalized across periods.
   In optimum, the government sets a positive interest spread. Given the depressed deposit rate, the government
can either ration credit to the private sector or set a spread so that the market for private credit clears. The latter alternative is
superior because the spread generates revenues for the government without further distorting private investment. This allows
the government to economize on costs associated with tax collection. Furthermore, the price mechanism guarantees that private
credit is allocated to the private projects with the highest return. Credit rationing, on the other hand, requires some guess work
regarding where are the highest-return projects: since the interest rate is depressed, inefficient projects may find it optimal to
request financing. At a higher borrowing rate, only the more productive projects will be profitable.
   Policy Scenario 1 (financial repression with more private credit) can be illustrated in the model by
simulating alternative values of the government infrastructure variable. The properties of the theoretical model
can be illustrated by assuming plausible functional forms, including Cobb Douglass production and utility functions and a
quadratic tax collection cost function. Figure 1 illustrates the effect of alternative values of government infrastructure (kg) on
other variables in the model.
   There is an optimum level of government infrastructure, kg*, namely the level that maximizes welfare. For kg < kg*
there is insufficient crowding-in of infrastructure and production and consumption is too low. For kg > kg* infrastructure crowd-out
private capital via the credit markets and this lowers production and consumption as well.
   The following additional results hold: First, the future tax burden is rising in government infrastructure. Second, any
decrease in government infrastructure will be compensated by a corresponding increase in private capital. Third, the deposit
interest rate is rising in infrastructure up to the optimum, but unaffected thereafter.
   An increase in private credit would be welfare enhancing if there is currently too much government
infrastructure. In Figure 1, this situation can be illustrated by considering a situation where we are at a point to the right of
optimum and reduce the level of government infrastructure investment. As also illustrate, this would result in an increase in
private capital. As long as government infrastructure is not reduced too much, welfare is enhanced as more private capital can
be invested. At the margin, additional private investment boosts production and consumption more than the resulting loss from
lower infrastructure investment.

104         ETHIOPIA’S GREAT RUN – THE GROWTH ACCELERATION AND HOW TO PACE IT




        BOX 7.2: A Theoretical Model of Financial Repression and Interest rate liberalizationa (continued)
           Policy Scenario 2 (interest rate liberalization) can be illustrated in the model by simulating alternative values
        of the deposit rate. Recall that the deposit rate is the return on household saving and represent the borrowing cost to the
        government bank.
           There is an optimum level of the deposit rate, r*, namely the level that maximizes welfare. Consider very low levels
        of the deposit rate, say zero. As the policy rate increases so does the return to household savings. This encourages households
        to save rather than consume and the total pool of savings increases in the economy. However, since the government must pay
        the deposit rate to borrow from households, the borrowing cost to finance government infrastructure is rising. The first effect
        continues to dominate the second effect until welfare is maximized at the point indicated in the welfare graph below. Beyond
        this point, the deposit rate becomes ineffective as a policy tool as further increases in the rate are matched by additional savings
        which ultimately drives down the decentralized equilibrium rate, r, to its maximum level.
           The following additional results hold: First, the future tax burden is rising in the deposit rate because higher taxes
        compensate for the increased borrowing cost of government. Second, private investment is rising in the deposit rate as more
        savings is made available to finance it.
           Interest rate liberalization will be welfare enhancing if the deposit rate is currently too low. The larger deposit
        rate encourages household savings and enhances the amount of private investment that can be financed.
           However, government revenues will decline. The government bank earns a revenue from the difference between the
        borrowing rate and the deposit rate. As the deposit rate rises, the spread diminishes, and eventually disappears.

Notes: This table reports the results from a series of regressions of changes in real GDP on changes in public investment, with country and year
fixed effects. All changes are in constant local currency units and are scaled by lagged GDP   . The sample consists of IDA-eligible countries (first
three columns) and IDA-eligible countries in Africa (second three columns). Panel A reports OLS estimates, Panel B reports 2SLS estimates, and
Panel C reports the corresponding first-stage regressions. Weak instrument-consistent confidence intervals are based on the Moreira Likelihood Ra-
tio statistic. Changes in predicted disbursements on loans from official creditors are used as an instrument for changes in government investment
in Panel B. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered at the country level are indicated in parentheses. * (**) (***) indicates significance
at the 10 (5) (1) percent level.

  BOX 8.1: Structural Reform Indices: Data and Definitions
  The data on structural reforms cover more than ninety developed and developing countries, and span a fairly
  long period of time, namely 1973 to 2006. These data are taken from Prati et al. (2013), which are in turn based on
  databases constructed by Abiad et al. (2008) and Ostry et al. (2009). The indices of structural reforms are categorized into
  two groups: real sector and financial sector reforms.
     The reform indicators in the real sector comprise openness to international trade and domestic product market
  liberalization. Openness to international trade is measured along two dimensions: average tariff rates and restrictions
  (or lack thereof) on current account transactions (including payments and receipts on exports and imports of goods and
  services). The average tariff index takes the value 0 if average tariff rates are 60 percent or higher, the value 1 if tariff
  rates are zero, and varies linearly for intermediate tariff rates. The degree of reforms in the product market is captured by
  two different indices. The first corresponds to the agricultural sector and measures the extent of state intervention (i.e. the
  presence of export marketing boards and price controls) in the market for the country’s main agricultural export commodity.
  The second captures the degree of liberalization (i.e. the extent of competition and regulatory quality) in the networks
  (telecommunications and electricity) sector.
     Financial sector reforms are captured by two indices measuring domestic finance and capital account
  liberalization. The indicator of domestic financial reform is derived as the average of six sub-indices. Five of them involve
  the banking system: (i) credit controls, such as subsidized lending and direct credit; (ii) interest rate controls, such as floors or
  ceilings; (iii) competition restrictions, such as entry barriers and limits on branches; (iv) the degree of state ownership; and
  (v) the quality of banking supervision and regulation. The sixth sub-index focuses on the securities markets and measures
  the degree of legal restrictions on the development of domestic bond and equity markets, and the existence of independent
  regulators. The index of capital account liberalization measures the intensity of restrictions on financial transactions for
  residents and nonresidents, as well as the use of multiple exchange rates. We use both the aggregate indicator of capital
  account reforms and two sub-indices of external capital account openness for resident and nonresident. The two sub-indices
  capture the degree of legal restrictions on residents’ versus nonresidents’ ability to move capital in and out the country.
     All reform indices range between 0 and 1: the higher the rating, the greater the degree of liberalization. We
  note that variations in the values of each index over time and across countries reflect differences in the absolute degree
  of economic liberalization within each sector. As the indices were constructed using different methodologies, quantitative
  differences in the values of the indices across sectors do not provide an exact measure of whether one sector is more
  liberalized than another.

What would be the potential impact on growth                                      peers would potentially have considerable impact
of structural reforms in Ethiopia? To address this                                on GDP per capita growth. In particular, the largest
question, we perform a benchmarking exercise based                                potential growth payoffs could be reaped from closing
on the cross-country growth regression model in Prati                             gaps in domestic financial reforms, the current account
et al. (2013), using the data set described in Box 8.1.                           and the capital account.
Effectively, we simulate the growth effect of closing                                 We acknowledge upfront that these results are
Ethiopia’s reform gap relative to relevant peer groups,                           only indicative. The results shed light on the potential
