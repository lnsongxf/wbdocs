                                Turkmenistan: Turkmenistan Coca-Cola Bottlers
                                              Project ID: 11662

    Fiscal year: 2012
    Guarantee holder: Coca-Cola Icecek A.S.
    Investor country: Turkey
    Gross exposure: US$8.7 million

    About the project:

    On June 25, 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$8.7 million to cover an investment by Coca-Cola Icecek
    A.S. (CCI) of Turkey in Turkmenistan Coca-Cola Bottlers (TCCB). The coverage is for a period of up to seven
    years against the risks of expropriation, transfer restriction, and war and civil disturbance.

    The project consists of the continued expansion and modernization of a soft drink bottling facility in the city
    of Ashgabat. TCCB bottles, distributes, and sells soft drink products throughout the country.

    Results achieved:
    MIGA has supported this project since 1999. Since then, TCCB has continued to grow and meet rising local
    demand by installing three additional production lines. TCCB has widened its reach by increasing its
    distribution and warehousing network.

    TCCB’s expansion and modernization contribute to the strengthening of local businesses through the
    procurement of raw materials. Eighty percent of plastic preforms are sourced from a local supplier, and TCCB
    procures pallets and propane from the local market. The project’s investment in human capital has continued
    to grow—from 185 jobs in 1999 to approximately 360 jobs in 2011, with wages and benefits 10 percent higher
    than the country-wide standards; additional staff is also expected to be added. Workers also benefit from the
    substantial transfer of technical and managerial expertise. There is anticipated employment growth among local
    suppliers of goods and services as TCCB’s production increases.

    The project is aligned with MIGA’s strategic priority of supporting South-South investments.
