I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Niger
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Niger regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Niger;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Niger;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Niger; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Niger.

       Use data to help inform the Niger country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In October and November 2012, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in Niger were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime
Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks/students;
the judiciary branch; activists or social mobilizers; and beneficiaries of World Bank projects. A
total of 194 stakeholders participated in the country survey (65%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned it accordingly or completed
questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Niger, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the World
Bank; the Bank’s future role in Niger, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Niger: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Niger was headed
   in the right or wrong direction, the most important development priorities, and which areas
   would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Niger.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Niger, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, agreement with
   various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to
   reduce poverty in Niger, with which groups the Bank should work more in Niger, and how
   they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty-four development areas, the extent to which the Bank’s work helps
   achieve sustainable development results in Niger, and the extent to which the Bank meets
   Niger’s need for financial instruments and knowledge services.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities (i.e., Analysis, Studies, Research, Data,
   Reports, Conferences): Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they consult
   Bank knowledge work and activities in the work they do, the areas on which the Bank should
   focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Niger: Respondents were asked to rate how significant
   a role the Bank should play in Niger’s development in the near future and to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Niger.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Niger, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 616 respondents (70% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2007. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.1; this was
        significantly higher than the mean rating received in the FY ’07 country survey (5.1).
             Respondents across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations had
              statistically similar levels of familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
              significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Niger, the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development
              results, and the Bank’s relevance to Niger’s development.

IV. General Issues facing Niger

Headed in the Right Direction

       When asked whether Niger was headed in the right or wrong direction, 55% of
        respondents indicated that Niger was headed in the right direction.
             A plurality of respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that Niger was
              headed in the right direction, except respondents from NGOs/CBOs/private
              foundations who were more likely to say that they were not sure whether Niger
              was headed in the right or wrong direction.

        received a mean rating of 6.7 across all respondents.
             Respondents from PMUs gave the highest ratings for the extent to which the
              Bank’s work achieves sustainable development results in Niger whereas
              respondents from NGOs/CBOs/private foundations and the media gave
              significantly lower ratings.
             Respondents across all geographic locations gave statistically similar ratings for
              the extent to which the Bank’s work achieves sustainable development results in
              Niger.

       Across all respondents, ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness in Niger
        received a mean rating of 6.6; this was statistically similar to the mean overall

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank (continued)

Greatest Weakness

       Nearly half of all respondents in the FY ’07 country survey indicated that the Bank’s
        greatest weakness in its work in Niger was imposing technocratic solutions without
        regard to political realities (47%).

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in just two of these thirty-four development areas.

             Respondents from academia/research institutes/students, bilateral or multilateral
              agencies, and other organizations had the highest ratings for the Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Transport” whereas respondents from local government,
              NGOs/CBOs/private foundations, the media, and employees of
              ministries/implementation agencies had significantly lower ratings.

             Respondents from PMUs had the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at
              “Water and sanitation” whereas respondents from the media, the office of the
              President/Prime Minister/Minister, and NGOs/CBOs/private foundations had

       Respondents in this year’s country survey gave lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        across most areas that could be compared to respondents in the FY ’07 country survey
        (those differences that reached statistical significance are noted in the graph).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Niger, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achiev e sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ab ility to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Niger. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security and nutrition;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’07 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to reduce poverty;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the health sector; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the education sector.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related
        to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Niger, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development result s.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

VII. World Bank Knowledge and Instruments

Knowledge: Frequency of Use

       There were some interesting stakeholder group differences in their usage of the World
        Bank’s knowledge work and activities.
             Pluralities of respondents from ministries/implementation agencies, local
              government, private sector/financial sector/private banks, the media, and
              academia/research institutes/students indicated that they consult World Bank
              knowledge work and activities a few times a year.
             A plurality of respondents from PMUs also indicated that they consult World
              Bank knowledge work and activities a few times a year; however, over a quarter
              of PMU respondents indicated that they consult the Bank’s knowledge work and
              activities weekly (27%).
             Although a plurality of respondents from the office of the President/Prime
              Minister/Minister indicated that they consult World Bank knowledge work and
