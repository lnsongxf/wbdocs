        PARTNERSHIP IN PRACTICE: ENGAGEMENT WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES   1
Foreword

                              able resource management practices, have contributed effectively
                              to safeguarding our global environment. Tragically, and despite their
                              contributions to the global environment and to human culture, indig-
                              enous societies are disappearing at an unprecedented rate. Indigenous
                              peoples worldwide continue to be vulnerable and suffer from devastat-
                              ing poverty, disease and discrimination.1

                              The adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Dr. Naoko Ishii               Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) highlights the important need to secure

                              indigenous peoples rely upon for their cultural, spiritual and physical
                              survival. Indigenous peoples are also highly vulnerable to the impacts
                              of climate change, given that they often reside in environmentally sensi-
                              tive areas.2

                              Indigenous peoples are not only victims of a deteriorating global envi-
                              ronment: they are also a source of effective solutions. Their knowledge
                              systems are critical to helping us cope with changing environmental
                              patterns and conditions. The remarkable spatial convergence between
                              the globally important biodiversity sites and indigenous lands, ter-
                              ritories and resources also presents an enormous opportunity for both
                              conserving biodiversity and supporting indigenous peoples’ livelihoods.

                              This publication updates a document on indigenous peoples prepared
                              by the GEF Secretariat in 2008. In recent years, the GEF has enhanced
                              its partnership with indigenous peoples. For example, it has developed
                              the GEF Policy on Agency Minimum Standards on Environmental and
                              Social Safeguards (which includes a safeguard policy on indigenous
                              peoples), the Principles and Guidelines for Engagement with Indig-
                              enous Peoples, and the establishment of the GEF Indigenous Peoples
                              Advisory Group. Moreover, GEF projects involving indigenous peoples
                              have more than doubled during the past six years to more than 220.

                              The GEF will continue to fulfill its mandate to conserve the global envi-
                              ronment through a multi-stakeholder approach, while supporting provi-
                              sions of the UNDRIP. We remain open to feedback and guidance from
                              our partners. And we invite indigenous groups and community organi-
                              zations to help the GEF continue to evolve as an effective mechanism
                              for championing the global commons.

                                       ethno-ecological councils serve as a forum to identify

staffed with Rama, Kriol and mestizo (mixed European
