                 7. Description of the Forest Investment Plan




• Small and medium-scale subsistence agriculture, with low economic profitability and
  weak articulation with the market, especially associated with high population growth;
• Extensive unsustainable livestock breeding, especially in the north and northeast
  areas of the country and within protected areas (associated with invasions, fires
  and high levels of deforestation);
• High unsustainable demand and inefficient consumption of fuelwood as a primary
  source of energy for cooking and heating (indigenous communities in rural areas);
• Illegal and unsustainable extraction of wood and fuelwood (around 50% in some
  regions);
• Invasions and usurpations related to illegal activities within protected areas; and,




                                          11
     • Forest fires.




     • Complexity and lack of harmonization of the forest regulatory framework;
     • Limited availability of financing for the sector;
     • Problems with land tenure and distribution;
     • Public policies of the forestry sector with little or no implementation due to the scarce
       budgetary allocation to the institutions responsible for doing so;
     • Low valuation of the goods and services of forest ecosystems;
     • Lack of partnerships (between producers and industry) to reach competitive markets.


FIP interventions aim to propose the strengthening of governance1	 and governability2	
in protected areas, prioritizing the restoration of deforested and degraded areas;
sustainable forest management, both in natural forests and in forest plantations; the
strengthening of the value chain of forest products (timber and non-timber) and
institutional strengthening as a transversal support action.


b) Lines of intervention and selected projects
FIP-supported resources will focus on catalyzing scalable projects to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in priority areas where the highest levels of
deforestation and forest degradation are evident, and there is a greater potential for
increased carbon pools. It will be based on the restoration of linked areas, first, with
new forest plantations related to established processes (such as the forest incentives
that Guatemala has been promoting for many years); and, second, the recovery of areas
that can be regenerated, especially those contained within the Guatemalan System of
Protected Areas (Sigap, for its acronym in Spanish), also with the purpose of reducing
the pressure on them and encouraging investment potential by the private sector.
The proposed lines of intervention and their objectives are:




1 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), forest governance refers to the set of measures by which a
society defines its goals and priorities for governing its forests. . It is also defined as a process of political interaction between strategic actors,
guided by a set of rules, norms and strategies that determine how power is exercised. For governance to take place, it is necessary for the associated
standards and processes to be legal, legitimate and include the different sectors involved, such as the Government and other civil society actors
(FAO, 2011).
2 According to Camou (2001), governability should be understood as “a state of dynamic equilibrium between the level of social demands and the
capacity of the political system (State/government) [sic] to respond legitimately and effectively."



                                                                          12
3 A group of people is considered indigenous by the fact that it descends from populations inhabiting the country or a geographic region to which
the country belonged at the time of the conquest, colonization or establishment of the present State borders and, whatever its legal status, preserves
all its own forms of institutionality and social, economic, cultural and political organization, or part of them (Cojtí, 2010: 112-113).

forest and plantations). In addition, it is a very active area in the Smallholder Forestry
Incentives Program (Pinpep, for its acronym in Spanish), with productive activities
in agroforestry systems that not only provide an alternative for employment generation,
but also contribute to the restoration of strategic zones for water production and food
security.


D. Alta Verapaz and Izabal Region:	 It has one of the mountainous systems with the
greatest ecosystem diversity and endemic species in Central America (Conap, 2008). It
constitutes the territory with the greatest opportunities for the development of productive
chains of both timber products of forest plantations, and agroforestry products of high value
in export markets. It also has high potential for strengthening ecotourism projects and
ecosystem services driven by women's groups, mostly of indigenous peoples. This region is
of high social importance given its Mayan population density (q'eqchi'and pocomchi') and its
relevance in conservation initiatives at the level of important protected areas of the country.
In terms of forestry, it constitutes the region with the greatest extension of plantations under
the forestry incentive programs, reaching the final harvest stage.
Based on the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and the FIP selection criteria, two
main projects were prioritized:


Project 1: Sustainable forest management and Project 3: Access to funding (public and
private). They are aimed at developing actions to improve and strengthen the services of
institutions such as INAB and Conap in the territories; that promote responsible forest
management and trade, and increase in the added value of agroforestry and
silvopastoral products; and, that facilitate access to public and private financing, both
within and outside protected areas. The objective of these project is to facilitate
and expand      the    participation   of    local   actors   (communities,    indigenous
peoples, municipalities, private sector, among others) in order to promote
sustainable forest management processes that drive the value chain of wood and
restoration of the forest landscape.
The scope of these project is focused on overcoming administrative, legal, technical and access
barriers to financing that limit the participation of local actors, which at the same time
restricts the potential to extend the coverage of sustainable management in the forest
landscape. Combining actions through FIP funding to help overcome these barriers will
result in greater involvement of actors in the territories, strengthening partnerships
between public sector institutions and, therefore, improving forest landscape management
in prioritized territories, based on areas where higher levels of deforestation and
degradation are identified.

 c) Overall expected results
 Within the framework of the lines of intervention and the proposed projects, contributions
 will be made to the achievement of the following results:

        • Reduction of GHG emissions through activities to mitigate climate change in the
         forestry sector;
        • Improvement of adaptation to climate change by reducing the vulnerability of
         local communities and increasing resilience;
        • Strengthening of the forestry sector (public and private, as well as local and
         community governments);
ci) Improvement of the efficiency of the wood forest-industry-market (FIM) production
 chain;
        • Improvement of forest governance and governability in protected areas and
         territories of indigenous peoples;
cii) Sustainable and integral management of the forest landscape to ensure the provision of
  environmental goods and services (water, fuelwood, among others).


 ci) Linkage to activities supported by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF)
 and the UN-REDD Programme.
 The investment opportunities identified and proposed under the FIP framework are
 directly related to actions funded by the FCPF and presented by Guatemala in the
 preparation of its National REDD+ Strategy, included in the Readiness Project Idea Note (R-
 PIN), the Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) and the Midterm Report. They are also
 congruent with the Emission Reduction Program Idea Note (ER-PIN) approved by the FCPF.
 The preparation of the National REDD+ Strategy is creating the conditions and
 methodological requirements necessary to favor the implementation phase and the results-
 based payments of this mechanism. The REDD+ strategy options, measures, activities and
 territories coincide with the FIP intervention areas. Therefore, the alignment of the
 preparation phase with the implementation phase is guaranteed.
 In addition, the FIP will contribute to the achievement of goals and commitments identified
 in the nationally foreseen and determined contributions (NDC), the National Climate
 Change Framework Law (Article 20, on emission reductions due to the change in land use)4	
 and the National Action Plan for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation.5

       11. Other actors involved in the design and implementation of
                         the Forest Investment Plan

The design of the investment plan has been led from the public sector by INAB and Conap,
within the framework of the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG).6	 Through workshops
at the regional and national levels, these institutions have involved forest
governance platforms that include second and third-level community-based
organizations (National Alliance of Forest Communities;7	 Association of Forest
Communities of Petén (Acofop, for its acronym in Spanish);8	 48 Cantones de
Totonicapán;      Smallholder   Forestry Incentives       Program (Pinpep); UtzChé;9	
Fedecovera10),	 NGOs (Fundaeco,11 Fundación Defensores de la Naturaleza,12	
Calmecac,13	 FundaLachuá,	 early initiatives from REDD+, Rainforest Alliance14),	
international organizations (IUCN, FAO, UNDP) and the private sector (Forest
Association, forest industry companies, private banking). All of these actors,
together with INAB and Conap, are part of the forest governance platform of
Guatemala, which not only confers legitimacy to the Forest Investment Plan, but also favors
a more adequate implementation, to the extent that it reflects the interests and priorities of
the different stakeholders.
Guatemala is made up of four groups: Mayan, Ladino or Mestizo, Xinka and Garífuna.
The country is characterized by its cultural diversity, which is why the Forest Investment
Plan considered relevant socio-linguistic aspects. Representatives of the following socio-
linguistic communities participated in the joint development of the investment plan:
kaqchikel, k'iche', mam, q'eqchi', ch'orti', ladino and poqomchi'. In addition, community-
based forest governance platforms and with representation of indigenous peoples
were involved, bringing together most of the first-level forest-related organizations,
including the National Alliance of Forest Communities and the Network of
Beneficiaries of Forest Incentive Programs, as well as several of its first-level
members. On the other hand, professional technicians belonging to the indigenous
peoples participated as part of the strategies in force in INAB and Conap to attend to
these people and the search for gender equity.

6 The IACG is integrated by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Food (MAGA), the National Forest Institute (INAB) and the National Council for Protected Areas (Conap). See the IACG agreement at: :

12.        Participation of indigenous peoples and local communities

Guatemala is made up of four groups: Mayan, Ladino or Mestizo, Xinka and Garífuna. The
country is characterized by its cultural diversity, which is why the Forest Investment Plan
considered relevant socio-linguistic aspects. Representatives of the following socio-
linguistic communities participated in the joint development of the investment plan:

cooperation with the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). This will allow expanding the range of public and private
investment opportunities to other productive sectors with the active participation of
private banks at the national level.

        14. Gender approach in the Forest Investment Plan

Government institutions participating in the Forest Investment Plan (CONAP and INAB,
as well as MAGA and MARN) have gender strategies and policies that should be transferred
to those programs and projects they develop. Also, in the framework of the preparation of
the National REDD+ Strategy, the IACG gender units or divisions have
developed, in a participatory manner and with multiple stakeholders (mainly
grassroots community leaders), a path on how to mainstream gender considerations
in all three phases of the REDD+ mechanism. The Investment Plan is aligned with the
institutional framework and gender policies of the IACG, and with the path for
the same topic elaborated by REDD+. This ensures the incorporation of the gender
perspective in the Forest Investment Plan.	

For this reason, the development of the plan was supported by Conap and INAB
gender experts, who collaborated in the different stages of formulation and, in addition,
during the workshops in the four selected regions. The national workshop included the
participation of women and groups of women from different fields: public sector, local
governments, indigenous peoples, agricultural cooperatives, private sector and NGOs, who
made relevant contributions to the design of the investment plan. These are reflected in
the approach, scope and indicators of the proposed projects.

                                           23
              Section 1. Description of the country and sector context


1.1         Country context (geography, demography and economy)
1.    Guatemala has a territory of 108,890 km2,	 of which 2,500	 km2	 correspond to rivers
      and lakes. Administratively it is divided into 22 departments and 340 municipalities,
      each subdivided into villages, hamlets and places with great climatic variety due to its
      topography, which goes from sea level to 4,220 meters, a condition that favors
      biological and cultural diversity (Raxché, 2012: 8). The country is made up of
      four towns: Mayan, Ladino or Mestizo, Xinka and Garífuna. According to the
      International Working Group on Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA), Guatemala stands out
      as the second largest country in Latin America (after Bolivia) with a larger
      proportion of indigenous population, with more than 6 million inhabitants (IWGIA,
      2016). According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), by 2015 the population
      would have reached 16.18 million inhabitants, of which 51.14% are women, and
      48.86% are men (INE, 2016). 51% of the population is located in the rural area,
      and the remaining 49%, in urban centers.
2.    According to social indicators, Guatemala had a population density of 148.7 inhabitants
      per 	km2 by 2015;	 a nominal per capita income of USD3,907; a Gini coefficient of 53.5;
      a life expectancy of 73.3 years; and, population growth of 2.4%. The
      Human Development Index (HDI) ranked it 128 out of 188 countries. The 2014
      National Living Conditions Survey (Encovi 2014) reports a literacy rate of 75% for
      women and 84% for men; the birth rate was 25.1 births annually per 1,000
      inhabitants, while the fertility rate was 3.1 infants per woman.15
3.    The Guatemalan economy is the largest in Central America.16	In fact, in recent years the
      country has had good economic performance,17	 with a GDP of USD 58.83 billion (2014)
      and an inflation of 2.4% (2015).18	 In 2015, the most important productive sectors and
      sources of income included commercial activity, manufacturing, agriculture (which
      takes into account livestock, forestry and fisheries), transport and communications,
      among others (Table 1).19

4.    The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, 2015) report indicates that Guatemala has
      made substantial improvements in areas such as health and education. However, with
      regard to poverty –the main objective of the Millennium Declaration, which largely
      synthesizes the progress made– there was a significant reversal from 18.1% in 1989 to
      23.4% in the period from 2014 to 2015. Extreme poverty and poverty in general are
      more acute for women, with a predominance of indigenous women.
5.    According to the aforementioned MDG final report (2015), employment still poses a
      serious challenge to the country due to low levels of labor productivity and the
      prevalence of employed EAP segments living in poverty and working on their own
      (which amounted to 20.1% and 40.5% in 2014, respectively). Women represent 53%
      of the working-age population (WAP). However, they only make up 37.1% of the
      WAP, a figure that is even lower among indigenous women. Although the salary level of
      women has improved in recent years, wage gaps still prevail in all sectors: indigenous
      women earn 54.5% of men's salaries, while non-indigenous women earn 62.9% (INE,
      2013).
6.    In 2009, the contribution of forests to gross domestic product (GDP) was 2.6% (Iarna-
      URL, 2012). However, the forestry sector and State policies are a very important engine
      for employment generation, in particular, and for the rural economy in general. At the
      same time, forests provide ecosystem and prevention services to natural disasters of
      very high relevance; they also contribute to the improvement of the quality and
      quantity of water flows.



1.2     Sectoral context
7.    Despite the economic ups and downs of the financial products of the decade of 2010
      (Table	 1),	 favorable growth has been observed in the last five years (2011-2015),
      especially in the trade, manufacturing industry and agriculture and forestry sectors (the
      latter occupying the third place in order of importance). Table 1 presents a summary of
      GDP by sector up to the first quarter of 2016.

8.       The first occupation of women is commerce, since 40.5% of women work in commerce;
          the manufacturing industry comes in second place, especially the maquila and informal
         commerce, where 13.4% of them work. There are some economic activities that fail to
         reflect the reality of the situation and condition of women's employment. For example,
         in agriculture, 14% of workers are women, although in reality this figure could be
         higher since the work of women in the sector is seen as a complementary activity and,
         sometimes, it is not even remunerated.

1.3              Forests and land use

9.       Given the country's high cultural, genetic, species and ecosystem diversity, the country
         has been included among the select group of twenty related megadiverse
         countries, which account for about 70% of the planet's biodiversity.20

10. Guatemala's forest cover map, published in 2012, estimated forest cover for 2010 at
    3,722,595 hectares, corresponding to 34.19% of the national territory. The coverage for
    2006 was 3,866,383 ha, 35.53% of the national territory. This represents an annual net
    loss of 38,597 ha, equivalent to an annual deforestation rate of 1% during the period
    2006-2010. The data correspond to the difference between the gross annual loss of
    natural forests (132,138 ha) and the gain between forest plantations and natural
    regeneration (93,541 ha) during that period (INAB, Conap, UVG and URL, 2012).


20 During the X Conference of the Parties in Nagoya, Japan, Guatemala was included in the Group of Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries
and recognized as a "world power in biological diversity" (Conap, 2011).



                                                                                                       26
11. Recent studies developed by the Inter-Agency Group for Forest Monitoring and Land
    Use (Gimbot, for its acronym in Spanish; 2014) established the following figures for
    2012: a) agricultural territories, 37.6%; b) forests, 34.74%; c) means with shrub and/or
    herbaceous vegetation, 23.48%; d) open spaces with little or no vegetation, 0.33%; e)
    wetland areas, 0.98%; f) bodies of water, 1.64%; g) human settlements, 1.28%; and, (h)
    areas with no formations due to the effects of clouds or shadows (0.45%). Figure 1
    presents the forest and land use map for the year 2012 (although it was published in
    2014).

               Figure 1. Guatemala: Map of forests and land use (2012,

12. In addition to their social, economic and environmental importance, forests in
    Guatemala have a high cultural significance, since they constitute sacred sites and
    elements of the worldview of local peoples and communities whose average population
    percentage     is   close     to      60%.  The    direct   relationship   between
    indigenous peoples, conservation and responsible management of forests, especially
    concerning the use of water, forest and wildlife in the k'iché, q'eqchi', q'anjobal
    and mam linguistic communities (Calas, 2003a; 2003b; 2003c and 2007), is widely
    documented. However, this group of the Guatemalan population presents the
    highest levels of unsustainable fuelwood consumption, as well as a substantial
    increase in small-scale agriculture..
13. The ownership and tenure of land and forests in Guatemala is distributed as follows: a)
    State, 34%; b) municipalities, 8%; c) private companies, 38%; d) community groups,
    15%;21	and, e) others, 5% (R-PP Guatemala, 2013: 70).
14. Regarding the public administration of existing forests, 48% is INAB's responsibility,
    while the remaining 52% is managed by Conap, because it is within Sigap (R-PP
    Guatemala, 2013: 63).
15. It is important to note that land held by individual community/indigenous owners is
    fragmented and the plots of land are often small and overlapping, while in
    collective communal lands, the lack of clarity with respect to the ownership and
    tenure of the lands occupied by these groups contributes to tensions and conflicts with
    other actors, including the State itself (R-PP Guatemala, 2013: 70).22 There are no legal
    restrictions on the possession of women's land; however, this equality before the law is
    not reflected in reality. Women holding agricultural land, for example, represent
    only 7.8% of all individual holders, and these properties are mostly used for
    agricultural activities (INE, 2003). This is due to attitudes, behaviors and treatments of
    discrimination rooted in the patriarchal system that still predominates in society.

1.4      Status and trends of forest resources

1.4.1 Main agents of deforestation and degradation
16. In Guatemala, deforestation and forest degradation are multi-causal phenomena in
which direct and indirect causes are identified. The following stand out among the first: a)
land use change, especially for small and medium-scale agricultural purposes; b) extensive
cattle raising, especially in areas in the north of the country; c) demand for fuelwood as

21 According to Article 4 of the regulations of the Pinpep Law, communal lands are defined as those "[..].areas where the
rights of tenure, possession and/or ownership of land are shared collectively by a particular community or
social group."
22 The management of natural resources in communal lands is key to the livelihood strategies of local populations, mainly in
protected areas. However, several problems affect collective management in these tenure systems, such as the precariousness of
communal tenure rights and the growing conflict over control, access and appropriation of natural resources on communal lands
(Grupo Promotor de Tierras Comunales, 2009).


                                                              28
      a primary source of energy for food cooking and heating (INAB,	 2010	 and	 2015);23	
      d) illegal logging; (e) invasions and appropriation of land linked to illegal groups
      within protected areas; f) forest fires whose main causes are intentional burning
      and land preparation for agriculture and livestock (Sipecif, 2009) and, to a lesser
      extent, forest pests (Moore and Allard, 2009).


17. According to the National Strategy for the Sustainable Production and Efficient Use of
    Firewood 2013-2014 (INAB, 2015), the annual supply of fuelwood is 17.96 million	m3.	 Of
    this amount, 85% comes from natural forests; 14%, from forest plantations;
    and, 1%, from industry waste. However, the annual demand for fuelwood is
    estimated at 27.98 million	 m3,	 with 85% of rural domestic consumption and
    13% and 2% of domestic urban and industrial consumption, respectively.
    These data reflect a deficit of 10.02 million m3	 with respect to what grows in the
    forest. According to the Institutional Action Plan for the Prevention and Reduction
    of Illegal Logging (INAB, 2010), it is estimated that illegal logging for fuelwood
    production accounts for 30% to 50% of the volume of wood harvested per year.

18. The following predominate among the indirect (underlying) causes: (a) lack of
    valuation of forest assets and biodiversity; b) public policies favorable to agriculture
    and other sectors (such as livestock), to the detriment of forestry; c) lack of clarity in
    land tenure and distribution systems; d) institutional weaknesses in the monitoring
    of forest management and in combating corruption and illegal logging; (e)
    limited resources to strengthen the justice system in high-impact cases, such as
    invasions and usurpations of protected areas; f) little access to financial capital
    for long-term investments such as those demanded by forest management; and, g)
    population growth, increased poverty and lack of forest culture (Iarna-URL, 2012).

19. Under this threat scheme, it is evident that the dynamics of forests in Guatemala have
    always been marked by a recurring loss. If the baseline is 6,973,924 ha, it is estimated
    that during the period between 1950 and 2002, the initial area and the final area of
    forests decreased by 50%. During that time, the areas used for agriculture, grazing and
    other uses increased by 39%, 6% and 5%, respectively (Iarna-URL, 2012).

20. According to the aforementioned study by the Institute of Agriculture, Natural
    Resources and Environment of Universidad Rafael Landívar (Iarna-URL, 2012), 115



23 The population -mainly boys, girls and women- is at high risk of respiratory and heart disease, resulting in more than 5,000 deaths, with
losses equivalent to 1% of the GDP. Estimates for the next ten years indicate that some 65,000 new families will consume fuelwood,
which        accentuates          the       problem         (Global         Alliance       for       Clean        Cookstoves,        2014).
For more information, see: http://cleancookstoves.org/resources_files/guatemala-plan-de-accion.pdf



                                                                     29
      areas with deforestation were identified throughout the country, where 42% occurred
      on 5 fronts (especially in the north of the country and within protected areas24) and the
      other 58%, occurs in 110 areas distributed in the rest of the national territory. In the
      latter case, the loss of coverage is related to urbanization, fuelwood collection, small-
      scale agriculture, logging on coffee and sugar plantations, forest fires, pests and
      diseases, among other factors.

21. The annual gross profit of forest cover for the period 2001-2006 increased significantly
    compared with the decade from 1991 to 2001, from 19,987 to 53,768 ha per year. This
    trend continued in 2006-2010, a period in which an annual gross profit was reached in
    forest cover equivalent to 93,541 ha. By the end of 2015, 133,638.23 ha had been
    reforested and 232,765.59 ha subjected to natural regeneration management through
    the National Forest Incentives Program (Pinfor, for its acronym in Spanish), for a total
    result of 366,403.82 ha.

22. However, most of the volume of wood generated by the country is traded with a low
    added value of primary products, such as lumber boards, beams, among others. Only
    18% of the wood exported in 2008 consisted of products with high added value: doors,
    furniture, staves, etc. Exports were dominated by more than 70% by conifers (pine
    species alone accounted for 60% of exports in the period 1997-2008) (World Bank,
    2010). However, the export trend remains positive (INAB, 2012).



1.4.2 Changes in forest cover
23. Comparing the 2006 and 2010 coverage maps, the annual net forest loss was 38,597 ha,
    equivalent to an annual deforestation rate of 1.0%. This figure is 20% lower than
    during the period 2001-2006, for which the net forest loss was 48,084 ha.

24. A major event for Guatemala in 2010 was the promulgation of the Forest Incentives Act
    for Small Land Holders of Forest or Agroforestry Vocation, Decree 51-2010 (better known
    as the Pinpep Law),25	 whose purpose is to support holders of small tracts of land, with
    a forest or agroforestry vocation, of less than 15 hectares. By 2016 this program has
    encouraged the reforestation and management of 69,405.29 ha, which has benefited a
    total of 95,978 users, including 84,213 women (INAB, 2016).26 27 The evolution of

24 Iarna-URL (2012) reports that from every four hectares lost in the period 2006-2010, three happened within the Sigap, and one outside it.
25 According to this law, the Pinpep was assigned between 0.5% and 1% of the State's budget.

27 Prior to Pinpep, the National Forest Incentives Program (Pinfor) was created in 1997 as a tool for the long-term national forest policy,
which began in 1997 and runs until 2016. Pinfor plantations that are reaching their harvest period will be part of the strengthening actions in
the Forest Investment Plan.

1.4.3 Estimation of carbon pools and GHG emissions in priority areas

25. In 2014, Guatemala conducted a preliminary approach to its GHG emissions at the
national level according to the five sub-national REDD+ regions, and it was determined that
in the reference period 2001-2010, about 11.48 million tCO2e were emitted annually (FCPC,
2014). Table 3 provides an approximate summary of these estimates. The FIP will support

26. These preliminary calculations are being updated and refined by Gimbot, based on
    technical advice from Winrock International. In addition, it is important to indicate that
    these scenarios are elaborated according to the methodological framework of the
    Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) for the period 2001-2010.

27. On the basis of national inventories of 2005 (MARN, 2015a), it has been determined
    that Guatemala has had an average growth of total GHG emissions of 31.45 million
    tCO2e, of which 8.51 million tCO2e (approximately 27%) correspond to the land use,
    land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. It was also reported that the country has
    had an average growth of emissions of 0.90 million tCO2e per year in the period
    1990-2005 (Figure 3).

           Section 2. Identification of GHG reduction opportunities


2.1      Specific emission reduction opportunities

 1.     In Guatemala's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), published in
      2015,28	 Guatemala aims to contribute to reduce up to 22.6% of its projected GHG
      emissions by 2030, across all productive sectors, which is a target conditioned to
      financing. It is estimated that through the strengthening of the activities
      contemplated in the Law of Protected Areas, Decree 4-89; Forest Law, Decree 101-96;
      Forest Incentives Act for Small Land Holders of Forest or Agroforestry Vocation, Pinpep,
      Decree 51-2010; and, Law in favor of Forests, Decree 2-2015, and its
      articulation with the National REDD+ Strategy, can contribute to this goal, taking into
      account that the land use, land-use change and forestry sector contributed with 27%
      of the total emissions in 2005 (expected to be much more significant with the data
      being updated).

 2.     Based on analyses and diagnoses carried out at the national level on the agents
      of deforestation and forest degradation -described in section 1.4.1,- it is necessary
      to design interventions to address the direct and indirect causes of this problem from
      an integral approach. This means that, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, forests
      can improve the livelihoods of the rural population, respecting the rights of
      indigenous peoples and local communities, conserving biodiversity and generating
      benefits (social, cultural and economic).

 3.      The FIP's investment opportunities will, thus, be focused on areas where the
      highest levels of deforestation and forest degradation are generated. They will also
      seek the restoration of degraded ecosystems through increased carbon pools. Table 4
      presents an analysis of the relationships of direct and indirect causes and the
      identification of opportunities for emission reductions within the objectives of the FIP.

         (PAs) and those related to indigenous peoples and local communities. This, within the
         framework of respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and the rights of women.32	
         It involves actions to promote institutional strengthening, so that institutions provide
         legitimate and effective responses to the following social demands: a) satisfactory
         provision of services to the population, based on a consistent, inclusive and adaptable
         legal and technical framework; b) institutional coordination for the control and
         surveillance of the territories; c) development of productive and conservation pilot
         projects in areas with high ecosystem value; d) support to forest management and
         administration processes; e) development of productive alternatives (in accordance
         with the legal framework) for the improvement and diversification of livelihoods; (f)
         strengthening and building of partnerships between the Government and
         indigenous peoples and their authorities, local communities and women's groups,
         enabling joint management of the natural heritage, facilitating access to and
         conservation of the natural heritage.
2.3 Intervention approach
5.     From a holistic view of land management, the development of a forestry landscape
      approach and an effective level of intersectoral and programmatic coordination are
      proposed, considering the fulfillment of FIP criteria, the generation of social, economic
      and environmental co-benefits, and interconnectivity with natural ecosystems, so as to
      ensure effective reduction of the causes of deforestation and forest degradation. At the
      programmatic level, a link is expected between management initiatives in natural
      forests (Conap) and processes of restoration of the forest landscape with the support of
      the forest incentives programs (INAB).
 6.     The aim in these territories is to promote and facilitate the participation of local
      actors in partnership with public sector entities, with a view to promoting the
      sustainable management of the forest landscape. This will be achieved by: a)
      improving the efficiency of administrative, technical, legal and operational
      processes provided by institutions authorized by law for forest management
      (INAB, Conap, Diprona, Municipalities); b) access to public and private financing; (c)
      access to markets; and, d) improved participation in decision-making and control and
      monitoring of activities in the territory (governance and governability).
 7.     In each of the selected geographic regions, the potential projects to be developed will be
      prioritized, in accordance with the legal mandates of the public administrative
      institutions, according to their categories (Conap within protected areas and INAB
      outside protected areas), as well as the incorporation of inputs from the processes of
      socialization and collection of information that have been developed in each priority
32 According to the diagnosis made through the Grupo Promotor de Tierras Comunales, in 2007 there were 1,306 cases of communal land in
Guatemala, with a total area of 1,577,129 hectares (15,771 km²), equivalent to 14.48% of the national territory, with representativeness in all the
cultural and ecological areas of the country (INAB, 2013).

                       Section 3. Legal framework and enabling conditions


3.1        Legal framework
1.     The main rules governing the management of forest resources in Guatemala are the
       Protected Areas Act, Decree 4-89;33 the Forest Law, Decree 101-96, which includes Pinfor;
       the Forest Incentives Act for Small Land Holders of Forest or Agroforestry Vocation,
       Pinpep, Decree 51-2010;34	 and, the Law Promoting the Establishment, Recovery,
       Restoration, Management, Production and Protection of Forests in Guatemala,
       Probosque, Decree 2-2015.35	 The first of these legal bodies established the Sigap under
       the authority of Conap. This system groups a total of 243 protected areas covering
       more than 3.2 million ha, equivalent to 32% of the national territory.
2.     INAB currently manages the forestry incentive programs known as Probosque36	 and
       Pinpep. Both Pinfor (completed at the end of 2016) and Pinpep have allowed
       the protection, production, reforestation and implementation of agroforestry
       activities in more than 435,809.11 ha of national forests. Both have benefited more
       than 900,000 landowners and holders. Pinpep supports the forestry activity of
       small farmers without title deeds, in areas from 0.1 ha. The Government has invested
       more than USD290 million in both programs over the last seventeen years. As of
       2017, the Law Promoting the Establishment, Recovery, Restoration, Management,
       Production and Protection of Forests in Guatemala, Probosque, has been in operation and
       will be for 30 years (2017-2046).
3.     These policies have resulted in the participation and distribution of benefits among
       forest land owners and holders, as well as between local communities. They have also
       contributed to the conservation and economic development of the poorest and most
       vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples and women's groups (INAB, 2015a).
       Between 1988 and 2015, more than 4.1 million people (of which 30% were women)
       benefited from Pinfor, while between 2007 and 2015, 135,000 people benefited from
       Pinpep, of which 57% were beneficiaries belonging to indigenous peoples, and 30%
       were women.
4.     The	 Probosque Law	 provides for allocating not less than 1% of the national budget –
       around USD40 million annually- to promote protection, restoration and good forestry
       practices. It is expected that for the period between 2017 and 2046 one of the impacts

33 Among others, establishes that each protected area is created by law in accordance with the procedure established in Article 12.
34 Hereafter, Pinpep Law.
35 Hereafter, Probosque Law.
36 The validity of the Pinfor was stipulated in the law that created it (Forest Law of 1997). Therefore, the program has concluded its
activities in 2016. Many of the benefits of Pinfor related to forest plantations will form a core part of the actions proposed by the FIP. 5

     of this law is the establishment of 1.2 million ha of forest. This would benefit more than
     1.5 million rural families (where 30% would be women) (INAB, 2015a). Figure
     4 presents the process of institutionalization of the different instruments of forest
     policy and regulation in Guatemala over the last 25 years.


5.   Another standard that is relevant to mention in terms of the development of the Forest
     Investment Plan is the Framework Law to Regulate Vulnerability Reduction, Mandatory
     Adaptation to the Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, Decree 7-
     2013. This instrument identifies the LULUCF sector as a priority within adaptation and
     mitigation strategies.

6. Other policies and plans affecting forest management in Guatemala include the forest
policy, the agrarian policy, the National Forestry Agenda, the National Biodiversity Strategy
and Biodiversity Policy (including the 2012-2022 Action Plan), the Forest Concession Policy of
the MBR; the Forest Fire Prevention and Control System (Sipecif); the Inter-Agency Action
Plan for the Prevention and Reduction of Illegal Logging in Guatemala, the National Strategy
for the Sustainable Production and Efficient Use of Firewood, the National Forestry Landscape

     Action Plan on Climate Change, among others.


7. In this regard, it is important to note that there are different laws and standards in
   which the links between gender, forests and climate change are observed. Regarding
   laws that affect forest management, the Pinpep Law includes among its objectives to
   promote gender equity, prioritizing the participation of women in the management of
   natural forests, the establishment and maintenance of forest plantations and
   agroforestry systems. The Framework Law on Climate Change, Decree 07-2013, includes
   among the guiding principles that Integrality, which consists of “[...] considering cultural
   and ethnic relevance as well as the gender perspective, in the design of plans, programs
   and actions,” must be observed in decision-making and actions.
8. Similarly, the Law on Dignification and Integral Promotion of Women, Decree 7-99,
   establishes in article 16 that it was created to promote and guarantee a better quality of
   life for women. The Government, on the other hand, will promote policies regarding
   development and a real harmonious relation with nature, oriented towards the good use
   of its resources. It shall also take all necessary actions to restrict the use of technologies
   that violate, degrade or endanger the balance of the ecological system, the biosphere
   and the national environment.

3.2       REDD+ Strategy37
9.    Guatemala has made significant progress in the development of the National REDD+
      Strategy, the most recent revision of which has been presented in a midterm report
      approved by the FCPF in May 2016. The document stresses that Guatemala's REDD+
      efforts focus on the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)38	 and the
      agreements made at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties of the
      United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP 21). In
      addition, its actions are aimed at supporting the GHG emissions reduction proposal for
      the period 2020-2030 in the Nationally Foreseen and Determined Contribution (NDC)
      submitted in 2015,39	and the	National Climate Change Plan.



37 Annex 4 includes a description of the progress made in the preparation of the National REDD+ Strategy for Guatemala.

10. In line with the Cancun Safeguards, Guatemala's National REDD+ Strategy guides,
   integrates and coordinates national forest policies, strategies and programs in a
   coherent manner for effective implementation. At the same time, it seeks to strengthen
   the capacities of local institutions related to forest management and organization in the
   country. The strategy addresses complementary components: organization and
   consultation; preparation of the REDD+ Strategy; development of reference scenarios
   and design of a forest monitoring system and safeguards. The proposed REDD+ options
   are: a) strengthening of the Guatemalan System of Protected Areas (Sigap); and, b)
   strengthening of the economic instruments of the Forest Law (Government of
   Guatemala, 2016), which agree with the projects proposed in the Investment Plan.
11. Several platforms participate in the preparatory process for REDD+ in Guatemala:
   a) the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) made up of MARN, MAGA, Conap and
   INAB; and b) the Forests, Biodiversity and Climate Change Group (GBByCC, for its
   acronym in Spanish), made up of representatives from the private sector, academia,
   NGOs, local communities, women, indigenous peoples, civil society, and others. The
   latter includes the following commissions:	
    a) Inter-Agency Group for Forest Monitoring and Land Use (Gimbot), made up of the
   institutions of the IACG and two private sector universities in Guatemala; b)
   the Multisector REDD+ Safeguards Committee (CMSREDD, for its acronym in Spanish);
   and, c) REDD+ GIREDD + Implementers Group (Guatecarbón, Lacandón, Costa Caribe
   and Funda-Lachuá), made up of agencies from the sector, indigenous peoples and
   local governments (ER-PIN, 2014).
12. In order for REDD+ processes to be effectively implemented, it is important to include the
   gender approach, and thereby contribute to the empowerment of women, promote
   compliance with international commitments on gender equality, ensure a human rights-
   based approach to development, establish frameworks for effective participation (especially
   for women in rural areas), and increase the recognition of women as important managers,
   key stakeholders and decision makers on forests and forest management.40

13. The preparation of the strategy is coordinated by the IACG and its components are
   being developed jointly with multiple stakeholders (private sector, local
   communities, indigenous peoples, local governments, NGOs, academia, women's
   associations, among others). The agenda that is taken into account includes: a)
   organization; b) participation and consultation; c) strategy options; d) emission
   reference levels; and, e) emission monitoring and safeguard systems, among others.41
14. During this process, the gender units of the entities that form the IACG –with technical
    and financial support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature
    (IUCN), technical support from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
    and the participation of leaders of indigenous organizations and various
    associations– have carried out, between 2015 and 2016, four workshops aimed at
    strengthening the technical capacities of community leaders with regard to climate
    change, forests and the REDD+ mechanism. A proposal is also being made of the
    roadmap for incorporating gender considerations into the National REDD+
    Strategy, based on: land tenure; distribution of benefits; diversification of
    livelihoods; well-being of women; good governance; maintenance and improvement
    of biodiversity and environmental services; full and effective participation; and,
    compliance with laws, treaties and conventions to meet social and environmental
    safeguards.
15. This entire legal, institutional and policy framework, the level of consolidation of forest
    governance platforms and their participation in forest management, as well as the
    participation of multiple stakeholders in the elaboration of the National REDD+ Strategy
    and the Emission Reduction Program Idea (ER-PIN), represent a solid foundation that

41 Idem.



                                                             44
      generates the necessary enabling conditions for the implementation of the FIP, which
      comes to strengthen the processes that Guatemala is developing.

3.3     Some political and institutional limitations and challenges
16. While there is a political and legal framework for forest management, it is not
   sufficiently consolidated in relation to other sectors prioritized by the Government. At
   least not enough to make forest resources a true pillar of rural economic development
   and a strategic axis of adaptation and mitigation in the face of climate change.
17. In addition, both governance and good forest management are constrained by limited
    budget allocations compared to other sectors. The tax support system allocates only
    0.15% of the GDP to the administration of natural resources (forests) through the
    budgets of INAB, Conap and MARN (R-PP, 2013). This, coupled with low private
    investment in the forestry sector, increases the risks of natural capital deterioration, as
    well as conflict and socio-environmental vulnerability.
18. Another limitation on the financing of incentive programs is the delay in payment
   schedules. The uncertainty that this generates prevents such payments from being used
   as debt collaterals due to the unreliability of the payments. Therefore, some previous
   attempts to develop financial mechanisms within the forestry sector have not
   prospered when they are released. In addition, forest management also faces overlaps
   of competencies and functions between authorities linked to the sector.
19. Problems related to land tenure are entrenched constraints and conflicts that are
   beyond the scope of the FIP. However, they are decisive for the success of the proposed
   actions. Addressing this problem will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and with the
   support of local governments and community support committees, such as the
   Municipal Development Councils (Comudes, for its acronym in Spanish) and
   Community Development Councils (Cocodes, for its acronym in Spanish) and the
   ancestral community authorities (town councils, indigenous municipalities, among
   others), especially in territories led by indigenous peoples under community
   administration schemes.

2.   The implementation of the investment plan	(IP)	 in at least four of the five REDD +
     regions proposed in the	 ER-PIN	 will include areas in extreme poverty, with lack
     employment opportunities, and have a high consumption rate of fuelwood.
     Therefore, proposed actions will help reduce deforestation and degradation, in
     addition to contributing with the improvement of the livelihoods of the local
     population. The four proposed regions are even more relevant because they have
     at least	 90%	 of the remaining forest cover in Guatemala.

         Section 5. Collaboration among MDBs and other partners

1. Currently, Guatemala is implementing a USD3.8 million grant from the FCPF for the
   REDD + preparatory phase, where IDB is the implementing partner. After the midterm
   progress report was presented, an additional USD5.0 million was obtained for
   the preparation phase, which is now available for implementation.
2. This process is led by the IACG, which coordinates the preparation of the National REDD
   + Strategy      through     different   coordination     mechanisms     with    multiple
   stakeholders (see Figure 5). These coordination mechanisms also involve other
   strategic partners with whom the preparation of the REDD+ strategy is
   articulated technically and financially, with actions that can complement the FIP. These
   include:
    • Carbon Fund and National Emissions Reduction Program
    • KfW and its program in the highlands, in addition to its recent commitment with the
      eastern region of Guatemala
    • Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
    • International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
    • U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Climate, Nature and
      Communities in Guatemala Project (USAID/CNCG)
    • United Nations Development Programme	(UNDP)
    • Global Alliance	and World Bank (improved stoves' action plan)
    • REDD+	SES	(strengthening of safeguarding capacities)
3. Through multisectoral coordination mechanisms, the country has managed
   complementary technical and financial support for the Readiness phase, achieving
   approximately an additional USD3.0 million from the different programs or projects
   executed by these strategic partners. This coordination has continued and has been
   strengthened for the REDD+ implementation phase, within the framework of the
   elaboration of the Forest Investment Plan. This has been achieved through the
   inclusion of these strategic partners in the governance tables and FIP-specific
   participation and consultation spaces.
4. With the support of the IACG, the articulation of complementary efforts for the
   implementation of GHG emission reduction activities in the forestry sector has been




                                           49
   promoted, which in the case of the FIP, represents existing dialogue spaces. The
   specific actions developed by these organizations are summarized in Table 6.

Strategic partner                         Complementary support in the REDD+ preparation phase
                      At the request of the Government of Guatemala, it is the implementing partner of the FCPF
                      resources for the National REDD+ Strategy. The IDB advised the Government in the
                      preparation of the proposal presented to the Carbon Fund, a role from which it facilitated the
                      articulation of stakeholders for participation in the design of the investment plan (IP), as well as
                      the complementarity and alignment with the options, measures and territories prioritized in the
                      REDD+ Strategy. It has also guided the complementarity of both financing sources (FCPF and
                      FIP). The IDB has supported the development of pilot models with the public and private
       IDB
                      sectors through the MIF, which are contributing elements of these experiences prior to the
                      design of the IP, especially in the development of a mechanism that promotes the leverage of
                      private banking. In the area of complementarity with other climate finance funds, it is an
                      implementing partner of the Program for the Efficient Use of Firewood in Indigenous and
                      Rural Communities of Guatemala, approved by the NAMAs Facility for an approximate
                      amount of USD12 million. This program is being harmonized with the prioritized areas for
                      sustainable wood production actions within the FIP framework.
                      Through FAO, the use of forestry governance platforms was coordinated for the
                      consultation phase of the Forest Investment Plan. These platforms are made up of
                      community-based organizations that FAO has helped to develop. Among them, the
                      regional forest consensus work groups, the Alliance of Community Organizations
       FAO
                      and some forest producers' organizations. Likewise, the complementarity of
                      investment activities will be coordinated with agroforestry institutions and
                      organizations dedicated to the promotion of territorial rural development programs
                      and adaptation and mitigation in the face of climate change.
                      IUCN has experience working and coordinating with indigenous peoples and local communities in
                      Guatemala's forestry sector. This experience will serve as a basis for coordinating the development of
                      the Forest Investment Plan with various groups of indigenous peoples and local communities through
                      specific governance platforms. In formulating the projects, the map of indigenous peoples of Central
                      America prepared by IUCN will be used, as well as the maps generated at the national level by the
                      Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (ALMG, for its acronym in Spanish) for the
      UICN            identification and prioritization of territories managed by indigenous peoples, with the aim of
                      integrating them into the specific component of the Dedicated Grant Mechanism (DGM), as an
                      integral part of the IP. In addition, various studies and specific actions supported by IUCN are being
                      used in the framework of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative for
                      the identification and prioritization of activities under the forest-industry-market line of investment.
                      For example, activities will be undertaken to reduce illegal logging linked to FLEGT..

                      This partner works in the development of value chains and investment lines in the forestry
                      sector, mainly in the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR). For the implementation of the
     USAID/           activities to be financed by the FIP, the support and experience of this strategic partner
     CNCG             will be sought to generate market demand and promote the certification of timber
                      products within the framework of the forest-industry-market line of investment. Work will
                      also be done on identifying and strengthening productive activities of sustainable forest
                      management as provided by the Community Land and Indigenous Territories Strategy.

                          UNDP implements the project "Guatemala: Sustainable Forest Management and
                          Multiple Benefits Programme" in four departments of the country. Its goal is to
                          strengthen soil management, forest and biodiversity conservation processes to ensure the flow
                          of ecosystem services and resilience to climate change. This project has managed to
                          link its interventions with the municipal and national plans. The support of this
      GEF/UNDP
                          partner will be sought to facilitate the linkage of FIP interventions with these plans,
                          as well as the creation of value chains. On the other hand, UNDP is supporting the
                          preparation of the Third National Communication on Climate Change and the first
                          biennial report, so that the inclusion of FIP activities will be coordinated as part of
                          contributions to climate change adaptation and mitigation.
                          The German cooperation supports Conap through the project "Strengthening the
                          Guatemalan System of Protected Areas: Life Web," which is implemented in the
                          department of Huehuetenango. This project seeks the expansion and consolidation of
         KfW              the Sigap and expects the conservation of the system's biological diversity as result. It
                          also seeks institutional strengthening and the establishment of a compensation
                          program for environmental services.
                          Over the last few years, the World Bank has been accompanying the REDD+ process in its role
                          of secretariat of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), even though the multilateral
                          bank leading the work with the Government has been IDB. Given its experience with the DGM,
                          it has been agreed that the World Bank be the lead institution in the promotion of this
     World Bank           mechanism, which will be activated once the FIP begins its implementation. In addition, and
                          taking into account that Guatemala has applied and was accepted in the Carbon Fund, the
                          World Bank will work with the Government in the preparation of the corresponding program.

                          Considering the management and coordination that INAB, Conap and MAGA have developed
                          for the achievement of the FMAP project, with the financial and technical support of UKSA,
                          actions will be taken to strengthen governability and to apply technological innovations in the
        UKSA              monitoring of natural forests and forest plantations in two pilot areas of the country that will be
                          located in the departments of Petén, Alta and Baja Verapaz. This constitutes a potential source
                          of synergy between the different components and actions that can be developed between the
                          projects of the Guatemala FIP and the FMAP project.

     Section 6. Identification and rationality of programs and projects
                         to be co-financed by the FIP


6.1        Background and rationale
1.    According to the results of the 2005 national inventories, at least 27% of total GHG
      emissions (8.51 M tCO2e) correspond to the LULUCF sector, which is corroborated by a
      study made by IARNA/URL in 2012. It identified 115 deforestation areas in the country,
      of which 5 fronts (especially in the north and within protected areas) account for 42%
      of deforestation. The rest, 110 foci, is located at the national level and accounts
      for the remaining 58%, due in particular to the growth of traditional slash-
      and-burn agricultural practice, among other factors.
2.    However, the country's forest cover both in natural forests and plantations is a
      potential attractive for the depletion of GHGs. In relation to natural forests, at least 50%
      is within protected areas (Sigap), managed by Conap in relatively compact territories
      and where forests maintain their structure and functionality. The rest of the forest
      cover, outside protected areas, is in relatively dispersed extensions
      and fractioned forests. In both cases, however, and according to recent
      analyses of forest cover at national level, at least 34.19% (3.72 M ha) of the
      territory has forest cover (Gimbut, 2015).
3.    For this reason, in its NDC, Guatemala identifies this sector as one of the most
      important for the reduction of emissions during the first period, by the year 2030. In
      addition, in the framework for the preparation of the National REDD+ Strategy,
      areas with greater potential for emission reduction have been identified and
      the necessary tools are being developed to move towards the implementation
      phase, including a broad process of consultation and participation. This information
      has been aligned with the Forest Investment Plan, so as to ensure the rationality of
      interventions.
4.    Based on these analyses of the agents responsible for deforestation and forest
      degradation, and taking into account the barriers limiting the increase in carbon stocks,
      it is expected that the greater impact of the interventions supported by the Forestry
      Investment Plan would be determined by the implementation of scalable
      productive projects, the improvement of governance and governability, and the
      provision of financial alternatives.42	 All this in order to mitigate the effects of the
      expansion of agri-culture and its underlying causes, by integrating an intersectoral
      and programmatic scope (complementary actions between INAB and Conap).

42 They may include arrangements of agroforestry systems with subsistence or export crops (eg, cardamom, cocoa and/or coffee); the
establishment of silvopastoral systems, payment for environmental services, ecotourism projects or ecosystem services, among others



                                                                      52
6.2      Geographic approach for the development of programs and projects
5.    In order to focus and co-finance FIP investments, four geographic regions (see Figure 6)
      were selected, which concentrate areas and attributes for the achievement of FIP
      criteria, especially regarding the potential for climate change mitigation, scaling
      potential, cost/benefit ratio, programmatic implementation potential (Conap/INAB),
      the generation of co-benefits and compliance with safeguards. These geographic areas
      are closely related to the regions prioritized in the National REDD+ Strategy. Although
      these regions appear to be extensive areas, the sites for FIP interventions within these
      proposed geographic regions will be selected when the corresponding weighted criteria
      are applied (Table 7). Working with these four zones is intended to develop cases in the
      most important areas where deforestation and degradation occurs, or there is potential
      to increase carbon pools that can then be replicated and scaled.
     a. Petén Region (north and south):	The main selection criteria for this area include: a)
        high rate of deforestation (40,125 ha/year); b) degradation as a result of the highest
        occurrence of potential fires/heat points (46.6% in 2016); c) the country's largest
        carbon reserves (10.20 million CO2); (d) important conservation sites for
        biodiversity connectivity (4 of 6 restricted-distribution ecosystems and 2/7 Ramsar
        sites); (e) presence of an important community organizational base (forest
        concessions); and, f) presence of an important forestry industry. Some actions
        associated with the usurpation of land in protected areas and invasions by illegal
        groups are potential factors of conflict that must be considered when implementing
        the proposed actions. According to the ER-PIN (2014), this is an area of ​high
        archeological and historical value. Among others, it is located in Tikal National Park,
        which was listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
        Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site.

     b. Alta Verapaz and Izabal Region: It is one of the most active regions in forestry
        management of both private producers and community organizations. It has
        reached the largest extensions and number of beneficiaries in forest incentive
        programs with plantations reaching the ages of exploitation. Therefore, it
        represents, a pole with conditions to promote the increase of carbon
        reestablishments through plantations and agroforestry systems. Other selection
        criteria include: a) the second region with the largest carbon stocks (5.2 million
        tCO2e); b) high levels of extreme poverty (24.6% to 53.6%); and, c) the third region
        with the largest population (2.01 million people).

      c. Eastern Region:	In this area, actions aim to promote the protection and restoration
         of forest cover as a social development instrument	(agroforestry activity for food

   security and sources of employment),	 and the restoration of soils (recovery of soils,
   ensuring water supply) of communities with high poverty rates. It includes the
   departments of Zacapa, Chiquimula, El Progreso and Jalapa, which constitute one of
   the most representative areas of the Dry Corridor of Guatemala.	

   The main selection criteria include: a) high levels of poverty (53.2% to 70.6%) and
   extreme poverty (13.2% to 41.1%); b) vulnerability to the impacts of drought; c)
   high levels of food insecurity; d) significant density of indigenous population; e)
   high interest of local governments to address the problem of forest degradation
   (there is an important base of uncontrolled associations); and, f) strong activity in
   the industry (one of the most important industrial poles in the country). In fact, this
   region is characterized by its high potential for the development of forest-industry-
   market linkages given its high number of forest industries.



d. Western Region:	 In this region	—which includes the departments of Huehuetenango,
   Quiché,	 San	 Marcos,	 Quetzaltenango,	 Sololá,	 Totonicapán	 and	 Chimaltenango—, FIP
   actions will be aimed towards assisting in sustainable management and restoration
   of the forest landscape, mainly to promote the sustainable supply of fuelwood, but
   also to ensure other ecosystem services such as water (protection and recovery of
   forest cover in water-producing areas). The main selection criteria for this region
   include: (a) fuelwood consumption deficit (-10.3 million m3/year), one of the main
   causes of carbon stock depletion; b) high levels of poverty (56.0% to 80-9%)
   and extreme poverty (16.7% to 41.8%); c) high density of indigenous population, d)
   high interest of local governments to address the problem of forest degradation; and,
   e) presence of a major forest industry. In addition, there is a high interest in
   addressing issues such as the problem of forest degradation, the potential for
   establishing energy plantations, the typology of degraded forest and the connectivity
   of the forest landscape within highly important water recharge basins.

6.3           Selected projects and programs43
Project 1: Sustainable forest management
General objective: Promote sustainable forest management processes aimed at
improving the value chain of wood and restoring the forest landscape.
Specific objectives:

         a) Strengthen the technical capacities of the institutions of the public forestry sector in
            order to efficiently meet the demands of users of the sector in terms of sustainable
            management of natural forests, conservation of biodiversity and recovery of
            degraded areas.

         b) Increase the supply of timber and non-timber products, current and future,
            increasing yields, improving added value and access to processing and financing
            centers.

         c) Promote the management of natural forests and the restoration of degraded areas,
            applying ancestral knowledge aimed at the provision of sustainable sources of
            fuelwood and wood, as well as conservation, promoting connectivity.

7. Description of the intervention logic:	 Thematically, this project focuses on
addressing administrative, technical, market access and financial barriers that limit the
greater coverage/expansion of sustainable forest management in the forest landscape. The
scope of work of the project is mainly the institutional and the forestry industry.
Territorially, it covers the four priority regions, in areas where the main deforestation
fronts (Izabal and Petén), of degradation (Highlands), are located, where there is the
greatest potential for increasing carbon stocks (Verapaces, Petén), and there are better
institutional conditions for implementation (capacities of INAB and Conap), and there is



43 See Annex 1 for a detailed description.



                                                                                   57
       better	 potential	 to achieve co-benefits	 (population living in poverty,	 high rate of
       indigenous population,	 areas of great biodiversity value and strategic areas for the
       production of water).
8.      This project considers a five-year implementation period, during which time it is
      expected to address the proposed actions in a gradual way, in each geographical area
      and, with this, achieve significant progress in the proposed results and indicators.
 9.     The proposed interventions aim to improve the presence and institutional capacities
      of Conap and INAB in the prioritized territories (personnel, equipment,
      monitoring capacities, technical assistance, among others) and strengthen their
      institutional relationship with authorities (strengthening of municipal offices),
      improving access and efficiency of services provided to the population that participates
      or wants to participate in the sustainable management of the forest landscape.
 10. Work will be done on facilitating market access for forest and agroforestry products,
   promoting the organization of supply and its added value. Industrial poles that have
   expansion conditions (Verapaces, El Rancho, Chimaltenango, Quetzaltenango, Petén) will
   be promoted as a mechanism to increase demand for forest products, especially timber
   from plantations that are reaching their harvesting period, as well as natural forests
   under sustainable management (forest concessions). All this in order to ensure the
   financial viability of plantations, agroforestry systems and natural forests under
   management.
11. This intervention strategy in the prioritized territories, in which the ancestral
   knowledge of indigenous peoples will be further applied, will result in the consolidation
   and expansion of plantation areas, preferably of endemic species, agroforestry and
   silvopastoral systems, and the sustainable management of natural forests through
   sustainable management and restoration46	 of the forest landscape, reducing
   deforestation and degradation, and increasing carbon stocks.

Project components
      a) Institutional strengthening.	 Oriented to the effective attention of the demands
         (administrative, technical, legal, operative) of the users of the sector to promote
         their participation in the sustainable management of the landscape.
      b) Linkage between forest-industry and market. It includes strengthening the value chains
      of forest products (timber and non-timber) and agroforestry, to generate added value and
      promote access to markets.



46 In the framework of the National forest landscape restoration strategy 2015-2045 (Guatemala).




                                                                     58
  c) Sustainable forest management and restoration of the forest landscape. This, as a means
  to address the sustainable supply of fuelwood, the sustainable management of natural
  forest remnants and the connectivity of the forest landscape. The application of ancestral
  knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities will be considered.



Project 2: Strengthening governance and livelihoods diversification.
General objective:	Promote the efficient management of the forest landscape and its
ecosystem services in pilot areas.	
Specific objectives:


   a. Strengthen administrative, legal, technical and operational institutionality with the
      aim of improving forest governance and governability.

    b.    Promote the involvement of local actors to generate strategic partnerships and
         promote full and effective participation in the control, monitoring and management
         of the forest landscape.

    c. Consolidate and diversify sustainable productive activities in the forest landscape
       that promote the development of the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, women's
       groups and local communities.

13. Description of the intervention logic:	 The forest management model focuses on
promoting the participation of local actors (communities, indigenous peoples,
municipalities, private sector). Several emblematic cases are known to show that the
partnership between public sector institutions and local actors generates positive results
for the sustainability of the forest landscape (48 Cantones de Totonicapán Committee,
forest concessions in protected areas, Fedecovera, among others). Despite the country's
progress in this area, there are still areas for improvement that would allow the strengthening
and consolidation of these models, and would facilitate the participation of local actors, to
improve governability itself and that of the forest landscape.

14.    This project also considers a five-year implementation period, at which time it is expected
to address the proposed actions in a gradual way, in each geographical area and, with this,
achieve significant progress in the proposed results and indicators.

15. On this basis, it is proposed to focus FIP resources on two major themes: a) harmonization of
actions in the territories (e.g., avoiding antagonism between agroindustrial crops and protected
areas); b) establishment and formalization of partnerships with local actors (conservation




                                               59
agreements, monitoring, among others) that strengthen a framework between
institutions and stakeholders. The first theme has a more transversal application at the
national level, while the second theme can be focused, in this phase, on the territories
prioritized under the FIP, but can then be extended to other regions.

16. The actions of the project will have a differentiated approach for the areas of
intervention in which, at the forest landscape level, municipal territories, indigenous
territories and local communities converge. The National Strategy for the Management
and Conservation of Natural Resources in Communal Lands identifies thematic axes
neglected due to the strong institutional weakness on the subject. FIP orientation will
address the generation and implementation of new management mechanisms and
productive alternatives for the development of livelihoods related to forest ecosystem
services.

    Project components

    1.     Strengthening the capacities of social organizations and institutions on
         governance and forest governability issues. It addresses both the State
         institutions, Conap and INAB, as well as the organizations of indigenous peoples,
         local communities, women's groups and priority areas of Sigap.

   2. Strategic partnerships with local actors for control and surveillance. It is
      aimed at creating and strengthening strategic partnerships, and developing tools
      adapted to specific territorial conditions. These tools should be developed in a
      participatory and inter-institutional manner, allowing the implementation of control
      and monitoring mechanisms for the management of the territory.

   3. Economic valuation of environmental goods and services. Component related
      to the ordering and valuation of the main ecosystem services in indigenous peoples,
      local communities and priority areas of Sigap.
   4. Consolidation and diversification of livelihoods. Focused on the improvement of
      the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, women's groups and local communities
      through the promotion of productive models that promote the sustainable use of
      biological diversity (ecotourism, home gardens, underutilized plants, among
      others), as well as the strengthening of existing ones.

   Project 3: Access to funding (public and private)

   On the other hand, actions will be developed to improve access to forest incentives
   (with public funding) and private financing for sustainable forest management
   activities, mainly for smallholder groups, women and indigenous population.


                                            60
The development and consolidation of partnerships with local governments, NGOs and other
strategic partners will be supported to help local actors meet the requirements for access to
publicly-funded forest incentive programs (based on previous pilot experiences).44 In addition, a
financial mechanism will be designed to facilitate leverage of private banking resources,
addressing barriers that have limited the participation of the private sector in the forestry sector,
and enhancing previous experiences with some actors in the forestry sector.45

	
17. The system will ensure the execution of the projects and promote decision-making on
    said implementation. This is essential for the establishment of protocols, the promotion
    of diverse processes, the coordination and execution of activities for the monitoring of
    the indicators in each one of the projects, as well as the evaluation of their progress in
    relation to the established goals. The system will follow the guidelines set in the CIF-FIP
    reporting and monitoring tool.
18. This system seeks to create synergy with the National Monitoring, Reporting and
   Verification System (MRV), which is in its design phase (ER-PIN, 2014). The actions
   included in the Forest Investment Plan will support the efforts of the National REDD+
   Strategy and the National Emission Reduction Program.

6.5        Connectivity and synergy among implementing institutions
19. Due to the country's institutional design regarding the administration of its natural
   resources outside protected areas (INAB) and within protected areas (Conap), the
   implementation of the proposed projects will also require the designation of
   responsibilities and inter-institutional synergies. Some direct examples of the
   institutional and programmatic complementarity and connectivity expected to be
   promoted are:
      a)     Institutional management of processes related to the development of the value
            chain of forest, agroforestry and silvopastoral products. This includes actions
            within and outside protected areas with a focus on connectivity and forest
            landscape, taking advantage of the strengths and tools developed by each
            organization.
      b)       Facilitation of forest management instruments through the approval and
            simplification of directives, regulations or processes that promote the development
            of the forest sector, including the promotion of training and education programs for
            community-based organizations, local governments and public institutions
            themselves, regarding their ability to handle queries and solve conflicts.

                                                61
      c)      Articulation of financing and joint financial mechanisms in support of the
            productive processes and alternatives proposed in the projects within and outside
            protected areas.
       d)       Complementarity and joint actions towards the achievement of the goals
            proposed in the National REDD+ Strategy regarding the prioritization of
            territories for the reduction of GHG emissions.

6.6        Competitiveness of the proposed projects
20. The main elements that characterize the competitiveness of the actions proposed by the
    Guatemala Forest Investment Plan are:
      a)    Commitment of the Government of Guatemala through a robust institutional and
            policy framework, with more than twenty years of experience in forest
            management based on the participation of local actors (governance) and the
            allocation of public resources for forest incentive programs.
      b)      Support to a large number of indigenous associations and local communities
            located in areas with low human development, but linked to important natural
            forest reserves or that are promoting the restoration or conservation of the forest
            landscape.
      c)     Active participation of community-based organizations and community forestry
            enterprises (CFEs), including women's groups involved in the management of
            forest incentives (Pinpep networks) and in the management of natural forests
            (Acofop and the National Network of Forest Communities of Guatemala).
      d)      Forest industry organized in the Forestry Association and with considerable
            investments in the forestry sector.
      e) Unique models combining the protection of natural (forest) and cultural heritage,
         including archaeological sites of the Mayan culture that have global relevance,
         especially in the Petén region.
      f) Development of differentiated actions for groups of women involved in productive
         processes compatible with forests.

          Section 7. Implementation potential with risk assessment


7.1 Analysis of the technical and management capacities of the executing
entities of the project
1.    In 2015, the IACG agreed47 that INAB should lead the management process with the
     FIP, with the definition of administrative and financial responsibilities pending. INAB
     has a proven trajectory of nearly twenty years (1997-2016) administering
     and executing forest incentive programs, investing more than USD300 million
     in them. It has 9 regional offices and 32 subregional offices distributed
     throughout the main forest regions of the country, including those selected by
     the FIP. In addition, under the Probosque Law (Decree 02-2015), it will be
     responsible for carrying out actions to expand forest incentive programs, which
     will include an estimated USD40 million per year over a period of 30 years (2017
     -2046).
2.   Conap will be another key institution in the process of implementing the Forest
     Investment Plan. This entity manages all the country's protected areas, which represent
     32% of the national territory. It has more than twenty-five years of experience in
     protected area management, for which it has promoted different models that seek to
     promote the participation of local actors in forest management activities. It has eight
     regional offices, some of them -such as the one located in Petén- with significant
     technical and equipment resources (especially for monitoring). Schemes such as
     community forestry concessions, co-management through NGOs, participation of
     indigenous communities, private sector and local governments in the management of
     protected areas have allowed the development of partnerships that underpin the bases
     for the sustainability of protected areas.
3.   Both INAB and Conap have governance structures in which the public and private
     sectors, academia, local governments and NGOs participate, and which is the basis for
     articulating programmatic actions in the territories. In addition, the IACG
     structure, created under the National Climate Change Framework Law,
     constitutes a coordination platform that will allow this articulation.
4.   Other key institutions for the implementation of FIP actions will be MARN and
     MAGA. The first of these entities is responsible for authorizing environmental impact
     studies (EISs) and is the focal point for the UNFCCC on climate change issues. MAGA
     develops productive actions outside the forest, especially in agroforestry and
     silvopastoral systems, which seek to reduce the pressure on natural forests. All these
     instances will be strengthened through the interventions of the investment plan, which

                                             63
     translates into the added value of the FIP in terms of areas and actions to be promoted.



7.2 Identification of possible risks
5.   Some institutional and financial-administrative risks have been identified, especially
     those related to the allocation of forest incentives by the State. Similarly, some risks
     associated with intra and inter-institutional performance are also anticipated and
     related to the standardization and facilitation of rules and regulations, on the one hand,
     and illegal traffic of forest products, on the other. Also, invasions and levels of
     deforestation in protected areas pose considerable risks that demand an effective
     institutional response.


7.2.1 Institutional risks

6.    On the part of INAB -and especially in relation to the continuation of the incentive
     program (Pinpep and Probosque)- delays have been experienced in
     disbursements, which discourages producers from achieving reforestation goals. On the
     other hand, the low level of personnel and equipment assigned are perceived as
     major institutional challenges in view of the magnitude of the goals proposed by
     Probosque (40,000 ha annually) and the demands of the users. For example, in the
     year 2016, approximately 48,000 incentive requests were received, which
     accounted for 70% of the current institutional capacity, when there are about thirty
     additional services that the institution must address.
7.    In the case of Conap, the greater risk is determined by its low budgetary allocation
     (budget ceiling), which affects the effective administration of Sigap. In addition, the
     reduced allocation of technical personnel also limits the timely approval of files -such
     as licenses and permits for the use of resources. In the course of the socialization
     workshops, other operational risks of administrative nature were identified, which
     demand actions for institutional strengthening. The constant changes of civil workers
     constitute frequent political risks in the entities responsible for the administration of
     natural resources.



7.2.2 Operational or implementation risks (technological, adequate management,
      environmental and social)

8. Due to the programmatic (interinstitutional and intersectoral) nature
and geographic focus (within and outside protected areas), the actions
proposed under the FIP require a careful organizational level, as well as an


                                              64
     effective allocation of operational and administrative responsibilities. In addition,
     MARN's involvement in environmental regulations and MAGA's participation with
     actions outside the forest increase the level of operational complexity, which demands
     a higher level of organization.
9.    The incorporation of an inclusive financial mechanism into Guatemala's credit and
     financial system requires market analysis and credit conditions that are attractive to
     users without interfering with the country's financial market.
10. Issues related to land tenure in some areas with communal lands or those bordering
    protected areas also generate social instability and continuous claims that, in some way,
    limit operational and institutional performance. The renovation of the multiple use
    zone (MUZ) concession contracts of the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) also constitutes
    an operational risk.


7.3 Mitigation of identified risks
11. The potential risk mitigation plans that have been identified will be considered at the
    operational, technical and regulatory levels. Issues related to the operational
    and administrative weakness of the institutions responsible for executing the
    Forest Investment Plan (INAB and Conap) will be included in institutional
    strengthening plans in order to guarantee the efficient provision of
    institutional services and competitiveness, despite the low operating budget
    allocated.
12. In the case of delays in the payment of forest incentives, the IDB and the World Bank
    are taking appropriate action to develop a financial mechanism (and a guarantee fund)
    to allow said payments while disbursements from the national treasury are made. This
    initiative will be a pilot component that may provide important lessons as the
    Probosque incentive allocation process evolves.
13. With regard to the facilitation of administrative management, the contribution of the
    Forest Investment Plan translates into institutional strengthening and the search for
    spaces for dialogue to: a) standardize regulations and directives; b) improve the
    traceability control and certification system for the use of wood; c) strengthen public
    entities, local governments and community-based organizations in order to ensure a
    competitive performance of the sector.
14. In addition, the implementation of the investment plan will be based on the integration
    of the learning process and lessons learned at the level of the implementing
    organizations (INAB, Conap, MARN and MAGA). This will include the incorporation of
    information generated in studies, research, publications, reports of electronic bulletins

    and other periodic reports that are prepared within these organizations. Some reports,
    analyses and recommendations generated as a result of support from bilateral and multilateral
    cooperation in forestry and the environment will also be taken into consideration.
15. During the implementation of the Investment Plan (2018-2022), the lessons and
    experiences generated in the pilot projects established in the different geographic areas
    selected during the development phase of the projects will be taken into account. The
    recording and analysis of information through the monitoring and evaluation system
    will be decisive for continuously rethinking IP actions.

               Section 10. Environmental and social safeguards

1.   The design and subsequent execution of the investment plan shall take into account the
     environmental and social safeguards of the Inter-American Development
     Bank (IDB). The first ones, established in 2006, make reference to the fact that
     environmental issues must be properly identified and dealt with from project
     design. In terms of social safeguards, the IDB approved a specific operational
     policy for indigenous peoples in 2007, while in 2009 it updated its Operational
     Policy on Gender Equality in Development, with the objective of contributing to
     gender equality and the empowerment of women.

2.   In summary, the IDB's mandatory compliance safeguards include: a) compliance with
     the environmental policy and safeguards (OP 703); b) the disaster risk
     management policy (OP 704); c) forestry development policy, the operational policy
     on indigenous peoples and the strategy for indigenous development (OP 765); d)
     the operational policy on gender equality in development (OP 761); e) the
     involuntary resettlement policy (OP 710); f) the access to information policy (OP
     102); and, g) sectoral policies for rural development (OP 752) and forestry
     development (OP 723).

3.   On the other hand, the World Bank's direct observation safeguards refer to: a)
     indigenous peoples (OP/BP 4.10); b) involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12);
     c) forests (BP 4.36); d) physical and cultural heritage (OP/BP 4.11); and, e)
     natural habitats (OP 4.04).

4.   Prior to the initiation of the proposed actions, baseline assessments will be carried out
     to ensure compliance with social and environmental indicators, with emphasis on the
     development of socio-environmental mitigation measures. An appropriate strategy for
     conflict resolution will also be designed in cases where projects directly or indirectly
     affect natural resources in communal lands, or in cases of claims of territorial
     overlapping related to Sigap.

5.   The actions of the Forest Investment Plan will place a strong emphasis on the design of a
     specific strategy for the management and/or protection of forest ecosystems with
     attributes of high conservation value (HCV), or ecosystems with attributes for the
     generation of ecosystem services and for reducing vulnerability and promoting
     resilience to climate change.




                                              72
6.   Similarly, the implementation of the proposed actions will take into account the
     practices and ancestral knowledge of indigenous communities, especially with respect
     to the cultural and spiritual uses of the cosmovision and the practices that favor
     proposing the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Special attention
     will be given to the use of native species for fuelwood or wood, considering the official
     lists of non-invasive species.

7.   This investment plan will be implemented as a determining institutional mandate. The
     inclusion of gender equality, especially contemplated in INAB's Gender Equity
     Institutional Strategy, as well as the principles of recognition of indigenous peoples -
     contemplated in the Indigenous Peoples' Assistance Strategy,- will form an integral part
     of the safeguards included in this proposal.

                    Annex 1. Inventory of proposed projects

A.1 Project 1: Sustainable forest management


A.1.1.1 Multilateral banks, state agencies and collaborators

1.     This project will be implemented by IDB. From the activities of the project, the
     partners and collaborators will be INAB, Conap and other State agencies that work
     directly with indigenous peoples, local communities, women's groups and civil society.
     Forest management is expected to be achieved for the sustainable management of
     forests and the strengthening of control and monitoring actions for comprehensive
     governance and governability. It is a fact that strategic social actors such as local
     governments, indigenous authorities, community-based organizations and first
     and second-level organizations, as well as entities in the security and justice sector
     (Evironmental Prosecutor's Office, Diprona, Office of the Public Prosecutor and
     resource rangers) participate in indigenous and communal lands. In productive
     terms (wood value chain), and in relation to opportunities to access forest incentives,
     actions will be coordinated with INAB.

2.    The Forest Investment Plan will be linked to the Guatemala project being developed for
     the NAMA Facility on the efficient use of fuelwood, which will be carried out at two
     levels: a) at the level of the policy framework, NAMA will complement the line of action
     focused on the efficient use of fuelwood within the National Strategy for the Sustainable
     Production and Efficient Use of Firewood and the Energy Policy 2013-2027 (the FIP will
     focus on sustainable fuelwood production); b) at territorial level, the NAMA will be
     focused on the departments and municipalities with the highest fuelwood deficit, which
     matches the prioritization criteria used in this topic within the	FIP.




                                             78
3.     At the operational level, the key partners will be the local governments of the
     prioritized territories (municipalities and associations) through their municipal offices,
     indigenous authorities, indigenous and communal organizations, community forestry
     enterprises (CFE) as cooperatives, associations, federations or other second-level
     entities, such as Acofop and Forescom (case of forest concessions in the Petén region).
     Other partners and key contributors to the development of the project are the
     beneficiary networks of Pinpep and Pinfor, driven by INAB, especially those like
     Rainforest Alliance in the Petén and Verapaces region; IUCN, in the Verapaces;
     Fundaeco, in Izabal; Defensores de la Naturaleza in Petén, Alta Verapaz and Izabal;
     Calmecac, in the highlands and Alta Verapaz, among others.

4.    For the strengthening of the value chain of wood (FIM), there will be alternative
     investments and leverage of additional resources by the forestry industry (private
     sector) and even at the level of forest producers (small and medium-scale), who make
     their own resources available.

A.1.1.2 Statement of the problem and rationale for interventions: One of the main
causes of deforestation in Guatemala, and consequently of GHG emissions, is directly related
to the uncompetitive pattern in the value chains of forest products (timber and non-
timber), agroforestry products and the unsustainable and inefficient use of fuelwood as an
energy source. All this results in a low generation of employment opportunities, with few
alternative incomes and, as a consequence, the pressure on natural forests continues with
an increasing tendency. The factors directly related to this extractive scheme are due in
particular to institutional weakness (public and private sector) and to the lack of provision
of financial alternatives and alternative markets for the expansion of sustainable forest and
agroforestry management.


5.   It is important to apply knowledge and ancestral knowledge of indigenous peoples, as
     they promote the sustainable use and care of forest resources, which are essential for
     the life and subsistence of the human being.

6.    Regarding "wood supply" and according to official Seinef records (November 2016),
     during the period 2010-2016 at least 2.59 million m3 were obtained at national level
     from natural forests, while about 6.64 million m3 were obtained from forest plantations.
     This means that forest plantations are favorably reducing the pressure on the timber
     harvest in natural forests. However, most of the production of the plantations is being
     used for the production of pallets and other products of low commercial value, with the
     consequent deterioration of the final harvest and low economic income.	According to




                                              79
     reports from Seinef,	 the country mainly sells sawn timber, logs and wood platforms
     (including timber from precious natural forest species).

7.   With regard to the production and use of fuelwood, it has been determined that there is
     a deficit of at least 10.02 million m3 of fuelwood, for an estimated annual consumption
     of 29 million m3. Therefore, the proposed actions will be oriented to the management of
     natural forests (short term) and the development of energy plantations (medium and
     long term), in order to reduce the pressure on natural forests and, therefore, the
     emission of GHG, including the restoration of the forest landscape.

8.    Similarly, agroforestry products for export (coffee, cocoa and cardamom), with high
     commercial value, also present deficiencies in their production chains, which are
     associated with insufficient technical assistance, the incorporation of technological
     processes and, mainly, to the lack of markets. One element that stands out among
     producers is the lack of productive linkages and the lack of organization to incorporate
     productive improvements and economies of scale that allow access to competitive
     markets, mainly due to the geographical dispersion level and the small size of
     producers. In general, the development of silvopastoral systems is very incipient.

9.    The actions proposed for this project will be related to the country's policies and
     regulations on the management and sustainable conservation of forest resources and,
     therefore, guarantee a significant level of GHG emission reduction in a cooperative and
     programmatic manner with the participation of Conap and INAB. On the other hand, the
     actions are oriented to provide productive alternatives aimed at reducing poverty and
     promoting economic and social development within a sustainable forest management
     approach.



A.1.1.3 Proposed objectives and investment strategies
Objective: Promote sustainable forest management processes aimed at improving the
value chain of wood and restoring the forest landscape.
Specific objectives
     a) Strengthen the technical capacities of public sector forestry institutions to efficiently
        meet the demands of users regarding the sustainable management of natural forests,
        biodiversity conservation and recovery of degraded areas.
     b) Increase the current and future supply of timber and non-timber products in terms
        of yields, improving added value and access to processing and financing centers.




                                                80
     c) Promote the management of natural forests and the restoration of degraded
        areas through the application of ancestral knowledge aimed at the provision of
        sustainable sources of fuelwood and timber, as well as conservation, favoring the
        ecological connectivity of the forest landscape.

Component 1: Institutional strengthening
10. Focused on improving the presence and institutional capacities of Conap and INAB at
      central level and in the prioritized territories (personnel, equipment, monitoring
      capacities, among others), and strengthen their institutional relationship with local
      authorities (municipal offices), improving access and efficiency to the services provided
      to the population that participates in the sustainable management of the forest
      landscape (procedures for access to financing). The main actions proposed are:
        Institutional strengthening of INAB and Conap:49 The creation of staff capacitites,
        equipment and the procurement of materials will be promoted to provide extension
        services, monitoring, planning and efficient management of forestry incentives
        (Pinpep and Probosque), especially in the projects proposed in the investment plan
        and which have a scalable effect on the rest of the country. This will be done with the
        participation of indigenous authorities and local organizations as a strategy to reduce
        pressure on natural forests and GHG reduction. It is important to train the technical
        staff of INAB and CONAP on the ancestral knowledge of indigenous peoples in regards
        to forestry. This will allow them to value the use and care of forests in a sustainable
        way. This strengthening will be done in at least 6 subregional or regional offices of
        these two institutions (in the same sites for both).	
        Institutional strengthening of municipal offices:50 Focused on the training of
        municipal office staff on the modalities of forest incentives, natural forest
        management and planning, the establishment and management of forest plantations
        and actions in priority areas of Sigap. In addition, these units will be strengthened to
        support the organization of individual producers or groups in terms of
        implementation and access to forest incentive programs. At least 50 municipal offices
        are expected to be strengthened in the regions prioritized in the investment plan.




49 Within protected areas, more than 1,500 projects related to incentive programs have been addressed, and it is the Conap that authorizes
management plans within these areas.
50 Municipal forestry offices, women's municipal offices, municipal environmental management office and others linked to forest landscape
management.



                                                                    81
This component is seen as transversal and supporting the other three components that are
developed below, and would keep a close institutional, territorial and thematic integration
to enable its implementation.

Component 2:	Forest, industry and market linkage
 11. Aimed at consolidating the value chains of forest products to reach national or
      international markets (forest-industry-market), through the strengthening of chains
      that are competitive and replicable. It also includes the promotion of strategic
      partnerships to catalyze agroforestry and silvopastoral productive chains aimed at
      reducing pressure on natural forests, preventing changes in forest cover, increasing
      carbon stocks and social and economic co-benefits. Institutional and financial
      strengthening of the forestry industry, community-based organizations, local
      organizations, producer associations, NGOs, first and second-level cooperative
      enterprises, timber and fuelwood businesses, among others, are considered. Examples
      of potential eligible organizations would be Fedecovera,51 in Alta Verapaz; Forescom,52
      in Petén; the Petén Reforestation Association; Groups of Women Producers of Ramón53
      (Alimentos	Nu-trinaturales	S.A.),	among others.
12. The gender approach will also be integrated into the design and implementation of the
      actions proposed. This will include, among others, the participation of women and
      groups of producers in the creation of forest production partnerships.



Subcomponent 2.1: Value chain of forest products (timber and non-timber)
13. It seeks to boost the supply and demand of forest products through the formation of
partnerships between producers, industry and market linkages. Among others, it considers
the promotion of the following activities: a) development of links between the forest
producers of the Verapaces and Izabal with the eastern industrial corridor; (b)
strengthening of natural forest linkages in Petén with a view to promoting the secondary
processing of wood of high commercial value species such as cedar, mahogany and rarely
used species whose current production is mainly sawed (Figure A. 1.1);54 c) strengthening
of the value chain of wood among forest producers in the highlands (small and medium-

Cooperative.html.
54 At present, only between 15% and 20% of the wood is sold as finished product, while the rest is marketed as raw material (Forescom, 2016).
The most worrying case is the production and trade of mahogany, which accounts for about 90% of exports and whose harvest is equivalent to
54% of the total lumber sold and marketed as such.



                                                                      82
    size enterprises);	 d) Facilitation of access to industrialization technologies that
    improve the yields and quality of forest products; e) industrialization of alternative
    species; (f) development of non-timber forest product value chains; g) market
    intelligence.

14. In the case of the MBR's forest concessions, the process ensures not only the
    conservation of carbon stocks in at least half a million hectares, but also the sustained
    generation of social and economic benefits (co-benefits) for participating community
    groups. In addition, it facilitates the mobilization of new financial resources with the
    potential to enter the markets of FSC-certified timber. FIP interventions will be focused
    on strengthening actions aimed at secondary processing of certified (FSC) high value
    species and responsible forest trade (RFT), in line with BIM actions and joint
    cooperation between INAB and Conap.



Subcomponent 2.2: Improvement of the agroforestry production chain

15. In the north region,	Verapaces	 and east region of the country,	 a considerable amount of
    agroforesty systems is under INAB's forest incentive programs	 (Pinpep	 and	 Pinfor),
    and a potential growth is outlined with the new Probosque Law. These systems also lack
    efficiency in their production chain due to lack of technical assistance, technological
    improvements, collection centers and market openings, including certification
    initiatives for agroforestry products.




                                                            83
16. FIP interventions will include the establishment and strengthening	 of productive
    strategic partnerships	 (public-private)	 and management of technological
    improvements, processing infrastructure and operating capital aimed at increasing the
    added value of agroforestry products. This component will facilitate the access of
    women's groups to public (forest incentive programs) and private (financial
    mechanisms) financing. Strengthening the value chain of agroforestry products is seen
    as a way to reduce pressure on natural forests.

Component 3: Sustainable forest management of natural forests and restoration of
the forest landscape

17. This component focuses on regions of degraded areas to promote their recovery.
    This is a strategy to reduce pressure on natural forests, especially in areas bordering
    deforestation/degradation fronts or forest remnants critical to water production. The
    following key actions for restoration are proposed in this component: a) production
    and sustainable use of fuelwood; (b) promotion of agroforestry systems; c) promotion
    of silvopastoral systems; and, (d) restoration of natural forests (in areas close to
    deforestation or degradation fronts).


18. The different modalities of restoration of the forest landscape will be made with
    cultural relevance, taking into account the use of native species and considering the
    knowledge of the local populations for their establishment and later use. The use of
    invasive alien species that contravenes applicable safeguard regulations within the FIP
    will be avoided. It is important to apply knowledge and the ancestral knowledge of
    indigenous peoples, as they promote the sustainable use and care of forest resources,
    vital for the life and subsistence of the human being.

Subcomponent 3.1: Provision of sustainable fuelwood
19. The main weakness in the unsustainable use of fuelwood is the lack of order and plan-
    ning of natural forests. Official INAB records for the highlands area with the 24
    municipalities with a fuelwood deficit of more than 100,000 m3 per year report only
    217 management plans, covering an estimated area of 2,876.25 ha, while data on forest
    cover in that same area reports an estimated area of 132,872.20 ha, which explains why
    the largest amount of fuelwood and timber consumed in this region comes from forests
    without effective forest planning (Figure A.1.3).




                                            84
 Figure A.1.3 Priority areas with fuelwood deficit and forest landscape degradation




      Source:	Own preparation	(2016)

20. According to Seinef's records for the year 2015, the total authorized volume of
fuelwood in these same municipalities amounts to 95,595.29 m3. This means a
remainder with respect to the total deficit (-3,212,823.99 m3) of -3,117,228.70 m3, a
significant difference compared to the levels of degradation and GHG emission in this
region of the country. In relation to the rest of the country, this deficit is equivalent to
30% and, therefore, the development of actions to counteract this trend is an important
demand for FIP interventions. Planned actions include:
    a) Coordinate with the municipalities, indigenous authorities, local communities and
    community-based organizations the inventories of natural forests in order to
    determine the status and type of tenure.
    b) Apply ancestral forestry knowledge of indigenous peoples, women and local
    communities to determine trees of native species and for family consumption, in order
    to provide fuelwood and other forest benefits.
    c) Establish agreements of mutual cooperation with the aim of guaranteeing the
    sustainable management of forests according to their property category.



                                          85
      d) Coordinate between Conap and INAB, technicians of the MO and regents, the
     development of forest management plans that will ensure the sustainable use of
     natural forests for the production of wood and fuelwood.
      e) Strengthen, with the support of the MOs, the monitoring and control systems for
     the fuelwood origins and flows in the priority regions, including transport units and
     storage centers.
      f) Develop a training and education campaign on the production and sustainable use
     of fuelwood.


21. FIP intervention will support the production and sustainable supply of fuelwood with
species specific to each region, in close coordination with the forest incentive programs and
the support of municipal offices and community-based organizations. The activities planned
under the FIP component and with the direct support of the forest incentive programs
will be aimed at strengthening the goals established in the National Strategy for the
Sustainable Production and Efficient Use of Firewood              and the National Forestry
Landscape Restoration Strategy in priority intervention sites. The natural forests of the
highlands region are expected to be incorporated into management plans, as well as the
establishment of forest plantations and agroforestry systems for energy purposes, with the
aim of contributing to reduce the fuelwood deficit in the country.

22. This platform will be established in approximately 10 municipalities that will
accompany the actions that are promoted at local level with the support of the FIP.
Thus, by encouraging this process, it is expected to cover everything, thereby reducing
the degradation process, fuelwood deficit and, therefore, GHG emissions.

23. This subcomponent will promote the participation of women's groups in activities
related to the sustainable production of fuelwood through the sustainable management of
natural forests and energy plantations. In addition, through the complementarity of
efficient use of fuelwood through NAMA, training and awareness-raising will be
promoted on the sustainable use of fuelwood and the promotion of more
efficient cooking technologies.

Subcomponent 3.2: Promotion of the establishment of agroforestry systems

24. Agroforestry systems are the livelihood of rural families. Their promotion will ensure the
    food security of indigenous peoples, local communities and women, from traditional
    and non-traditional agriculture. The FIP will promote this activity; ancestral knowledge
    will be taken into consideration during its implementation.




                                           86
25. In addition, and considering that agroforestry systems (AFSs) are economic productive
    alternatives that generate financial income in the short term, which facilitates the
    recovery of forest landscapes and reduces the pressure on natural forests, the
    interventions will be oriented to: a) Prioritize areas to support the implementation of
    AFSs in accordance with the criteria of Pinpep and Probosque (water basins, etc.); b)
    facilitate the access of AFSs to the Pinpep and Probosque incentive programs. These
    two actions, therefore, will be scaling up the State's public resources and, at the same
    time, contributing to actions outside the forest in collaboration with the Ministry of
    Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA). It is expected to promote agroforestry
    systems in areas adjacent to some 50,000 ha of natural forests at priority sites for water
    production, along with some 25 municipalities (mainly in the eastern region),
    recovering carbon stocks with AFSs, and reducing forest degradation.



Subcomponent 3.3: Recovery of forest cover in degraded pastures and conversion to
silvopastoral systems

26. For the recovery of degraded areas to a natural forest, the application of ancestral
knowledge is key, as it allows the establishment of forests with native species.

27. Some critical areas of the Petén, Izabal and Verapaces forests have undergone a
continuous process of degradation that began with the cultivation of basic grains,
mainly maize and beans; then came the establishment of pastures for extensive
livestock grazing, with an average animal load of 0.7 units/ha on small farms and 1.3
units/ha on large farms. The degradation of these pastures, associated with the
unattached categories of soils, has caused a rapid expansion at the expense of natural
forests. Over time, livestock farms have increased in number in southern Petén, to the
extent that in 2015 there were 130% additional farms compared to 2003.

28. Most of the farms present a silvopastoral element (scattered trees, thicket, live fences,
among others). Studies conducted in the region by the Tropical Agricultural Research and
Higher Education Center (CATIE) indicate that producers recognize the positive benefits
of trees on livestock farms, both for shade production and its important role in animal load,
such as the production of some wood products for use in the same farms (which could
reduce the pressure for wood from natural forests). In that sense, FIP intervention will
focus on providing technical assistance and additional guidance through the following
actions:




                                           87
      a) Select priority areas (deforestation fronts, degraded areas).

       b)     Develop farm plans and technological improvements for the recovery of
            productivity.

      c) Promote the incorporation of trees within the pastures, taking advantage of the
         institutional advantages of the extension programs of the INAB-MAGA
         partnership.

      d) Promote, through INAB extension programs, the incorporation of silvopastoral
         systems into the forest incentive program intended for this purpose.

       e) Develop guidance and training programs on silvopastoral systems, with the
         participation of the municipal forestry offices, Cocodes and Comudes.

       f) Apply ancestral knowledge in the recovery of degraded areas, especially in
         relation to the use of native species.
It is proposed to promote this model in at least three pilot sites (northern Petén, southern
Petén, Izabal), in areas that have active deforestation fronts, in such a way that a scheme
can be generated that is then replicated in these and other areas. This subcomponent will
be developed in close coordination with MAGA and will be aligned with the Climate Change
Strategy of that institution.

Subcomponent 3.4: Recovery of natural forests
29. It will focus on the restoration of degraded areas of natural forest, as complementary
actions in areas where the three previous subcomponents are implemented. Ancestral
knowledge will be considered in order to strengthen existing processes of biodiversity
conservation, provision of ecosystem services and restoration of connectivity of forest
ecosystems. This action represents a significant opportunity to reduce environmental
vulnerability and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change, accelerating the
recovery of ecosystems in terms of connectivity, functionality and integrity. It also calls for
cooperative participation between INAB (forest incentives) and Conap (protected areas).

30. The participation of women and/or women's groups in the planned activities to
promote agroforestry systems, recovery and restoration of forest landscape in
degraded pastures and restoration of natural forests will be promoted.

A.1.2 Project 2. Strengthening governance and livelihood diversification

A.1.2.1 Multilateral banks, state agencies and collaborators


36. This project will be implemented by World Bank. From the project activities, the
partners and collaborators will be INAB, Conap and other State agencies that work
directly with indigenous peoples, local communities, women's groups and civil
society. Forest management is expected to be achieved for the sustainable management of
forests and the strengthening of control and monitoring actions for
comprehensive governance and governability. It is a fact that in regards to indigenous and
communal lands, strategic social actors such as local governments, indigenous
authorities, community-based organizations and first and second-level bodies, as
well as entities in the security and justice sector, Diprona, Public Prosecutor's Office and
rangers) participate. In terms of production (timber value chain), and in relation
to opportunities for access to forestry incentives, actions will be coordinated with INAB.
37. FIP interventions will emphasize MBR and southern Petén complexes, as well as in the
areas of influence of the SMBR (northern and southern regions) and the protected areas of
Izabal, depending on the sites with the highest dynamics of deforestation and threats and
with opportunities to implement projects aimed at developing the livelihoods of the
local population. In other words, inclusive projects for the local population. Likewise,
this project will promote actions to strengthen governance in indigenous peoples and
local communities linked to protected areas.



A.1.2.2 Statement of the problem and justification of interventions

38. It is important to harmonize the rules of the State with the rules of local communities
for the management of their natural resources. As is known, ignoring the latter will
continue to lead to an increase of ungovernability in the forestry sector. In reality, the
rules and norms of the State and of indigenous communities coexist, generating a use and
care of the forest resources vital for the life and subsistence of the human being.

39. According to studies conducted by Iarna-URL (2012), the greatest pressure of
deforestation occurs in protected areas, where, in that year, five areas were identified in
the protected areas of Petén (4) and Izabal ( 1), equivalent to 42% of the problem at the
national level. A critical aspect is that, in addition to the fragility of the ecosystems present
in these areas, indigenous and communal territories with high levels of vulnerability
also converge, facing challenges in the sustainable use of their resources, poverty and
adaptability to climate change.



                                            93
40. All of these threats represent real challenges for the State, where conservation efforts
and the establishment of co-management contracts, among other initiatives, tend to
degrade and deforestation of protected areas beyond the capacity to apply the
regulatory framework. The forest management model proposed in this Forest
Investment Plan will therefore be focused on strengthening the participation of local
actors (communities, indigenous peoples, municipalities, private sector) and, thus,
establishing models for the effective protection of natural forest remnants at priority
sites in protected areas.

41. In indigenous territories and local communities, the identified threats respond to the
absence of additional economic alternatives that promote the livelihood sustainability of
rural communities, as well as the lack of valuation of ecosystem services compatible with
GHG reduction initiatives and the reduction of vulnerability to climate change.

42. An innovative action of the Forest Investment Plan will focus on the harmonization of
the rules and regulations of the State with the rules and ancestral knowledge of local
communities, whose lack of recognition has led to an increase in ungovernability and,
consequently, to an increasing deterioration of the natural resources. In other words, one
of the innovative and scalable actions of this plan will be aimed at promoting the
participation and knowledge of local communities as a viable strategy to ensure the
conservation and sustainable use of forest resources as vital elements for the life and the
subsistence of the human being.

43. This project will also ensure the conservation of valuable carbon stocks contained in the
remaining natural forests, both at the level of core areas (full conservation) and in areas
under sustainable forest management. One of the most promising cases is the 497,653 ha
under sustainable management certified by the FSC in the multipurpose area of the MBR,
and whose integrity, to date, is the best of the country's forest cover . At the level of core
areas, the country still has significant reserves for biodiversity conservation and valuable
sources of ecosystem services.

44. FIP interventions will foster the following actions: a) strengthening governance in
protected areas to ensure the conservation and functionality of remaining forest
ecosystems; b) consolidation of governance in indigenous territories and local
communities; and, c) generation of sustainable livelihoods within and outside the forest,
promoting SFM (timber and non-timber products) as well as ecosystem services as
valuable tools for the conservation and development of the National REDD+ Strategy.

A.1.2.3 Proposed objectives and investment strategies
General objective: To promote the effective management of the forest landscape and its
ecosystem services in pilot areas.	
Specific objectives
   a)     Strengthen institutional capacity in the administrative, legal, technical and
          operational fields, in order to improve forest governance and governability of
          participating actors.
    b)      Promote the involvement of local actors in order to generate strategic
          partnerships and to promote full and effective participation in the control,
          monitoring (social oversight) and forest landscape management.
    c)      Consolidate and diversify sustainable productive activities in the forest
          landscape, to promote the development of livelihoods -mainly in indigenous
          peoples, women's groups and local communities- and the enhancement of
          ecosystem services.

Component 1: Strengthening the capacities of social organizations and institutions
on forest governance and governability issues

45. INAB and Conap have the legal mandate for forest management, sustainable
development and biodiversity conservation, which is an opportunity for FIP
interventions in the proposed areas.

46. This component will promote the strengthening of governance mechanisms, both
institutional and social organization of indigenous peoples and local communities,
which will allow the harmonization of management in the management of natural
resources in the territories of intervention. This is intended to be achieved through the full
and effective participation of social organizations in such management, at the local and
national levels progressively. This strengthening will be planned at the central level in
institutions (for national implementation processes) and in the territories prioritized in the
investment plan, in areas where there is greater potential to contribute to the objectives
of the FIP. Special emphasis will be placed on regional offices in Petén, Izabal, Verapaces,
Chiquimula (east region) and Quetzaltenango (highlands), as well as on organizations
operating in these territories. These actions can then be escalated to other areas of the
country. This is considered a transversal component of support to the other components
described in this project.

47. In governance issues, the need to implement new common forms of forest management
that actively involve the various sectors related to administrative, legal, technical and
operational areas is evident in the country, so as to generate sustainability processes in


                                           95
    forest management. In this sense, actions will be promoted to reduce the threats
    associated with deforestation and forest degradation in priority areas of intervention.


48. Monitoring and prevention actions: As the name implies it, they seek to monitor and
prevent a priori the occurrence of events that put the integrity of the forests at risk, so that
quick response actions can be taken to control them. These actions include the
following: a) creation and strengthening of monitoring and control centers with a focus on
early warning systems related to deforestation and degradation; b) reactivation and
consolidation of the inter-institutional group against illegal logging.

49. Actions of applicability of the current environmental legislation: The aim is to
harmonize and strengthen the institutional framework of the State and the social
organization of indigenous peoples and local communities in order to perform well in the
face of problems that threaten the forest resource. FIP interventions will be aimed at
strengthening the following actions:

    a) Improve the mechanisms for the interpretation and application of environmental
      legislation with the participation of the local actors involved.

    b) Harmonize, update and standardize technical instruments, norms and internal
      institutional administrative processes related to forest management.

    c) Know and analyze the internal norms and rules of indigenous peoples regarding
      forest management, for a harmonization between State and community instruments.

    d) Support the implementation of the objectives and goals of the following strategies:
      Attention to indigenous peoples; Gender equity (institutional); Restoration of the
      Guatemalan forestry landscape (national); Production and sustainable use of
      fuelwood; and, National biodiversity strategy in the selected territories.

      50. This component will ensure gender mainstreaming in activities to
      strengthen institutional and social governance mechanisms of indigenous
      peoples and local communities. For example, it will facilitate the representation of
      women at the inter-agency table against illegal logging.



Component 2: Strategic partnerships with local actors to carry out control and
surveillance activities
51. This component seeks the participation of local actors in prevention actions and control
      and monitoring processes in protected areas and community territories. Likewise, the


                                            96
      development of public-private partnerships between Conap and INAB and producers
      located in protected areas, and between these and local or regional industry or
      companies, seeking compensation for hydrological services (or other services) that are
      under the management of local communities. Interventions will be aimed at:
      strengthening the capacities of local actors in monitoring, control and surveillance
      activities; strengthen and create partnerships that promote governance and
      governability in the territories; promote the generation, capture and analysis of
      information through homologated methodologies and participatory techniques.
It will also facilitate the presence of women in the training of local actors, as well as in the
processes of creating partnerships to promote governance and governability in the
territories.	
Several strategic sites will be selected where conditions exist for the application of this
approach; for example, communities adjacent to forest concessions in the process of
regeneration (La Colorada, Cruce a la Colorada, among others), or communities with
agreements for the conservation55	 of national parks (Laguna del Tigre, Sierra del Lacandón
and Sierra de las Minas, Punta de Manabique Reserve, Sierra Caral, among others).
Likewise, the strengthening of partnershhps with ancestral models for the management of
natural resources, such as "parcialidades" (model of indigenous peoples in the highlands),
community forests, among others, will be considered. These groups are located on the main
fronts of deforestation and degradation of the country, so that joint work will generate
models that can then be scaled within these territories, or in others.


Component 3. Social and economic valuation of environmental goods and services

52. The component proposes the development and management of entrepreneurship
related to the management and valuation of the main ecosystem services in indigenous
peoples, local communities and priority areas of Sigap. In general, it covers the
identification and valuation of ecosystem services with payment potential for
environmental services (PES), including carbon sequestration; long-term carbon
storage in woody biomass and soil organic matter; conservation of biodiversity, as well as
the processes that determine and maintain biodiversity at all levels (landscape, species
and genes).

53. Among the FIP perspectives, valuation is conceived comprehensively, encompassing the
economic, social and environmental aspects of any component of the ecosystem. As a
whole, it considers collection and/or production, processing and marketing of goods and
services under the criteria of environmental, social and economic sustainability.


55 Mechanism established within the legal framework of protected areas to generate agreements with communities based on them,
with a view to promoting their involvement in management and conservation activities.


                                                                  97
54. This component will make it possible to visualize environmental, social and economic
     co-benefits at the local and national levels, promoting public awareness about the
    maintenance of foreste areas for the generation of goods and services. In addition,
    contribute to the country's mitigation efforts in support of compliance with national
    and international commitments on climate change.

Interventions will be oriented towards the promotion of the following actions:	

   1. Identification of priority areas with potential to generate environmental goods and
      services (ecosystemic).
   2. Valuation and characterization of goods and services in identified areas.
   3. Development of tools to incorporate the value of environmental goods and services
      into institutional planning indicators.
   4. Generation of financial mechanisms of payment for environmental services.



Pilot cases will be identified in areas where there is a threat of deforestation or
degradation, as an alternative for communities involved in forest management in these
territories. Preliminarily, potential PES cases will be identified for water in communal
forests in the highlands and eastern region, as well as tourism in Izabal, the Verapaces and
Petén. These cases will generate models that can then be scaled and/or replicated in other
territories.


Component 4. Consolidation and diversification of sustainable livelihoods

55. This component focuses on improving the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, women's
groups and local communities through the development of productive models that
promote the sustainable use of biological diversity (ecotourism, family farms,
underutilized plants, minor livestock species, among others). It also focuses on
strengthening ongoing ventures related to non-timber forest products. The promotion of
these actions will reduce socio-environmental vulnerability linked to the degradation of
ecosystems, generating, as co-benefits, improvements in food security, health and
sustainable development.

56. Similarly, there will be the potential generation of ecotourism projects -whose actions
are fully compatible with conservation initiatives and, at the same time, are very
valuable opportunities for the diversification of the livelihoods of the local population.
Some of the identifiable potential actions within the component are:




                                           98
       a) Identification of productive activities in order to consolidate them.
       b) Diagnosis of productive activities of the different local actors considering the
       environmental, social, economic, financial and cultural conditions of each intervention
       territory.

       c) Provision of opportunities for dialogue and exchange of knowledge, practices and
       experiences, prioritizing the ancestral knowledge of indigenous peoples in forestry
       matters.
      d) Generation and consolidation of forms of sustainable production linked to identified
      productive activities. This will allow the strengthening of natural resource
      management capacities on the part of women's groups, indigenous peoples and local
      communities.
       e) Establishment of pilot projects for productive activities and service provision for
       the improvement and diversification of livelihoods.
        f) Facilitation of women's access to strategic economic alternatives such as
       ecotourism, non-timber products and ecosystem services.	

57. Some examples that will include this component are: strengthening of the chain of xate
     and ramón (especially, groups of women) in Petén and Izabal; extraction/production of
     fungi in communal forests of the highlands; pineapple production (Abies
     guatemalensis); backyard productive systems with native plants and smaller species
     with indigenous groups in the east (Chortís, Poqomchíes, Xinkas), among others.

A.1.2.5 Preparation for implementation

58. Proposed actions will be developed with the technical and administrative support of
Conap and INAB, in coordination with local governments and civil society organizations
within Sigap, and the participation of local communities in indigenous territories.
Productive actions will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the master
plans of each protected area. Productive and commercial linkages will be promoted
inside and outside the forest, in order to reduce the pressure on the forest. For
regulatory issues, application of the institutional and legal framework, and measures to
prevent forest fires or illegal traffic of products, the corresponding institutional
platforms will also be taken into account, which will be consolidated. The
implementation of the components -including institutional strengthening, partnerships
with local actors, payment models for environmental services and diversification of
sustainable livelihoods- will be focused on those territories that face the greatest
threats of deforestation and degradation, and which present conditions to generate
changes and consolidate new models of sustainable forest management.

59. With regard to governance and governability issues regarding indigenous peoples and
local communities, implementation of the actions will be carried out in accordance with the
institutional mandates stipulated in the previously established strategies.
Specifically: a) strategy of attention to indigenous peoples; b) institutional strategy on
gender equity; c) strategy of restoration of the forest landscape; d) policy and national
biodiversity strategy (especially with respect to the commitment to "[...] respect,
preserve and maintain the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and
local communities embodying relevant ancestral lifestyles for the conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity"); e) national strategy for the management and
conservation of natural resources in communal lands. All this will observe the criteria and
guidelines of governance in the territories. In addition, these initiatives will be
strengthened by the Dedicated Grants Mechanism (DGM), once the Forest Investment
Plan has been approved.

A.1.2.6 Possible national and international partners

60.    Amont national partners we can mention:	a)	 local governments with territories under
      areas of incluence in Sigap;	 b)	 indigenous authorities; c) workshops on natural
      resources; d) civil society organizations with community territories and indigenous
      populations; e) second-level organizations that support ventures within protected areas
      (such as Acofop, for example); f) organized producer groups; f) local authorities; h)
      academia; i) group of REDD+ implementers; j) Ministry of the Interior (Mingob, for its
      acronym in Spanish), Public Ministry (MP, for its acronym in Spanish), Diprona, etc.

A.1.3 Project 3: Access to financing (public and private)

64. This project will improve access to public (forest incentives) and private funding, in
order to make forest investments viable. The main public funding will be
provided by the Government through the forestry incentives, both of the Probosque Law and
that of the Pinpep. The extension services of INAB and Conap, with the support
of the municipal offices, will promote the management of incentives in order
to facilitate competitive and equitable access to them (articulation with component 1 of
Project 1).

65. The Forest Investment Plan also seeks the mobilization of private capital for
investments in the sector, which will be provided by financial institutions through an
appropriate mechanism to be developed with the support of the IDB/MIF. For this
purpose,    similar   experiences      from    other      FIP   projects or   financial
mechanisms for forestry projects in the country will be taken up.

66. This mechanism is of particular importance in view of the credit constraints being
faced by forest producers, and in particular small businesses, producer groups
and, in particular, organized women's groups.




                                               104
67. During the development of Pinfor (1997-2016) more than 350,000 hectares of natural
forest and plantations were invested, which represented an investment by the State of
USD300 million.	 At present, the Probosque Law (Decree 02-2015) aims to expand the
country's forest cover through the creation and implementation of this incentive
program for the establishment, recovery, restoration, management, production and
protection of forests during the period 2017-2046. This law expands the goals of this
financing, its modalities and types of user. Despite this potential for public funding,
there are limitations to accessing it. For this reason, the strengthening of the capacities of
the implementing governmental instances is fundamental to overcome this barrier.

68. The financing of forestry activities (forestry, industry and wood products, including
furniture) by the financial system in Guatemala has been low, representing for
the period 2010-2013 between 0.3% and 0.5% of the total of credits granted during
each year. The credit portfolio has been between 1.5% and 19%, decreasing to 0.8% in
2014 and 2015. These data reflect the marginal attention that the sector receives due
to the lack of knowledge of its potential to strengthen the economy of the country. In
the analysis of investment opportunities and consultations, it was determined that one
of the constraints to the development of the sector is the lack of attractive
financial alternatives.

69. On the other hand, the cost of credit in the market is high, between 16% and 22% for
medium-sized companies, decreasing for more developed companies with
better financial capacities. In this sense, access is limited and the willingness of
producers and entrepreneurs in the sector to take out loans is low, making it
difficult to carry out investments to develop the sector.

70. The FIP intervention, for example, will return to the model generated by BID-MIF,
Rainforest Alliance and Financiera de Occidente, S.A. (Fidosa) in the development of
credit products for community forestry enterprises, as well as other successful
models of the forest sector. An innovative and transformative aspect of the FIP is to
establish a guarantee fund for the granting of loans under the investment plan
actions, where the guarantee fund is the means for the credit institution to share the
risks, with the proviso that they contribute a ratio of at least 4 to 1. In other words,
for each dollar of the guarantee fund, financial institutions put 4. In addition to
the guarantee of portfolios generated through FIP actions, the mechanism will
allow the timely payment of credits to financial institutions against possible
government arrears in the payment of incentives.

71. In the preliminary agreements, it is planned to use USD2 million financed by FIP and
USD2 million financed by MIF. For this reason, the transformative and scalable effect

72. Women's access to public and private financing will be facilitated. In the public sphere,
Pinpep's forestry incentives will be used to increase the percentage of women
beneficiaries of the program by 30%. In the private sector, women's access to financial
products will be ensured. For this purpose, the following will be studied:
    a) the creation of specific financial instruments to facilitate the participation of women;
    b) training of financial entities in gender and female customer service; and, (c) financial
    training for women.

      73. In summary, the contributions to the reduction of emissions by the three projects is
      3.90 million	 tCO2/year	 (1,68	 tCO2e/year	 project	 1	 and	 2.20	 tCO2e/year	 in project	 2), and
      the average cost of intervention in the projects is	 USD15.27	 million/year. Therefore,	
      the cost/effectiveness of reducing each	 tCO2e/year	 is	 USD3.91 considered to be an
      appropriate cost&effectiveness ratio.	 At the time of designing the projects, the
      financial breakdowns will be done on the scale of the activities and their estimated
      average cost, according to the geographic areas to be selected.

         Annex 2. Actors' participation plan

A.2.1 Plan for the participation of actors in the socialization process of the
Forest Investment Plan
1. The participation plan has undergone a participatory and dynamic development,
   involving a national level (IACG coordination), a regional level (Conap’s and
   INAB’s headquarters) and also a local level. There was valuable support from the
   MDBs, who have provided information and experience in the development of other FIP
   investment plans globally. In its different stages, calls were made with civil society
   actors and other government entities in order to make the pertinent decisions.
2. The first joint mission (IDB, WB/IFC and IACG and representatives of civil
   society) was held from September 7 to 9, 2016, to review progress in the
   formulation of the investment plan (IP), especially with regard to sections 1 to 5.
   From October 17 to November 8, 2016, four socialization workshops were held with a
   broad participation of the forest and environmental sector and Guatemala’s civil
   society. These workshops were held in the Highlands (Chichicastenango); Petén;
   Cobán, Alta Verapaz; and, Río Hondo, Zacapa, with participation of 312 people from
   different sectors, and a 24.67%participation of women (77). On January 26, 2017, a
   national workshop was held in Puerto Barrios, Izabal, with the participation of 85
   people (31 women and 54 men).
3. The design of the IP has been a process of inclusive cooperation at the national, regional
   and local level for which participatory methods have been developed, ensuring effective
   engagement of all interested actors.
4. From a methodological point of view, the roadmap was based on a process of
   socialization that sought to comply with the principles of honesty, truthfulness,
   transparency and respect for cultural diversity, inclusion of gender, and based on the
   governance of indigenous peoples. This has allowed the enhancement of the subject for
   the preparation of the programmes and projects with their corresponding components,
   according to each geographical area originally selected.
5. In socio-cultural terms, at least six linguistic communities have participated: Kaqchikel,
   K’iche’, Q’eqchi’, Poqomchi’, Itza’ and ladino/mestizo.




                                            108
6. Objectives

   •      To share with forest sector actors the scope and criteria of the investment plan, and
          how these relate to the selected geographic areas and the established investment
          preliminary lines.

    •       To set out investment opportunities and needs in the previously identified
          territories, in order to achieve the goals that allow the creation of links between
          sustainable forest management or other productive activities and the reduction of
          GHG, as well as the generation of co-benefits for the rural population.

   •      To identify possible cooperative partnerships between producers, industry and their
          link with the national or international market; and to identify the establishment of
          pilot projects —both timber and non-timber forest products, inside and outside the
          forest— whose scaling up is feasible.
7. Table A.2.1 summarizes the logical process of generating the actor’s participation plan,
  according to the development phases of the Guatemala FIP.

1. Identification of target group by each geographical area
8. A determining factor for the achievement of the objectives and results of the community
   participation plan was the adequate selection of the target group and the achievement of
   commitments of permanence by selected people. Below is a short list of actors identified
   and invited in thematic order:



                                                                109

              cooperatives —federations—, civil societies, producer networks, etc.)
      •       Relevant individual producers (in each geographic area of interest), both forest
              products (timber and non-timber) and products of agroforestry and silvopastoral
              systems

A.2.2. Actors’ Involvement Plan (AIP) for the implementation of Forest Investment
        Plan
10. 	As in the process of socialization of the Forest Investment Plan, the actors’ involvement
   plan will be methodologically based on a process of consultation oriented
   towards cultural diversity with gender considerations, based on the governance of
   indigenous peoples.
11. As in the process of socialization of the actors’ involvement plan, methodologically the
    process will be based on a process of socialization under a cultural diversity and gender
    approach, and based on the governance of indigenous peoples. .
12. In this phase not only the relationship between potential actors (producer-industry-
   market value chains) will be sought, but the mechanisms and responsibilities of
   the parties will be formalized in relation to the development of their specific
   actions. In other words, whenever possible, the establishment of formal
   agreements between members of the productive and value-added chain of forest and
   non-forest products will be sought. At this stage, the financial mechanism that will
   strengthen the renewal or updating of technological processes (equipment,
   machinery, training and technical assistance) must already be structured and ready
   for operation.
13. A relevant aspect to be sought at this stage of implementation of the plan will be the
    search for synergies and the application of lessons learned from other processes or
    projects with similar components in the target regions and at the global level, with the
    support of similar experiences provided by the MDBs. Additionally, the installed
    capacity of conservation programmes (Conap) and forest development programmes
    (INAB) and the private initiative will be exploited in terms of their operational capacity
    and alternative co-financing to achieve the proposed goals.
14. In this phase of implementation, it will be vital to capitalize on the experience and
    results of the consultations conducted for the development of the National REDD+
    Strategy, as well as synergies with early REDD+ initiatives —such as Guatecarbón and
    Bosques para la Vida, In the MBR, and in the Izabal area, the REDD+ project for
    Caribbean Guatemala.
15. In this phase of implementation, strong emphasis will also be placed on the definition
   and enforcement of safeguards at the national level and those defined by the MDBs (IDB
   and WB).

Annex 3.Process and progress on the Dedicated Grant Mechanism (DGM)

1. The Dedicated Grant Mechanism (DGM) is a global initiative that was created and
   developed as a special window of the Forestry Investment Program (FIP). It seeks
   to provide donations to indigenous peoples and local communities (PICL, for its acronym
   in Spanish) who want to strengthen their participation in the FIP and other
   REDD+ processes at the local, national and global levels.
2. The DGM design document emphasizes the need to strengthen the capacity of PICLs to
   participate effectively in all stages of the FIP and REDD+ processes, and create livelihood
   opportunities that generate both benefits of mitigation and adaptation to climate.
   The DGM intends to accomplish this task respecting the culture, the ancestral knowledge
   and the indigenous systems of forest management of the PICL. The general objective
   of the DGM is: “To improve the capacity and support of indigenous peoples
   and local communities' specific initiatives in FIP pilot countries to strengthen their
   participation in the FIP and other REDD+9 processes at the local, national and global
   levels.”
3. To date, the DGM as a program is implemented in eight FIP pilot countries (Brazil,
   Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mexico and
   Peru) through donor projects, under the overall framework of a global component that
   serves as a platform for the exchange of experiences and knowledge. Recently other pilot
   countries have been added: Guatemala, Ivory Coast, Ecuador, Mozambique, Nepal
   and the Republic of Congo.
4. In accordance with the rules of operation of the DGM, preparatory activities to start this
   initiative in each country depend on the approval of the investment plan. Once the
   document has been approved, the World Bank, as an implementing partner, can request
   resources to carry out the first phase of organization and governance for the DGM
   through a broad consultation phase for the formation of the National Directing Council
   (NDC). To date, only a few consultations and briefings have taken place
   with representatives of local interested groups and representatives of entities
   of the Government of Guatemala.
5. Some important steps in shaping the DGM for Guatemala are: Consultation phase for the
   integration of the system of governance and integration of the NDC and selection of the
   national implementing agency (NIA) responsible for the execution of donated funds
   in conjunction with local organizations. NSC members will be selected through a
   self-selection process that may or may not be facilitated by the World Bank
   during the preparation of the national DGM project.

          Annex 4. Preparation process of the FCPF/UNREDD R-PP
                         National REDD+ Strategy

A.4.1 Background
1. Guatemala is currently preparing the national strategy for reducing emissions from
   avoided deforestation and forest degradation and increasing carbon stocks (REDD+).
   This is being carried out with funding from the Forest Carbon
   Partnership Facility (FCPF),   amounting     to    USD8.8    million   implemented
   through the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG), which is leading the REDD
   + process, and formed by the Ministry           of   Environment     and     Natural
   Resources    (MARN); Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA);
   National Forest Institute (INAB) and National Council for Protected Areas (Conap).56
2. In December 2008, Guatemala submitted to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility
   (FCPF) its Readiness Project Idea Note (R-PIN), through which the country
   requested a review of its interest in participating in the Preparation of the FCPF,
   which included a summary of the state of land use in recent years, causes
   of deforestation, consultation processes at that time and potential inter-institutional
   arrangements that could be made for REDD+.
3. With the approved R-PIN, Guatemala continued with the next phase and agreed to
   USD3.8 million for the preparation of its REDD+ strategy at the national level. To
   this end, during the period 2011-2013, the country prepared a Readiness
   Preparation Proposal (R-PP), a document created to assist developing countries in
   preparing for their participation in REDD+, either through FCPF or the UN-REDD
   program.
4. The R-PP proposal for Guatemala addresses the basic components of REDD+ preparation,
   such as consultation and participation processes, interagency arrangements; grievance or
   complaint mechanisms; proposal for REDD+ activities; addressing the drivers of
   deforestation and/or forest degradation; related legal framework; reference levels of GHG
   emissions; forest monitoring and information systems and safeguards; incorporation of
   gender issues, among others.
5. In 2014, after approval of this proposal and formal access to these preparation resources,
   the Republic of Guatemala signed a technical cooperation agreement with the Inter-
   American Development Bank (IDB) as implementing partner of the FCPF. These funds are
   currently being executed through MARN, in coordination with the other IACG institutions.
6. To date, Guatemala has made significant progress in the preparation of its National
  REDD+ Strategy. In May 2016, it had access to additional funding		of FCPF preparation

56 See: http://www.iadb.org/en/projects/project-description-title,1303.html?id=GU-T1194.



                                                                   120
      for USD5 million. To this end, the country produced a mid-term report in which
      significant progress in the four components of the strategy was presented, in
      accordance with the FCPF preparation methodology. In Figure 1 (progress evaluation
      system) of the mid-term report to the FCPF, Guatemala presents its progress, by
      component and subcomponent, according to the evaluation system of the preparation
      package.
7. It is important to note that the process of preparation of the National REDD+ Strategy
   has been strengthened by the recent approval of the Probosque Law (Law Promoting the
   Establishment, Recovery, Restoration, Management, Production and Protection of Forests
   in Guatemala (Decree 2-2015) .57	 This law, with a validity of thirty years (2016-2046), is
   part of the economic instruments of the Forest Law, which are one of the two proposed
   strategy options for REDD+. Based on the experiences of Pinfor and Pinpep, Probosque
   brings qualitative progress by including new modalities of sustainable forest
   management and establishment of forest plantations, as stipulated in its regulations.
8. According to the Probosque Law, and depending on the availability of public resources,
   the State undertakes to allocate 1% of ordinary income annually, approximately USD1.2
   billion in thirty years (USD40 million per year). These public investments will have an
   open impact on the generation of 20,000 direct jobs and 60,000 indirect jobs per year;
   benefiting a total of 1.5 million families, of which an estimated 30% is made up of
   women.
 9.     Lhe appropriate articulation of the different environmental and forestry policy
      instruments with the National REDD+ Strategy foresees a reduction of emissions of
      approximately 20 million tons of CO2e	for the reference period 2016-2020, as established
      in the ER-PIN submitted in October 201458	and as detailed below.

      Annex 5. Context of the gender approach in Guatemala

1. The data available for the last two decades (1990-2010) show some achievements for
  Guatemalan women. Among them, there is a greater number of registered women, female
  candidates for elected positions, more women entering public spaces, as well as a greater
  number of indigenous and rural women involved in political processes. However, visible
  and invisible obstacles persist for their participation on equal terms, in the area of
  decision-making, affecting their communities and the country.
2. In the case of Guatemala, phenomena of discrimination against indigenous peoples and
   territorial exclusion are added and combined with gender discrimination, to limit in a
   broader and more structural way the enjoyment of citizens' rights and the development
   of the potential of women in different areas.
3. In Guatemala, since the Peace Accords in 1996, substantial changes have been sought in
   favor of women, considering that the State, through its various entities, must guarantee
   the opportunities for the integral development that can be achieved through the
   unification of efforts of the institutions that guide economic development. This is the
   minimum basis for women to build their own spaces based on social organization and
   local structures.
4. According to population data of the National Statistics Institute (INE), by 2015, the
  Guatemalan population amounts to 16.18 million inhabitants, of which 48.86% are men,
  and the remaining 51.14%, are women. Extreme poverty at the national level affects
  59.3% of the population (1,951,724 people), and general poverty affects 40.38%.
5. If information is disaggregated, it can be seen that extreme poverty and general poverty
   are more acute for women; poverty is also largely attributable to the indigenous
   population. The female and indigenous population is even more affected.
6. Productive sector.	 Women represent 53.4% of the working age population (WAP).
  However, only 35.9% of the economically active population (EAP) is made up of women
  (World Bank, 2015), a figure that is further reduced among indigenous women.
7. The first occupation of women is commerce, where 40.5% is employed; the second is the
   manufacturing industry, especially maquila and informal commerce, where 13.4% of
   women work. There are some economic activities that fail to reflect the reality of
   women's employment opportunities. For example, in agriculture, 14% of workers are
   women; however, in reality this figure could be higher, since the work of women in the
   sector is seen as a complementary activity and, sometimes, it is not even paid (INE,
   2014).	




                                           123
8.    Informal sector employment accounts for three quarters of national employment,
     especially in the rural area, where eight out of ten workers are in informal situations.
     Only 23.7% of men and 18.5% of women work in the formal sector (INE, 2014).
9.    Although the level of wages for women has improved in recent years, there are still
     gaps in all sectors. Indigenous women earn 54% of men's salaries, while
     non-indigenous women earn 62.9%.
10. Education.	 Literacy rate is 57% for indigenous women and 77.7% for indigenous
  men, while for non-indigenous people, the literacy rate for women is 83.7% and 88.9%
  for men. Primary school enrollment rates are very similar for women (85%) and men
  (86%). In secondary school, coverage rate is considerably reduced and the number of
  male enrollments (49%) exceeds that of women (45%). In tertiary education, it is
  women who most enroll in university: 19% compared to 18% of men. However, the
  country's university population is very small (INE, 2014)..
11. Head of household.	 Women represent 87.5% of family heads in single-parent
  households, while men are heads of nuclear households (99%) or extended families
  (70%). Total data show that men are heads of households of 57.5% of Guatemalan
  families, and women of 42.5% (INE, 2014).
12. Violence against women. In 2008, the Law Against Feminicide and other forms
  of Violence against Women was passed, which establishes penalties for physical,
  economic or psychological violence against women because of their gender,
  including rape, spousal abuse and domestic violence. According to the Human
  Rights Commission of Guatemala, 560 women were victims of feminicide in 2012.
  Despite the penalties established by the law, approximately 98% of cases of
  feminicide         remain        in      impunity        in         Guatemala.

13. The lags of violence due to internal armed conflict, which have not yet been healed,
  coupled with racism and discrimination against indigenous peoples and domestic
  violence have created fear, insecurity, lack of self-esteem and self-assessment of their
  capabilities and potentialities among Mayan women.
14. According to the latest report of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
  Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), sexual harassment at work is a matter of
  particular concern in Guatemala; especially that of the maquila industry and the
  domestic sector, both highly exploited and scarcely regulated.




                                             124
15. Political participation. Guatemala has a small representation of women in high
   government positions. Women hold 13% of seats in Congress and 20% of ministerial
   positions.
16. 		For the general elections of 2015, the voter register amounted to 7,556,873 people and it
   was recorded that 46% of the total electors were men; 1,736,698 voters were registered in
   the department of Guatemala and 734,079 belong to the metropolitan area. The number of
   1,65,620 illiterate women cast their ballots in the September elections. 57% percent of the
   electorate was between the ages of 18 and 40.
17. Women occupying seats defined by popular election represent only 8.1% of the seats
  decided on the ballot. This percentage places Guatemala among the countries in the region
  with the lowest political participation rate of women.
18. Of a total of 338 municipalities, only 8 women were elected; only one is indigenous. These
   are the only women who took office as mayors, compared to 330 men who took office as
   mayors. According to the figures of the Citizen Registry, 4,556 women were candidates;
   18% of the electoral roll, in which the majority is women, because they occupy 52% of this
   electoral roll.
19. Ownership of land.	 There are no legal restrictions on women's access to land
   property; however, the percentage of women who own it is only 6.5%. This is due to
   customs and attitudes of a patriarchal culture in which the man, head of the family,
   makes most decisions related to the land. Widowed or unmarried women with
   dependents control the land they have inherited from their deceased parents or
   husbands. The majority of other women do it through a male relative. In indigenous
   communities, women are even more marginalized in regards to access to land by their
   male relatives.
20. According to the National Agricultural Survey (ENA 2008), 85% of crop land in all forms
   of tenure (property, lease, and usufruct) is in the hands of male producers, in contrast to
   15% that is in the hands of women producers. While individual male producers own orf
   lease most of the land, individual female producers own it through usufruct.
21. Forests. According to statistics from 2016, in Pinfor, 75.81% of beneficiaries are men,
   and 35% are women. The Pinpep program shows a higher percentage of women's
   participation, with 30.83% of beneficiaries, and 63.83% of male beneficiaries. This is in
   compliance with the Pinpep Law, which mandates giving priority to the participation of
   women in order to promote gender equality.59

Gender-related legislation
22. Guatemala ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
   against Women (CEDAW) in 1982. As its name implies, this international instrument
   aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, forcing States to reform
   laws to ensure gender equality, establishing, among other things, effective public
   institutions..
23. With the signing of CEDAW, the Guatemalan State contracted a series of legal obligations
    of international character that were reflected in article 4 of the Political Constitution of
    the Republic, concerning the inclusion of the principle of freedom and equality between
    women and men.
24. 	In the area of protection against violence, Guatemala ratified in 1995 the Inter-American
    Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women,
    known as the Convention of Belem do Pará. This convention is one of the main human
    rights instruments for women to implement concerted action to prevent, punish and
    eliminate violence against women based on gender, while condemning all forms of
    violence against women perpetrated at home, in the labor market or by the State and/or
    its agents. Table A.5.1 presents a chronological list of laws and policies in favor of
    women.

   necessary measures to restrict the use of technologies that violate, degrade or endanger
   the balance of the ecological system, the biosphere and the national environment
26. 	 The Framework Law against Climate Change (Decree 07-2013) includes among the
   guiding principles that must be observed in decision-making and in action, integrality,

   steering role will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Biodiversity
   Policy, facilitating actions between the different public and private institutions The
   Convention on Biological Diversity is the first global agreement focused on the
   conservation and sustainable use of resources, as well as on equitable sharing of the
   benefits derived from the use of biological diversity. This instrument reaffirms the

   relevance, within a framework of equality between men and women and promoting
   integral rural development.
30. 	 MAGA's efforts are defined through the creation of the Gender Unit as a special unit of

    Independent Review of the Forest Investment Plan of Guatemala
                            (GUAT-FIP)

                                                                          Reviewer: David Kaimowitz
                                                                         Date of review: 19 April 2017

PART O: Setting the context
(from the reviewers overall understanding of the FIP document)
The overall objective of the Guatemala FIP is to contribute to the country’s Green House Gas (GHG)
emissions targets by reducing deforestation and degradation and increasing forest carbon stocks.
The FIP has identified four priority regions for an initial intervention of 5 years, covering a total of
86,038 kms (80% of the national territory):
    • Petén (3.6 m ha) is the region with both the most forest and the most deforestation. Forest
      clearing there is mostly for cattle ranching, maize and bean cultivation, and oil palm. More
      than three quarters of all land in protected areas is in Petén. Communities and companies sus-
      tainably manage the forests in the Multiple Use Zone (MUZ) of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve
      (MBR). Protected areas outside the MUZ have the highest deforestation rates.
   • The Verapaces and Izabal (2.1 m ha) are the second most forested region. It also has deforesta-
     tion hot spots, but was chosen largely due to its dynamic forest plantation sector, involving both
     cooperatives and companies.
   • The Western (highlands) region (2.0 m ha) has the largest Indigenous population. Indigenous
     communities manage a substantial area of fragmented coniferous forests. Thanks to commu-
     nities tree planting and natural regeneration, the region’s forest cover has been increasing.
     Nonetheless, some places suffer from forest degradation due to excessive fuelwood harvesting.
   • The Eastern region (0.9 m ha) has limited forest cover (and deforestation), but significant ins-
     talled timber processing capacity and small-scale plantations. It also has high poverty rates.
The Guat-FIP proposal’s strategy to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and increase forest
carbon stocks focuses on three sets of activities: 1) strengthening the institutional capacity of the
INAB, the National Protected Areas Council (Conap), and other government agencies; 2) supporting
sustainable forest management, including natural forest management, timber plantations, agrofor-
estry, and silvo-pastoral systems; and 3) improving forest governance and promoting non-timber
forest-based income options, particularly in protected areas and indigenous communities. The work
in Petén would emphasize avoiding deforestation. The other regions would focus more on forest
restoration. The strategy seeks to undertake these efforts in ways that reduce poverty, ensure food
security, improve forest sector competitiveness, promote gender equality and citizen participation,
respect indigenous rights, and strengthen the rule of law.
The proposal builds on Guatemala’s main strengths with regards to forests: 1) well-functioning com-
munity forestry concessions in Petén; 2) a tradition of indigenous communal forests in certain re-
gions; 3) a successful government forest incentives program; 4) the presence of municipal forest
offices; and 5) a functioning national forest service (INAB) and protected areas department (CONAP).
Guatemala has made progress towards developing a National REDD+ strategy. An Inter-institution-
al Coordinating Group (CGI) composed of the Ministries of Environment (MARN) and Agriculture
(MAGA), INAB and CONAP, is leading that process. The REDD+ strategy will revolve around two key
pillars: 1) strengthening Guatemala’s protected area system and 2) strengthening the economic in-


                                                   130
      centives for sustainable forestry activities. Those two pillars are also at the heart of the FIP invest-
      ment plan, and the CGI would guide FIP implementation.
      The FIP proposes to support forest-based investment through two projects managed by the IADB
      in collaboration with the World Bank. Both projects are expected to be implemented over five years
      (2018-2022). The two projects’ total proposed budget would be $76,360,000, of which $3,150,000
      would be a FIP grant, $20,850,000 would be FIP loans, and the remaining $53,325,000 would be gov-
      ernment counterpart funds. Guatemala would also be eligible to receive DGM funding once the FIP
      Investment Plan was approved. The FIP Investment Plan proposes the following interventions:
      Project 1 Sustainable Forest Management
      Component 1, Institutional Strengthening:
           • Provide training, equipment, and other resources to improve INAB and Conap’s capacity for
             planning, monitoring, extension activities, and the administration of forestry incentives.
           • Train the Municipal Forestry Offices in administration of forestry incentives, forest manage-
             ment plans, and activities related to timber plantations and protected areas.
      Component 2, Integrating Forest Management – Processing – Markets:
           • Promote strategic alliances and provide institutional strengthening and financial support to
             forest industries and grassroots forestry producer organizations to make forest-related supply
             chains more competitive and sustainable.
           • Provide market intelligence, technical assistance, and other support to help producers increase
             their added value, identify new markets, utilize non-traditional species, certify their produc-
             tion, access funding, and improve their productivity.
      Component 3, Access to Public and Private Financing: 60
           • Assist local communities and other producers to get access to government forestry incentives
             and use those incentives appropriately.
           • Create a financial instrument to provide private credit for forest-related activities, supported
             by a loan guarantee fund and a technical assistance fund. In addition to funding commercial
             forestry, this financial instrument could also reduce problems linked to delays in government
             disbursement of forestry incentive funds.
      Component 4, Forest Landscape Restoration:
           • Work with multiple stakeholders to conduct forest inventories, develop forest management
             plans, monitor supply chains, and undertake educational campaigns and training designed to
             ensure the sustainability of fuelwood production.
           • Use forestry incentives to promote the production of shaded coffee, cocoa, cardamom, and
             other perennials in priority areas for forest restoration.
           • Provide farmers with technical assistance and training about silvo-pastoral systems and forest
             restoration in degraded pastures and help them access forestry incentives for this purpose.
           • Support restoration of natural forests in sites near other funded activities.
      All four components include measures to ensure strong involvement of women, including activities
      specifically for women and quotas for women’s participation in mixed activities.

large structural fuelwood deficit.
The practical relevance of this is that Component 4 of Project 1 proposes
more regulation of fuelwood production and trade to solve what may be a
non-existent or very localized problem. Most countries that have tried to reg-
ulate fuelwood have had little sustained success, and this would be a poor
use of INAB’s very limited resources. On the other hand, the proposals to
invest in increasing fuelwood supply seem appropriate, independent of any
fuelwood deficit. (Note that, in any case, there is little relation between result
3 and the proposed performance indicators 3.1 and 3.2.).

mates the program will reduce net carbon emissions by 3.88 mtCO2e
per year. That would represent roughly one third of the average national
net forest carbon emissions between 2000 and 2010. If implemented as
proposed, it would improve the capacity of Guatemala’s two most im-
portant forestry agencies. Better collaboration between those agencies
and the municipal forest offices, grassroots community organizations,
and private companies could improve many aspects of forest policy.
The proposed financial mechanism would unleash an estimated $30
million in new private forestry lending. Tens of millions of dollars of
government forestry incentives would be better administered. New in-
novations in forest processing, payments for environmental services,
eco-tourism, non-timber forest products, silvo-pastoral systems, and
company —community partnerships could generate self-sustaining
growth. National forest policies that address gender inequalities, indig-
enous rights, and traditional knowledge more consistently would also
provide substantial benefits.

Project 2: Strengthening Governance and Livelihood Diversification (focused on protected ar-
eas, indigenous communities, and surrounding areas)
Component 1, Strengthening Government Agencies & Civil Society in Forest Governance:
   • Creation and strengthening of centers for control and monitoring of deforestation and degrada-
     tion and reactivation of the inter-institutional roundtable on illegal logging.
   • Support multi-stakeholder dialogues and consultancies to build understanding and adjust and
     implement government strategies, rules, norms, and administrative processes related to fo-
     rests as well as traditional community norms and procedures.
Component 2, Strategic Alliances with Local Actors for Monitoring and Control:
   • Establish alliances with community organizations in protected areas and indigenous lands fo-
     cused on monitoring, control, and vigilance, payment for environmental services, and commu-
     nity – company partnerships.
Component 3, Giving Value to Environmental Goods and Services:
   • Develop pilot projects for payment for environmental services, eco-tourism, bottled water, and
     similar goods and services.
Component 4, Consolidation and Diversification of Sustainable Livelihoods:
   • Assist with studies, policy dialogues, training, exchanges, and other activities to strengthen
     existing non-timber forest product and tourism efforts.
As with Project 1, the document envisions specific efforts in each component to ensure gender equal-
ity.

Part III: Conclusions and Recommendations
Overall assessment of the Investment Proposal
Guatemala is an excellent candidate for FIP funding. Over the last two decades, its community forest-
ry concessions and forest incentive policies have significantly reduced net forest carbon emissions.
Nonetheless, both the community concessions and the forestry incentives face major challenges. The
FIP proposal would strengthen the forest incentives programs and provide some limited support to
the community forestry concessions.
The main forest regions have strong municipal forestry offices, second and third tier community
forestry organizations, conservation NGOs, and/or multilateral and bilateral forestry projects. The
FIP proposal appropriately emphasizes building partnerships between the government forestry and
protected areas agencies and these stakeholders, as well as with private forestry companies. The
proposal accurately assesses key obstacles to competitive and sustainable forest management, in-
cluding limited access to private finance, delays in disbursing forestry incentives, weak market intel-
ligence, insufficient vertical integration and diversification, low productivity, and limited attention
to the needs of women and indigenous communities. Concrete steps are foreseen to address each
of these. Relevant problems the proposal largely ignores include: burdensome regulatory policies
and practices, biases and lack of transparency in the allocation of forestry incentives, and conflicts in
protected areas.
Given INAB and Conap’s weaknesses and the relatively modest FIP budget, the proposal may be over-
ly ambitious. The proposed «priority» regions include practically all the country’s forest and the the-
matic areas covers a very wide range of topics.
Overall, the reviewer assessed a total of 47 criteria and indicators with the following scoring:

       The criteria and/or indicator has been generally met and there is no need for any revision or
 35
       larger complement at this stage.
       The criteria and/or indicator is partially met, it is recommended to relook at some of aspects
 10
       that need further clarification.
       The criteria and/or indicator is partially met and need to be developed (or, at the current
  2
       stage the criteria is not relevant).
Some recommendations that could enhance the quality of the investment plan
1. Explain what the FIP will do to contribute to renewing and expanding the community forestry
   concessions in the Multiple Use Zone of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve (MBR). This is the largest
   compact forest in Guatemala. The existing concessions end in several years and there is no clear
   process to renew them. If they are not renewed, the entire Multiple Use Zone would be at extreme
   risk of massive deforestation, similar to what has occurred in Petén’s national parks. Investment
   Plan will be addressing strengthening current SFM activities that community groups develop in
   the MUZ. This includes incorporation of technological and financial support to increase forest
   products (timber and non-timber) value added, while gender participation and employment gen-
   eration are addressed. Additionally, investment plan will provide institutional support for com-
   pleting assignment of total MUZ territory to organized community groups through concession
   mechanisms. This may imply none less than 350,000 ha of tropical forest. To ensure this challeng-
   ing goal, a close institutional work will be performed with direct support of grassroots and sec-
   ond level local organizations such as Acofop and local municipalities´ Natural Resources Offices.
   Support from key local and international NGO´s will highly be appreciated. Tangible support from
   Guatecarbón, an outstanding early REDD+ initiative, is expected.

2. Consider	narrowing	the	proposal’s	geographic	and	thematic	scope,	concentrating	on	a	smaller
   area	and	eliminating	activities	that	are	marginal	to	the	program’s	overall	success.	In	some	cases
   this	may	mean	being	more	specific	about	planned	activities;	in	others	it	may	require	eliminating
   activities.
   During	 projects	 preparation	 a	 more	 focused	 geographical	 approach	 will	 be	 defined	 to	 ensure
   consistent	overall	success	and	impact	in	planned	actions	along	selected	territories.	For	sure	this
   focusing	exercise	will	include	narrowing	geographic	and	thematic	IP	scope	with	direct	participa-
   tion	of	relevant	stakeholders.	It	is	important	to	highlight,	however,	that	financial	mechanism	will
   be	open	to	a	broader	level,	in	order	to	ensure	IP	spill	over	a	wider	number	of	beneficiaries	within
   the	sector.
3. Ensure	that	the	DGM	becomes	operational	as	quickly	as	possible	and	that	FIP	and	DGM	efforts
   are	fully	integrated.	The	second	and	third	tier	community	forestry	organizations	are	crucial	for
   the	FIP’s	success.	This	proposal	would	support	those	organizations	through	training,	technical
   assistance,	and	studies	and	facilitate	greater	multi-stakeholder	coordination,	but	they	will	also
   require	DGM	funding	to	strengthen	their	own	activities.
   As	soon	as	the	IP	is	approved	by	FIP	committee,	DGM	mechanism	will	be	developed	according	to
   stated	guidelines	and	methodological	approach.	Most	indigenous	peoples	and	community	groups,
   who	participated	in	national	and	regional	consultant	workshops,	were	informed	on	this	issue	and
   therefore	a	large	participation	is	expected	on	the	design	of	Guatemala	DGM.

4. Provide	quantitative	estimates	for	as	many	of	the	expected	activities,	outputs,	and	outcomes	as
   possible	and	present	them	in	a	few	tables	or	graphs.	The	proposal	already	has	some	of	this	infor-
   mation,	    but	     it	  is	   incomplete	      and	   dispersed	      throughout	    the	  text.
   At this stage of formulation of the Forest Investment Plan, estimates of activities, outcomes and
   outputs are displayed generically (Sections 9.1 and 9.2). Once the IP is approved, each project
   will have its own set of quantitative and qualitative estimates and indicators, which will be an
   integral part of the monitoring plan. All this information will be properly organized and agreed
   with the groups of beneficiaries to ensure the fulfillment of the established goals.

5. Focus	more	on	activities	that	increase	fuelwood	supply	and	less	on	difficult	and	probably	un-sus-
   tainable	 efforts	 to	 regulate	 fuelwood	 production	 and	 marketing.	 Further	 data	 collection	 and
   analysis	 to	 examine	 forest	 biomass	 dynamics	 in	 Guatemala’s	 highlands	 could	 provide	relevant
   insights	                           for	                      these	                           efforts.
   The IP proposal takes both approaches into account, although there is likely to be a greater level
   of effort in increasing the supply of fuelwood, starting with the sustainable planning of natural
   forests (from which almost 85% of the fuelwood consumed in the country comes from). In
   addition, it includes the establishment of pilot energy forests, taking advantage of ancestral
   knowledge about the species of each region. Obviously the sustainable planning of natural
   forests entails a production and transportation component, which is expected to reduce illegal
   trade in wood and firewood. The contribution of other parallel initiatives such as NAMA (on the
   efficient use of fuelwood) and the MAPS-UKSA Project (forest management and protection
   project) will allow to proactively strengthen the actions promoted by the FIM in a coordinated
   way.

6. Explain	 how	 the	 FIP	 will	 support	 REDD	 initiatives	 such	 as	 Guatecarbón	 and	 «Bosques	 para	 la
   Vida»,	in	Petén,	and	the	«Caribbean	REDD	project»,	in	Izabal.	The	FIP	proposal	should	have	an-		




                                                   152
    alyzed	these	major	initiatives	and	given	clear	rationale	for	how	the	FIP	might	relate	to	them.	At	
    present	there	is	only	one	indirect	reference	to	these	initiatives	in	Annex	2.

    Given the nature of the funds stipulated in the Guatemala FIP (with 87.50% of concessional
    credits, totaling USD20.85 million), it is expected that through the development of a financial
    mechanism, additional resources can be catalyzed with the participation of banks and local
    financial institutions to support the performance of forestry and agroforestry producers. In
    other words, “inclusive” financial resources will be allocated to all productive actors
    (community and forest industries) involved in sustainable forest-use processes (timber and
    non-timber) and high-value agroforestry products in international markets, and that at the
    same time demand a margin or financial amount that allows them to complete their portfolio
    through access to FIP financing in flexible and inclusive conditions.
    Many of these groups are located precisely where early REDD+ initiatives are supported by the
    indicated projects, but they need substantial improvements in their production chains and,
    especially, technological innovation and renewal of equipment. In other words, FIP funds are
    really meant to boost productive projects, which are potential candidates for managing carbon
    credit payments in the near future.

7. Give	 more	 explicit	 attention	 to	 how	 the	 government	 agencies	 and	 other	 relevant	 stakeholders
   will	learn	from	these	efforts,	including	analyzing	the	results	and	documenting	and	sharing	the
   lessons.
   Both projects have the responsibility of developing specific monitoring and evaluation plans
   towards the progress of the proposed indicators. This plan includes a component on
   documentation and dissemination of lessons learned under a continuous improvement plan.
8. Ensure	that	grievance	mechanisms	and	conflict	resolution	strategies	are	in	place	shortly	after	the
   program	 becomes	 operational.	 These	 should	 include	 procedures	 for	 addressing	 conflicts	 over
   indigenous	rights	in	protected	areas	and	the	allocation	of	forestry	incentives,	among	others.
   The recommendation is very appropriate and will be taken into consideration as soon as the
   Forest Investment Plan is approved.

Deforestation and degradation of forests and soils is a
growing concern in Guatemala, as it is a problem that
has a direct impact on the well-being of present and
future generations. Aware of this reality, a diversity of
representatives from government institutions, social
organizations and international organizations, as well as
representatives from particularly relevant groups such
as indigenous peoples and women, shared the
experience and learning to create, in a participatory
way, the present Forest Investment Plan.

The implementation of the actions included in this
planning instrument is expected to address the direct
and underlying causes of deforestation and degradation
in priority regions of the Guatemalan territory. The
strategies are based on a territorial approach at the
forest landscape level, and integrate multisectoral
interventions under the programmatic coordination of
the National Forest Institute (INAB) and the National
Council for Protected Areas (Conap), with the Ministry
of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and
technical support from the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Food (MAGA). It also aims to promote the
participation of the private sector, as well as various
social organizations with presence in the different
prioritized territories. The idea is to achieve, jointly and
collaboratively, the necessary investments to address
the causes of deforestation and degradation in
Guatemala.
