Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	   ix
Executive Summary
The Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs,
co-hosted by SecureNutrition and the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance,
was held in Moscow, Russia on the 10th and 11th of September, 2015. The
event drew approximately 150 participants from over twenty countries, and
provided a space for in-depth conversations anchored to country case studies
that featured programs integrating social protection instruments and nutrition
principles.
  The role of effective nutrition-sensitive social protection programs has been
increasing, and the current global development agenda calls for the profile of
nutrition to be raised by ensuring strong leadership and commitment at all
levels and across multiple sectors. Partnerships are playing an increasingly
important role in the development of assistance architecture. The Global
Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs (Global Forum)
aimed to support these efforts by contributing to the evidence base for policy
options and operational actions.



Global Forum Objectives and Achievements
(See also: Annex 1)
1.	 Better understand existing needs of countries to assist them in setting
    up well-functioning nutrition-sensitive social protection programs.
    The Global Forum was anchored to a series of country case studies com-
    piled especially for the event.1 The case studies were the focus of two work-
    ing group sessions aimed at facilitating a critical review of how the
    programs work. All case studies followed a template that was designed to
    highlight key aspects of social protection programming, approaches to
    improving nutrition, and, where possible, impacts and challenges. The
    case studies featured programs implemented by a range of government
    agencies, donors, and partners, and represented a variety of social protec-
    tion instruments and strategies for integrating nutrition principles span-
    ning all global regions. Four of the case studies were selected for “program
    snapshot” presentations during the Global Forum, which highlighted key
    cross-cutting themes.2
2.	 Support countries in catalyzing, building commitment for, designing,
    establishing, managing, and scaling up nutrition-sensitive social pro-
    tection programs through providing technical assistance and capacity
    development to governments.
    The Global Forum was designed to convey the synergistic potential of
    nutrition-sensitive social protection. In an evaluation immediately fol-
    lowing the event (Annex 11), the vast majority of participants (91 per-
    cent) reported that the Global Forum provided new information, insights
    and approaches, including exposure to new nutrition terminology and
    examples of nutrition-sensitive social protection programs. Most

Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	          1
    participants also reported their intention to share what they learned with
    colleagues (85 percent) and use it to inform future nutrition-sensitive
    social protection program design and implementation (84 percent). In a
    follow-up survey conducted eight months after the Global Forum (Annex
    12), all respondents (20) reported to have shared information gained
    from the event with colleagues in their organization; 81 percent shared
    information with colleagues outside of their organization; 81 percent
    reported to have led or supported training on nutrition-sensitive social
    protection; 92 percent reported to have used resources learned about or
    received at the Global Forum in their work; and 85 percent reported to
    have learned information or approaches that made an impact on their
    work at the country level.
3.	 Disseminate best policies and practices and innovative approaches in
    the area of social protection systems linking food security and nutri-
    tion, poverty reduction, and agricultural production.
    Learning from the Global Forum is captured in the three-part series
    Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition,3 which
    includes a Summary of Evidence, a Compendium of Case Studies, and a
    Forum Report (this document). The Summary of Evidence addresses “the
    why” for nutrition-sensitive social protection programs, and the
    Compendium addresses “the how.” All materials from the Global Forum
    (e.g. resource library, keynote addresses, and program snapshot presenta-
    tions) were provided to attendees on a USB thumb drive, are available on
    the SecureNutrition website (www.securenutrition.org), and have been
    shared through newsletters, seminars, and other fora.
4.	 Improve access to knowledge and build awareness related to nutri-
    tion-sensitive social protection through presentation of existing inter-
    national initiatives, knowledge platforms and tools, including the
    SecureNutrition Knowledge Platform.
    The Global Forum catalyzed the compilation of a curated library of
    resources on nutrition-sensitive social protection, which was provided to
    participants on a USB thumb drive and made available on the
    SecureNutrition website (www.securenutrition.org). In conjunction with
    the Global Forum in Moscow, the FAO Global Forum on Food and
    Nutrition Security and SecureNutrition cohosted a multilingual online
    discussion4 that explored key questions related to nutrition-sensitive
    social protection. Finally, the Global Forum and its associated reports,
    discussions, and knowledge products formed the foundation for the
    SecureNutrition nutrition-sensitive social protection seminar series,
    open to all and accessible globally through web streaming.
         Global Forum attendees were invited to subscribe to the
    SecureNutrition monthly newsletter and discussion group to keep up
    with knowledge products and events. Attendees and other partners were
    invited to share experiences and resources through SecureNutrition’s dis-
    semination channels (http://www.securenutrition.org/community).
5.	 Facilitate South-South and Triangular Cooperation and exchange of
    experience and lessons learned among countries, allowing them to

2	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
    identify their own pathways in developing nutrition-sensitive social
    protection programs specific to their national needs.
    The participatory format of the Global Forum—based almost entirely on
    working groups and discussions—facilitated the sharing of diverse expe-
    riences beyond the 21 selected case studies. The BRICS session focused
    on lessons in overcoming malnutrition and increasing economic growth
    (Annex 9) in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa; this may be
    particularly instructive for other low- and middle-income countries.
         A variety of working group and discussion formats were used, recog-
    nizing that all attendees had experiences to share and could equally learn
    and teach. The open format and short rotations enabled participants to
    choose for themselves the examples and topics most relevant to their own
    country context or interests. Financial support from the Russian
    Federation enabled approximately 150 participants to attend from over
    20 countries, and the provision of simultaneous interpretation in six lan-
    guages for all Global Forum proceedings ensured that all attendees could
    participate in a meaningful fashion.
6.	 Enhance coordination and cooperation among development partners
    and international organizations to harness the resources of a diverse
    range of actors involved in nutrition-sensitive social protection
    programs.
    Attendees of the Global Forum included high-level government officials,
    program managers, researchers, and technical practitioners. Multilateral
    and bilateral donors, United Nations agencies, research and academic
    institutions, international and local non-governmental organizations, the
    private sector and, most importantly, country representatives from gov-
    ernment agencies in low- and middle-income countries, were all repre-
    sented. Attendees noted the value of participating in such a unique
    gathering across agencies, sectors, countries, and languages to share
    experiences and learn from each other. Feedback from an evaluation
    immediately following the event (Annex 11) and eight months after the
    Global Forum (Annex 12) suggest that attendees have made use of the
    information learned and relationships built. The Global Forum provided
    a platform for fostering dialogue and relationships than can be drawn
    upon for years to come.
7.	 Promote engagement of all-interested stakeholders, including govern-
    ments, private sector, civil society, NGOs, international and regional
    organizations, and other development partners in designing and
    implementing nutrition-sensitive social protection programs.
    The Global Forum leveraged the convening power of WBG and partner
    organizations to generate awareness around nutrition-sensitive social
    protection, and its potential for catalyzing individual and national
    growth and development. As participation at the Global Forum in
    Moscow was necessarily limited, a multifaceted social media and com-
    munications campaign was undertaken—in collaboration with part-
    ners—to engage the broader community of practitioners and other
    stakeholders (Annex 5).

Goals (MDGs), and the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
will similarly challenge the global community. Evidence shows that improved
nutrition is a driver of economic growth and that increasing income alone is
insufficient to improve nutrition outcomes. Therefore, specific action is
required if the global nutrition targets and other SDGs are to be achieved.
Experiences highlighted in the Global Forum underline how remarkable
progress against poverty and malnutrition is possible with sufficient political
will, no matter the context-specific constraints.

Political commitment
In most cases, progress has only been possible through government owner-
ship, continuous political commitment to pro-poor and nutrition objectives
in social protection programs, and the coordination of policies and programs
at national and local levels. Basic challenges to leveraging social protection
investments for nutrition include limited resources and lack of financial sus-
tainability. Low-income countries have a large number of vulnerable people,
but domestic resources are often insufficient to provide a meaningful amount
of transfer to the entire population in need. Prioritization is politically diffi-
cult, and there are trade-offs associated with targeting the nutritionally vul-
nerable that affect the overall social protection portfolio (e.g. covering the
first 1,000 days versus other groups among the poor).5 More work is needed
to enhance the evidence base on the impact of nutrition-sensitive social pro-
tection and support the design of effective strategies for the most efficient use
of public resources.
   Governments should be held accountable for commitments made regard-
ing nutrition and social protection (e.g. at the Second International Conference
on Nutrition, or ICN2). It is key to listen to—and involve more—the minis-
ters of finance and other authorizing entities. While a strong economic case
can be made for nutrition-sensitive social protection,6 some countries (e.g.
South Africa) have made great strides using a rights-based approach, codified
in legal and normative frameworks. While there is general consensus that
increased government financing is crucial, and several mechanisms for gen-
erating sufficient resources are available, strategies for making programs
financially sustainable require further exploration.

Partnership
Despite a general consensus that partnership and collaboration in tackling
poverty and malnutrition are instrumental for achieving global development
targets, the attendees agreed that stakeholders rarely have the opportunity to
come together across agencies, sectors, and countries to share experiences
from the field and understand their unique perspectives. The results of the
Global Forum evaluation indicate that the participants gained valuable
insights and awareness of opportunities for partnership. However, given the

4	              Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
            current economic climate, global partners need low-cost, high impact plat-
            forms for sharing experience and knowledge. This will further develop the
            competency required to effectively advocate for, design, and implement nutri-
            tion-sensitive social protection programs.

            Global challenges
            The challenges inherent to simultaneously tackling poverty and malnutrition
            in a rapidly evolving program landscape are immense. Rates of stunting
            remain stubbornly high, while rates of overweight/obesity, which accompany
            economic growth, are rising. The result, in many countries, is a double bur-
            den of malnutrition (DBM). Climate change, conflict, and other crises are
            exacerbating the underlying drivers of undernutrition, while at the same time
            the global extent of food waste is staggering. Achieving accelerated progress
            in reducing poverty and malnutrition between now and 2030 will be harder
            than it has been to date. It will require reaching extremely vulnerable popula-
            tions living in remote or hard-to-reach locations, many of whom are indige-
            nous, illiterate and/or otherwise unaccounted for in national registries. To
            achieve scale and reach the last mile will involve, at minimum, overcoming
            severe infrastructure and capacity constraints, and ensuring the availability,
            standardization, and quality of nutrition services. Country governments need
            strategies for designing nutrition-sensitive social protection interventions
            that can be scaled up (or down) in response to crises and other changing
            conditions.

            Program design and delivery
           Where poverty is a leading driver of malnutrition, nutrition-sensitive social
           protection programs are warranted. Synergies do not come automatically,
           however. Social protection program design and delivery needs to be trans-
           formed to improve nutrition and other child development outcomes. Each
           country’s development and nutrition situation is unique, and among Global
           Forum participants there was general agreement that there is no one-size-fits-
           all nutrition-sensitive social protection solution. The design of nutrition-sen-
           sitive social protection interventions—including determining which social
           protection instrument is best suited to improving nutrition outcomes—must
           come from the countries themselves, with careful consideration and under-
           standing of the local context, capacities, and constraints. Designing smart and
           context-specific nutrition-sensitive social protection programs requires
           imbedding technical support from both social protection and nutrition
           specialists.
                                       The Global Forum highlighted two distinct path-
                                     ways by which nutrition-sensitive social protection

                                     through many case studies and experiences shared at

            Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	        5
the Global Forum, sometimes even small enhancements to existing programs
can go a long way to improving impacts on nutrition outcomes. Other pro-
grams were designed from the start to be nutrition-sensitive. The experiences,
challenges, and evolution of these two sets of programs are different.

Multisectoral collaboration
Poverty and malnutrition are multidimensional and require a multisectoral
approach, with all actors working in coordination to support national strate-
gies, policies, and programs. There is much to be gained synergistically by
integrating social protection and nutrition interventions. Adopting a sys-
tems approach—aligning with other complementary sector policies and pro-
grams—and linking delivery to nutrition-specific and other relevant programs
can enhance impact. For example, social protection instruments can be lever-
aged to drive inter-sectoral coordination and increased demand for nutrition
services. This can be achieved through hard conditionalities (when services
are available), soft conditionalities, and/or creating effective linkages between
social protection and nutrition interventions (e.g. geographic overlap of ser-
vices, nutrition messaging, use of pay points to provide nutrition education,
etc.). This approach pushes governments to provide better quality services.
   Despite general consensus that nutrition is not the purview of any one sec-
tor, and that cross-sectoral collaboration is therefore crucial, integrating all of
the numerous relevant sectors (e.g. reproductive health and family planning,
WASH, child development, education, agriculture, etc.) is challenging. Often
there are no mechanisms to facilitate it, especially in the context of decentral-
ized governance. To be effective, multisectoral collaboration requires policy
coherence, clear institutional arrangements, and interoperable information
systems (i.e. databases that can “talk” to one another and follow shared pro-
tocols) to facilitate communication and engage key actors. Efforts to improve
the nutrition sensitivity of social protection programs also need to be comple-
mented by wider policy reforms to address the root causes of poverty, improve
the quality and scale of healthcare, education and other basic services, and
promote social equity and inclusion.

Solutions
Despite widely varying conditions, many challenges
are shared across countries and, as the Global Forum             Global Forum participants

            dissemination of nutrition messages and communication on changes in social
            behavior. To scale up in times of crisis, programs must address not only the
            pressing needs of the family, but also the very specific nutritional needs of the
            young child. The Global Forum proceedings also frequently cited the impor-
            tance of community engagement and participation.
              Finally, the substantial money, resources, and time invested in school feed-
            ing programs is being better leveraged to provide a complete package, trans-
            forming from simply a schooling incentive to comprehensive programs for
            nutrition enhancement. School feeding programs can be used as a vehicle for
            micronutrient supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education. This
            can include addressing overweight/obesity by introducing better diets (e.g.
                                     more fruits and vegetables) and providing childcare

                  1,000 days);
             •	   disbursing transfers to women to increase the likelihood that they will be
                  spent in a nutrition-sensitive way;
             •	   providing adequate and regular payment of benefits;
             •	   promoting the use of nutrition, health, and other human capital building
                  services using conditionalities—either hard or soft—in how transfers are

                  beneficiaries;
             •	   linking programs with nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems;
             •	   ensuring the adequate supply of quality nutrition services;
             •	   incorporating nutrition education and behavior change communication
                  (BCC) to provide mothers and other caregivers with appropriate and
                  timely information to help them make nutrition-relevant choices; and,
             •	   measuring nutrition results and monitoring nutrition impact to inform
                  program design and improve quality.

             Knowledge gaps
             However, operational knowledge gaps are numerous. Those noted in the
             Global Forum include: the scale-up of social safety nets that respond to the
             negative effects of crises on the nutritionally vulnerable; bridging emergency
             response and social protection; strengthening resilience; and designing for
             climate change. While we know that the first 1,000 days is the most

cost-effective window of opportunity to intervene for nutrition, effective
strategies for reaching adolescent girls and women before pregnancy are gen-
erally lacking. In addition, current understanding of the design and imple-
mentation ingredients that make nutrition impacts possible is weak, and
measuring the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions is challenging.
More work is needed to understand how to ensure that investments in cash
transfers and other social protection instruments contribute to nutrition out-
comes. Further work is also required to understand the amount of investment
required to achieve nutrition behavior change, and to quantify their relative
cost-effectiveness.
   Global Forum proceedings highlighted the unique potential for social pro-
tection to play a catalytic role in motivating effective multisectoral collabora-
tion mechanisms. It can also link social and human development policies and
WASH with economic development, investments in agriculture and food sys-
tems, and women’s empowerment. However, there are gaps in realizing effec-
tive multisectoral collaboration. These include identifying new and innovative
ways for operationalizing linkages between social protection and nutrition,
for example taking advantage of strong case management systems of social
workforces in many countries. Strategies for sustaining gains achieved by
those who have escaped poverty are also needed to prevent them from falling
back into poverty, and to improve their resilience. Finally, although gender
and women’s empowerment are identified as key themes across case studies,
operational mechanisms to address them through social protection for the
betterment of nutrition outcomes seem limited.

Conclusion
The Global Forum has strengthened the capacity among technical practi-
tioners to advocate for, and increase the effectiveness of, nutrition-sensitive
social protection programs in their respective countries. It achieved this
through sharing, and providing dialogue on, evidence and operational expe-
riences from around the world. The unique opportunity and substantive for-
mat provided by the forum held the attention of participants over two full
days of activities, culminating in a foundation to continue building experi-
ence and expertise in nutrition-sensitive social protection programs
worldwide.

Introduction
The Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs,
co-hosted by SecureNutrition and the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance,
was held in Moscow, Russia on the 10th and 11th of September, 2015. The
event drew approximately 150 participants from over 20 countries, and pro-
vided a space for in-depth conversations, anchored in country case studies,
on integrating social protection instruments and nutrition principles.



Goals and Objectives
The role of effective nutrition-sensitive social protection programs has been
increasing, and the current global development agenda calls for the profile of
nutrition to be raised by ensuring strong leadership and commitment at all
levels and across multiple sectors. Partnerships are playing an increasingly
important role in developing assistance architecture. The Global Forum on
Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs (Global Forum) aimed to
support these efforts by contributing to the evidence base for policy options
and operational actions.
  Specifically, the Global Forum aimed to achieve the following seven
objectives:


Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	       9
1.	 Better understand the existing needs of countries to assist them in setting
    up well-functioning nutrition-sensitive social protection programs.
2.	 Support countries in catalyzing, building commitment for, designing,
    establishing, managing, and scaling up nutrition-sensitive social protec-
    tion programs through providing technical assistance and capacity devel-
    opment to governments.
3.	 Disseminate best policies and practices and innovative approaches in the
    area of social protection systems linking food security and nutrition, pov-
    erty reduction, agricultural production.
4.	 Improve access to knowledge and build awareness related to nutrition-sen-
    sitive social protection through presentation of existing international ini-
    tiatives, knowledge platforms and tools, including the SecureNutrition
    Knowledge Platform.
5.	 Facilitate South-South and Triangular cooperation and exchange of expe-
    rience and lessons learned among countries, allowing them to identify
    their own pathways in developing nutrition-sensitive social protection
    programs specific to their national needs.
6.	 Enhance coordination and cooperation among development partners and
    international organizations in to harness the resources of a diverse range
    of actors involved in nutrition-sensitive social protection programs.
7.	 Promote engagement of all-interested stakeholders including govern-
    ments, private sector, civil society, NGOs, international and regional
    organizations, and other development partners in designing and imple-
    menting nutrition-sensitive social protection programs.

  The achievements against these objectives are catalogued in Annex 1.
  The Global Forum built on the ICN2 side-event, “Transition from Safety
Net Programs to Comprehensive Social Protection Systems: Food Security
and Nutrition Perspective,” which was also co-hosted by SecureNutrition and
the Russian Federation in November 2014.7



Why Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection?
Among other objectives, the Global Forum aimed to clarify the basic concepts
related to the design and delivery of nutrition-sensitive social protection pro-
grams, including the relationship between nutrition-specific and nutrition-sen-
sitive interventions. Nutrition-specific interventions focus on the immediate
causes of malnutrition (inadequate dietary intake and disease); Nutrition-
sensitive interventions focus on its underlying and basic causes (e.g. food secu-
rity, care practices, the disease environment, and access to health services).
   There is a globally recognized package of cost-effective nutrition-specific
interventions spanning the first 1,000 days, from conception through a child’s
first 24 months. These interventions are by-and-large delivered through the
health sector, but can also be delivered through social protection programs.
They include the promotion of an adequate and diverse diet, supplementation
and fortification with essential micronutrients, and the management of

10	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
moderate and severe acute malnutrition. However, this core package—even if
scaled up to 90 percent coverage in countries with a high burden of undernu-
trition—would result in a decrease of only 20 percent in global stunting. This
is insufficient to achieve the global nutrition targets of the SDGs.8
   More can be done to improve the coverage of nutrition-specific interven-
tions. To this end, the underlying factors driving nutrition outcomes must
be addressed simultaneously. These underlying determinants of nutrition
status are multisectoral—with links to agriculture, social protection, health,
water, sanitation and hygiene, and education—so the interventions to
address them must be multisectoral too. Social protection is inherently
nutrition-sensitive in the extent that it targets families at risk of malnutri-
tion. As of the end of 2015, 1.9 billion people were enrolled in social safety
net programs in 136 countries, and the share of government expenditures
devoted to social protection in low- and middle-income countries relative to
other sectors is currently growing.9 The preponderance and scale of social
protection budgets, and the potential for social protection programs to tar-
get the most vulnerable (the poor and infants within the 1,000-day nutrition
window of opportunity),10 together increase the potential for improving
nutrition outcomes.
   There are obvious synergies from combining better access to health and
nutrition services with other benefits of social protection coverage: higher
incomes, better access to education, greater awareness, and enhanced agency
and participation, especially among women. The pathways by which social
protection programs can address the underlying determinants of malnutri-
tion are fairly well understood.11 Families choose whether and how to invest
in health and nutrition, based on their knowledge and preferences, their
income, and the price of inputs into health. Health and nutrition outcomes
also depend on the available resources (such as nutritious foods and health
services), the level of investments (the amount spent purchasing nutritious
foods, health services, and clean water) chosen by the household, and the
skills of the household in using the chosen resources. Social protection as a
platform provides the opportunity to manipulate these inputs to promote
improved nutrition outcomes.
   A number of nutrition-sensitive social protection instruments are available
worldwide. For example, the early success of conditional cash transfer pro-
grams12 turned attention to other social protection instruments, including
public works, in-kind transfers, and unconditional cash transfers. These can
be leveraged to achieve greater results for nutrition, for example by targeting
nutritionally vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant and lactating women), or by
combining with nutrition education and behavior change or other accompa-
nying measures. Other strategies for incorporating nutrition principles are
also being deployed that are specific to each social protection instrument and
country context.
   There has been a proliferation of nutrition-sensitive social protection pro-
grams in recent years, many of which are rigorously monitored and evaluated.
While there have been no pure successes, there have been a lot of experiences
and lessons from which all stakeholders can learn.

About the Final Report
SecureNutrition developed this Final Report with funding from the Russian
Federation. The Final Report is intended to augment the World Bank’s guid-
ance on improving nutrition through multisectoral approaches. It will inform
ongoing and future efforts by all development partners to improve nutrition
outcomes through investments in the social protection sector.
   The report aims to summarize the proceedings of the Global Forum on
Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs, with the intention of helping
technical practitioners at WBG and elsewhere involved in the design and
implementation of nutrition-sensitive social protection projects. It aims to
provide access to information about the types of interventions being carried
out, what works, the achievements that can be realized, and the challenges
involved. As a summary of the proceedings of the Global Forum, the Final
Report is not necessarily representative of all partners, nor is it intended to be
a comprehensive review of all issues or evidence on the topic.
   The Final Report will be disseminated and made available on the SecureNutrition
website (www.securenutrition.org) as one of a suite of knowledge products,
which include the Summary of Evidence and Compendium of Case Studies.

protection for achieving nutrition objectives, as evidenced by the increase in the
number of countries implementing nutrition-sensitive social protection pro-
grams. The Global Forum aimed to build upon this sizeable work and catalyze
substantive dialogue—through peer learning and exchange of experiences—on
“the how” of implementing nutrition-sensitive social protection programs in
diverse country contexts, among people working on the front line.
   To bridge the gap between the two sectors (nutrition and social protection)
and identify how, by working together, the strengths of each could be maxi-
mized, it was key to bring together participants across the spectrum—both
those with deeper knowledge on the nutrition side and those with deeper
knowledge on the social protection side. It was also important that partici-
pants had at least some experience in delivering nutrition-sensitive social
protection programs at the country level. Attendees included high-level gov-
ernment officials, program managers, researchers, and technical practitioners.
They represented multilateral and bilateral donors, United Nations agencies,
research and academic institutions, international and local non-governmen-
tal organizations, the private sector and, most importantly, country represen-
tatives from government agencies in low- and middle-income countries.
   Country representatives were supported to participate in the Global Forum
proceedings in a meaningful way, including complete financial and logistical
assistance and simultaneous interpretation provided for all sessions. Based on
the make-up of the participants, the supported languages were Arabic,
English, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Participants from low-
and low-middle income countries were prioritized for financial support.

The organizations represented included: ACF, CARE, Al-Ikhaa, DFATD,
DfID, ENN, FAO, GIZ, Global Child Nutrition Foundation, IFAD, IFPRI,
ILO, SIFI, SCI, SUN, University of California Los Angeles, WBG, WFP, WFP
COE, WHO, and WVI.

The Countries represented included: Armenia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Costa
Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, France, Haiti, India, Indonesia,
Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Mali, Mexico, Mozambique, Niger, Peru,
Philippines, Russian Federation, South Africa, Sweden, Syria, Tanzania, The
Gambia, and Zambia.

Learning Methodology
The Global Forum program was developed collaboratively between
SecureNutrition, the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, WBG’s SPL and
HNP Global Practices, and other international partners including FAO, WFP,
and IFAD. It was designed with the aim of conveying—through engage-
ment-oriented learning methodologies14—the synergistic potential of nutri-

   The Global Forum aimed to balance the need to provide sufficient time for
both deep learning and networking to occur, to retain engagement over the two
days. A variety of working group and discussion formats were used, in recogni-
tion of the fact that all attendees had experiences to share and could equally
learn from each other. Only one session utilized conventional lectern-style pre-
sentations. Interspersed through the program were four “program snapshots,”
which were brief (ten minute) presentations that highlighted the key cross-cut-
ting themes identified in advance from the Compendium of case studies.15
   Over a third (35 percent) of the attendees had an active role in carrying out
Global Forum proceedings, as either presenters, panelists, or expert facilita-
tors; the essence of the Global Forum was the substantive contributions of the
attendees themselves.
   A detailed program of the Global Forum is available in Annex 4.



Case Studies & Selection
The proceedings of the Global Forum were deeply anchored in the sharing of
country experiences in nutrition-sensitive social protection. Countries and
international organizations were solicited to contribute case studies to the
Compendium using a standard template. The case study template was designed
to highlight the key aspects of selected individual social protection programs,
identifying their different approaches to improving nutrition and, where possi-
ble, their effects and challenges. Although the compendium case studies could
not describe in detail all aspects of each program, they aim to present sufficient
information and, in an organized fashion, to describe what is possible and how
to achieve it. Each case study was comprised of the following sections:

•	    Program Overview. The main characteristics of the program, including the
      country, budget, duration, target groups, number of beneficiaries targeted
      and reached, funding and implementing agencies, and cross-cutting themes.
•	    Context Overview. The specific context the program has been designed
      to address, both the overall country setting and the nutrition situation.
      This includes the respective country context, social protection data, and
      nutrition/health data.
•	    Program Details. The program’s components, costs, transfer level,
      denomination, frequency, and duration. In the case of public works, it
      also includes the main tasks and working time. In the case of food trans-
      fers, it details whether food procurement relies on local producers. This
      section also covers institutional and implementation arrangements, issues
      of scalability and sustainability, and community participation.
•	    Monitoring and Evaluation. A description of how M&E is carried out,
      the specific indicators used, a summary of key findings from available
      evaluation, and harmonization with other programs.
•	    Nutrition-Sensitive Rationale. A description of the pathways leveraged
      to make the program nutrition-sensitive (either explicitly designed to
      improve nutrition outcomes or not), including: the promotion of income

                      Out of the 79 eligible case studies reviewed (35 from WBG and 44 submit-
                    ted from other international organizations and governments), 21 were
                    selected for inclusion in the Compendium. For WBG case studies, the Global
                    Forum core team first identified pipeline, active, and recently closed social
                    protection projects that included a nutrition component. Practice Managers
                    then made a determination regarding which projects would be prioritized for
                    inclusion in the Compendium from a regional perspective. For non-WBG
                    case studies, each lead international organization or government used its own
                    processes to decide which project to submit for consideration. The Global

Forum core team screened these submissions for concurrence with nutri-
tion-sensitive social protection principles, as described by WBG in the 2013
Improving Nutrition through Multi-Sectoral Approaches Guidance Notes.
   The Final selections (Table 1) were made with the intention of providing a com-
prehensive representation of social protection instruments and mechanisms for
globally incorporating nutrition principles. In addition, the final Compendium
encompasses case studies for projects that were designed from the start to be
nutrition-sensitive as well as those that evolved to be nutrition-sensitive over time.



Communications and Knowledge Management
As participation at the Global Forum in Moscow was necessarily limited, a
multifaceted social media and communications campaign was under-
taken—in collaboration with partners—to engage the broader community of
practitioners and other stakeholders (Annex 5). SecureNutrition created and
disseminated a communications kit, including Global Forum branding, key
online resources, suggested Twitter messages, etc. through WBG (e.g. corpo-
rate WBG/, and regional WBG/Moscow and WBG/ECA) and non-Bank (e.g.
FAO, IDS, IFAD, IFPRI, Thousand Days, WFP) channels.
  SecureNutrition also collaborated with the FAO Global Forum on Food
and Nutrition Security to co-host a multilingual online discussion that
explored key questions related to the Global Forum.16 The discussion was held
from August 28 to September 13, concurrent with the Global Forum in
Moscow, and was moderated by Lucy Basset (Social Protection Specialist,
WBG) and Ahmed Raza (Nutrition Specialist, FAO).
  The Global Forum culminated in a three-part Leveraging Social Protection
Programs for Improved Nutrition series of reports: Summary of Evidence
Prepared for the Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection
Programs (Summary of Evidence); Compendium of Case Studies Prepared for
the Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs (the
Compendium); and Report on the Proceedings of the Global Forum on
Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs (the Final Report). The
Summary of Evidence addresses “the why” for nutrition-sensitive social pro-
tection programs, and the Compendium addresses “the how.” All materials
from the Global Forum (e.g. resource library, keynote addresses and program
snapshot presentations) were provided to attendees on a USB thumb drive,
were made available on the SecureNutrition website (www.securenutrition.
org), and have been shared through newsletters, seminars, and other fora.
  The Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition series
will be the foundation for the SecureNutrition nutrition-sensitive social pro-
tection seminar series. This will be open to all, and will be accessible globally
through web streaming. Global Forum attendees were invited to subscribe to
the SecureNutrition monthly newsletter and discussion group to keep up
with future knowledge products and events. Attendees and other partners
were also invited to share experiences and resources through SecureNutrition’s
dissemination channels.

Session Summaries
Vocabulary
Both days of the Global Forum began with an interactive session on vocab-
ulary, to both set the tone for engagement and assess where participants
were in their understanding of key nutrition-sensitive social protection ter-
minology. Words and definition choices were projected on the screen, one
slide (word) at a time. Each participant was provided a remote device (a
“clicker”) to anonymously vote for the best definition among the options
provided. Participants were given 30 seconds to vote. The correct answer
was projected along with the distribution of responses, the answers were
explained, and additional discussion ensued, as needed. The vocabulary for
Day One (Session One) was a list of 16 words collated by the organizers.
Translations of the vocabulary and definition options for the five supported
languages were provided. The vocabulary for Day Two (Session Eight) was
derived from feedback from participants on the terminology encountered
on Day One.
   The results (Annex 7) suggested that the attendees’ familiarity with social
protection terminology was far stronger than their familiarity with nutrition
terminology.

Opening & Welcoming Remarks
Opening remarks were delivered by Anna Popova, the Head of the Federal
Service for Surveillance on Consumer Protection and Human Well-being,
and Chief State Sanitary Physician, Russian Federation (Rospotrebnadzor),
and by Maria Margarita Cedeño Lizardo, the Vice President of the Dominican
Republic. They welcomed the participants, underlined the potential for the
Global Forum to foster collaboration related to nutrition-sensitive social pro-
tection, and highlight the related work underway in their respective coun-
tries. Prior to these addresses, the facilitator (Stephen Atwood) reviewed the
objectives of the Global Forum (Annex 1). The official opening remarks were
followed by welcoming remarks by representatives of each of the participating
IOs, including: Rob Vos (FAO), Josefina Stubbs (IFAD), Carlo Scaramella
(WFP), and Ruslan Yemtsov (WBG).

Anna Y. Popova: The Russian Federation supports food and nutrition secu-
rity globally through donations to FAO, WFP, WBG, ILO and other interna-
tional organizations. The purpose of the Global Forum is to foster cooperation
and support of a safe and secure food system, ensure food and nutrition secu-
rity, and identify ways of enhancing social protection to respond to social
crises. The Global Forum provides an opportunity to share experiences across
a breadth of countries, in the implementation of nutrition-sensitive social
protection programs.

Maria Margarita Cedeño Lizardo: The Global Forum
is a unique opportunity to share experiences, with the              “Taking good care of

food and nutrition security. Collaboration is crucial in
addressing the “vicious triangle” of poverty, malnutri-
tion and hunger. Providing proper food and nutrition
is “a complex task in a world governed by uncertainty.” Despite progress made
with the MDGs, the 795 million who remain malnourished are an “ethical prob-
lem that should make us all ashamed,” especially in light of the “billions of tons
of food every year” that is wasted. Progress against malnutrition is possible with
political will, technologies and innovations, international cooperation, and
interest from governments in providing technical assistance to emerging coun-
tries. “Taking good care of children means taking good care of all of us.”

strengthen the collaboration and commitments made
by all member states during ICN2 to incorporate

              BRICS countries—having successfully reduced hunger and poverty—can and
              should play a lead role. Given that three-quarters of the poor and hungry live in
              rural areas and depend on agriculture, there is a crucial nexus between nutri-
              tion, social protection, and agriculture. “We need to learn from experience.”

              Josefina Stubbs (Associate Vice-President and Chief Development Strategist in
              the Strategy and Knowledge Department, IFAD): Smallholder farmers produce
              80 percent of the food that is consumed worldwide, and have an important
              role in conserving world biodiversity and providing fresh, nutritious varieties
              of food to local and national markets. When farmers lose their ability to pro-
              duce food, the entire nation suffers. Social protection programs are an import-
              ant vehicle for bringing about inclusive rural transformation. The goal is to
              create vibrant rural communities, where young people are looking forward to
              living their lives.

                                       Carlo Scaramella (Deputy Regional Director of the
“Strengthening partnerships is         Regional Bureau for North Africa, Middle East,

             pathways, while also realizing the right to social security for all. Making social
             protection more efficient and sustainable is an urgent necessity across all
             countries and regions, particularly in those low- and low middle-income
             countries, which are also most prone to socio-economic shocks. Scaling up
             social protection is critically important when dealing with protracted crises,
             whereby governance failures contribute to replicating intergenerational cycles
             of malnutrition and poverty. “This complex reality is the new normal reflect-
             ing the increasing demands and challenges,” and is characterized by multiple
             intersecting drivers of food and nutrition insecurity. This reality demands
             that we work together to look beyond traditional systems with a view to estab-
             lishing more efficient, scalable, adaptable and reliable social protection and
             safety net services. “Strengthening partnerships is indispensable.”

             malnutrition through the health sector—have now both demonstrated their
             limitations. “Neither of them in isolation can end poverty and malnutrition—

             to learn new lessons from integrated approaches. The WBG’s $1 billion annual

on social protection.” We need to “leverage those limited funds, and look at
them as catalytic investments.”


Statement of the Problem & Keynote Address
This was the only session of the Global Forum that involved conventional
lectern-style presentations. It was comprised of two parts: the first was a state-
ment of the problem by Meera Shekar, Global Lead for Nutrition and Lead
HNP Specialist with WBG’s Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice.
She described the economic case for nutrition and the linkages between pov-
erty, equity and malnutrition. This was followed by the keynote note address
from Harold Alderman, Senior Research Fellow on Poverty, Health, and
Nutrition at IFPRI. He presented the rationale for linking nutrition and social
protection programs, describing the synergy between the two sectors and the
necessity of integration in order for the goals of each to be achieved. The pre-
sentations were followed by a joint moderated discussion.

Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection: Why and What?
Meera Shekar
Epidemiology of nutrition. Nearly 85 percent of global stunting is concen-
trated in 37 countries. Since 1990, both the prevalence of under-five stunting
and the number of children stunted has decreased, however progress across
regions has been variable. The prevalence of stunting remains severe in South
Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. There is simultaneously a global trend of
increasing rates of overweight/obesity, also with marked regional variation.

Linkages between nutrition and social protection. Income poverty drives
many of the factors that contribute to malnutrition (e.g. low food intake, fre-
quent infection, reliance on physical labor, frequent pregnancies). In turn,
malnutrition causes direct losses in productivity from poor physical status,
indirect losses from poor cognitive development and schooling, and losses
due to health costs. The trickle-down effect of increased income on nutrition
is slow, and the relationship between stunting and GNP is highly variable
across countries. Some countries have shown impressive economic growth,
yet continue to have high rates of stunting. Improving income growth alone is
insufficient to achieve SDG nutrition targets. “The vicious cycle of malnutri-
tion and poverty continues unless we do something to break it.”

Consequences of malnutrition. Nutrition can con-
tribute to economic growth, reduced poverty, and,              “By addressing malnutrition,
through targeting the bottom 40 percent, enhanced
                                                               social safety net programs are
equity. Because stunting disproportionately affects
the poor, “by addressing malnutrition, social safety                addressing the poor.”
net programs are addressing the poor.” Improved
nutrition can increase schooling completion by

20	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
              approximately a year, and earnings from 5 to 50 percent. Children who escape
              stunting are 33 percent more likely to escape poverty as adults. In Asia and
              Africa—the regions with the highest burden of malnutrition—improved
              nutrition can increase GDP by 4 to11 percent.

                                       versible. Intervention after the age of two is too late
             and too expensive. “It’s human capital that drives nations.”

              Multisectoral determinants of malnutrition. Nutrition-specific interventions
              focus on the immediate causes of malnutrition; Nutrition-sensitive interven-
              tions focus on its underlying and basic causes. Historically, nutrition-specific
              interventions have been delivered through the health sector. Nutrition-sensitive
              social protection offers a chance to expand those delivery platforms. To achieve
              the SDG target for stunting—a reduction from 162 million to 100 million by
              2030—nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions are needed.

              Cost benefit. New research shows that a package of proven nutrition-specific
              interventions costs approximately $8.50 per child annually. Every dollar
              invested in stunting reduction leads to about $18 in economic returns. Getting
              the right start from the beginning is a win-win. Together, social protection and
              nutrition can take advantage of the early malleability that exists in the brain
              and body to build the foundation for future productivity and economic growth.

              Harold Alderman
            Multisectoral collaboration. A package of ten proven nutrition-specific
            interventions, scaled up to 90 percent of the target population, would reduce
                                    stunting by 20 percent. This is “well and good, but
                                    not good enough.” To go beyond 20 percent, we need

              Pathways from social protection to nutrition. Social protection programs
              can affect nutrition by increasing the resources that households control,
              changing their preferences, reducing the price of food, increasing incentives
              to invest in health, and providing micronutrients. Behavioral change commu-
              nication is an important element.

How transfers are used. Research shows that if you give a poor household more
resources, the largest share will be spent on food. “Food security and nutrition
security are not identical.” However, not only does food consumption increase,
but also dietary diversity—“they don’t just buy calories, they diversify their diet.”
Referred to as “nutrition labeling,” poor households often spend more out of a
transfer program—even when there is no requirement to do so—on food than
they do out of general income. There is no evidence that transfer programs lead
to indolence, nor that transfers are spent on tobacco and alcohol.

unconditional transfers, many programs do not                      “Giving households more

becoming obsolete (except in some emergency con-
texts where markets do not function), because we
know how to give cash assistance, and the technology to support it is now
there. It is generally 15–20 percent cheaper on average to deliver cash than
food. The impact of a transfer on consumption depends on the environment,
particularly the functioning of the markets. Markets tend to function well
outside of emergency situations. One advantage of in-kind assistance is the
ability to substitute a fortified food for what (non-fortified alternative) might
have otherwise been purchased.

School feeding. School feeding is a type of in-kind conditional transfer in
that children only receive it if they attend school. Roughly 375 million chil-
dren receive school meals or take-home rations every year, at a cost of $75
billion dollars. This is far greater than the cost of achieving the SDG stunting
target. “It’s a lot of money and a lot of people.” School feeding is not primarily
a nutrition program because the age group of the recipients are not the most
vulnerable (i.e. compared to women and children within the first 1,000 days,
the “window of opportunity”). School feeding is a social protection program,
and it is also an education program. School feeding
programs can be used to address the problem of obe-
sity through the introduction of better diets and                “Poor countries have large

nets that cover every group; however, many countries do not have the
resources to provide a meaningful amount of transfer to the entire poor pop-
ulation. “Poor countries have large numbers of poor, as well as small budgets.
They have to prioritize and that is politically very difficult.”

Integration. Nutrition-sensitive social protection must be cross-sectorial—not
only to increase demand for health services, but also to increase the quality of
those health services.

Hypotheses to make social protection more nutrition-sensitive:
1.	 Prioritize nutritionally vulnerable populations.
2.	 Include behavior change communication.
3.	 Enhance the quality of nutrition services available to social protection
    beneficiaries.
4.	 Leverage the money, resources, and time put into school feeding to ensure
    it’s a complete nutrition package (i.e. a vehicle for micronutrient supple-
    mentation, deworming, nutrition education, etc.).
5.	 Design programs that can scale up in times of crisis and have programs
    that can scale up to address not only the pressing needs of the whole fam-
    ily, but also the very specific needs of the young child.

Moderated Discussion
Below is a summary of the discussion; Comments are not necessarily
comprehensive or representative of all partners.
Scale-up of social safety nets in emergencies. The reliance on humanitarian
assistance financing from international agencies, which comprises a major com-
ponent of scaling up, poses a challenge due to the amount of time between when
a country requests assistance and when that assistance is received. Some social
protection instruments (public works programs were specifically cited here, but
others may also apply) are relatively easy to scale up, at least if the program
already exists. To start one from scratch in the midst of a crisis is difficult, and to
make it nutrition-sensitive is harder still. Different types of crises have different
time dimensions. Some countries (e.g. Ethiopia) have included contingency
funding. The 2008 food and fuel crisis highlighted that these are important
issues that require advance planning, both from a humanitarian perspective and
from a development perspective—“those need to work side-by-side.”

Conditionalities. Simple conditionalities (either hard or soft) or design
elements, which affect how a cash transfer will be delivered or used, are
another potential way to make social protection programs more nutri-
tion-sensitive. It is important to consider the operational costs of enforcing
conditions, as well as the availability of supply and quality of services.
Currently, evidence on the costs and impacts of unconditional and condi-
tional transfers is mixed.

Overweight /obesity. There is a need for education to combat the growing
rates of overweight/obesity that result from increased resources at the house-

Solutions to Date: Nutrition Programs and Social
Protection Programs
Two facing panels were used to present what is being done by the global com-
munity in the nutrition and social protection sectors to tackle malnutrition
from the perspective of different International Organizations (IO). The ses-
sion aimed to illustrate the division between the sectors by placing four nutri-
tion panelists and four social protection panelists on either side of the
moderator. This division was then brought towards integration—visually and
conceptually—throughout the following sessions.
   The nutrition panelists were Bibi Giyose (FAO), Iain MacGillivray (IFAD),
Menno Mulder-Sibanda (WBG), and Joao Breda (WHO). The social protec-
tion panelists were Natalia Winder Rossi (FAO), Josefina Stubbs (IFAD),
Christina Behrendt (ILO), and Daniel Balaban (WFP COE). Each panelist
responded to pre-selected questions and presented their approach to address-
ing the problem articulated in Session Three. The panel presentation was fol-
lowed by a moderated discussion.

Bibi Giyose (Senior Nutrition Officer for Policy and Programs in the Nutrition
Division, Economic and Social Department, FAO): Ensuring that nutrition is not
the purview of only any one sector requires pooling resources, putting minds
together, putting governance at the center, political will, and investment.
Partnerships—for communication, collaboration, coordination, harmonization
and joint planning—are important, and have not happened easily. There are
numerous global nutrition initiatives that are focused on nutrition-sensitive
approaches, including the Zero Hunger Challenge; the SUN Movement; the
Committee on Food Security; the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems
for Nutrition; and ICN2. With a dedicated SDG for agriculture and nutrition,
we are poised to ensure that the world delivers better nutrition through a multi-
plicity of approaches, through multiple partners, through heightened invest-
ments, and through dedicated tracking and monitoring of progress.

              Iain MacGillivray (Special Advisor to the President, IFAD): There is a lot of
              knowledge, best practice, and experience on furthering the impacts of income,
              food availability and prices, on nutrition to build from (e.g. women’s empow-
              erment, diversifying production and consumption, targeting the most vul-
              nerable, leveraging food supply chains, scale up of bio-fortified crops, etc.). A
              key challenge for IFAD is scaling up nutrition and nutrition-sensitive inter-
              ventions in agriculture and rural development, without detracting from the
              agriculture sector’s conventional goals. Organizationally, IFAD is working to
              mainstream nutrition by integrating it into all project assessments, analysis,
              design, quality control, monitoring and evaluation, in-house staff training,
              and capacity building for multisectoral project design.

              strength. Complex issues around incentives, rules, and power relations link
              the nutritionally vulnerable population to service providers and different lay-
              ers of government. The SUN Movement has raised awareness at three levels of
              action: the enabling policy environment; scaling up nutrition-specific inter-
              ventions; and maximizing nutrition sensitivity in a range of development sec-

Natalia Winder Rossi (Senior Social Protection Officer in the ESP Division,
FAO): FAO and other IOs are making critical contributions in strengthening
the evidence base around social protection impacts and operational learning.
This will ensure that economic and productive investments are climate-smart
and nutrition-sensitive. FAO has evidence for the impact of unconditional
cash transfers on poverty, food security, and dietary diversity in sub-Saharan
Africa.17 This highlights the need to understand the design implementation
ingredients that make these impacts possible. Other operational challenges
requiring further evidence include understanding the role of the intra-house-
hold dynamic, effectively integrating nutrition education to translate invest-
ments into nutrition-sensitive investments, other ways of operationalizing
linkages between nutrition and social protection, integrating other sectors
such as education and child protection, and using overlapping targeting to
create a multidimensional view of vulnerability. We need to be “very creative
as we bring together the two sectors.”

Josefina Stubbs (Associate Vice-President and Chief
Development Strategist in the Strategy and Knowledge        “The poor in all countries of the

and other social protection programs. To sustain the
gains achieved, we need to help people receiving social
protection support by improving productivity. This will allow them to generate
income and graduate those programs. “We need to move from cash to assets.”
Eliminating poverty in the next thirty years is going to be harder than it has
been so far because it requires reaching people who are extremely poor, many
of whom are in faraway places without an identity card, and most of them are
indigenous. To mainstream nutrition, we have to think about how to bring peo-
ple into the food system, be it as producers, consumers, or processors.

Christina Behrendt (Senior Social Protection Policy Specialist in the Social
Protection Department, ILO): “If there is one thing we have learned, it is that
the synergies don’t come automatically.” A key challenge is how to secure those
who have escaped poverty, sustain gains, and prevent them from falling back
into poverty. ILO’s approach is a universal social protection system, which
does not just provide benefits and services to the poorest and most vulnerable,
but also protects everyone in the population—“universal social protection for
all.” An “integrated and comprehensive approach” means everyone in the soci-
ety has at least a minimum level of social security, including income security
and access to health care. The required national capacities include ensuring
that the social protection system is rooted in country policies, and financed
through national resources with a legal framework that helps to support it.

Daniel Balaban (Director, WFP Centre of Excellence Against Hunger): We
don’t have just one social protection policy solution, and “we don’t have the

                                     organizations. Sometimes we involve ministers of
                                     agriculture, ministers of health, and ministers of edu-
            cation, but we forget the person who decides the budget—we need to listen to
            and involve the ministers of finance. “They need to understand that social
            protection is an investment, not an expenditure.”

            Creating Synergies: Strengthening Social
            Protection Programs
            The first of several working group sessions used a modified world café meth-
            odology to develop competence in the design of nutrition-sensitive social
            protection programs. This addressed the problem identified in Session Three,
            and promoted awareness of the associated challenges and opportunities.
               There were ten tables divided into five nutrition principle “themes” and five
            social protection instrument “themes.” The social protection instruments were:
            school feeding, public works, cash transfers, in-kind transfers, and conditional-
            ities. The nutrition principles were: gender, 1,000 days, dietary diversity, target-
            ing the nutritionally vulnerable, and nutrition education and promotion. Each
            table had an assigned Expert Facilitator (Annex 8) who remained at the table
            for the duration of the session. Participants selected a table based on their inter-
            est and the availability of chairs (16 per table). “Whisper” interpreters were
            provided to facilitate multi-lingual groups. Given the limited availability of
            interpreters, some tables were assigned language groups.

            Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	             27
   Participants at the social protection instruments tables were instructed to
discuss what could be gained by using their respective social protection
instrument to address the problem of malnutrition, and how it could be
adapted. Participants at the nutrition principles tables were instructed to
discuss the added benefits of integrating their respective nutrition principle
into social protection instruments and what would be required to do so.
After 45 minutes, participants switched tables. All those sitting at social
protection instruments tables moved to a nutrition principle table, and
vice-versa. Participants then had 30 minutes for discussion before return-
ing home to their original table to report on their discussions and reflect on
(i) how to create synergies between the sectors and (ii) what conditions
need to be in place for nutrition-sensitive social protection solutions to
work. The session culminated with a brief summary of the key discussion
points by a representative from each table, followed by a moderated
discussion.

Below is a summary of the discussion; Comments are not necessarily
comprehensive or representative of all partners.

Public Works
•	    Targeting the first 1,000 days (i.e. households with small children and
      pregnant women) in public works programs is being carried out, but
      there are trade-offs that need to be considered.
•	    Activities. Typical PW activities—building or restoring infrastructure,
      sanitation, and education infrastructure—require hard physical labor
      that would be inappropriate for PLW. Activities involving public services,
      e.g. childcare, cleaning, or other campaigns, can be used instead. Replacing
      the infrastructure that would have been built (e.g. sanitation infrastruc-
      ture), however, also has implications for nutrition.
•	    Benefit amount. There is a need to determine an amount that is sufficient
      to drive change with a measurable nutrition impact (e.g. changing the
      diet) without creating a disincentive to work.
•	    Benefit recipient. Many programs—regardless of who actually does the
      work—give benefits to women, to increase likelihood that it is spent in a
      nutrition-sensitive way.
•	    Frequency of payments. The predictability of payments is important in
      encouraging expenditures for nutrition.
•	    Accompanying measures. Other activities can be integrated to improve
      nutrition impact, such as nutrition education, food demonstrations,
      dietary supplements, and activities to diversify livelihoods.
•	    Enabling environment. The roles and responsibilities of institutions, col-
      laboration between ministries, and community participation all need to
      be clear.
•	    Monitoring & Evaluation. It is important to include nutrition indicators
      in the results framework at the outcome and process levels to ensure that
      efforts are having the intended impact.


28	              Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
Cash Transfers
•	   Size of the transfer. The transfer amount should be linked to the nutri-
     tion needs of the targeted beneficiaries.
•	   Nutrition education and behavior change. Programs should target the
     first 1,000 days, and should sensitize beneficiaries. This would encourage
     them to improve nutrition and health seeking behavior, for themselves
     and for their children.
•	   Demand generation. Transfers should be linked to other interventions,
     especially health services and information systems.
•	   Local production. Cash transfers can be used to promote local food
     production.
•	   Transfer frequency and duration. Within the group, there was dis-
     agreement on the appropriate duration of cash transfers, and on the
     frequency of payments required to measurably affect nutrition
     outcomes.
School Feeding
•	   Synergies. School feeding is multisectoral, which poses both opportuni-
     ties and challenges. Schools can serve as a hub for education on a number
     of nutrition-sensitive social protection issues, including nutrition,
     hygiene, parenting, agriculture production, life skills, and prevention of
     adolescent pregnancies.
•	   Linkages to school-based nutrition activities. E.g. deworming, hygiene
     education, and focus on adolescent girls, including reducing anemia and
     early marriage.
•	   Linkages to agriculture. Using decentralized approaches to increase
     food diversity in school feeding through local procurement and job
     creation.
•	   Targeting. Within the working group there was disagreement on whether,
     within a given budget envelope, aiming for universal coverage or targeting
     only the most vulnerable would result in the best nutrition outcomes.
Conditionalities
•	   Behavior change. Increasing income alone cannot change nutrition
     behavior—nutrition education is also needed. Conditionalities have
     the potential to influence beneficiaries, modify nutrition-related behav-
     ior (e.g. seek appropriate services or purchase nutrient-rich foods), and
     therefore achieve nutrition objectives. However, considerations around
     costs and the capacity to implement and enforce conditionalities, as
     well as the supply and quality of services, are critical. Community lead-
     ers may be effective mechanisms for conveying nutrition information.
     Educational programs, mass media, or other government services like
     schools and health units can also be used.
•	   Integration. Conditionalities can influence both beneficiaries and pro-
     viders, with the potential to push governments into providing services.
     To meet the demand generated by beneficiaries, governments need to
     offer services, and cross-sectoral work is needed to achieve this.


Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	       29
Gender
•	    Local context. Cultural beliefs and traditional gender roles contribute to
      malnutrition, and are often very hard to change. Communication cam-
      paigns and other intervention strategies are necessary to overcome them, as
      well as an understanding of local beliefs, and how to better influence them.
•	    Community engagement. Joint initiatives at the community level are
      needed to address nutrition challenges. Local communities and authori-
      ties also need to be involved.
•	    Behavior change. To better empower women, the behavior of men and
      politicians needs to change.
•	    Identification. Policies, resources, and activities promoting the rights of
      women and supporting their access to those resources are needed. This
      includes securing the mechanisms of identification (e.g. national identity
      card or passport) required.
1,000 Days
•	    Time-appropriate intervention. There are different stages within the
      1,000 days (e.g. pre-pregnancy, pre-natal, antenatal, etc.). They are differ-
      entiated by respective interventions and counseling. Reaching women
      and adolescent girls pre-pregnancy is especially challenging.
•	    Enabling environment. Ministries of health and social welfare need to
      work together to develop policies and harmonize indicators related to the
      1,000 days concept.
•	    Localization. The local/national context and existing platforms should
      be taken into consideration when designing programs targeting the first
      1000 days.
•	    Behavior change communication. BCC is crucial, and organizations
      and social services at the community level must be engaged to dissemi-
      nate information to young women and young mothers. Organizations
      must also be able to refer them to services.
•	    Training & capacity building. Changing behavior at the household level
      requires investment in training for community workers.
Dietary Diversity
•	    Social protection instruments. A wide range of social protection inter-
      ventions have been used to improve dietary diversity, including cash
      transfers (with and without behavior change communication), programs
      targeting cooperative farmers contracted to produce a range of goods,
      livestock offtake programs, etc.
•	    Dietary assessment. A diagnostic is needed to assess the gaps in food
      commodities, market availability, the functioning of the market, cost
      issues, demographic groups and their respective dietary requirements
      (e.g. in emergencies often the elderly are left out of assessments), etc. This
      will facilitate collaboration across sectors and ministries (or in the case of
      emergencies, between clusters).
•	    Multisectoral collaboration. Getting different sectors or clusters to talk
      to each other is challenging, and there often are not mechanisms to do so,
      especially in the context of decentralized programming.

30	               Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
•	   Transfer amount. In some cases, there is a minimum transfer amount,
     which is sufficient for households to purchase higher quality foods, but
     below which will be spent on calories. This has program cost implications.
•	   Multipurpose programming. Social protection systems that target multi-
     ple demographic groups may generate competition between sectors and/
     or actors, each trying to influence the behavior of the same beneficiaries.
Targeting the Nutritionally Vulnerable
•	   Inclusivity. Social protection programs typically avoid targeting an out-
     come of interest e.g. malnourished children. They err on the side of
     greater inclusion so as not to, in this case, shift programs towards nutri-
     tion so much that they fail to reach other goals.
•	   Multisectoral collaboration. Diagnostic tools are needed to understand
     each unique country context. Targeting nutritional vulnerability requires
     other sectors to engage (e.g. health and WASH). Multisectoral coordination
     is needed at the national level and on the ground, ensuring that social work-
     ers have the capacity to deliver a social protection program that is targeted
     to the nutritionally vulnerable. They must understand what it means, how
     to talk to households about it, and how to work across sectors.
•	   Prioritization. When resources are scarce, the prioritization of program-
     ming and transitioning between different types of programming is a chal-
     lenge. During a crisis—is it just an expansion of the program or are there
     other groups that become nutritionally vulnerable, and how do we take
     that in to consideration?
Nutrition Education & Promotion
•	   Synergies. Nutrition education is a platform for fostering integrated approaches.
     This unleashes a multiplier effect and maximizes nutritional impact. Many
     types and approaches to nutrition education have evolved over time.
•	   Use of new technologies. There are both opportunities (to leverage new
     technologies for the dissemination of nutrition education messages) and
     associated challenges (e.g. no longer being able to disperse cash transfers
     at the same time that nutrition education messages are being provided).
     Integrating new technologies into already existing large-scale programs is
     also a challenge.
•	   Conditionalities. These can be used to instill a sense of responsibility
     among targeted beneficiaries, however balanced, with the understanding
     that in seeking to reach the most vulnerable, leniency (e.g. “soft” condi-
     tions) may be needed. Conditions must be clearly communicated to ben-
     eficiaries, ensuring that the conditionality is not perceived as a punishment
     per se, but as an opportunity to maximize the resources being invested.

Moderated Discussion
Below is a summary of the discussion; Comments are not necessarily
comprehensive or representative of all partners.
Conditionalities. In response to a question posed about other options available
(in addition to conditionalities) to forge the linkages between social protection

Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report	              31
and nutrition, it was noted that conditions are used when beneficiaries are not
trusted to spend the transfer in ways likely to achieve the intended impact. If it’s
reasonable to assume that giving the cash alone will result in intended impacts,
then conditions are not needed. Furthermore, it was noted that there are limita-
tions and challenges around implementing and enforcing conditionalities (e.g.
in contexts where supply is not there, or where the capacity to implement is
insufficient). However, it’s possible to leverage the conditionality to induce gov-
ernments to do a better job by arguing that the cash transfer will not change
behavior if the government in question does not also commit to improving ser-
vices. Finally, as illustrated by the 18 years of experience in Mexico, the impor-
tance of co-responsibilities for changing paths and increasing human capital
was emphasized. Monitoring conditionalities and ensuring some level of supply
also play an important role in enabling inter-sectoral coordination.

1,000 days. The importance of framing the first 1,000 days in terms of life-
long consequences was also emphasized. It is also important to monitor preg-
nant women from the point of conception to address emerging health issues,
and to continue monitoring women and children during the remainder of the
first 1,000 days.

Reaching adolescent girls. A question was posed around how to reach women
prior to conception. There was some concern about targeting adolescents with-
out encouraging adolescent pregnancy. Although several projects (e.g. Nigeria
Child Development Grant Program) are reaching women early in the 1,000 days
window of opportunity, during pregnancy, there were no examples cited that
reached women prior to conception. It was suggested that girls could be targeted
during school with messaging around the responsibility to protect themselves
and their children, and to look after their health before and after becoming
pregnant. It was emphasized that engagement with the education sector is
important, and that the education system should provide not only education but
also life skills to girls and boys. There is need for further collaboration.

Integration with family planning. It was emphasized that adolescent girls
are not prepared to be mothers, and that “kids having kids” sacrifice their life
path and fundamentally change their future. Protecting children during ado-
lescence is therefore an integral part of social protection programs. This can
be achieved by including birth control programs to prevent adolescent moth-
ers, and by spreading knowledge about the availability of contraception (per-
manent or temporary) as a matter of social/human rights and freedom of
self-determination.

Nexus between nutrition, social protection and agriculture. A multisectoral
response to address malnutrition requires not only health and care, but also a
strong focus on providing access to quality and nutritious food. An integrated
package of cash transfer, nutrition education and nutrition-sensitive agriculture
can enhance nutrition impacts. Social protection has a unique power to gener-
ate incentives for food systems to evolve in a way that is better for all consumers.

32	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
School feeding programs that procure fruits, vegetables, or other fresh produce
from local farmers generate an incentive for the producer to increase produc-
tion diversity for example. In some cases, this can improve the quality of their
produce, which benefits all consumers. Moreover, an assessment of local pro-
duction, foods and products can help to design more culturally appropriate
menus, contributing to nutrition and local economic dynamics.

Multisectoral targeting. From the point of view of agriculture intervention, it’s
difficult to target PLW. In Zambia, for example, work is often done with coop-
eratives and groups where there may be only three or four women who are
pregnant or have children below two years. Collaboration with the ministry of
health is required to target PLW and ensure that, within the targeted commu-
nities, adolescent girls of childbearing age are involved in program activities.

Women’s groups. Agriculture interventions aimed at increasing the availabil-
ity of diverse food often target women in groups. However, when the group
shares the field it’s a challenge to ensure that the benefits trickle down to the
household.

Involving men. As men often are responsible for making household deci-
sions on what crops or livestock to produce (typically geared towards produc-
tion for sale rather than home consumption), men must be included in
nutrition education activities so that they understand the special nutritional
needs of women and children. It also highlights the importance of producing
nutritious food for consumption within the household. Sensitization is also
needed to highlight the important role that men can play in early childcare.

Political economy. The difficulty of persuading policy-makers, in particular
legislators, to invest money into social protection, nutrition-sensitive or not,
was noted as a challenge that requires additional consideration.

Policy coherence and the DBM. For countries dealing with the double bur-
den of malnutrition (e.g. Mexico and Costa Rica) the coherence of the policy
environment is crucial. Disincentives for the production and consumption of
nutritionally poor foods, for example, should be combined with incentives to
increase the production and consumption of healthy foods (through social
protection and agriculture measures).


Way Forward: Implementation of ICN2 Declaration
in Terms of Social Protection and Nutrition – BRICS
Partnerships
This panel presentation, organized by FAO, was designed to foster under-
standing of the BRICS countries’ policies and programs on nutrition-sensi-
tive social protection, share lessons and good practices, promote a common
approach and South-South cooperation, share thoughts and define

approaches and modalities for delivery, follow-up on ICN2 outcomes around
social protection and nutrition, and draft and adopt a chair summary. The
panel was chaired by Rob Vos, Director for Social Protection and Coordinator
of the Strategic Programme for Rural Poverty Reduction of the FAO. It was
moderated by Bibi Giyose, Senior Nutrition Officer for Policy and Programs
in the Nutrition Division, Economic and Social Department at FAO, and was
comprised of representatives of the BRICS countries:18 Brazil (Arnoldo de
Campos, National Secretary for Food and Nutrition Security of Brazilian
Ministry for Social Development and Fight Against Hunger), Russian
Federation (Vyacheslav Smolenskiy, Director for Science and International
Relations, Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian Federation), India (Sanjay
Mahendru, First Secretary – Trade, Embassy of India in Russia), and South
Africa (Thando Dalamba, Political Counsellor, Embassy of South Africa in
Russia).
   In preparation for this session, FAO developed a paper on the unique expe-
riences of BRICS in designing and implementing nutrition-sensitive policies
and programs. This paper also highlighted their role in promoting knowledge
exchange and information sharing within the context of South-South
Cooperation.19 A brief prepared for the Global Forum is available in Annex 9.
   Each panelist was asked to comment on the following: What were the effec-
tive ways to include nutrition in social protection programs? What were the
operational challenges of implementation and political commitment? What
were the incentives for all players to come together? Following each presenta-
tion, the panelist was asked to respond to a question from the moderator. All
presentations were followed by a moderated discussion and a chair summary,
delivered by Rob Vos.

Rob Vos (Director for Social Protection and Coordinator of the Strategic
Programme for Rural Poverty Reduction, FAO) BRICS countries were instru-
mental in forging the political will around the ICN2 agenda. The commit-
ments made by governments20 for which they must be held accountable
included: to “incorporate nutrition objectives into social protection programs
and into humanitarian assistance safety net programs” and to “use cash and
food transfers, including school feeding programs and other forms of social
protection for vulnerable populations to improve diets through better access
to food.” Global improvements in undernutrition are driven, in part, by the
success of BRICS countries in reducing poverty and hunger, and their experi-
ences are instructive in how to bring programs to scale. Despite widely varied
contexts, conditions and approaches, shared elements are:

•	    A systems approach to link social protection programs with nutri-
      tion-specific programs. This enhances impacts and aligns with other
      complementary sector policies and programs;
•	    Political commitment to pro-poor and nutrition objectives in social pro-
      tection programs, without which it’s difficult to achieve success;
•	    The right to food and good nutrition, enshrined in legal and normative
      frameworks;

34	              Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
•	   Clear institutional arrangements to facilitate communication about the
     program and engage the actors that deliver the results; and
•	   Commitment to monitoring and evaluation, which can inform program
     design and improve quality.

Arnoldo de Campos (National Secretary for Food and Nutrition Security of the
Ministry for Social Development and Fight Against Hunger, Brazil): Zero Hunger
was designed as a poverty control program. It was made possible due to the
political will of the government, and has achieved dramatic results, including
reducing infant mortality by 65 percent. Zero Hunger seeks to provide food
and resources to vulnerable social groups, providing 14 million rural and urban
households with transfers, access to job opportunities, healthcare and educa-
tion. A system of monitoring and control is coordinated between sectors “to
organize our work and streamline the process.” This helps to introduce new
initiatives into the program and improve the target indicators. Multisectoral
approaches are applied to current challenges, including enhancing the quality
of the healthcare provided, and addressing overweight/obesity and NCDs.

Vyacheslav Smolenskiy (Director for Science and International Relations,
Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and
Human Wellbeing [Rospotrebnadzor]): Russia employs ICN2 principles in link-
ages to the food chain. These aim to ensure healthy diets, including health and
nutrition education to prevent NCDs and reduce obesity, provision of essential
micronutrients to young children, provision of food allowances and subsidies
to pregnant and lactating women, school-age children and workers in vulnera-
ble social strata, and food safety. Russia has a three-tier system to ensure food
safety and food quality, and scientific research guides policies and recommen-
dations for healthy diets and energy requirements. This, together with data on
food production and per capita food consumption, informs future planning of
the food supply. Russia’s commitment to cooperation in social protection and
nutrition is evidenced by over US$200 million in funding to IOs and over two
dozen countries. Russia also supplies technical assistance related to healthy life-
styles and diet and school feeding, and dissemination of global best practices in
leveraging social protection to improve nutrition. The challenging economic
environment requires tools to share experience and knowledge more efficient-
ly—“less costly but producing greater benefit and impact for countries.”

Sanjay Mahendru (First Secretary – Trade, Embassy of India in Russia): India is
addressing challenges of social protection and nutrition through a coordinated
approach across multiple ministries and programs. These include subsidized
food distribution, rural planning programs, and a child grant for girls, school
feeding with supplementation of essential micronutrients, and the Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS) program. The approach is supported by
1.2 million Anganwadi centers, which can reach the farthest corners of the
country. Reforms underway include a shift from in-kind transfers to direct cash
transfers, and the promotion of financial inclusion by requiring a bank account
to receive subsidies and cash transfers. Priorities include addressing nutrition

during emergencies, and the gender gap in nutrition
that occurs after the age of 1, whereupon girls suffer a           “Exchange of successful

                                                                critical period of 1,000 days.”
ventive health care, sufficient food and water, and
social security. Children are disproportionally repre-
sented among the poor; they are the most vulnerable
and are at the greatest risk of malnutrition, disease, and abuse. Social assis-
tance has expanded at an unprecedented rate, with the number of beneficia-
ries increasing from 2.7 million in 1994 to 16 million in 2013. The child
support grant has grown the most. In collaboration with civil society, SA has
introduced programs on children’s rights to nutrition, education, safety, and
protection. “Exchange of successful experiences will go a long way in ensur-
ing that there is no child that is deprived of nutrition, especially at the critical
period of 1,000 days.”

Moderated Discussion
Below is a summary of the discussion; Comments are not necessarily
comprehensive or representative of all partners.
BRICS cooperation on social protection, food security and nutrition. All
that is needed is political will. Periodic BRICS meetings—including upcom-
ing meetings with the ministers of agriculture and health—are viable plat-
forms for country ministers to take up the issue.

Chair Summary. Success is achievable despite a variety of contexts, through
international and South-South cooperation, and platforms for exchange. The
BRICS Session Summary (Annex 10) follows up on the deliberations of the
Global Forum.



Learning from the Field: Case Studies of Nutrition-
Sensitive Social Protection Programs
Two working group sessions used the world café method to present case studies21
of nutrition-sensitive social protection programs. They provided a critical review
of how they work to generate understanding of the processes and challenges
involved. These two sessions held the greatest prominence in the Global Forum.
   Each of the ten tables were assigned a case study, and a Case Study
Representative from the project and Expert Facilitator (Annex 8) remained at
each table for the duration of the session. Participants received case studies in
advance and selected a table based on their interest and the availability of
chairs. “Whisper” interpreters were provided to facilitate multi-lingual

36	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
                   groups. Given limited availability of interpreters, some tables were assigned
                   language groups.
                      After a brief overview of the program by the Case Study Representative, the
                   Expert Facilitator opened the discussion, which aimed to develop the lessons
                   learned in implementing a nutrition-sensitive social protection program in
                   the specific country context. The lessons included: what were the elements of
                   the problem statement that this case addresses? What did the case teach us
                   about how to implement a nutrition-sensitive social protection program or
                   project? What barriers to integration did the implementers of this case face?
                   How did they overcome those barriers? After 45 minutes, participants were
                   invited to move to another table, with the opportunity to visit four case stud-
                   ies. At the conclusion of each session, a representative from each table deliv-
                   ered a brief summary of the key lessons learned.
                      A more comprehensive presentation of each case study is available in the
                   Compendium.

New Horizons for Nutrition-Sensitive Social
Protection
This was the last of the working group sessions that a modified world
café methodology. Its objective was to consider new challenges and
opportunities when improving nutrition through social protection
interventions. The New Horizon topics were representative of 18
cross-cutting themes, which were identified in the case studies22 and in
consultation with partner IOs.
   There were 16 tables. Each was assigned a theme and an Expert Facilitator
(Annex 8) who remained at the table for the duration of the session.
Participants received the list of themes in advance and selected a table based
on their interest and availability of chairs. “Whisper” interpreters were pro-
vided to facilitate multi-lingual groups. With guidance from the Expert
Facilitator, participants were given 15 minutes to discuss how the theme
relates to nutrition-sensitive social protection, new opportunities or chal-
lenges it poses, how programs can capitalize on these opportunities and/or
overcome these challenges, and any gaps in what we know in relation to the
theme. After 15 minutes, participants were invited to move to another table,
rotating among tables with the opportunity to visit four themes. Time con-
straints and fatigue, however, resulted in just two rotations. There was no
reporting back from this session.



What Have We Learned?
This penultimate session aimed to provide participants the chance to reflect
on lessons learned from the Global Forum and, together, to outline the key
take-away messages and next steps. Participants were asked to spend a few
minutes individually reflecting upon and writing down three things (e.g., a
message, a method, or a particularly memorable quote) that stood out in
their mind from the two days (i.e., a short term “critical incident”).
Participants were then given approximately 20 minutes for discussions with
their table to determine the most important lessons of the Global Forum.
Contributors were then called back into plenary for a moderated
discussion.
   IO representatives were asked to consider the following questions: What
are the key points you have learned from the Global Forum? How will these
influence or inform organizational operations in the future? What knowledge
gaps still need to be addressed? What is needed to move forward? Country
representatives and other participants were asked to consider different ques-
tions: What are the key points you have learned from the Global Forum?
What do country governments recommend for establishing or continuing the
integration of nutrition-sensitive / social protection programs at the country
level? What support do countries need from the international community in
order to carry this forward?

             comprehensive nor representative of all partners.

  resources and the number of          However, given limited project resources and the
                                       number of topics that need to be covered (e.g., hygiene,
 topics that need to be covered
                                       sanitation, ECD, and family planning), are we capable
(e.g., hygiene, sanitation, ECD,       of doing enough? How do we make it effective? How
  and family planning), are we         do we sequence it? Technology and the social media
    capable of doing enough?           innovations associated with it offer huge opportuni-
                                       ties that have not yet been maximized.

             Partnership. Government ownership is a cross-cutting theme encompassing
             the cases featured in the Global Forum. However, government involvement
             alone is insufficient; effective programs require community support and civil
             society engagement.

             Crises. Special strategies are needed for designing nutrition-sensitive social
             protection interventions in crisis settings and/or social protection programs
             that can be scaled up to effectively respond to emergencies. Different crises
             have different characteristics; among those briefly discussed at the Global
             Forum were conflict, climate change, and food price. Of particular impor-
             tance, no matter the predicament, are interventions aimed at addressing the
             specific nutrition needs of children.

             Financing. Social programs are crucial for reducing malnutrition and pov-
             erty, yet limited budgets and financing are key issues for many countries.
             Governments need to integrate social programs into their broader framework
             and create budgetary safeguards so that they can be adequately funded.
             Politically difficult conversations around prioritization are also needed.
             Nutrition-sensitive social protection is both an investment and a step toward
             equity, which makes it a doubly important.

             Integration. Social protection can be a lever for driving change in other sec-
             tors (e.g., agriculture, health, and education) with important implications for
             sustainability.

             Knowledge sharing. A “wealth of information” was gained at the Global
             Forum through airing the struggles and achievements of the cases. There is a
             lot still to learn and a lot of knowledge and lessons available. Many of the
             challenges are not unique to any single location, and it is helpful to know that
             there are shared challenges and, therefore, opportunities to learn from each
             other. Tapping into compartmentalized knowledge, however, is a challenge,
             and the Global Forum—though limited—was an enormous and “fantastic”
             opportunity for collaboration. It was also a unique opportunity for bringing

nutrition practitioners and social protection practitioners together in one
room. In order to make an impact, however, the knowledge and lessons shared
at the Global Forum—and results of various impact studies being con-
ducted—need to disseminate into the wider literature. Improved access to
information and knowledge products is key. Social media, as well as global
and organizational dissemination platforms can be better leveraged.

interventions, ensuring that programs are imple-
mented well is a challenge. Measuring program execu-
tion, performance, and results is important, as is using that information to
inform program design and optimization. Having good data collection pro-
cesses, monitoring methods, and transparency is required.

Program design & delivery. Improving impact on nutrition can be achieved
through design enhancements to existing programs, and does not require cre-
ation of new programs. Many case studies featured in the Global Forum
included programs that were designed to put in place a social safety net system
and evolved to be more nutrition-sensitive over time with added components.
Others were designed from the start to be nutrition-sensitive. Technical sup-
port is needed at the implementation level from both social protection and
nutrition specialists.

Targeting. There is no consensus among Global Forum participants on the
extent of prioritizing the nutritionally vulnerable in social-protection pro-
grams. However, the rationale for “putting a stronger nutrition lens to social
protection projects” and the importance of addressing children’s development
is generally understood. Social protection and social welfare are fundamental
aspects of the sustainability of a society. There are trade-offs to prioritizing the
first 1,000 days versus other groups among the poor, and the consequences
affect the overall social protection portfolio.

Andrey Bokarev (Director of the Department of the International Financial
Relations, Ministry of Finance, Russian Federation): Our joint efforts will help
us increase efficiency of social protection and nutrition programs, and move
this important issue forward. The Global Forum was successful in providing
the opportunity for exchanging views and deepening current approaches. It
was widely supported and mentioned in the agendas of important global
events, including: ICN2, the Third International Conference on Financing for
Development, and the UN Summit Sustainable Development Summit.
Participation, including among the BRICS countries, demonstrates mutual
commitment to building strong support, as well as political will towards
reducing poverty and eliminating food insecurity by capitalizing on each oth-
er’s experience, networks, and outreach for raising awareness.

Evaluation
Evaluation of the Global Forum took place over two sessions, Taking Stock
(Session Seven) at the end of Day One and the final evaluation at the end of
Day Two. In both cases, the evaluation was conducted using a remote device
(a “clicker”) to anonymously vote. Feedback from the Day One Taking Stock
session was used to inform Day Two proceedings. Complete results are avail-
able in Annex 11.
   Feedback during the Global Forum and subsequent solicited and unsolic-
ited follow-up was overwhelmingly positive. The working group sessions (i.e.,
Creating Synergies, Learning from the Field, and New Horizons) were the
most highly rated, along with the Statement of the Problem and the Keynote
Address. In general, participants enjoyed the opportunity to share experi-
ences and to learn from each other. The Statement of the Problem and Keynote
Address clearly filled a need for foundational information.
   In corroboration of the results of the vocabulary quiz, participants reported
being exposed to new terminology and information about nutrition for the
first time, as well as new approaches to nutrition-sensitive social protection.
The most prominent key messages were:

•	    “Poverty and malnutrition are multidimensional and require a multidi-
      mensional approach,”


46	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
•	   “Social protection is an investment, not an expenditure,” and
•	   “A lot can be gained synergistically by integrating social protection and
     nutrition-sensitive interventions and approaches.”

  Overall, the vast majority of participants reported that the Global Forum
provided “new information, insights, and approaches,” rating the event as
“overall excellent, with some gaps” with a quarter rating it as the “best confer-
ence ever attended.” Nearly all participants intended to take some substantive
action to use what they had learned upon returning from the Global Forum.

                    Results
                    Results suggest that participants had good understanding of social protection
                    terminology, whereas over a quarter did not correctly identify the following
                    nutrition terminology: nutrition-specific (64 percent), nutrition-sensitive (72
                    percent), hunger (73 percent), nutrition security (52 percent), wasting (60
                    percent), and undernourishment (65 percent). Day Two continued this trend
                    with substantially lower scores for the nutrition terminology: obesity (32 per-
                    cent), metabolic syndrome (52 percent), and adolescent fertility rate (34 per-
                    cent). Economic resilience (69 percent) was also widely unclear.

Annex 9: Experiences of
BRICS Countries in the
Development of Nutrition-
Sensitive Social Protection
Programs Brief
The following annex will be made available as a formal publication in 2016.
Please visit www.fao.org or www.securenutrition.org to read in full.
   The Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), held jointly by
FAO and WHO in Rome, Italy, in November 2014, called on governments
and policy makers to address nutrition issues through various sectors; social
protection was emphasized as being a key sector.
   Member States endorsed the outcome documents of the ICN2, the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition and Framework for Action. The latter urged the
integration of nutrition objectives into social protection programs and
humanitarian assistance safety net programs to holistically tackle hunger,
food insecurity and malnutrition.
   The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) played a key role
in mobilizing political will and cooperation for nutrition during the ICN2,
and have since led the way in following-up on commitments set forth in the
outcome documents.
   Building on the ICN2 recommendations, this session is an extension of a
series of dialogues that are aimed at enhancing the partnership and coopera-
tion among and with BRICS countries on the successful implementation of
the ICN2 follow-up, with a specific focus on making social protection systems
more nutrition enhancing.



Growing influence and enhanced cooperation
The BRICS countries are increasingly assuming a greater leadership role as a
political block in global policy dialogues on economic, social, and environ-
mental issues. Together, they represent 3.1 billion people and 42 percent of
the total world population.
   The BRICS have been successful in achieving the Millennium Development
Goal of halving the prevalence of undernourishment by 2015. On average,
Brazil, India and China reduced the number of undernourished people by 36
percent between 1990 and 2015–2016.23
   Furthermore, the BRICS countries have in the recent past emerged as a
vehicle for South-South cooperation for the reduction of hunger and malnu-
trition by assisting countries’ design and implement of robust social protection
programs.

  That being said, challenges remain in assisting about 333 million under-
nourished people in these countries.



Brief summary of Nutrition-Sensitive Social
Protection Policies and Programs
BRICS countries have shown firm commitment to social protection as a plat-
form to reach vulnerable populations. The social protection programs in
BRICS countries are framed within state-level institutional structures, domes-
tically financed and highly context-specific in their design and implementa-
tion. For some countries, these programs have been instrumental in reducing
hunger and malnutrition.



Brazil
Food security and nutrition found political ground in 2003 in President
Lula’s government, as he put the hunger eradication goal on top of his politi-
cal agenda—with introduction of the Zero Hunger Strategy. It has thus paved
the way for a broad National System for Food and Nutrition Security Policies
to interact in a multisector, decentralized, and participatory way. This System
comprises of two dozen ministries and civil society organizations at the
national, state and municipal level. The main sectors involved in the process
include social protection, health, nutrition, education, agriculture, rural
development, environment, labor, human rights, and gender.
   Since then the social protection policy has also been revised and strength-
ened, and the Right to Food has been included in the Constitution (along
with other social rights).
   In President Dilma’s tenure, the commitment towards hunger and poverty
eradication has been further strengthened with the launch of Brazil without
Poverty Programme. The Programme, while maintaining the former structure
of National System for Food and Nutrition Security, has initiated new mecha-
nisms to create more links to nutrition activities, while also focusing on the
inclusive production of the extremely poor population in an effort to help
them escape the trap of poverty.
   In recent times, Brazil has stepped up its efforts to share its experience and
provide technical assistance to other Latin American, Central American, and
African countries, mainly through South-South Cooperation programs.
   Key Social Protection Programs with linkages to nutrition in Brazil include:

•	   Conditional Cash Transfer Programme – Bolsa Família
•	   School Feeding Programme (PNAE)
•	   Purchase for Africa for Africans (PAA)
•	   Food and nutrition education and distribution of micronutrients and vita-
     mins through public health services

Russia
The issues of nutrition and food quality have traditionally been on top of the
agenda in Russia, backed by a strong legislative framework. In 1998, the
Concept of the State Policy in the Field of Healthy Nutrition at Federal and
Regional Levels was established. In 2014 the Concept of Domestic Food Aid
was started, which enacted the Concept for developing internal food aid in
the Russian Federation that specifies the latter as “a system of state assistance
to population in the form of direct supplies of foodstuffs to relevant individu-
als or by providing them with monetary aid for the purchase of food in order
to improve nutrition and ensure a balanced diet based on rational rates of
food consumption.”
   Russia is an emerging donor in the areas of agriculture and food security.
Eastern Europe and Central Asia have benefited and still do benefit signifi-
cantly from Russia’s approach, which had a focus on the social and cultural
rights whereby emphasis on food, nutrition, education, and social protection
were at the heart of their development. With the Eurasian Center for Food
Security, Russia wants to strengthen and use Russian Institutions to provide
technical support to the developing countries and regions.
   Key Social Protection Programs with linkages to nutrition in Russia include:

•	    The School Feeding Programme



India
In 2010, the Indian Government launched the National Rural Livelihoods
Mission, the largest integrated rural poverty reduction program in the
world, with its goal of reaching nearly 70 million rural households. Among
other things, the Mission will give poor households a voice to demand ser-
vices such as early childhood education, pensions, and other safety nets,
including programs on maternal, infant, and young child feeding and
nutrition.
   Support for poor rural households through employment schemes, other
income generation interventions, and better nutrition delivery are also exten-
sively implemented in India. School meals and school nutrition as part of social
protection programing has promoted girls’ education and participation in
society. Food fortification is also another area where the region is fairly
advanced; this provides the much needed micronutrients to a larger popula-
tion through different outlets (e.g., supermarkets, community health centers,
clinics, etc.). India also maintains extensive public food distribution systems
with a goal of smoothing consumption (i.e., managing scarcity) and reducing
volatility in food and essential prices.
   Key Social Protection Programs with linkages to nutrition in India include:

•	    Subsidized Public Food Distribution Systems (PDS)
•	    National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS)

90	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
•	   Child Grant for Girls
•	   School Feeding Programme



China
China has a large manufacturing capacity and huge commodity export base.
Its focus on the diversification and economic transformation of agriculture is
paying dividends as China is able to not only provide technical support, but it
also partners with many developing countries to support infrastructure devel-
opment, investment, and technological transfers. Over the years China has
become a major donor to agriculture development and food security.
Pledging/donating $15million to FAO demonstrates the most recent example
of a strong collaboration towards hunger reduction worldwide.
   The Food fortification programs to combat micronutrient deficiencies and
school feeding programs are widespread in China, and many vulnerable pop-
ulations benefit from these. The delivery mechanisms and points for these
social protection and nutrition programs may vary according to region (e.g.,
health sector, education, or agriculture).
   Main Social Protection Programs with linkages to nutrition in China
include:

•	   School Feeding Programme
•	   Food Fortification Programs



South Africa
South Africa has a number of social grants schemes that aim to protect the
poor from extreme conditions. The policies and programs such as the National
Integrated Nutrition Programme, and the school feeding programme seek to
address challenges of malnutrition in a holistic way, involving several sectors
and local communities. South Africa explicitly recognizes the Right to Food
and to Social Protection.
  South Africa’s National Development Plan 2030 accords a central role to
social protection in addressing the critical challenges of eradicating poverty
and reducing inequality. A role is assigned to social protection to contribute
to ensuring that no-one slips below a minimum standard of living, as well as
a more transformative and developmental role of moving towards a more
inclusive growth path and to ensure more inclusive development outcomes.
  Key Social Protection Programs with linkages to nutrition in South Africa
include:

•	   Child Support Grant
•	   School Feeding Programme – NPSP

Opportunities and Challenges in enhancing the nutrition
sensitivity of social protection programs
There is an increased momentum around social protection—at global and
regional levels—and countries are further expanding the coverage and/or
domestic financing of their social protection systems. In addition, there is an
increasing recognition towards the need to align social protection with other
key interventions to maximize its potential impacts on poverty reduction24.
   BRICS countries’ experience in the development of nutrition-sensitive
social protection interventions is critical, particularly for countries that are
progressively moving towards a systems and multi-sector approach to social
protection and nutrition.
   Moreover, there remain numerous challenges in integrating nutrition and
social protection in the BRICS countries. However, some of the identified
challenges can also be applicable in other contexts. Firstly, there is a need for
further exploration and systematic identification of the experiences and les-
sons-learned of social protection systems on nutritional outcomes.
   It is also important to analyze the institutional and governance mechanisms
that must be in place in order to ensure successful implementation and posi-
tive nutritional outcomes.
   Lastly, there is a need to identify common international cooperation
schemes within BRICS countries and main target countries/regions to
strengthen complementarities and synergies.

FAO’s Work in Nutrition Sensitive Social Protection
FAO acknowledges the necessity of a multisectoral and multi-stakeholder
approach in integrating nutrition and social protection.
   Social Protection has been recognized as instrumental in alleviating pov-
erty and it can positively address all dimensions of food security. Poverty and
malnutrition both have multiple causes that cannot be addressed by a single
sector or stakeholder. Protecting the vulnerable populations from poverty
and exclusion, and ensuring improved nutrition, therefore requires a multi-
sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach. This approach operates at various
levels, from individuals to households to communities, all the way up to the
policy level.
   Through the new Strategic Framework, which includes addressing malnu-
trition and rural poverty as Objectives, FAO aims to strengthen government
capacities in designing, implementing, and monitoring social protection sys-
tems that benefit rural households and those dependent on rural livelihoods,
while establishing key linkages with food security and nutrition.
   FAO’s expertise on supporting the development of sound policies in the
agricultural sector is now further enhanced by aligning rural development
approaches with strategies that would strengthen poor households’ capacity
to better cope and manage risk, reduce negative coping strategies, and increase
access to resources and critical services.
   FAO also generates knowledge and evidence on the impact of national social
protection programs on nutrition outcomes, as well as on linkages and

92	             Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
synergies between nutrition and social protection within the wider context of
agricultural and rural development. It also works with partners in developing
normative and standard setting instruments.
   Furthermore, a heavy emphasis is placed on facilitating partnerships, out-
reach and advocacy among and within countries in the area of social protec-
tion and the links with FSN, agricultural and rural development.

malnutrition.
   In this regard, they also noted the commitments on nutrition and social
protection made, as reflected in the ICN2 outcome documents, the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition, and its companion Framework for Action.
   They welcomed the initiative of the Russian Federation and the World Bank
to organize the Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection
Programs, which provided opportunity to share best practices and gain a bet-
ter understanding of existing needs of developing countries for support in
designing and implementing scaled up nutrition-sensitive social protection
programs.
   They expressed appreciation to FAO for providing opportunity to BRICS
countries to follow through on ICN2 commitments, in particular those aim-
ing to make social protection systems more nutrition-sensitive through
strengthened partnership and cooperation among and with BRICS
countries.
   During the session, the following messages were highlighted:

•	    Important progress has been made in terms of reducing poverty, hunger
      and malnutrition.
•	    Yet, important challenges remain given still high rates of malnutrition in
      all its forms and the alarming number of children, women, and rural
      households that continue to experience extreme poverty, hunger, and
      limited access to food in many parts of the world.
•	    The international community has made important commitments to
      address all forms of malnutrition and have placed food security and
      nutrition high on the political and development agendas.
•	    Ample evidence is showing the critical role that social protection can play
      in enhancing nutrition outcomes. Such impacts tend to be significantly
      larger when complemented with other interventions, emphasizing the
      need for multi-sector approaches in policymaking.
•	    It is essential for policy and normative frameworks to provide a nation-
      wide vision to integrate nutrition-sensitive programs and policies and
      establish institutional mechanisms to engage all relevant stakeholders to


94	              Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition: Report
     ensure coherence across interventions at national, sub-national, and
     community levels.
•	   BRICS countries are firmly committed to social protection as a means to
     reach vulnerable populations and ensure their food security and nutri-
     tion. The social protection programs in BRICS countries are set up
     through government-led institutional structures and are domestically
     financed. The designs of the programs vary and are specific to each con-
     text. The programs have been instrumental in reducing hunger and
     malnutrition.
•	   Investments on social protection systems have to be considered as critical
     catalyzers for inclusive growth and sustainable development.

  Considering their emerging leadership and key role of BRICS countries in
global policy dialogues on economic, social, and environmental issues and
building on the ICN2 recommendations they agreed on the following:

1.	 Continue efforts in promoting the establishment of more comprehen-
    sive nutrition-sensitive social protection programs and systems aimed at
    enhancing food security and nutrition. Further, support should be given
    through complementary measures to enhance agricultural sustainable
    production and productivity, including through the strengthening of
    smallholder family farming, measures to reduce food waste and losses, to
    promote local food purchases, and other instruments towards the inclu-
    siveness and efficiency of food systems. This establishes enabling condi-
    tions for enhanced income-earning opportunities and purchasing power
    of poorest, improving access to health, education, and basic services, and
    raising awareness about healthy food and healthy diets.
2.	 Promote partnership and cooperation among the BRICS countries in this
    area, aiming to develop a knowledge-sharing network and platform on
    best practices. Additionally, to enhance South-South and Peer-to-Peer
    Cooperation for improved social protection systems that foster food
    security and better nutrition.

                   Annex 12: Impact Survey
                   Results & Testimonials
                   In May 2016, SecureNutrition surveyed Global Forum attendees to under-
                   stand how participation at the Global Forum had made an impact on their
                   work. The survey was conducted using Survey Monkey and made available in
                   English, French, Russian, and Spanish. In total, 20 participants completed the
                   survey.
                      Results of the survey (Table 3) suggest that feedback garnered during the
                   evaluation immediately following the Global Forum was largely born out. All
                   (100 percent) participants of the survey reported to have shared information
                   gained from the Global Forum with colleagues in their organization, and 92
                   percent reported to have used resources learned about or received at the
                   Global Forum in their work. Among survey participants, 85 percent reported
                   to have learned information or approaches that made an impact on their work
                   at the country level. Over 80 percent of participants shared information with
                   colleagues outside of their organization (81 percent) and have led or sup-
                   ported training on nutrition-sensitive social protection (81 percent). Over
                   two-thirds of attendees have continued to engage with people they met at the
                   Global Forum (62 percent). These results provide additional supporting evi-
                   dence that the Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection
                   Programs has made an important and lasting impact on the work for techni-
                   cal practitioners globally.
                      Qualitative feedback indicates that attendees gained understanding and
                   skills to advocate for and design nutrition-sensitive social protection policies
                   and programs. Participants learned about the linkages between nutrition and
                   social protection, how social protection instruments can be leveraged for
                   nutrition outcomes, and evidence in support of nutrition-sensitive social pro-
                   tection. They also learned new approaches and best practices. Information
                   and resources gleaned from the Global Forum has been discussed and shared

widely, with colleagues and managers in organizations, academic institutions,
and government through reports, in-person and virtual meetings, and “brown
bag” lunches. These same information and materials have been shared broadly
outside attendees’ organizations too, with nutrition colleagues, partners, stu-
dents, government stakeholders, donors, and civil society organizations. Due,
in part, to connections made at the Global Forum, attendees have partici-
pated in site visits and exchange missions, and continued collaboration
through emails and video conferences. Attendees have also supported or con-
ducted training with program partners, government counterparts, and local
authorities and associations. The “practical advice” encapsulated in the case
studies has proven to be “inspiring” and “helpful.”
   In addition to evaluating the impact of the Global Forum, the survey aimed
to gather information to guide ongoing SecureNutrition programming. Key
topics of interest (Table 4) identified include: Integrated approaches in a sin-
gle program (7), Behavior change communication (6), Community participa-
tion (6), Double burden of malnutrition (6), and Early childhood development
(6). Also of interest is Governance of programs (5), Harnessing nutrition data
(5), Local procurement of food, services, etc. (5), and Multisectoral collabora-
tion among partners (5).
   Additional feedback from survey participants included both praise for the
Global Forum and specific requests for additional support, including: more
