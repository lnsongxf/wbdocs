        SHAPING THE GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM TO DELIVER IMPROVED NUTRITION AND HEALTH                       3
This paper is third in a series. The first, Ending Poverty and Hunger by 2030: An Agenda for the
Global Food System, released at the 2015 Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, outlined the overall agenda. That paper called for action on climate-smart
agriculture, improving nutritional outcomes, strengthening value chains and creating jobs,
while improving market access for poor farmers. The second, Shaping a Climate-Smart Global
Food System, distributed at the 2015 Annual Meetings, focused on climate-smart agriculture.
This third paper focuses on how the food system can deliver improved nutrition and health
for better lives and well-being. It presents a set of nutrition-sensitive interventions that coun-
tries can adopt, adapt, and apply to their circumstances (table 1).


Key messages:
•	 Malnutrition and food-borne diseases impose large current and future human, economic,
   fiscal, and social costs on countries. Key among these is child stunting that has life-long
   consequences, reducing cognitive development and lifetime earnings of individuals, and
   undermining the future competitiveness of countries.

•	 Reducing these costs requires multisector approaches. Governments often look to the
   health sector for interventions and solutions. However, the potential of food systems to
   leverage change and mitigate adverse nutrition and health impacts is frequently over-
   looked. This paper focuses on measures that can be, and have been, taken in food systems
   to improve nutrition and health.

•	 Shaping food systems to deliver improved nutrition and health requires a combination
   of improved knowledge, sound policies, regulations, and investments across the produc-
   tion-to-consumption continuum. The goal is to stimulate behavioral change in food pro-
   ducers, post-harvest handlers, food processors, food distributors, and consumers. As the
   link between food systems and household nutrition and health passes primarily through
   women, greater consideration of this gender dimension is needed across all interventions.

•	 No one size fits all. Countries need to tailor the combination of interventions to suit their
   specific needs. Moreover, different combinations of actions are needed across low- mid-
   dle- and high-income countries. There is a growing body of experiential and empirical
   evidence from which countries can draw to apply to their own circumstances.

The three sections of this paper focus on, respectively, why the global food system needs to
concentrate more on delivering improved nutrition and health; what types of food system
interventions can deliver improved nutrition and health; and how the agenda can best be
implemented.
