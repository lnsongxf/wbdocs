6 The 2013 Budget Statement mentions that between 2008 and 2012 unemployment in Grenada has doubled but unfortunately, no hard data was found available to confirm this fact.
7 Unfortunately, there is no data available in between this period to have a clearer vision of the effect of the crisis.

Box 1. Active Labor Market Policies in St. Lucia

An inventory of active labor market policies (ALMP) was created for St. Lucia by a World Bank team in 2013
collecting data from official documents and interaction with government representatives.
Spending on ALMPs in St. Lucia in 2012 represented 1.16% of GDP. This percentage is high compared to
OECD countries, which in 2011 spent less than 1% of GDP, with the exception of Belgium (1.6%), Denmark
(2.3%), Sweden (1.1%) and the Netherlands (1.1%). Comparing with Latin America, spending in St. Lucia is
particularly high: Chile allocated 0.45% of its GDP in 2010, Argentina and Colombia allocated 0.45 % and
0.35%, respectively, in 2010.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of spending on ALMPs by program category. A larger proportion (47.8%) went
to direct job creation, followed by apprenticeship programs (36.7%), training (9.6%) and development (5.8%).
Direct job creation has also the largest number of beneficiaries (78.3% of the total), followed by learning
programs (10.1%), promotion of entrepreneurship (7.2%), and training (4.5%). Note also that spending on
youth programs is low compared to the total spending.

A set of challenging characteristics emerged from the analysis of the ALMP in St. Lucia that may be preventing
individuals to receive assistance in improving their job prospects. First, in St. Lucia there is no a unique
governing body responsible for the management of all ALMPs. Employment and education matters are
integrated following the merger of two ministries into a single entity and the Ministry of Social Transformation
is responsible for managing and financing five of the fourteen existing programs. The NICE program was
conceived as an umbrella instrument, which would absorb all other programs, but in practice the programs
continued existing without change and coordination, and collaboration between actors is marginal. The
lack of coordinated management has led to duplication of efforts. For instance, in St. Lucia there are five
enterprise-incentive programs. This institutional arrangement may pose challenges unless there are clear
coordinating structures that allow for an articulated functional provision of services. Second, St. Lucia does not
have a sole institution that compiles vacancies with unemployed workers. Some programs provide assistance
for job search, such as HOPE, Skills for Inclusive Growth and NAPP, but the country does not offer a single
public service for the intermediation of labor supply and demand. Third, St. Lucia does not have a unique
registry of beneficiaries nor a profiling instrument of beneficiaries and their needs that would support a more
efficient provision of services. Fourth, most activation programs do not include a monitoring and evaluation
component that could provide feedback to the design and implementation of the program and, in turn, an
opportunity to correct mistakes and maximize good results. Furthermore, there is not a policy of evaluating the
whole ALMP strategy based on the country’s labor market needs and the cost-effectiveness of the programs.

Heterogeneity of job seekers and their needs
must be recognized when providing employ-
ment services. Not all unemployed face the same
constraints to employment. It is essential that a first
step in to the employment services is the identifica-
tion of the job seekers’ needs and characteristics. It
is not just the standard demographics or academic
qualification what explains unemployment spells. It
is also the interaction of the individual character-
istics with life trajectories what better explains the
needs of service. In fact it may be that an individual
facing difficulties with securing a job does not nec-
essary need a service from the employment office
but from social services in general. For example,
a qualified single woman with children may not
be vulnerable in the labor market just for being
women but for a combination of her living situa-
tion; she may not need more training or any type
of intermediation services but affordable child care
solutions. A similar case can be argued with a per-
son having difficulties holding a stable job due to
mental health problems. Thus, a good profiling of
the individuals helps understand their needs and
allows for a more effective assistance by referring
them to the right service or program. A tailor-made
