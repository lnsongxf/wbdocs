       damage and loss from major events such as TC
       Ami in 2003, which resulted in estimated damages
       in excess of F$100 million (US$54 million). The
       costs associated with disasters pose problems for
       the government of Fiji, as the repair of national
       infrastructure following floods and other hazard
       events drains limited national financial resources.

           The Pacific Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance
           (DRFI) Program is one of the many applications
           of PCRAFI. It is designed to increase the financial
           resilience of PICs by improving their capacity
           to meet post-disaster financing needs without
           compromising their fiscal balance. Through DRFI,
           technical assistance is available to PICs to build

           The Pacific has seen several recent cases that show
           the need for immediate liquidity post-disaster. In
           the Cook Islands, in the immediate aftermath of
           TC Pat in 2010, a delay in the receipt of travel
           funds meant that key government personnel could
           not immediately commence the initial damage
           assessment. Following TC Vania in 2010, Vanuatu
           had to reallocate a significant amount of the
           national budget. Similarly, Fiji and Samoa had to
           reallocate budgetary funds in the wake of TC Evan
           in 2012 and 2013; and the Santa Cruz earthquake
           in the Solomon Islands in February2013 drained
           the annual budget for the National Disaster
           Management Office and used the majority of the
           national contingency budget.

           Lacking contingency reserves and access to short-
           term loan funds, PICs have limited post-disaster
           budget flexibility and rely heavily on post-disaster

  COUNTRY RISK PROFILE: FIJI
  Fiji is expected to incur, on average, 79 million USD per
  year in losses due to earthquakes and tropical cyclones. In
  the next 50 years, Fiji has a 50% chance of experiencing a
  loss exceeding 750 million USD and casualties larger than
  1,200 people, and a 10% chance of experiencing a loss
  exceeding 1.5 billion USD and casualties larger than 2,100
  people.

POPULATION, BUILDINGS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND
CROPS EXPOSED TO NATURAL PERILS
An extensive study has been conducted to assemble a
comprehensive inventory of population and properties at
risk. Properties include residential, commercial, public and
industrial buildings; infrastructure assets such as major ports,
airports, power plants, bridges, and roads; and major crops,
such as coconut, palm oil, taro, sugar cane and many others.

Table 1 summarizes population and the inventory of buildings,
infrastructure assets, and major crops (or “exposure”) at risk

infrastructure.

                                       Country Note
                                                                           FIJI

              This note on Fiji forms part of a series of country Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance (DRFI) notes that
              were developed to build understanding of the existing DRFI tools in use in each country and to identify
              gaps future engagements in DRFI that could further improve financial resilience. These notes were devel-
              oped as part of the technical assistance provided to countries under the Pacific DRFI program jointly im-
              plemented by the World Bank and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community financed by the Government
              of Japan. The technical assistance builds on the underlying principles of the three-tiered disaster risk
              financing strategy and focuses on three core aspects: (i) the development of a public financial manage-
              ment strategy for natural disasters, recognizing the need for ex-ante and ex-post financial tools; (ii) the
              post-disaster budget execution process, to ensure that funds can be accessed and disbursed easily post-di-
              saster; and (iii) the insurance of key public assets, to resource the much larger funding requirements of
              recovery and reconstruction needs. The Pacific DRFI Program is one of the many applications of PCRAFI.
              It is designed to increase the financial resilience of PICs by improving their capacity to meet post-disaster
              financing needs without compromising their fiscal balance.
