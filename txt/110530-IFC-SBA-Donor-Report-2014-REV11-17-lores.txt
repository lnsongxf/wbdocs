IFC ADVISORY SERVICES IN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS


2014 ANNUAL REVIEW
Foreword
An encouraging trend is emerging with a growing number of businesses integrating sustainability
into the heart of their operations. However, our current global business model is unsustainable.
And planetary equilibrium seems to be becoming more distant. Progress towards sustainable
development is still neither fast nor deep enough. The urgency of far-reaching action towards
sustainable business remains profound, not least to address the key challenges of food insecurity,
climate change, inclusive growth, and job creation, especially for women and youth.
IFC continues to play an important part in concretely tackling these challenges by collaborating
with private sector clients and partners across the globe. Working with private enterprises in about
100 countries, we use our capital, expertise, and influence to help eliminate extreme poverty
and boost shared prosperity. In FY14, we provided more than $22 billion in financing to improve
lives in developing countries and tackle the most urgent challenges of development. Within the
sustainability sphere, working with over 500 clients, IFC, through its Sustainable Business Advisory
(SBA), played critical roles, including: promoting strong environmental, social and governance
standards in companies, facilitating investment in clean and efficient technologies, and helping to
build productive and inclusive supply chains.
As we look back and reflect on the last fiscal year, we can again see the sizable difference we are
making through our expertise and our partnerships. From significantly boosting farmer productivity
and incomes with ECOM in Indonesia and Vietnam, to implementing sweeping corporate reforms in
Yemen, our footprint drove forward several transformational projects, including in the Bangladeshi
garment and textile sector through the introduction of labor and safety standards, which stand to
improve the safety of millions of workers, mostly women.
Looking ahead, to unleash further transformational change and to help speed up business-led
sustainable and inclusive growth in emerging markets, we are embarking on exciting organizational
changes. We have taken the strategic decision to strengthen and better coordinate our Investment
and Advisory Services to achieve two interdependent goals: to add more business value to clients
and to facilitate greater development impact, as independent evaluations show happens when we
get the combination of finance and knowledge right. In this way, we can bring the full weight of our
resources to bear to address the kind of critical sustainability challenges facing the world.
We look forward to putting our planet on a more sustainable path, and in the process seizing
further opportunities to partner with you – firm in the belief that business is an essential vehicle for
delivering a more prosperous, cleaner, and equitable world to the next generation.

As of June 30, 2014, SBA had 127 active client-facing projects in 53 countries with a combined value of
$242 million. The average size of an SBA project has doubled from $0.9 million four years ago to $1.8
million today, promoting efficiencies of scale. With respect to larger projects in FY14, SBA contributed
to 11 of 15 projects IFC defined as “transformational,” with engagements in the energy and power
sector in Central Asia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Nepal, and Nigeria; in the extractives sector in Mongolia
and Guinea; in the agribusiness sector in Mozambique; and in support of apparel manufacturers in
Bangladesh.

SBA is proud of its global footprint and the impact we make through our clients. During FY14, SBA
had more than 300 new client engagements, with strong growth in engagements with clients who
also benefit from IFC Investment Services. In a reflection of the world-class offering that SBA pro-
vided, more than 90 percent of our clients said they were satisfied with the quality of our services.
Here is a snapshot of some of the regional results that we have achieved.

Strategy
The continuation of economic growth in developing countries cannot be taken for granted. For the
benefits of such growth—as well as this growth process itself—are being threatened by a number
of sustainability challenges, many of which are intensifying in force. Everyday an additional 210,000
people join our human family, accelerating competition for the planet’s life support systems of food,
water, and energy on which humanity depends; by 2030, we expect to need at least 50 percent more
food, 45 percent more energy, and 30 percent more water, all at a time when environmental con-
straints present new limits to supply. Just as the severe pressure on these natural resource supplies is
unprecedented, so too is the pressure to find new ways to conserve them, promote their most efficient
use, and replace non-renewable resources with renewable ones wherever possible. Such aggressive
efforts are vital to ensuring that the lifeblood of our integrated global economy is protected and main-

This reality underscores the importance of efforts by              sustainability into the heart of their operations. In our

of verifiable market standards and the availability of
standards-based best practices. This is true with regard
to sustainable sourcing (agricultural commodities
sourced from farmers using sustainable land manage-
ment practices; textiles sourced from SMEs using decent
labor standards for their employees) or with regard to
new “green” technologies in consumer markets (e.g. for
efficient lighting or solar lighting, consumers in par-
ticular in developing countries need to be able to trust
product quality to make investment decisions). Where
such standards are lacking, IFC projects support their
development, as well as their testing and broad uptake,
working with producers, buyers, and intermediaries.
   The need to support individual firms through address-
ing first-mover risk is critical to achieving behavioral
and investment changes at the sector level. Identifying
and working with first movers who can set an example,
and based on whose experience other firms can follow,
is an important part of many projects. Even where
environmentally and socially relevant business practices
and technologies may make immediate financial sense,
resulting in operational savings or increased market
success, most businesses are risk-averse and prefer not
to be a first mover. Where transactions do not occur
because the risks perceived are too high or because
there is simply not enough knowledge and experience
available in terms of the “how to,” our projects work
with individual firms with the specific purpose to dem-
onstrate commercial value while also making available
practical experience on how to handle implementa-
tion risks. A good example is the work with industries
reliant on fossil fuels to promote uptake of clean energy
solutions.
  Across the board our projects take a systematic and
specific focus on the role of women—as entrepreneurs,
staff, or clients and customers—in order to enhance
the development impact of the advisory interventions,
noting the important and under-invested-in role that
women tend to play in the private sector. Specific targets
are being set in particular for advisory efforts in sectors
with high shares of women entrepreneurs or employees,
such as agribusiness and selected sub-sectors in manu-
facturing.
  While many businesses are aware of environmental-,
social- or governance-related risks and opportunities,
awareness of tools to address these and turn them into
commercially valuable market advantages is lacking.
Going forward our projects will continue to focus on
sectors with high environmental or social relevance,
work with firms to analyze and understand firm-level
gaps and exposures that can be translated into oppor-
tunities, and then develop and disseminate relevant
information and best-practice tools in this regard.

Agribusiness
To eliminate food insecurity by 2050, it is expected that we will need to adequately feed 9.3 billion
people. That is an additional 2 billion more people than we need to feed today—all at a time when
there are 875 million people suffering from chronic hunger. Ensuring a food secure world by the
middle of this century will require raising global food production by 70 percent. This unprecedented
challenge is complicated further by the constraints on agricultural production caused by increasing
demand and growing competition for natural resources, as well as environmental degradation and
the effects of climate change. Raising yields and improving agriculture’s resilience to climate change
are important actions needed both for sustainable global food security and to raise the income of
rural people in the world’s poorest countries.

Extractives
Across the globe, oil, gas, and mining companies invest billions in local communities, contributing
to local development through employment, local supply chains, taxes paid, and voluntary programs
to improve the lives of people in host communities. Nearly half of sub-Saharan Africa’s population
lives in countries rich in oil, gas or hard mineral resources, and these countries account for some 70
percent of Africa’s gross domestic product and receive the bulk of foreign direct investment.

Clean Energy and Resource Efficiency
Rising demand for scarce resources has increased the pressure to drive economic growth in ways
that are environmentally and socially sustainable. IFC’s Advisory Services in clean energy and resource
efficiency address critical challenges for inclusive green growth, and help ensure environmentally
sustainable outcomes and an efficient use of resources. Our advisory team works with the private
sector to catalyze investment and market growth in three primary areas of focus: supporting
markets for renewable energy for both on- and off-grid uses, supporting private sector solutions to
provide energy access for the underserved, and catalyzing investments for resource efficiency.

  IFC is already generating sector-level outcomes and
impacts recognized by external stakeholders, but many
are not captured today. For example, in Bangladesh,
stakeholders estimated that IFC accelerated the textile
sector’s awareness and uptake of resource efficiency
technologies by two to three years, with nearly exclu-
sive attribution to IFC of various positive changes in the
sector’s resource efficiency awareness and adoption.
  While there is a lack of consensus on exactly what
constitutes sector transformation, the review defined
a sector transformation impact target as additional
market growth achieved over the business-as-usual
scenario.
  The review confirmed that achieving market trans-
formation takes time and requires intervention on
multiple levels, including a client’s ability to act upon
information and market intelligence, secure financing
and supply of services, implement technologies, build
infrastructure, and comply with regulation.

STRATEGIC ORIENTATION
In FY15, IFC expects to continue to focus its efforts
clean in energy and resource efficiency in Europe and
Central Asia, whilst also deepening our engagement
in the African and South Asian markets. We will also
boost our development impact by increasingly offering
complementary knowledge support to our investment
clients, particularly in the Manufacturing, Agribusiness
and Services sectors, and also in Infrastructure.
  We will continue to support grid-connected renew-
ables projects, as well as solutions for captive power
from renewable energy sources, and focus on resource
efficiency IFC clients. Our resource efficiency team will
roll out work on waste heat recovery in the cement
and chemical sector in multiple geographies around the
world. Finally, we will continue to scale our support for
off-grid clean energy solutions to match the potential
shown by the industry’s annual growth rates of over
300 percent.

Small and Medium Enterprises
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the pivotal drivers of growth and the primary engine of job
creation in developing countries, accounting for more than 90 percent of new formal jobs in emerging
markets. IFC partners with companies whose value chains integrate large numbers of suppliers and
retailers within different sectors, such as agribusiness, construction, financial services, extractives,
manufacturing, telecoms, retail, and tourism. Evidence has demonstrated that by partnering with
large companies, IFC programs can reach a larger number of SMEs, including women and youth.

current technological trends and the need to reduce

such online capacity-building products include Partner

SME Toolkit partners, an on-line instructional design
course that allows IFC to build regional capacity of
instructional designers in a much more cost effective

designers will also allow IFC to develop and customize
sector specific training content to maximize our offering
for corporate value chains.

STRATEGIC ORIENTATION
To help find solutions for many development issues, IFC
will continue to focus on SME segments, youth, and
women-owned businesses, including supporting SMEs
in fragile and conflict-affected countries, strengthen-
ing local business capacity, and supporting domestic
entrepreneurs. We plan also to focus on ways to enable
SMEs to participate in the supply chains and portfolios
of client banks and corporations.
  Over the course of FY15, IFC will upgrade its SME
Advisory offering by releasing the new SME Toolkit
platform and adding new content/modules to better
serve targeted SME segments and sectors. Examples
include cooperatives management training for agribusi-
ness, entrepreneurship workshops for women-owned
businesses, and relationship management training for
banks in cooperation with IFC’s Investment Services.
   In addition to content and tools, IFC will diversify
its delivery mechanisms using technology to increase
the scale of our reach and to reduce the costs of deliv-
ery, while increasing our focus on blended learning
content—further integrating SME Toolkit and Business
Edge to create an enhanced blended learning offering.

Jobs
The world needs to create 600 million new jobs by 2020 just to accommodate the number of young
people entering the workforce over the next six years.1 These jobs will need to be created mainly in
sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, largely due to demographic trends. The link between poverty and unem-
ployment is stark. Employment is the surest path out of poverty—it boosts living standards, raises
productivity, and fosters social cohesion. A job for the individual is also integral to human develop-
ment because it recognizes human dignity; work is not just a means of self-support, but also a con-
tribution to society. Being out of work for a prolonged period undermines the freedom and creativity
of an individual, and underlines that human costs always include economic costs.

Gender
Evidence shows that achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of shared prosperity and reduced
absolute poverty is only possible if the private and public sectors succeed in efforts to include women
in the economy and eliminate barriers to their full participation. IFC recognizes the potential of
women—as entrepreneurs, employees, and leaders—to drive economic growth and enhance busi-

LESSONS LEARNED
IFC has learned that in order to reach its gender goals,
we need to better leverage the knowledge and resources
of internal and external partners. Starting in FY15, the
Secretariat will form part of the new World Bank Group
Gender Cross Cutting Solution Area (CCSA). While IFC
will continue to focus on private sector contributions
to integrated gender solutions, this new structure will
allow for better coordination of resources and more
knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the newly established
Global Gender Network, with staff from across IFC,
helps to disseminate gender related learning across all
regions and industries.

Environmental and Social
Performance Standards
Environmental and social risks and challenges are becoming even more important, impacting com-
panies’ long-term strategies, their customers, and external stakeholders. From increasing demand
for natural resources to economic disparity to climate change, companies are facing a more complex
array of trade-offs and risks across their value chains. Population growth, a rising middle class, rapid
urbanization, and economic growth are all fueling an increasing demand for food, water, energy,
land, and other resources. In the last decade, emerging markets saw an 80 percent increase in per
capita income, which in turn is resulting in an increase in consumption. Early projections show an 80
percent increase in energy use and a 60 percent increase in water use.

Knowledge Sharing and
Thought Leadership
Thought leadership and strategic knowledge management at the global level enable SBA to develop
technical expertise, assure quality, innovate, and enhance our efficiency. A core function of the SBA
global team is to encourage new thinking, and capture lessons learned to enable replication and adap-
tation of successful business models and projects across regions and countries, and help transfer skills
from one business context to another. The knowledge generated in our work is made available to our
partners and stakeholders through our web pages, seminars, events, and a number of publications.

Funding
The trusted relationship between SBA and our donors is the cornerstone of our ability to have
maximum impact and deliver concrete results. Over three-quarters of our project funding is derived
from our ongoing partnership with more than 20 donors. The power of this partnership in FY14
enabled SBA to continue to be effective and efficient in the delivery of our products and services.
Our donors recognize that broad-based sustainable
economic growth and private-sector development are              CHART 2   SBA FY14 Project Funding Composition
essential for reaching desired development outcomes.
Conscious of the importance SBA places on deliver-
ing value for money and the impact our high-quality
specialist advice can have, our donors continue to make
contributions to SBA either directly to our programs
and projects in the regions, through core funding to the
Global SBA Facility, or through other IFC Multi-Donor
Trust Funds, which fund our global work and are chan-
neled to projects in the regions.
   In addition to funding received from our donor
partners, SBA is financed by retained earnings from
IFC’s investments, as well as by the fees earned for the
services that SBA provides to more than 500 firms and
other clients. In May 2011, the IFC Board of Directors’
