T      his poverty assessment analyzes recent trends in monetary and nonmonetary aspects of
       poverty and economic vulnerability in the Republic of Congo (ROC), based on two nation-
       ally representative and broadly comparable household expenditure surveys conducted by
the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) in 2005 and 2011. The study determines the drivers of
poverty reduction by systematically looking at demographic, labor, and human capital dimen-
sions. The report also discusses cross-cutting issues relevant for poverty reduction, such as service
delivery, marginalization of autochthons, and others. This study aims to provide policy makers
with the knowledge needed to improve the effectiveness of their programs to reduce and finally
eradicate extreme poverty in the Republic of Congo.3


Between 2005 and 2011, the Republic of Congo experienced
a strong macroeconomic performance that was driven by oil
revenues

The country’s history has been characterized by ups and downs related to the performance
of the oil sector, changes from communism to market economy, civil war, and social unrest.
Since the 1960s, the country has experienced four economic phases: 1960–1972; 1973–1984;
1985–1999; and 2000–2014. These periods correspond, respectively, to the pre-oil economy; the
first oil boom; the oil price crisis; and the second oil boom (World Bank 2016a). The country
also experienced social unrest with a military coup and civil war. The various governments, also in
line with the cold war, have moved back and forth from communism towards a market economy.
All these affected the economy and people’s perceptions, especially toward the importance of the
state as the main job provider.
       Dutch disease followed the discovery of oil. In the 1960s, the economy was diversified,
but with the discovery of oil followed the reduction of the relative importance of other sectors.
Most importantly, the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors shrank due to reduced competi-
tiveness. As a consequence, the country imports most of its goods, even food.

 Economic growth, economic diversification job creation and poverty reduction are at the core of the National De-
velopment plan (Republic of Congo 2012a, 2012b).

       poverty and economic vulnerability in Republic of Congo (ROC), based on two nation-
       ally representative and broadly comparable household expenditure surveys conducted by
the NIS in 2005 and 2011. The study determines the drivers of poverty reduction by systemati-
cally looking at demographic, labor, and human capital dimensions. The report also discusses
cross-cutting issues relevant for poverty reduction, such as service delivery, marginalization of
autochthons, and others. This study aims to provide policy makers with the knowledge needed
to improve the effectiveness of their programs to reduce and finally eradicate extreme poverty in
the Republic of Congo.


History has been marked by political instability and
dependency on the oil sector

The country’s history has been characterized by ups and downs related to the performance
of the oil sector, changes from communism to market economy, civil war, and social unrest.
Since the 1960s, the country has experienced four economic phases: 1960–1972; 1973–1984;
1985–1999; and 2000–2014. These periods correspond, respectively, to the pre-oil economy; the
first oil boom; the oil price crisis; and the second oil boom (World Bank 2016). The country also
experienced social unrest with a military coup and civil war. The various governments, also in
line with the cold war, have moved back and forth from communism toward a market economy.
All these affected the economy and people’s perceptions, especially toward the importance of the
state as the main job provider.
       Dutch disease followed the discovery of oil. In the 1960s, the economy was diversified,
but with the discovery of oil followed the reduction of the relative importance of other sectors
(Figure 1). Most importantly, the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors shrank due to reduced
competitiveness. As a consequence, the country imports most of its goods, even food.
       The Republic of Congo experienced strong economic growth between 2002 and 2015.
This strong economic growth was driven by higher oil prices and political stability. On average,
during this period, the Republic of Congo’s growth rate stood at 4.5 percent (Figure 2). Between
2005 and 2011, the country grew strongly at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent mainly driven
by high oil revenues from oil production and the decision of the Government to step up its invest-
ment in infrastructure in 2006.
