THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      downloaded in the website.

      LCCs are:

      issued by the business registry (or equivalent authority) in the country
      where the founding shareholder is registered, showing registration and
      current status (i.e. that the said company is not under any insolvency,
      winding-up or other similar process) - this excerpt inter alia should
      indicate the names of the person(s) signing the resolution referred to

      Notary prepares sale and purchase agreement and notarizes it

      "Pursuant to the Law No. 03/L-10 on Notary, the function of legalizing
      transactions with real property has been transferred to Notaries.
      According to the Law: the notary prepares and certifies property deeds,
      upon the request of natural and legal persons, or public authorities.

      Notary prepares and notarizes deeds in connection, inter alia, with the
      following operations, which the parties wish or are required to endow:

      made by the Notary or in his or her presence;

      certification that copies are true copies of the original document;
      3. legalization of signatures affixed by individuals to documents signed
      under hand; and
      4. receipt of sworn statements.

      The notary fees are defined by the Ministry of Justice, in consultation
      with the Chamber of Notaries. The Administrative Instruction No.
      02/2012 On Provisional Notary Fees sets out provisional notary fees for
      notarial acts and services in the Republic of Kosovo. According to the
4     Article 5 of the Instruction: ""Notary fee rates are determined based on       2 days       EUR 166.93
      transaction value of the notarial act"".

      For notarial acts prepared based on the transaction value and which are
      not included in other fees, the notary fees shall be calculated as follows:
      Transaction value in Euro

      For the property with the value of:
      0,01 EUR to 2.500,00 EUR - fee is 20 EUR
      2.501,00 EUR to 5.000,00 EUR - fee is 30 EUR
      5.001,00 EUR to 20.000,00 EUR - fee is 50 EUR
      20.001,00 EUR to 60.000,00 EUR - fee is 80 EUR
      60.001,00 EUR to 100.000,00 EUR - fee is 120 EUR

      For notarial acts where the transaction value exceeds the amount of
      100,000.00 EUR, the fee will increase for 20 EUR for every 20,000.00, but
      can not exceed the total fee amount of 1.000 EUR."

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Kosovo (table 10.1)?
