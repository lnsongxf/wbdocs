Action Plan                     The Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) or Action Plan (see
                                Performance Standard 1). “The Action Plan will (i) describe the actions
                                necessary to implement the various sets of mitigation measures or corrective
                                actions to be undertaken; (ii) prioritize these actions; (iii) include the timeline
                                for their implementation; (iv) be disclosed to the affected communities; and (v)
                                describe the schedule and mechanism for external reporting on the client’s

                                ESAPs and tasks. In addition the ESAP when completed and approved migrates
                                automatically to the ESRS. During Supervision, when the status of each ESAP
                                task has been updated and then approved, these data will flow to the IFC
                                Disclosure Website to disclose completion status of each task consistent with
                                the requirements of the 2012 AIP.

Additionality                   The development impact that will be achieved because of IFC’s participation in
                                a project. This is articulated in the Board Paper.

Advisory Assignment             A financial or policy advisory assignment where IFC proposes to carry out an
                                activity for a fee.

AMR                             The Environmental and Social Annual Monitoring Report (AMR). Report scope
                                and content are agreed between IFC and the client, and may in some vases be
                                included in the investment contract. The AMR helps IFC assess on a yearly basis
                                the E&S risk of the project and revise and update the ESRR score
                                (Environmental and Social Risk Rating). In order to ensure that the
                                corporation maintains a quality E&S portfolio, the CRC (Corporate Risk
                                Committee) has approved a capture rate of 90% for Annual Monitoring Reports
                                (AMR).

AMR-CR                          Annual Monitoring Report Capture Rate (AMR-CR). The AMR-CR defines the %
                                of IFC active portfolio clients with reporting covenants in the investment
                                contract whose most recent AMR was received within the last 15 months. The
                                total number of portfolio clients with the obligation to report excludes those:
                                without E&S reporting covenants; with $0 outstanding balance; in SOU,
                                litigation or liquidation; that have received supervision waivers; and, with a 1st
                                disbursement <15 months previously.

Applicable                      All IFC Performance Standards (PSs) are applicable to projects as stated by
Performance                     investment contract covenants. In the case of Financial Intermediaries (FI), this

                                controls; (ii) associated facilities that are not funded as part of the project and
                                whose viability and existence depend exclusively on the project; (iii) areas
                                potentially impacted by cumulative impacts from further planned development
                                of the project; and (iv) areas potentially affected by impacts from unplanned
                                but predictable developments caused by the project that may occur later or at a
                                different location.

                                projects are scored at the end of appraisal and during supervision (see below).
                                Category C projects and Category FI-3 projects are not scored. Calculated ESRR
                                scores range from 1-4 with 1: Excellent; 2-Satisfactory; 3: Partly Unsatisfactory;

                                ESRR(A) is to establish a baseline ESRR rating to express the status of the client
                                before IFC intervention and implementation of remedial measures contained in
                                the Action Plan. The ESRR(A) baseline will be compared or contrasted side-by-
                                side over time to the ESRR(S) to illustrate the impact of IFC’s intervention

    Version 7, April 15, 2013




    ESRP 1. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL REVIEW PROCEDURES MANUAL

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    1.1 Purpose: Management-approved environmental and social (E&S) appraisal and supervision guidance
    for investment activities contained in this E&S Review Procedures (ESRP) Manual is an essential
    component of the larger IFC and the specific CES risk management system. The Manual describes how
    CES conducts its due diligence for the business activities under consideration. IFC’s Performance
    Standards (PS) define the performance outcomes of the client throughout the life of the project, and
    the ESRP Manual provides a structured approach for CES to monitoring and recording client
    performance. The structure of the procedures follows the typical chronology of events in the investment
    project cycle. However, the sequencing may vary to satisfy specific project needs (e.g. the sequence of
    IRM and ESRS disclosure).

    1.2 Applicability: A fundamental part of IFC’s mission is its commitment to sustainable development.
    IFC’s Sustainability Framework (SF) is the foundation of this commitment and includes the Policy on
    Environmental and Social Sustainability, which defines IFC's commitments to environmental and social
    sustainability; the Performance Standards, which define clients' responsibilities for managing their
    environmental and social risks; and the Access to Information Policy, which articulates IFC's
    commitment to transparency.
    The Risk Management System Manual (see Rules and Tools RMS Manual) provides an overview of the
    structure of the CES management system of which the ESRP Manual is a fundamental piece. It presents
    the risk management policy and defines the broad responsibilities of staff within CES who contribute to
    the workings of the CES Department.
    This ESRP Manual incorporates procedures that CES specialists follow to consistently implement the
    requirements of the SF and complements IFC’s Operational Procedures.
    The ESRP Manual applies to the full range of IFC’s investment activities, such as direct lending to private
    enterprises including corporate and project finance; lending to financial intermediaries (FIs);
    equity/shareholding in companies, financial institutions, and other entities; structured finance products
    such as guarantees and securitizations; municipal finance; and E&S due diligence of Advisory Services
    (AS) projects. The ESRP Manual also describes the methodology to implement IFC’s institutional
    disclosure requirements in accordance with the AIP.

    IFC Asset Management Company, LLC (AMC) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFC), is IFC’s fund
    management organization raising and managing third-party capital, which it invests in IFC transactions.
    All investments made by AMC-managed funds are executed and managed in accordance with all IFC
    operational policies and standards, including the Sustainability Framework. As AMC only invests in
    projects in which IFC directly invests, it relies on IFC’s E&S due diligence.

    2. ESRP Scope

    2.1 ESRP Procedures Manual and the WB Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines: The
    general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines provide benchmark criteria in line with good international
    industry practice and are linked to the PS through PS2: Labor and Working Conditions, PS3: Resource

    Efficiency and Pollution Prevention and PS4: Community Health, Safety and Security. The ESRP Manual
    does not repeat this technical guidance for specific E&S project performance, however, the ESRP Manual
    provides structured guidance for CESI Specialists to ensure consistency and quality of CESI review
    processes. (For further reference please read Guidance Notes for PS2, PS3 and PS4 in Rules and Tools /
    Sustainability Framework)

    2.2 Project Documentation: CES’ risk management system for investment review and supervision
    comprises decision recording systems (i.e., Environmental and Social Review Document (ESRD) and the
    corporate document repository for all investment projects, iDesk/IFCDocs). The ESRD facilitates creation
    of a record about key E&S decisions taken over the life of the project. iDesk/IFCDocs is the corporate
    repository of all pertinent project related documents reviewed. IFC applies specific monitoring and
    supervision requirements to investment projects including production and submission of annual
    monitoring reports (AMR), status reports on the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), periodic
    Site Supervision Visits (SSVs), and data required to update the corporate Development Outcomes
    Tracking System (DOTS). Category A and B investments are also scored at the end of appraisal and then
    during supervision using the Environmental and Social Risk Rating (ESRR), an internal CES tool designed
    to indicate the project’s relative level of E&S risk. Corrective and preventative actions are ultimately
    captured and managed through the Environmental and Social Action Plan Tracker (ESAP Tracker).
    Category A and B projects are also rated at the end of appraisal and during supervision using the
    Performance Standards Achievement Rating (PSAR), introduced with ESRD 3.0 (see Rules and Tools –
    CES Apps) to track the progress made towards the implementation of applicable Performance
    Standards.

    2.3 Roles and responsibilities: a more comprehensive description of roles and responsibilities in CES is
    included in the CES RMS manual (see Rules and Tools/ RMS Manual)

              2.3.1 Client’s Role: IFC expects clients to manage E&S risks and impacts of their projects. This
              entails client assessment of these risks and impacts, and implementation of management
              systems and management plans to meet the requirements of the PSs. An important component
              of the client’s E&S performance is its engagement with the affected communities through the
              life of the project.

              2.3.2 Role of the CESI Lead E&S (LESS) and Support E&S Specialist (SESS): The LESS and SESS
              identify and assess projects’ E&S risk and impacts in order to help clients to define adequate
              E&S management plans and to promote sustainable outcomes. The ESRP Manual is not intended
              as a substitute for specialists’ professional judgment and expertise. The ESRP Manual provides
              work instructions to guide consideration and documentation of key issues and decisions that are
              to be made during the investment cycle. Deviations from recommended practice in the ESRP
              Manual must be approved by Manager CESI and recorded and stored in iDesk/IFCDocs.

    Version 7, April 15, 2013




              Specifically this role includes:

                   •     Conduct due diligence of the proposed investment activity;
                   •     Assist the client in developing measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and where
                         residual impacts remain, compensate/offset for E&S impacts consistent with the PSs;
                   •     Categorize the project to specify IFC’s institutional requirements to disclose project-
                         specific information to the public;
                   •     Identify opportunities to improve E&S outcomes;
                   •     Monitor and document the client’s E&S performance throughout the life of IFC’s
                         investment; and
                   •     Disclose information about its institutional and investment activities in accordance with
                         the Access to Information Policy (see Rules and Tools – Sustainability Framework).

                 2.3.3 Role of Regional Team Leaders (RTL) and Sector Leads (SL): RTL and SL have an
                 outstanding role on the quality and consistency of the project processing and on providing
                 guidance on technical issues and operational performance. There is some desirable level of
                 overlap between the two functions (as it provides robustness to our E&S products), but most
                 often SL have a leading role during the appraisal of projects while RTL have the main role
                 during the project supervision phase.

                 2.3.4 CES Managers: have the responsibility for the overall performance of their management
                 units; on the management of personnel and resources; and on providing clearance on critical
                 decisions about projects.

    3. ESRP Manual content:

    Individual procedures applicable to appraisal and supervision of Direct Investments activities are
    addressed in ESRP 2: E&S Team Assignment, Early Review, and Concept Review Meeting; ESRP 3:
    Appraisal; ESRP 4: Disclosure and Commitment; and, ESRP 6: Supervision (see Rules and Tools –
    Sustainability Framework). Individual procedures applicable to appraisal and supervision of FI
    investment activities are addressed in ESRP 7: Early Review and Appraisal; ESRP 8: IFC Disclosure and
    Commitment; and ESRP 9: Supervision (see Rules and Tools – Sustainability Framework).

    For both Direct and FI investments, actions for addressing eventualities (e.g., something that might
    happen, contingent occurrences) during IFC’s investment cycle are described in ESRP 5: Managing Non-
    routine events in Investment Projects. ESRP 10 E&S High Risk List describes special supervision
    treatment given to the group of projects in the active portfolio that entail the highest level of E&S risk.
    E&S responsibilities for appraisal and supervision of AS investments are defined in ESRP 11: E&S
    Requirements for Advisory Services Projects (see Rules and Tools – ESRP 11). ESRP 12 describes the
    steps for updating existing and generation of new environmental and social (E&S) Review Procedures in
    ESRP Manual.

    4. Rules and Tools:

    A cornerstone of CES quality assurance efforts is the control of operational documents. Document
    control is an essential preventive measure ensuring that only approved, current documentation is used
    throughout the organization. Inadvertent use of out-of-date documents can have significant negative
    consequences on consistency and traceability of E&S processes.

    Rules and Tools is an information management application that contains current, management-
    approved procedures, documents, and guidance for CESI Specialists and links to other operational
    resources. It is the definitive source of guidance, information, links, and document formats for CESI
    Specialists engaged in IFC appraisal and supervision work. For each step in Mainstream and Financial
    Intermediary project cycles (e.g., Early Review, Appraisal, etc.), there is a compilation of Rules, including
    applicable procedures and E&S Sustainability Framework documents, and Tools, including document
    formats, worksheets, calculation and estimation tools, and diverse guidance.

    On addition to the Sustainability Framework related documents, IFC has a library of technical resources
    on sustainability available in its webpage (IFC+Sustainability/publications) organized as Reports,
    Handbooks and Toolkits, Case Studies, Good Practice Notes and Lessons of experience that provide
    additional valuable references .

    5. IFC Policies Compliance and Oversight Mechanisms:

    The World Bank has several organizations to ensure compliance with its policies. These entities have
    access to appraisal and supervision documents and may evaluate them during the course of an
    investigation.
    The oversight functions include the following.

         • Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman Office (CAO) established by IFC and the Multilateral
           Investment and Guarantee Agency in 2000. The CAO audits compliance with IFC’s Sustainability
           Framework. CAO also carries out an ombudsman role by attempting to mediate disputes among
           companies, governments, and civil society organizations. The CAO also provides advice to the
           President of the World Bank Group and to senior management of IFC and MIGA on broader
           environmental and social issues.

         • The Internal Audit Vice Presidency (IAD) is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the
           organization’s risk management and governance processes. It provides advice in the
           development of risk control solutions and monitors implementation of corrective actions to
           mitigate risk.

         • The Independent Evaluation Group for Private Sector (IEG) is responsible for the post-
           evaluation function within IFC. IEG's work aims to:
           • Help provide accountability for achievement of IFC's objectives;

    ESRP 2. DIRECT INVESTMENTS: PRE-MANDATE INITIAL REVIEW, CONCEPT
    REVIEW MEETING, AND E&S SPECIALIST(S) ASSIGNMENT

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    This procedure applies to initial environmental and social (E&S) review activities for Direct Investments
    beginning with pre-mandate review through approval to proceed with appraisal as an outcome of the
    project Concept Review Meeting (CRM).

    This procedure addresses: understanding the scope of the business activity(ies) in which IFC is proposing
    to invest; initial identification of potential key Performance Standards issues associated with the
    proposed investment based on the business sector and geographic extent of the activities; participation
    in the CRM; preparation of E&S Considerations text for the Project Data Sheet-Concept (PDS-Concept),
    and assignment of E&S Specialist(s) team. It also includes assignment of provisional E&S categorization
    and related investment Tier, and development of an appraisal strategy with any involved WBG entities
    or other DFIs.

    2. Procedure

    2.1 Initiation and Identification of Potential Risks and Impacts: Upon being notified by the regional or
    global investment department of a prospective new project, the CESI Regional Team Leader (RTL, often
    in the case of regional projects) and/or the relevant CESI Sector Lead (SL particularly for global projects),
    or their designee, shall request available information necessary to understand the extent of the business
    activity being considered for investment. Central to this understanding is information surrounding the
    intended use OF IFC proceeds and whether the assets to be developed are physically defined and
    located or yet to be identified. It is also important to understand whether the proposed financing
    involves debt, equity, or both, and the nature of the existing assets at the investee company level in
    relation to the use of IFC proceeds. Equally important is an understanding of the level of management
    control the investee has over the business activity.

    Once the use of proceeds, asset type/status, investment instrument and nature of asset control by the
    company are understood, the RTL and/or SL identifies the risks and impacts that might be associated
    with these types of activities. Risk and impact identification will depend primarily on what is known
    about the: (i) physical E&S footprint of the activity(ies); (ii) particular business sector, or range of
    sectors, addressed by the activity(ies); and (iii) in the absence of a physical footprint, risk context of the
    future environmental and social setting or location of the activity(ies) in conjunction with the industry
    sector (s). To help inform the provisional categorization decision (see 2.5 below), sectors and settings
    with potentially high inherent risks should be noted at this early stage.

    On the basis of the above understanding of use of proceeds and potential risks and impacts of the
    activity(ies), the RTL and/or SL shall articulate the conceptual approach that will guide the eventual E&S
    scope of review should the project be approved for appraisal (see ESRP 3). Where some or all proceeds
    are directed at unidentified, future assets, the review will include the investigation of the capacity,

                                                                 Page 1 of 7

    maturity, and reliability of the company’s E&S corporate management system to enable compliance
    with the Performance Standards (PS).

    2.2 Repeat Investment: If the proposed investment projects involves an existing IFC Partner, no further
    E&S review is required provided that: (i) IFC previously conducted E&S due diligence of the existing
    investment consistent with all applicable PSs; (ii) the new investment will not result in any material
    change in E&S impacts associated with existing investment(s); (iii) the existing investment is not a
    “knowledge gap” project (see ESRP 6); and the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) of the
    existing investment does not require any corrective actions additions, cancellations or reschedules
    because of either poor performance or to satisfy repeat investment needs.
    It’s important however for those cases where the existing investment has a high ESRR and supervision
    activities shown poor E&S performance, that the LESS highlights these facts for consideration during the
    IRM.

    2.3 Investment Programs: There are some IFC investment programs (e.g. CCFP, GTSF and Infraventures)
    consisting of pre-approved funds for subprojects in some broad defined sectors or products. Those
    subprojects (in this type of investment programs) are processed by IFC receiving their own project ID
    and are subject to IFC’s appraisal and are assigned an individual E&S category. That’s why it does not
    seem purposeful to assign an E&S category to the investment program as a whole since the subprojects
    are subject individually to IFC’s E&S due diligence and they receive an applicable E&S category. Thus
    Investment Programs are therefore not subject to E&S categorization as long as their subprojects are
    processed as described here.

    2.4 Infraventures: is an investment program to support early stage infrastructure projects development
    efforts; for example (i) consultants’ expenses and fees, (ii) planning and feasibility studies, and/or (iii)
    early project development costs (permits, land acquisition; pilot studies, etc.). Individual subprojects
    funded through Infraventures are categorized as C because impacts are very limited due to the pre-
    development nature of these projects and thus do not require further appraisal activities. In practice,
    however, they often require significant support from E&S Specialists in terms of drafting Terms of
    Reference (TOR) for consultancy purposes or environmental and social assessments and providing
    guidance screening projects through key E&S criteria, and/or providing advice on aspects such as
    community engagement issues, land acquisition monitoring, etc.

    2.5 Transactions that do not require due diligence: CESI Specialists are not typically engaged in the
    special investment instruments listed below. They are automatically categorized in iDesk as follows.

                                involves a change in the type of instrument, e.g.,

                                of the scheduled Loan payments, but does not

    No further CESI action is necessary in these cases, but if so required automated categorization can be
    overridden and a revised category can be assign.

    2.6 Provisional Categorization and Tiering: The RTL (regional projects) and/or Sector Lead (global
    projects), or their designee, shall determine the provisional categorization for the project. The
    categories are defined as follows;
         Category A: Business activities with potential significant adverse environmental or social risks
            and/or impacts that are diverse, irreversible, or unprecedented.
         Category B: Business activities with potential limited adverse environmental or social risks
            and/or impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible, and readily
            addressed through mitigation measures.
         Category C: Business activities with minimal or no adverse environmental or social risks and/or
            impacts.

    Where the use of proceeds of IFC financing and the associated E&S footprint of the business activity are
    known/largely known at the time of the decision to invest, such as in traditional project finance, the RTL
    or SL (or their designee) will determine the business activity’s provisional E&S category based on its
    potential impacts.

    Where the use of proceeds of IFC financing and/or the E&S footprint of the business activity cannot be
    well enough understood/defined, the RTL/SL will determine the E&S category based on risks inherent 1
    to the particular sector, as well as on the likelihood of a development taking place and on what can be
    reasonably ascertained about the environmental and social characteristics of the business activity’s
    likely geographical setting.

    In making a categorization decision CESI shall take into consideration the guidance provided in
    Interpretation Note on Categorization (Rules and Tools: Early Review, Guidance & Sustainability
    Framework, and Interpretation Notes). It is therefore expected that investments in sectors that are of
    inherent high risk and are likely to be located in geographically sensitive areas will be categorized as A.
    Investments in sectors with high inherent risk but where investments are likely to take place in low risk
    context will be categorized as A or B depending on availability of specific information.

    E&S categorization of a prospective corporate investment is informed by the magnitude of potential
    impacts posed by the assets whether existing, under development, or yet to be identified. Where the
    physical assets have yet to be identified, but the sponsor’s business plans and investment strategy
    indicate strong likelihood that high risk projects – i.e., large hydro projects in ecologically sensitive areas,
    greenfield thermal power plants or industrial complexes, transport projects involving sizeable
    resettlement – will be developed or acquired, the project is categorized as A. For entities with planned
    business activities characterized by limited potential E&S risk the project is categorized as B.




    1
     Inherent E&S risk is the E&S risk related to generic aspects of an industrial sector or commercial activity and if known the geographic setting
    excluding management or mitigation measures.

    Where another IFI, such as IBRD, MIGA, ADB, AfDB, EBRD or IADB, is known to be involved in a proposed
    investment, or is preparing to become involved, the RTL or SL will endeavor to ensure consistency of
    provisional E&S categorization.

    The RTL/SL shall also agree with the investment department as to the E&S Tiering classification (Tier I, II,
    or III) in accordance with Guidelines for Early Risk Assessment for Project Tiering (see Rules and Tools -
    Guidance).

    2.7 Processing Category C projects: The LESS analyzes the project scope and its potential E&S risks and
    when those are minimal or none assigns a provisional category C subject to clearance with the SL. The
    LESS has to provide a rationale for assigning a Category C to a project in the SII. Cat C do not require in
    general any subsequent project disclosures, unless there is any major incident that IFC has to inform to
    the public by updating the SII. Given that Cat C project are not subject to regular supervision activities,
    AMR and ESRR calculations are not required. However the LESS should review regular operational
    information provided by the client to the Portfolio Unit (like current investment portfolio for example)
    to identify any potential change in the project risk profile. For further guidance on Category C projects
    please refer to the “Brief Note on Category C projects” in Rules and Tools under Mainstream/Early
    Review/Rules.

    2.8 Concept Review Meeting (CRM), COC/ROC Meeting, and Pre-Appraisal: The RTL or SL (or their
    designee) participates in the CRM and provides input based upon the initial risk and impact
    identification. The CESI participant should be prepared to discuss the provisional categorization and E&S
    tier, the conceptual approach to the E&S scope of review should the project be approved for appraisal,
    and any potentially significant E&S issues. The CESI participant should also endeavor to understand the
    investment process timing to assist in appraisal planning, scheduling and resourcing (ESRP 3).

    If a ROC/COC meeting is called, the CESI participant should brief the CES Manager/Director prior to the
    meeting, and attend the meeting.

    If one of the outcomes agreed at the CRM is to gather further pre-appraisal E&S information before
    engaging in project appraisal, the scope and timing of the visit shall be agreed among the CESI
    participant, relevant RTL/SL/Manager, and the investment department. The RTL and the SL will
    designate the CESI specialist(s) responsible for conducting the pre-appraisal mission.

    On completion of the pre-appraisal mission, the responsible CESI specialist(s) will create a report of the
    mission findings using the IFCDocs format entitled Site Appraisal Visit (SAV)Findings n IFCDocs and to the
    investment department. Refer to Good Practice BTO (Rules and Tools – Early Review, Document
    Formats).

    2.9 Lead E&S Specialist (LESS): If the project is approved for appraisal, the RTL and SL will designate, in
    coordination with the responsible CESI Regional Manager, a LESS and, if necessary, a Support E&S
    Specialist (SESS) for the new project, and notify the investment department team of this decision. The
    LESS is responsible for inputting CES team information in iDesk and for creating an Environmental and

                                                                                Approved: William Bulmer , Director CES




    ESRP 3. DIRECT INVESTMENTS: APPRAISAL

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    This procedure describes the environmental and social (E&S) appraisal process for Direct Investment
    projects up to project preparation for public disclosure. ESRP 4 describes post appraisal activities.

    2. Procedure

    2.1 Appraisal Planning: Based on the understanding of the proposed financing structure, the mix of
    known and unidentified assets involved, and which of these assets IFC’s proceeds are intended to
    finance, the LESS, in consultation with the RTL and SL, as necessary, determines the scope of the E&S
    appraisal process to be undertaken.

    For traditional project finance where the use of proceeds and associated E&S footprint is known and
    defined, the scope of review focuses on information surrounding the project components and the site,
    including any Associated Facilities.

    In corporate finance when the use of proceeds from IFC’s investment, and the associated environmental
    and social footprint are known and largely understood, the appraisal will proceed as it is done for
    traditional project finance and IFC's requirements regarding environmental and social risk management
    will apply to the business activities financed from funds provided by IFC.

    However, in those cases like provision of working capital, equity or an investment in holding companies,
    IFC’s review will take into account the full range of operations undertaken by the entity in which IFC
    plans to invest, including any significant operations undertaken by its subsidiaries and companies for
    which it has management control.

    Depending on the mix of known and unidentified assets, the review involves the investigation of the
    capacity, maturity, and reliability of the client’s E&S corporate management system to effectively
    manage E&S performance, including its ability to enable current and future project compliance with
    IFC’s PSs. When possible the review also considers the E&S performance of a representative set of past
    and prospective identified projects as a measure of management system effectiveness.

    The LESS has to do the planning of appraisal activities required to accomplish adequate data collection,
    analysis, and decision-making. Planning should consider the extent to which some combination of
    document review, meetings and interviews with key stakeholders, and site visits are required. Appraisal
    planning should also consider whether additional E&S review resources are needed beyond those
    provided by the LESS and supporting CESI specialists. In cases where other financial institutions are
    involved in the prospective investment and retain outside consultants to conduct their E&S reviews,
    IFC’s E&S review may want to rely, in part, on the work of these experts to inform our appraisal.

    If needed, the LESS plans and develops an agenda for the Site Appraisal Visit (SAV) in coordination with
    the investment team and client which has adequate time and scope to identify the key risks and impacts
    and client mitigation.


                                                                Page 1 of 7

    Version 7, April 15, 2013
                                                                                      Approved: William Bulmer , Director CES




    Appraisals involving participation of other multilateral investment organizations require significant
    planning and coordination of E&S review and disclosure. If the International Bank for Reconstruction
    and Development (IBRD) and/or Multilateral Investment and Guarantee Agency (MIGA) are involved,
    refer to Environmental and Social Policy and Procedural Guidelines for Projects Financed Jointly by Bank,
    IFC and/or MIGA (see Rules and Tools - Guidance) to coordinate the E&S review. Coordinate with other
    investors, as needed, and determine opportunities to share information and avoid inconsistency and
    where it makes sense, duplication.

    2.2 Conducting the Appraisal: If feasible, the LESS with support and collaboration from the supporting
    E&S Specialist should request and review available information before conducting site visits and
    meetings with project stakeholders.
    In the absence of existing Environmental Assessment (EA) outputs (including generic and strategic
    environmental impact assessments, environmental analyses, and environmental audits), the LESS may
    also assemble a format for collection of data needed for appraisal and submit such format to the client
    to gather project appraisal information. Formats may include an E&S questionnaire.

    Where corporate finance of unidentified future projects is involved, the LESS should request and review
    information surrounding the client’s corporate management system including the following:

         •    Policies and objectives for environmental and social performance.
         •     Procedures for identifying and assessing the environmental and social risks and impacts of each
              project to be developed, acquired, or operated;
         •    E&S Management programs and their mitigation measures ;
         •    Organizational structure with sufficient resources and capacity necessary to implement the E&S
              management programs;
         •    E&S performance monitoring reports and review by management ; and
         •    Processes for ongoing stakeholder engagement including engagement with communities
              affected by individual project developments and operations and on-going disclosure of
              information.

    The LESS can make use of the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (see Rules and Tools – Calculation
    and Estimation Tools) and other available sources of information to identify potential biodiversity issues
    that merit consideration during appraisal,

              2.2.1 Site Appraisal Visit: While there are cases when a site visit is not required for appraisal, for
              example for repeat investments in the same, well-known asset/project or projects with a very
              limited footprint, in most cases new projects require an appraisal mission and an appraisal
              mission report which is to be created and stored in IFCDocs using Site Appraisal Visit (SAV)
              template (available in IFCDocs). The SAV should include project description and the findings of
              different appraisal activities that the LESS considers relevant such as the following:
                  • On-site inspections of:
                       - One or more project locations and/or operating facilities;
                       - Associated facilities, and/or supply chain operations; and
                       - Third-party operations and activities;
                  • Interviews with company and contractors’ staff, representatives of affected communities,
                    key stakeholders, and local authorities;

                                                                Page 2 of 7

                  • Gathering and review of additional information that may be needed to complete E&S
                    appraisal; Close-out meetings with client representatives at its headquarters to discuss
                    key issues, preliminary findings and likely improvement tasks and items that will be
                    included in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) and gaps that will need to be
                    closed prior to ESRS release, Board, commitment and/or disbursement;
                  • When possible a brief description of next steps and timing.

              2.2.2 Multiple appraisal missions: In certain situations, due to the complexity and dispersion of
              assets, multiple appraisal missions may be required. In addition, IFC may not be able to
              complete the appraisal unless the client undertakes additional assessments or studies needed to
              assess any number of issues. In some cases, IFC may direct the client to engage an external
              expert to support, for example, specific EAs of certain significant impacts, such as threats to
              critical habitat, natural resources, or legally protected areas (PS6); indigenous peoples (PS7) or
              unusual cultural heritage issues (PS8); or to conduct an environmental or resettlement audit if
              facilities are existing. If supplemental assessment or external expert studies are required, the
              LESS shall assist the client with developing Terms of Reference and/or suggest potential
              external experts.

    2.3 Identifying PS Gaps, Finalizing Categorization, Peer Review, Completeing Appraisal and Investment
    Review Meetings: Based on the appraisal information, the LESS completes the analysis, with guidance as
    necessary from the SL and/or RTL, identifying:
        • Applicable PSs and the reasons why certain PSs are applicable and why the other PSs are not
            applicable;
        • Any performance gaps associated with each of the applicable PS;
        • The key actions that will be necessary to mitigate the identified gaps;
        • Confirming or modifying, as necessary, the provisional categorization.

    The LESS, with guidance from the SL/RTL, should also verify whether, at this stage in the appraisal
    process, there is sufficient IFC understanding of how project E&S risks and impacts will be managed for
    IFC to proceed to Investment Review and institutional disclosure. The project is not ready for disclosure
    until there is enough information to understand the key risks and impacts and enough information for
    the LESS and other decision makers to feel comfortable that these key risks and impacts are manageable
    and/or acceptable. If the LESS determines that more information is needed from the client or relevant
    third parties before the above can be identified, the LESS should notify the investment team promptly as
    this decision may impact the project timeline. Either the LESS or the Transaction Leader (TRL) will notify
    the client.

              2.3.1 Peer Review Meetings: The need for a Peer Review Meeting (PRM) should be discussed
              with the CESI Manager for the following types of projects:
                 • High-Risk Projects; refer to Key Terms and Acronyms (Rules and Tools - Guidance);
                 • Projects with actual or potentially significant, adverse E&S impacts that are diverse,
                    irreversible, or unprecedented, and that can be only partially addressed through
                    mitigation measures;
                 • Complex projects with E&S issues that are uncommon or have not been encountered
                    before;


                                                                Page 3 of 7

    In addition, Manager CESI may stipulate the need for a PRM of any project.
    Once the CESI Manager agrees that a PRM should be held, the LESS is responsible for producing
    background materials and presentation for review by the Chair and distribution to PRM participants
    according to the timeline noted in the Peer Review Meeting Planning, Execution, and Documentation
    (see Rules and Tools – Peer Review Guidance).

              2.3.2 ICP, BCS & FPIC: For projects where the client must institute an Informed Consultation and
              Participation process, then IFC will make an assessment of the scope and quality of client’s
              engagement with affected communities (see Annex 1). For projects where the client must
              institute a Free, Prior and Informed Consent process then IFC will verify this process. In each of
              these cases, the LESS will plan these processes in consultation with the SL and CESI Manager.
              Ideally the assessment of Broad Community Support should take place before disclosure,
              however because of the complexity of such assessment it happens often after the disclosure
              date (see Annex 5.1 of this document; ESRP 4 Disclosure and Commitment; and the Guidance
              Note on “BCS Determination Pre-Board and Post-Board Supervision of ICP Process” in Rules &
              Tools/Mainstream/Board Review and Approval/Tools).

    When applicable, the LESS will propose to SL and RTL to include the project in the High Risk List. If they
    agree the LESS will create the record as described in ESRP 10 E&S High Risk Projects Listing.
    The LESS can assist the TRL in those cases where GHG emissions need to be calculated or estimated for
    corporate reporting purposes if so required.

    The LESS should participate in the project IRM and be prepared to discuss the key issues of the project.
    Prior to the IRM, the LESS should provide explanatory E&S text and related deliverables for IRM
    documentation. Refer to IRM E and S Considerations Category A and B Examples (See Rules and Tools –
    Guidance).

    2.4 Preparing the ESRS/ESAP and providing SII input: For category A and B projects, the LESS should
    prepare a draft ESRS summarizing IFC’s E&S appraisal findings. No ESRS is required for category C
    projects. The ESRS should present a succinct summary of the review and assessment of the E&S impacts
    associated with the project and how they are or will be mitigated by the project. Refer to ESRS
    Template with Guidelines (see Rules and Tools – Document Formats) and Formatting Guidelines for
    Disclosure Documents (see Rules and Tools - Guidance).

    Where appropriate, the LESS should also prepare a draft ESAP (See Rules and Tools, CES Apps; or
    Appraisal/Appraisal Guidance/Action Plan Guidance Note,). Note that only actions requiring completion
    after Board approval, commitment, or first disbursement should be included in the ESAP.

    2.5 Actions requiring completion before Board approval, Commitment or First Disbursement: in many
    cases the appraisal identifies client actions that are needed to close some defined E&S gaps before
    investment milestones such as Board Approval, commitment or first disbursement. These actions are to
    be agreed with the investment team and the client in advance and documented elsewhere such as in a
    covenant in the loan agreement, in a side letter, in a share retention agreement, etc. (See Rules and
    Tools - Appraisal/Tools/Action Plan Guidance).

    The LESS follows up and ensures that such actions are completed, documents this fact (in the Action
    Plan Tracker) and keeps the CESI Manager informed if an investment milestone is reached without gaps
    being closed.

    To facilitate supervision of the client’s progress in implementing the Action Plan, the approved ESAP
    should be created in the Action Plan Tracker (Refer to Rules and Tools, Appraisal, Action Plan Guidance
    Note).

    The LESS should provide the draft ESRS and ESAP to the SL and the RTL for review and comment. For
    category A projects, the ESRS and ESAP should also be reviewed by the CESI Manager. Once the SL and
    CESI Manager, as appropriate, approve the draft ESRS/ESAP, the LESS shall discuss these documents
    with the investment team with particular focus on the proposed conditions of investment articulated in
    the ESAP. After review and discussion with the investment team, the ESRS/ESAP should be sent to the
    client for review and approval. The client disclosure letter should also confirm that the PSs and
    applicable general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines have been sent to the client and client E&S staff
    (see suggested letter format in Rules & Tools, Public Disclosure/Tools/Document Formats). The LESS in
    consultation with the SL as appropriate will analyze and decide which client documents will be disclosed
    in addition to the ESRS and the ESAP.

    For all projects, the LESS should prepare the E&S text to be inserted into the Summary Investment
    Information (SII). In all cases, E&S text should indicate the categorization rationale and the key E&S
    issues which will need to be managed by the client. Refer to Sample SII Template with Guidelines (see
    Rules and Tools – Document Formats).

    2.6 ESRD and ESRR (a) record: The LESS will complete the ESRD and calculate the ESRR(A) score based
    on collection and analysis of project due diligence information and record it. The ESRR(A) score is a
    snapshot of the client’s E&S performance at appraisal and prior to any improvements made as condition
    of IFC’s investment.

4   DIRECT INVESTMENTS: DISCLOSURE AND
    COMMITMENT
                                                                                     Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES


    Version 7, April 15, 2013




    ESRP 4. DIRECT INVESTMENTS: DISCLOSURE AND COMMITMENT

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    This procedure describes the E&S requirements of public disclosure of proposed investment information
    in IFC’s 2012 Access to Information Policy (AIP) up to the signing of the Investment Contract
    (Commitment). IFC disclosure of key E&S information is implemented by posting documentation on the
    public-access IFC’s Disclosure website.

    2. Procedure

    2.1 CES Approval for Disclosure: All E&S disclosure documents prepared by IFC shall be reviewed and
    cleared as drafts by the Sector Lead before the drafts are discussed with the Sponsor. For Category B
    projects the LESS shall discuss and agree with the Sector Lead any material revisions suggested by the
    Sponsor before starting the disclosure workflow. For Category A projects, disclosure documents shall be
    agreed with the CESI Manager, following Sector Lead review and before discussion with the Sponsor and
    following Sponsor review, before starting disclosure workflow. Rationale for early disclosure shall be
    agreed by the LESS, Sector Lead and CESI Manager before disclosure.

    2.2 Early Disclosure: For projects or investments with potential significant adverse environmental or
    social risks and/or impacts, disclosure of the ESIA should occur early in the environmental and social due
    diligence process where possible. For some of these projects IFC provides early access to the client’s
    draft ESIA document(s), so as to enhance transparency of the proposed project (see Rules and Tools –
    Public Disclosure Tools, Early Disclosure Guidance) before IFC has completed, or in some cases even
    started the appraisal. Whenever possible early disclosure of Category A projects takes place 120 days
    before Board to allow all IFC’s shareholders to vote.

    2.3 ESRS, ESAP &SII Approval Letter: The LESS is responsible for preparation of the approval letter for
    disclosure of the ESRS, ESAP and the SII to be signed by the client (see Rules and Tools – Document
    Formats). Once agreement is reached on the ESRS and ESAP, the client will complete the ESRS, ESAP &SII
    Approval Letter and return the letter signed to IFC. Upon receipt of the Disclosure Release letter, the
    LESS shall ensure that this approval letter is stored in IFCDocs (Public Disclosure Folder). All Tasks (Items)
    in the ESAP uploaded in the Action Plan Tracker must be Submitted (approved) before they are
    published.

    2.4 ESRS and ESAP Disclosure: The LESS shall start the IFCDocs workflow to publish the ESRS and ESAP.
    The LESS then claims the workflow and clears it to the SL for his/her clearance. For a Category A project
    or Category B with BCS requirements), after SL clearance, the workflow proceed to Manager CESI, for
    his/her clearance, and where BCS is documented to Director CES for clearance of the BCS memo. A
    Category B project ESRS / ESAP will be cleared directly by the SL to CRU.When all CES approvals are
    complete in the IFCDocs workflow, disclosure documents will be forwarded to Corporate Relations.
    Corporate Relations will then disclose the ESRS, the Action Plan and the SII (when the Transaction
    Leader (TRL) has approved it in the workflow) on IFC’s Web site. Refer to Disclosure Portal (SII, ESRS, and
    ESAP) (see Rules and Tools - Guidance). The LESS will provide to Corporate Relations Unit (CRU) the links

                                                                 Page 1 of 6

4   DIRECT INVESTMENTS: DISCLOSURE AND
    COMMITMENT
                                                                                 Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES

    and attachments to relevant client project Environmental Assessment (EA) information that are
    referenced in the ESRS for disclosure on IFC’s website.

    2.5 Disclosure Coordination IBRD and MIGA: disclosure coordination with International Bank for
    Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Multilateral Investment and Guarantee Agency (MIGA): If,
    IBRD and MIGA are involved in the project, ensure coordination of disclosure requirements. Refer to
    Environmental and Social Policy and Procedural Guidelines for Projects Financed Jointly by Bank; IFC
    and/or MIGA, January 2009 (see Rules and Tools - Guidance). If other multilateral investors are involved
    endeavor to coordinate the timing of the institutional disclosures.

    2.6 Disclosure Duration and Public Interest: The SII, ESRS, ESAP, and supporting documents must be
    disclosed in the IFC website prior to IFC’s Board of Directors/Management consideration of the
    investment as follows:
        • Sixty (60) days for Category A projects; and
        • Thirty (30) days for Category B and C projects.

    2.7 Delayed Public Disclosure: In some limited circumstances where the minimum time period cannot
    be met (as described in AIP paragraph 14), the relevant investment department director may delay the
    public release of the entire SII, ESRS and ESAP (“Option 1”) or of certain client identifying information
    within the disclosure documents (“Option 2”). Option 2 is sometimes described as “Anonymous
    Disclosure.” In the case of Option 1, E&S document disclosure workflow proceeds as described at 2.5
    above, except that the Project Lawyer will enter the workflow, and CRU will not disclose until receipt of
    notification from the project team. An Option 2 disclosure proceeds as at 2.5, involving the project
    lawyer, but with withheld information marked “Pending” in the disclosure documents. The Access to
    Information Policy requires notification and details of and reasons for the delayed disclosure to be made
    in the Board Paper.
    For Category A projects where the public release of the SII and E&S documentation is to occur after IFC’s
    Board approves the investment, draft copies of the client approved ESRS and ESAP will be provided to
    the Board on a confidential basis prior to the Board’s consideration of the investment. The documents
    should be appropriately watermarked as “confidential - not to be distributed”.

    2.8 Public Interest and Comments during Disclosure: Environmental and social inquiries or comments
    raised during the IFC disclosure period should be addressed in accordance with Environmental and
    Social Review Procedures (ESRP) 5: Managing Non-Routine Events in Investment Projects (Rules and
    Tools - Rules).

    2.9 Restarting Public Disclosure: Restarting the time period of public disclosure may be necessary under
    certain circumstances and the LESS is responsible for recognizing the need and for advising the TRL on
    restarting the public disclosure duration prior to Board. Where new relevant project information that
    could substantially change (i) the adverse risks or impacts described in the ESRS or (ii) the mitigation
    measures described in the ESAP is received after release of disclosure documents but before Board
    approval, the disclosure duration (30 or 60 days) must be restarted in accordance with the Section IIB of
    the AIP (see Rules and Tools – Sustainability Framework).

                                                                                   Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES

    2.10 Supplemental appraisal activities: Even though the appraisal is in most cases completed by the
    disclosure date, in some projects aspects of the due diligence process may continue after that date. If
    the LESS is confident that there is enough information to understand the risks and enough information
    for the LESS and for other decision makers to feel comfortable that these risks are manageable and/or
    acceptable the disclosure can proceed while some supplemental appraisal activities continue during the
    disclosure period and before Board approval. Supplemental information (for example framework
    management plans, client’s specific policy documents, monitoring plans, etc) may be reviewed by IFC
    during the disclosure period. Projects where IFC will conduct a process to determine if Broad
    Community Support exists may require engagement with local communities close to the Board date as
    BCS is a point in time that helps to inform decision making.

    2.11 Addressing Transboundary Issues: The Board representatives (Executive Directors) of countries
    potentially affected by transboundary effects of proposed project must be notified so they are aware
    that the proposed project has the potential for causing adverse effects through air pollution or
    deprivation of water from, or pollution of international waterways (see E&S Sustainability Policy, ¶18 –
    Rules and Tools – Sustainability Framework). Where transboundary conditions are present or
    anticipated, the LESS shall inform the Manager CESI, and ensure notification prior to the Board decision
    to the members of IFC’s Board of Directors representing countries that are potentially impacted by the
    transboundary E&S issue.

    2.12 Determination of ICP, FPIC, and BCS: In cases where clients are required to engage in a process of
    Informed Consultation and Participation (ICP), IFC determines whether there is Broad Community
    Support (BCS) for the business activity by Affected Communities. Broad Community Support is a
    collection of expressions by Affected Communities, through individuals or their recognized
    representatives, in support of the proposed business activity. There may be BCS even if some individuals
    or groups object to the business activity. The LESS will verify that the client has implemented an ICP
    process. Where assets are known, and the project development timing permits, IFC will disclose a
    summary of how it made its BCS determination with the ESRS. Where a BCS summary is not available
    prior to Board approval, the ESRS will be updated with this summary when available. Note that IFC will
    not routinely update ESRSs to summarise BCS in transactions that are corporate in nature with multiple
    sub-projects (for additional guidance please check the Guidance Note on “BCS Determination Pre-Board
    and Post-Board Supervision of ICP Process” in Rules & Tools/Mainstream/Board Review and
    Approval/Tools). The Manager CESI should be consulted, and the Director CES should be provided with
    the outcome of the BCS review. Where BCS is confirmed, the Director CES must clear the outcome. The
    FPIC/BCS process is summarized in the document entitled Review of Evidence of FPIC and BCS (see Rules
    and Tools – Appraisal Guidance) and then a FPIC/BCS approval memorandum is prepared by the LESS,
    and approved in writing by CES Director. This memorandum will be uploaded in iDesk.
    After Board approval of the business activity, IFC continues to monitor the client’s ICP process as part of
    its portfolio supervision.
    FPIC builds on and expands the process of ICP and will be established through good faith negotiation
    between the client and the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples. For additional guidance, refer
    to Rules and Tools/Appraisal for Mainstream Projects/ICP, BCS and FPIC Assessment and Approval

    2.13 Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) scope and content: The LESS is responsible for preparing and
    proposing reporting formats to the client to help IFC’s understanding of project E&S performance,
    compliance with ESAP, compliance with the applicable PS and general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines
    during the supervision phase. The AMR includes specific mandatory sections, ESAP Status, and any
    additional information that may be needed to evaluate client’s performance. Refer to AMR Generation
    Tools (see Rules and Tools).
    The AMR scope and content and its required reporting frequency must be discussed and agreed with the
    client and with the Core Team Lawyer to ensure incorporation of requirements into the Investment
    Contract. Where feasible, IFC’s reporting requirements should take advantage of any other reporting by
    the client.
    To support this requirement, the LESS shall:
        • Prepare AMR reporting formats to ensure early on that the client is fully informed of the of data
            collection requirements necessary to support thorough and timely reporting; including ESAP
            Status reporting formats using the Action Plan Tracker Reports function and then transmit them
            to the iDesk Core Team leader for incorporation into the Investment Contract (generic term
            referring to Investment, Subscription, Participation, and other Agreements);
        • Ensure that the Investment Contract mandates IFC client preparation and transmittal of AMR and
            clearly defines the frequency; and
        • Ensure that the Investment Contract stipulates that the AMR may be changed by the client or by
            IFC with mutual agreement because of changed project circumstances or to enhance the content,
            clarity of E&S sustainability information reported to IFC.

    2.14 Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) Input: The LESS will provide the investment
    department with selected DOTS E&S indicators for entry in the DOTS system under the Monitorable
    Impact Section. See Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) and Development Effectiveness at
    IFC (Rules and Tools -Guidance). The LESS should also review any commentary in the Board Paper on
    E&S Risks and Impacts, Additionality and Developmental Outcome. Where the project team proposes or
    the project is required to report against mandatory Development Outcome indicators, then the LESS
    should calculate baseline and target values for these and advise the investment team.

    2.15 E&S Section of Board Paper: The Board Paper is a document prepared by the investment
    department for IFC’s Board of Directors. Board Papers relating to specific investment projects are not
    publically disclosed, because they contain confidential client information. The E&S section of the Board
    Paper should:

       •     Describe significant risks and impacts and mitigations as well as anticipated key development
             outcomes of the project. Refer to Board Paper Environmental and Social Input (Rules and Tools -
             Guidance);
       •     Include E&S additionality language where warranted. Refer to Guidance on Environmental,
             Health and Safety Additionality for Board Papers (see Rules and Tools - Guidance);
       •     Include the outcome of the status of BCS/FPIC verification for cases where BCS/FPIC is required
             and can be conducted at that time. Refer to Review of Evidence of FPIC and BCS (see Rules and
             Tools - Guidance); and


                                                                 Page 4 of 6

                                                                               Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES


    Version 7, April 15, 2013




    When BCS is required but the project is not defined enough to conduct the process pre-Board, the Board
    paper should describe this situation and discuss how future supervision will review the clients ICP
    process and the level of support that the project enjoys from the community. For corporate and equity
    projects, it is not intended that IFC will conduct BCS on all future activities but on those that were
    described in the Board paper as being key to IFC supporting the transaction.
    The LESS will seek clearance of the E&S language for the Board Paper by the SL. The LESS provides
    support, as necessary, to the project team for project presentations and briefings to the Board.

    2.16 E&S Input to Investment Contract and Core Team Lawyer Liaison: The LESS will continue the
    liaison with the iDesk Core Team Lawyer, review current iterations of the Investment Contract, and
    continue to provide E&S input for the drafting of legal agreements as needed. For those investments
    where non-standard E&S clauses are required the LESS will consult with the SL.
    For investments in market instruments and publically traded equity investments, where limited IFC
    influence or access to information exists because IFC cannot be a preferential shareholder, the LESS
    should seek alternative means of monitoring the investment such as through Corporate Sustainability or
    Social Responsibility Reports, etc. to monitor if the Company’s Environmental Management System is
    consistent with IFC’s PSs.

    3. Responsibilities

    ESRP 5. MANAGING NON-ROUTINE EVENTS IN INVESTMENT PROJECTS

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    Approved actions for addressing non-routine events during IFC’s investment cycle for CESI Specialists are
    described in this procedure.

    2. Procedure

    2.1 Compliance Advisor Ombudsman Involvement: During any phase of a project, a complaint may be
    filed on alleged E&S issues with and accepted by the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman
    (CAO). The CAO communicates such complaints to the Investment Director responsible for the project.
    When the Lead Environmental or Social Specialist (LESS) is made aware of such complaints he/she will
    inform the following IFC staff of the CAO complaint:

          •   The CES Communications Officer
          •   The CESI Sector Leads (SL) and Regional Team Leaders (RTLs);
          •   The Manager CESI; and
          •   The CES Director.

    CESI interface is related to two CAO activities:
         • CAO Ombudsman reviews complaints of stakeholders affected by IFC projects and works with
            stakeholders and IFC clients to help resolve grievances; and
         • CAO Compliance conducts audits of performance of IFC to ensure compliance with policies,
            guidelines, procedures and systems.

    The LESS shall provide support to the Investment Director and proxies in their efforts to develop a
    response and an interface plan with CAO. This will include the following steps:

          • Cooperate with Investment Department protocol for communication amongst the client,
            investment staff, CESI staff, and the CAO;
          • Provide background E&S information to Investment Department staff assigned responsibility for
            CAO interface and response;
          • Support CESI Sector Lead (SL), and Manager CESI review and input to the Investment
            Department’s response to the CAO. This response will be cleared by Director CES.
          • Keep CES Director, CESI Manager and Regional Team Leader (RTL) abreast of the progress made
            by CAO engagement and on the client responses to the complainants.
          • Add the project to or update the CES High Risk List project record, upload all related documents
            to IFCDocs, and update the Environmental and Social Risk Rating (ESRR) score if needed.

    2.2 Notification of Serious Incidents: If the LESS is informed of any project related serious incidents
    including fatalities the LESS will immediately inform the following:
         • The Investment Department Portfolio Officer;
         • The CES Communications Officer

                                                                 Page 1 of 3

    Version 7,April 15, 2013



          • CESI SL and RTL;
          • The Manager CESI; and
          • The CES Director

    The LESS should obtain information on the incident and learn about the corrective actions taken or
    planned to mitigate the consequences and manage risks. If needed, the LESS will request the client to
    investigate root causes for the incident, and prepare conclusions resulting from the investigation. In
    some cases the Action Plan tracker will be updated to include the key actions to be implemented to
    prevent recurrence along with a timeline. If the LESS determines that a supplemental supervision
    mission is warranted they will discuss this with the SL and CESI Manager.

    The LESS will record the incident in the ESRD, update the ESRR score if applicable, and record this new
    score and date in IFCDocs.

    2.3 Media Coverage, Non-Governmental Organization, or other External Complaint or Inquiry: If there
    is a media, non-governmental organization, or other external entity interest or a complaint on E&S
    grounds (e.g., media reports, early protests regarding a potential IFC investment, allegations of
    substandard E&S performance) related to prospective, actual, or past IFC clients, the LESS shall not
    respond to any personal, e-mail, fax, telephone, or other inquiry. The LESS shall rely upon IFC resources
    assigned this responsibility and immediately inform the following staff members:
         • The CES Communications Officer
         • CESI SL and RTL;
         • The Manager CESI; and
         • The CES Director.

    The project team Communications Officer and/or the CES Communications Officer and the Investment
    Department Communications Officer will take the lead for all subsequent communications and follow-
    on actions. The LESS will provide support to the lead Communications Officer. Upon request, IFC’s
    Communications Staff would assist the client in communicating with the media, non-governmental
    organizations, or complainants.

    The LESS will update the CES High Risk List records, revise the ESRR with new information if required,
    and upload available documents to IFCDocs.

    2.4 Exceptional Circumstances: The AIP (para 12 & 13) describes IFC’s prerogative to disclose
    information in the public interest in the event that information provided by the client or other sources
    indicates that the disclosure of non-public information would be likely to avert imminent and serious
    harm to public health or safety, and/or imminent and significant adverse impacts to the environment. In
    this case, the LESS shall immediately inform the following staff members:
          • CESI SL and RTL;
          • The Manager CESI;
          • CESI Director; and
          • The Investment Department TRL and Portfolio Officer.

    Version 7, April 15, 2013
                                                                                  Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES




    ESRP 6. DIRECT INVESTMENTS: SUPERVISION

    1. Purpose and Applicability

    This procedure describes the environmental and social (E&S) review process during the supervision
    stage of the IFC project cycle for Direct Investment projects. E&S supervision obligations are applicable
    during the period from Commitment until the IFC investment project is closed.
    The purpose of supervision is to obtain information to assess the status of project’s compliance with the
    PS and other specific E&S requirements agreed at commitment; to assess the current level of E&S risk;
    to provide advice to clients on how to address critical E&S issues; and to identify opportunities for
    improvement and good practices that could be applied to similar projects.

    2. Procedure

    2.1 Supervision Responsibilities: Effective E&S supervision entails periodic review of the client’s E&S
    compliance with the requirements of the IFC investment contract. Review activities include:

         •    Review Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs);
         •    Undertake Supervision Site Visits (SSVs) – refer to section 2.6;
         •    Review all other project-related information that may become available including conducting
              periodic internet search’s on the project; and define any changed project circumstances that
              were not anticipated in appraisal and that could or do result in adverse E&S risks and/or
              impacts;
         •    Establish client’s degree of compliance with all investment conditions such as covenants,
              Conditions of Disbursement (CODs) prior to all disbursements, side letters, ESAP
              implementation, etc; Refer to ESAP Status Report Example Format (see Rules and Tools -
              Document Formats);

         •    Identify good E&S practices to promote their replication in other projects in the portfolio;
         •     Identify poorly performing projects and where the client fails to comply with its E&S
              commitments.
         •    Advice the client on how to manage E&S project issues.
         •    Clearly communicate risks and probable consequences of client compliance failures with the
              E&S requirements and initiate remedies if the client fails to reestablish compliance.

    2.2 Conditions of Disbursement Review: Conditions of Disbursement (COD) may include specific
    investment contract E&S clauses and/or refer to an enclosed ESAP. After the legal agreements are
    executed and while disbursement(s) are pending, the LESS shall obtain compliance data from the project
    to assess fulfillment of E&S COD obligations. If all relevant E&S CODs and ESAP tasks have been
    completed, the LESS shall amend the ESAP Tracker record, upload the records to iDocs, and inform the
    TRL/Portfolio Officer of CESI clearance for the disbursement.
    If there are incomplete E&S CODs and/or ESAP tasks at the time of disbursement, the LESS shall inform
    the TRL/Portfolio Officer. If the TRL/Portfolio Officer proposes to waive the COD, and if the LESS is
    supportive of the waiver, the LESS should document the justification for the waiver and send it to the
    CESI RTL and Manager CESI. Waivers of E&S CODs and ESAP task completion dates and/or approval of
                                                                 Page 1 of 11

    replacement or modified CODs or ESAP task completion dates must be approved in writing by the
    Manager CESI and documented in IFCDocs and the ESAP Tracker. If the Manager CESI does not approve
    a proposed waiver or a replacement or modified COD, the LESS will inform the TRL/Portfolio Officer that
    CESI will not support disbursement until the COD is met.

    2.3 AMR Review: The AMR, including a status report for ESAP tasks, is the client’s primary
    communication channel for reporting E&S performance to IFC.
    The Investment Department Portfolio Assistant is primarily responsible for logging AMR documents into
    iDesk. If clients send AMRs directly to the LESS, should send the AMR to the relevant Investment
    Department Portfolio Assistant for compliance tracking log-in. When the AMR is received in CESI, the
    CESI Team Administrative Client Support (ACS) is responsible for logging the document into the CESI
    section of the iDesk timeline, preparing the AMR Review Cover Sheet (see Rules and Tools - Document
    Formats) that provides instructions for the reviewing specialist, and sending the AMR to the reviewing
    specialist. AMRs sent directly from the client to the CESI Specialist, in HQ should be given to the CESI
    Team ACS and when in field offices to the ACS of the Portfolio Unit of the Investment Department.

    Before reviewing the AMR, the CESI Specialist should read and understand IFC’s project specific E&S
    requirements developed during appraisal including the ESAP. Review of the client’s submittal should
    focus on material compliance with these requirements. E&S requirements are also captured in the
    Negative and Affirmative Covenants and Reports sections of Investment Contracts.

    The review should carefully consider:
          • The project’s performance compared to the requirements of Safeguard Policies, IFC’s PSs 2006
             or 2012 PSs as applicable; applicable requirements of general and sector-specific EHS
             Guidelines, environmental assessment-proposed mitigation and management plans;
          • The project’s performance compared to the requirements of the ESAP;
          • The implementation degree and effectiveness of the project’s Environmental and Social
             Management System;
          • Conclusions and completion status of remedial actions from previous AMR reviews; SSVs; and
             associated Supervision Environmental and Social Risk Rating (ESRR(S)) ;
          • The effectiveness of the client’s grievance mechanism and community engagement;
          • When applicable the post-board implementation of ICP process (for further guidance see “BCS
             Determination Pre and Post Board of ICP Process” in Rules & Tools /Mainstream / Supervision/
             Tools/ Project Supervision/ Supervision Guidance and Tools)Reported serious incidents in
             accordance with Environmental and Social Review Procedure (ESRP) 5: Managing Non-Routine
             Events in Investment Projects (see Rules and Tools - Rules); and
          • All other project-specific E&S reporting requirements defined in the Investment Agreement,
             side letters or other places.

               2.3.1 Report AMR Review Conclusions: Using the AMR Review document (see Rules and Tools -
              Document Formats) the LESS shall prepare a written record of the AMR review. The review
              shall:
                   • Consider carefully the resolution status of issues of noncompliance with PSs and general
                      and sector-specific EHS Guidelines highlighted during the appraisal or previous
                      supervision activities;
                   • Provide an analysis and interpretation of the meaning of the information;
                                                                 Page 2 of 11

                    •     Clearly communicate to the TRL and client the conclusions reached from information
                          review, defining the gravity of E&S risk and impacts; and
                    •     Communicate specific mandatory follow-up actions and reporting needs.

              The LESS shall calculate an updated ESRR(S) (see section on “Calculate ESRR”). When the ESRR(S)
              is A/B-3, Partly Unsatisfactory, or A/B-4, Unsatisfactory, the AMR review distribution shall
              include the Investment Department Portfolio Manager and Manager CESI.

              If a single AMR covers multiple IFC project numbers, the LESS shall record this fact in the AMR
              review. The LESS will also ensure all actions on the AMR Review Cover Sheet are completed,
              and sign and return to the CESI Team ACS along with the AMR review and ESRR(S) scoresheet.

              Updated CRR E&S language is recorded through creation and editing of example text in IFCDocs-
              created Recordable Supervision Activity (RSA) formats. These include AMR Review, SSV Findings
              (former BTO), CES Client Meeting & Information Review, or AMR Review and SSV Findings
              Combined. The most current ESRR(S) score and date are automatically uploaded to the CRR.

              2.3.2 AMR Waiver: Waiver of IFC investment contract-mandated E&S Annual Monitoring
              Reports (AMR) submission is exclusively for extraordinary circumstances. For example, if
              construction is delayed and the proposed facility has not yet been built; if operations have
              ceased due to catastrophes such as earthquakes, explosions and the like; and/or other reasons
              for temporary halt of operations for which there are no operations or data to report. Waivers
              are granted for limited periods only (e.g. one year).
              The document entitled Petition for Waiver of E&S Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) should be
              used to request Manager CESI approval of AMR Waivers (See Rules and Tools, Mainstream
              Supervision, Tools, Document formats).

    2.4 Special reporting requirements: in those circumstances when specific aspects of the project rise
    significant E&S concerns IFC may request supplemental project information in addition to the AMR and
    on a quarterly or even monthly basis depending on the nature of the issue and its potential E&S
    consequences. These special reports will allow IFC to monitor more closely those specific aspects. In
    these cases additional supervision site visits may be required too.

    2.5 Recordable Supervision Activity , Supervised Projects, and Supervision Site Visits Plan:

              2.5.1 Recordable Supervision Activity (RSA): Is defined as any E&S specialist activity that results
              in an assessment of a portfolio project’s E&S performance (e.g. obtaining and reviewing an
              AMR; conducting a Supervision Site Visit; or participating in a client meeting, stakeholder
              meeting or conference call) and an updated ESRR score. Written records of RSA activities are to
              be saved in IFCDocs using the relevant supervision template.

              2.5.2 Client Meeting/Teleconference/Supplemental project information: could be alternative
              supervision resources but they become RSA only if enough information is obtained to update
              the client ESRR score. In such cases this supervision activity shall be recorded using the template
              “Client Meeting/Information Review Summary” available in IFCDocs. If the information received


                                                                 Page 3 of 11

              IFCDocs if warranted.

              2.5.3 Supervised Project: Is defined as a project for which the ESRR score, CRR language and
              DOTS E&S ratings and indicators have been updated as a result of a Recordable Supervision
              Activity. All active Category A and B investment projects should be supervised at least once a
              year.

              2.5.4 Supervision Site Visits (SSV) Plan: CESI RTLs are responsible for proposing a list of projects
              to be supervised every year at the beginning of the fiscal year (FY) using Portfolio Considerations
              below. RTLs will finalize the list of targeted projects for the FY following discussion with the
              respective CESI Specialists, Industry Departments and CES Quality Assurance team and obtain
              Manager CESI approval for the final SSV Plan. The Plan will constitute the annual target of
              supervision site visits for that region and will be tracked on a regular basis.

                    Selection of projects for SSVs shall consider the following selection criteria.

                Justification for removal of projects from the draft SSV Plan may include the following:

                • Adequate Supervision Information is available from other sources - e.g. independent E&S
                monitoring reports, assessment reports from other lenders, etc.;
                • Financial Restructuring underway;
                • Constrained Engagement Projects: projects for which prospects of a resolution of issues
                with IFC are very low; and, where IFC leverage is limited;
                • Excellent Sponsor E&S Capacity and Performance - RSA history confirms this; SSV would

                add no value (exclusively applicable to Portfolio Consideration 3 All Other Projects);
                • Other compelling factors discussed and agreed between the LESS and the RTL.


          Other factors may dictate SSV frequency, including major E&S incident(s), non-governmental
          organization (NGO) complaints, Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman Office investigations, an
          Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR), or an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) visit. Refer
          to ESRP 5: Managing Non-Routine Events in Investment Projects. If an SSV is proposed because of a
          circumstance described in ESRP 5, the LESS shall ensure consensus for mission travel among the
          RTL, TRL or Portfolio Officer, and Manager CESI.

       2.6 Preparation for Supervision Site Visits: The LESS shall prepare for and plan the SSV by reviewing
       previous RSA records, appraisal-generated documents, including BTO reports, the Environmental and
       Social Review Summary (ESRS), the ESRD and ESAP. Additionally, the LESS shall review the client’s
       performance considering the requirements of the PSs, general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines,
       any environmental assessment mitigation and/or management plans and the criteria described for
       AMR reviews in Section 2.3 above. The LESS should ensure that the TRL or Portfolio Manager advises
       the client in advance of the proposed SSV, the purpose for the SSV, and recommended preparations.
       The SSV should include interview and discussion with the client and other representatives, document
       review, and physical inspection of selected facilities and/or activities.

       Some IFC investments originally had a debt and an equity investment. Where the debt component is
       closed the E&S investment debt obligations are no longer applicable; however, if the company is not
       publically listed there may be E&S requirements tied to the equity investment. If the company is
       publically listed (refer to ESRP 4, 2.14) there may not be specific E&S requirements. In this case, the
       LESS should monitor the level of E&S risk posed for IFC. Ideally periodic reviews should be included in
       the Site Supervision Plan or other supervision formats whereby RSA should be used to evaluate
       project performance considering IFC’s at-Commitment E&S requirements (if any) and the applicable
       PSs.

       Circumstances permitting, after completing the SSV, the LESS or their designee should have a close
       out meeting with the client including presentation of findings, conclusions, and recommendations for
       corrective actions. If ESAP items need to be altered or new ones added, the LESS should try to secure
       agreement with the client at this time.

       2.7 Documenting the Supervision Site Visit: The LESS shall document the SSV, along with key
       observations and interpretations, findings, and conclusions, through completion of an SSV Findings
       (former BTO) or AMR Review and SSV Findings Combined format document created in IFCDocs (Rules
       and Tools - Document Formats). Using the Sponsor Follow-up section of the relevant template, the
       LESS will highlight any material E&S compliance gaps for the client’s attention. Once the document is
       completed, it must be filed in the Environmental Plans and Documents Folder of IFCDocs. CESI
       Specialists are responsible for distributing these reports, which contain the CRR E&S language, to the
       RTL and the Portfolio Officer along with the updated ESRR(S). The LESS shall upload all other relevant
       E&S documents provided by the client to IFCDocs and will update the project’s DOTS record. Refer to
       Development Effectiveness at IFC (see Rules and Tools - Guidance).


                                                                 Page 5 of 11

       2.8 Independent supervision activities: When several lenders are financing large and/or complex
       projects they often agree on hiring E&S consultants to conduct independent supervision activities on
       their behalf. These consultants regularly visit the project in order to supervise the project’s E&S
       performance and the progress on implementing the ESAP and they report back to the lenders.
       Thereafter, lenders follow up on any outstanding issues with the client as necessary. The LESS can
       rely on this source of supervision information to fulfill his responsibilities in terms of completing IFC’s
       records and databases (e.g. ESRD, ESAP Tracker, ESRS(S), CES HRL, IFCDocs supervision records, etc).

        2.9 Waiving Supervision Site Visits: It may not be feasible to conduct an SSV for projects selected in
       accordance with Portfolio Considerations in the FY Supervision Site Visits (SSV), Recordable
       Supervision Activity (RSA) Selection Criteria table above. In the case of projects listed in the
       Knowledge Gap, cancelling a planned supervision site visit requires the Manager CESI to be advised
       why supervision is not feasible using the Waiver of Environmental and Social Supervision and
       Removal from Knowledge Gap and Supervision Lists petition format (refer to Annex 7 and Rules and
       Tools - Document Formats). Supervision visits to projects that are not listed in the Knowledge Gap
       can be cancelled without a formal waiver but in order to reach the site supervision target they should
       be replaced with an alternative project supervision site visit.

             2.9.1 Justifications for Waiving SSVs May Include:
            • In the case of a dispute considered temporary and resolvable by the TRL/Portfolio Manager,
               the project supervision may be considered for postponement;
            • In the case of a dispute considered permanent or irresolvable, an SSV may be postponed,
               suspended, or terminated; and
            • Staff security and safety considerations.

                2.9.2 Management Approval for SSV Waivers:
            •     The LESS will complete a Waiver of Environmental and Social Supervision and Removal from
                  Knowledge Gap and Supervision Lists petition format (see Annex 7 and Rules and Tools -
                  Document Formats) describing the reason for the proposed supervision waiver;
            •     Obtain signature approval from the Manager CESI;
            •     Upload signed waiver to iDocs;
            •     Transmit approved waiver to Quality Assurance and to TRL;
            •     Quality Assurance will remove the project from current Fiscal Year Supervision Plan.

    2.10 Update Status of ESAP Tasks in the Action Plan Tracker: The 2012 AIP mandates update of the
    implementation status (e.g. % Complete, Completed, Rescheduled, Cancelled, etc.) of the publicly
    disclosed ESAP once the project is in IFC’s portfolio for projects that were Board approved after January
    1, 2012.
    The Action Plan Tracker maintains detailed information about ESAP Items status. When the status of all
    Items (Tasks) in the ESAP has been updated and Submitted, the information may then be published to
    the IFC Disclosure Website. The LESS selects the Supervision Disclosure option. The system then
    provides an illustration of the information that will be transmitted to the IFC Disclosure Website.

    2.11 Unfulfilled Action Plan: If the client fails to comply with its E&S commitments expressed in the
    ESAP or legal agreements with IFC, the LESS shall work with the client to bring it back into compliance to
    the extent feasible and, if the client continues to fail to achieve compliance, shall recommend
                                                                 Page 6 of 11

    appropriate remedies for CESI Manager and Investment Department consideration. The project may be
    listed in the CES High Risk List because of the failure to implement the ESAP.

    2.12 ESIA and Third Party Monitoring Post-Board Disclosure: except for those projects with minimal or
    no E&S risk and/or impacts, the LESS will update the content of project disclosed relevant E&S
    information as it becomes available through the life of the investment. In particular, disclosing the status
    of the implementation of the ESAP and any additional ESIA or third-party monitoring reports as
    applicable (in accordance with the Access to Information Policy Please refer to “ESIA and Third-Party
    Monitoring Post Board Disclosure” for guidance on the definition of ESIA and third party monitoring
    reports and which should be disclosed ( filed in Rules & Tools/Mainstream/Supervision/ Tools/ Project
    Supervision/ Supervision Guidance and Tools).
    IFC also encourages clients to make publicly available periodic reports on their environment and social
    sustainability performance.

    2.13 Calculate ESRR(S): The supervision process requires the calculation of a project’s ESRR(S), which IFC
    uses as a short-hand measure of project E&S risk. The LESS is responsible for calculation of the ESRR(S)
    using the ESRR calculation worksheet as a result of RSAs for projects, after reviewing AMRs, Supervision
    Site Visits, Client Meetings, stakeholder meetings or conference calls and other RSAs (see refer to 2.4
    above).
    On the basis of the information gathered, the LESS shall calculate the ESRR(S): A/B1- Excellent; A/B-2-
    Satisfactory; A/B-3-Partly Unsatisfactory; or A/B-4-Unsatisfactory. If the Supervision Activity does not
    provide sufficient information to impart confidence of the project’s compliance with at-commitment
    requirements, then the ESRR(S) score should be at best A/B-3-Partly Unsatisfactory.

    The reviewing specialist shall consider if the qualitative review and associated conclusions are consistent
    with the resulting ESRR(S) score generated using the ESRR spreadsheet. If the score is inconsistent with
    or contradicts the LESS judgment, he/she shall override the calculated score and record the underlying
    justification of the revised ESRR score.

    IFC’s corporate systems assign ESRR(S) scores at the partner (client) level and not at the project level so if
    there is more than one investment project in the system with the same client, then the system only
    accepts one ESRR(S) Score. For original investment projects and repeat investments affecting the same
    facilities or operations, the most recent ESRR(S) will be reported in the system for this partner (client).
    For investment projects with the same partner (client) affecting different facilities or operations there
    may be multiple separate ESRR(S) scores for each of these projects. However, as the system will only
    accept one ESRR(S) score, the ESRR(S) score entered into the system at the partner (client) level shall
    reflect the highest risk rating (i.e. least satisfactory) recorded score among the partner’s (client’s) IFC
    projects. This approach is required to focus IFC and partner (client) attention on resolution of the project
    issues that led to the higher ESRR(S) score.

    On occasion, a Portfolio Officer will request an ESRR(S) score to accompany CRR language, even though
    recent information on which to base the evaluation is not available. The LESS shall not update the
    ESRR(S) score or date or CRR language in IFCDocs-created RSA formats without new information.

    2.14 Update DOTS Indicators and DOTS Rating: Measuring development results helps IFC to report on
    our performance to stakeholders. Please refer to the Development Impact at IFC Website (see Rules
    and Tools – Mainstream Supervision – DOTS Guidance).
    The DOTS system (Development Outcome Tracking System) uses standard indicators for E&S that are
    aggregated into results to capture development impact and to facilitate comparison of development
    effectiveness across regions and industries.

    To update the status of each project the LESS may access the DOTS View tab in iDesk. Within the menu
    of DOTS E&S indicators there is a subset named as “CORE” E&S indicators. These indicators are the only
    ones the LESS is responsible for updating. Other indicators in the E&S menu (without the CORE name on
    it) are mostly related to CBG projects and are the responsibility of the Portfolio officer. A list of CORE
    E&S Indicators indicating which ones are mandatory by sector, and those that are subject to public
    disclosure and detailed definitions for each are located in Rules and Tools (Rules and Tools –
    Mainstream Supervision – DOTS Guidance). The CORE indicators are mandatory for some defined
    industry sectors and may not be eliminated without permission from the DEU Department.

    The LESS is responsible for updating the DOTS E&S Indicators that were established at appraisal; and,
    updating the DOTS Rating (Environmental and Social Performance) for each portfolio investment project
    on an annual basis. DOTS updates are required as a part of Recordable Supervision Activities.

    2.15 The Expanded Project Supervision Report: The Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR) is an
    annual exercise by the Internal Evaluation Group (IEG) affecting a random sample of IFC projects 5 years
    after Commitment. The XPSR considers IFC and project performance, anticipated and actual project
    outcomes, and a review of the quality of IFC appraisal and supervision work.

    The LESS prepares for the XPSR by reviewing XPSR instructions and reporting template available on IEG’s
    Intranet site (refer to Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR) (see Rules and Tools - Guidance). The
    specialist should review available historical project records including IDocs and the M/Environment
    Files/Mainstream Projects drive and iDocs. Based upon this review, the LESS shall assess the project’s
    long-term E&S performance, including its E&S impacts and mitigation measures; compliance with PS,
    general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines, and ESAP requirements; client staff responsiveness; and the
    quality and frequency of the project’s E&S reporting.

    The LESS will schedule a Supervision Site Visit if necessary to assemble complete, up-to-date project
    information. After the SSV the LESS will provide input to the project team as needed, recording all key
    findings, decisions, analysis, and conclusions in the SSV Findings format created and stored in iDesk (see
    Rules and Tools - Document Formats). The LESS is responsible for distributing the report from iDesk.

    The LESS will record conclusions of the E&S project review in Project Environmental and Social (E&S)
    Review (See Rules and Tools – XPSR Guidance) and in the IEG XPSR report template (Expanded Project
    Supervision Report) (see Rules and Tools – XPSR Guidance); request review and approval from the CESI
    SL and/or RTL; and, when approved, send the completed XPSR report template to the Portfolio Officer.
    The LESS will upload the completed XPSR input to IFCDocs.

    2.16 Addressing Reporting Gaps:


                                                                 Page 8 of 11

          2.16.1 Late E&S Reporting: CES Quality Assurance (QA) will inform the LESS through the CES
          Monthly Performance Report about all active portfolio projects for which AMRs have not been
          received on time, and for which AMR reviews are overdue. RTLs will communicate the lists of
          overdue AMRs to appropriate Portfolio Managers, who will instruct the Portfolio Officers to obtain
          the overdue AMRs. RTLs will follow up with individual specialists with respect to AMR reviews that
          are more than 30 days overdue.

          2.16.2 Knowledge Gap: A Knowledge Gap refers to Projects that were disbursed 15 or more months
          previously that do not yet have an ESRR(S) score; and, projects with an ESRR(S) score older than two
          years. This definition applies to projects with an existing balance of more than $0, but not to
          Category C or Special Operations (CSO) Projects.
          CES QA will inform CESI Specialists through the CES Monthly Performance Report of Knowledge
          Gap projects. RTLs, in discussion with SLs, Portfolio Officers and Portfolio Managers, will develop
          and implement measures to update E&S information, either by requesting an AMR, holding a client
          meeting or by conducting a SSV.

    2.17 Portfolio Review: RTL shall note all projects where, following supervision, the ESRR(S) is 3 or 4 -
    and, projects in the CES High Risk List and the current portfolio distribution among E&S categories. All
    this information will be reported quarterly to the Portfolio Managers. Quality Assurance provides the
    support to include this information in the Quaterly Regional Portfolio Review presentations.

    2.18 High Risk List: Quarterly, the RTL is responsible for requesting regionally mapped CES Specialists to
    identify projects that have a high E&S risk and seek concurrence with the respective CESI SL. High E&S
    risk may be attributed to projects due to significantly adverse E&S impacts, reputational risks to IFC
    and/or Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) cases.
    Refer to ESRP 10: Environmental and Social High-Risk Projects Listing (see Rules and Tools – Rules – 2012
    Sustainability Framework) and to High Risk List (Rules and Tools – CES apps) for further guidance on the
    identification, listing and updating of HRL projects.

7   FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENTS:
    EARLY REVIEW AND APPRAISAL
                                                                                    Approved: Morgan Landy, Director CES


    Version 5, July 11, 2014



    ESRP 7. FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENTS: EARLY REVIEW AND
    APPRAISAL

    1.     Purpose and Applicability

    1.1 This procedure specifies the environmental and social (E&S) review process for financial
    intermediary (FI) investments leading up to the Investment Review Meeting (IRM). ESRP 8 covers the
    remaining appraisal related steps from disclosure to commitment.

    2.     Procedure

    2.1 Nomination of Responsible Sector Lead (SL) and Lead Environmental and Social Specialist (LESS):
    The CES SL is determined based on the Industry Department leading the transaction. The Regional Team
    Leader (RTL) and SL will determine the LESS. Where the FI investment involves multiple Industry
    Departments, the Financial Institutions Group (FIG) SL will discuss with the SL serving the other Industry
    Department the assignment of the LESS.

    2.2 Initial Documentation Review: The LESS is responsible for reviewing available information about
    the project concept, the financing product type offered to the client, the expected portfolio to be
    supported, and, where available, the Financial Institution’s Environmental and Social Management
    System (ESMS) and E&S risk management approach, and its labor practices in collaboration with the
    Transaction Leader (TRL).

    2.3 Project Concept Review Meeting: The LESS will participate in the project’s Concept Review
    Meeting, responding to E&S inquiries, and flagging key E&S issues associated with the project, product
    and type of financing, the need for a field appraisal, appropriateness of the assigned project E&S Tier,
    and in the case of existing clients key performance gaps. Upon request the LESS will provide the TRL with
    the E&S input for the PDS-Concept/MOR, identifying the provisional category of the project, key
    portfolio risks, the anticipated E&S requirements, scope of E&S due diligence (ESDD) and for existing
    clients the ESRR and outstanding E&S issues.

    2.4 Need for Site Appraisal Mission: For projects expected to be FI-1 (high risk), as well as projects
    where the applicable performance requirements are expected to include IFC’s Performance Standards
    (PSs), and where it is considered necessary to review further the client’s E&S risk management practices
    or existing sub-projects, the LESS will discuss with the SL and communicate with the TRL on the need to
    carry out an appraisal visit to the FI. The TRL is responsible for arranging the site visit. Field appraisal
    might also be required in cases of new offerings where applicable performance requirements are to be
    established for the new product.

    2.5 Provision of E&S Language for Mandate Letter and/or indicative Term Sheet: If requested, the
    LESS will review the E&S language included in the mandate letter and/or the indicative Term Sheet that
    lists the conditions of IFC participation. This should include:
         • Scope of IFC’s ESDD;
         • Expected applicable performance requirements;

                                                                 Page 1 of 9

7   FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENTS:
    EARLY REVIEW AND APPRAISAL
                                                                                            Approved: Morgan Landy, Director CES


    Version 5, July 11, 2014



        •    The need for the FI to establish or upgrade an ESMS and capacity to implement the applicable
             performance requirements; and
        •    The requirement to comply with PS2 on labor and working conditions.

    2.6 Participation in Corporate Operations Committee Meeting: If requested, the LESS will brief the
    Manager CESI and/or Director CES on key E&S issues of the project, participate in the Corporate
    Operations Committee (COC) meeting and other review or decision meetings, and respond to E&S
    inquiries. In cases where projects are referred to Regional Operations Committee (ROC), the Specialist
    will brief the Managers CESI (if requested).

    2.7 Appraisal Assessment, Summary of Investment Information (SII) Preparation and Clearance: The
    LESS will obtain relevant information to analyze the level of E&S risk in the client’s portfolio. This will
    include the client’s top exposures, potential exposure to projects under the Compliance Advisor
    Ombudsman (CAO) investigation, and projects on CES’ High Risk List (see ESRP 10). The LESS will also
    review the client’s E&S risk management practices against the requirements of PS1 and any relevant
    country requirements; and assess the FI’s labor and working conditions in line with PS2 and life, fire, and
    safety (LFS) measures. 1 Once the appraisal has been completed in the Environmental and Social Review
    Document (ESRD) FI, 2 the LESS will submit the appraisal assessment and proposed SII E&S language for
    clearance to the SL, and relevant Manager CESI where required.

    2.8 Peer Review Meeting: The LESS will ask the Manager CESI to call for a Peer Review Meeting (PRM)
    in the case of:
        • Projects with a complex E&S issue with structures that are uncommon or have not been
            encountered before; or
        • Other projects as suggested by the LESS, SL, or Manager CESI.

    Once the Manager CESI agrees that a PRM should be held, the LESS is responsible for determining the
    scope and purpose of peer review required and preparing background materials and a presentation for
    review by the Chair and distribution to PRM participants according to the PRM, Planning, Execution and
    Documentation and PRM Minutes Template (see Rules and Tools - Guidance and Document Formats).

    2.9 Investment Review Meeting: The LESS will prepare a summary of the key appraisal findings for
    inclusion in the IRM book, provide this to the TRL, and participate in the IRM responding to any E&S
    related queries. The IRM contribution will be a summary of the portfolio assessment, including
    categorization of the project, key E&S risks and impacts, high risk exposures and E&S reputational risk
    deriving from the existing or expected portfolio; the client’s E&S risk management practices, level of
    existing E&S capacity and training required; labor and working conditions and LFS practices; as well as
    the E&S requirements and the E&S Action Plan developed for the project, and the client’s commitment
    to implement these. The LESS will also provide comments on the E&S requirements specified in the



    1
      Refer to Appraisal Questionnaire for Financial Institutions in Rules and Tools. The RTL is responsible for requesting
    the required information from the client and providing it to the LESS.
    2
      This will follow the Appraisal Assessment and SII Preparation Guidance for Financial Institution Investments (See
    Rules and Tools).

                                                                 Page 2 of 9

    Term Sheet. Any deviations from standard E&S requirements and the residual risk deriving from these
    will be clearly flagged for review by the IRM.

    3.        Detailed Appraisal Guidance

    3.1 Categorization: Once the appraisal is completed, the LESS will categorize the investment as FI-1
    (high), FI-2 (medium) or FI-3 (low). The categorization will be commensurate with the E&S risk profile of
    the existing and/or proposed portfolio and will take into account the tenor, type, size and sector
    exposure of the portfolio, and be guided by the Tip Sheet Compendium 3 and IFC’s Policy on
    Environmental and Social Sustainability, as follows:

          •   Category FI-1: when an FI’s existing or proposed portfolio includes, or is expected to include,
              substantial financial exposure to business activities with potentially significant adverse
              environmental or social risks or impacts that are diverse, irreversible, or unprecedented.
          •   Category FI-2: when an FI’s existing or proposed portfolio comprises, or is expected to comprise
              of, business activities that have potentially limited adverse environmental and social risks or
              impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible, and readily addressed
              through mitigation measures; or includes a very limited number of business activities with
              potentially significant adverse environmental or social risks or impacts that are diverse,
              irreversible, or unprecedented.
          •   Category FI-3: when an FI’s existing or proposed portfolio includes financial exposure to business
              activities that predominantly have minimal or no adverse environmental or social impacts.

    3.2       Applicable Requirements and Scope of Application:

    3.2.1 Exclusion List, List of Restricted Activities and National E&S Laws and Regulations:4 All FIs will
    meet the requirements of the IFC Exclusion List and List of Restricted Activities (see Rules and Tools -
    Guidance). Where financing provided presents E&S risks, the FI must review the operations of the
    borrower/investee for compliance with the national E&S laws and regulations, where they exist and are
    applicable.

    3.2.2 PSs Application: In addition, for FIs where the portfolio to be supported entails project finance and
    long-term corporate finance, the FI will be required to assess E&S risks against the PSs and require its
    borrowers/investees to comply with the PSs. Specifically, the FI will apply the PSs as follows:

          •   For project finance and corporate loans with tenor of not less than 36 months and
              funding-defined assets as part of a project amounting to at least $10 million of total capital cost,

    EARLY REVIEW AND APPRAISAL
                                                                                      Approved: Morgan Landy, Director CES


    Version 5, July 11, 2014



             consistent with PS1 and PS2, commensurate with the level of risk presented by the sub-client
             business activities; and
        •    In cases where the FI’s leverage is limited (e.g., secondary market transactions or syndicated
             loans where the FI’s participation is below 25% of the total loan value), the FI will be required to
             screen such transactions against key objectives of the PSs and make a go or no go decision based
             on the results of this screening.

    3.2.3 Targeted End Use and Asset Class Approach: 5 Where IFC funding is provided for a targeted,
    specific end use, the client will be required to apply the E&S requirements to cover only the specific end
    use. However, if the FI supports similar activities from its own account, the E&S requirements will apply
    to the entire asset class. Notwithstanding, as part of its ESDD CES will examine the E&S reputational risks
    of the client’s entire portfolio, report the findings to the TRL, reflect them in the IRM and board paper
    E&S contribution, and document them in the ESRD FI.

    3.2.4 Equity and General Purpose Funding: In cases where IFC’s investment consists of equity or general
    purpose financial support with no traceable, specified end use, the E&S requirements will apply to the
    entire portfolio of the FI.

    3.2.5 Exceptions: In cases where modifications to the E&S requirements outlined in sections 3.2 and 3.3
    are requested by the client, the LESS will inform the SL. The SL will consult all material changes with the
    Director CES. The Director FIG will be informed and if needed consulted by the Director CES. The
    Directors CES and FIG will determine the approval process of these modifications by (i) either both
    Directors, or (ii) Corporate Risk Committee (CRC). Proposals for any waivers of the E&S requirements
    outlined in the Sustainability Policy will be appropriately addressed in Board Papers. They will be subject
    to the final approval by the Board. The LESS will inform the TRL about the process accordingly. The TRL
    will take the lead in cases of the CRC or Board approval requirements in preparing the relevant
    documentation with inputs from the LESS as needed.

    3.3 Summary Guidance on E&S Requirments for Key Products:
    IFC offers a wide range of products to its FI clients, and tailored E&S requirements have been developed
    for each. This section provides an overview of the E&S requirements of key products; for further details
    and other products not specified in this section refer to the Tip Sheet Compendium (See Rules and
    Tools). The Tip Sheet Compendium entails a description of all products offered by IFC to FIs and the
    respective E&S requirements. It comprises of four compendiums covering: (i) Short Term Finance
    programs, ii) Commercial Banks, iii) Non-Banking Financial Institutions, and iv) Investment Funds. These
    provide guidance to CESI Specialists on the key characteristics of each product, the typical E&S risks and
    resulting E&S requirements, the appraisal approach currently being followed, an indicative portfolio risk
    rating, and the likely categorization. The Tip Sheet Compendium is updated continuously to reflect new
    products and changes in products, requirements and approaches.

    3.3.1 Retail Operations and Mortgage Finance: For FI investments where the FI is engaged only in Retail
    Operations (retail banking, consumer product leasing, consumer NPL acquisition) or Mortgage Finance

    (without construction) and has no plans to engage in any other business in the future, or IFC’s financing
    to the FI is intended only for Retail Operations or Mortgage Finance, the LESS will categorize the project
    as a Category FI-3 investment with no E&S requirements.

    3.3.2 Short-Term Trade Finance: For FI investments where IFC is supporting trade finance transaction
    through the Trade and Supply Chain Solutions Department, the LESS will classify the transaction as a
    Category FI-3 or FI-2 depending on the portfolio risk level in accordance with the Tip Sheet Compendium
    (see Rules and Tools). For projects supported under the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) IFC’s
    Trade and Supply Chain Solutions department will need to apply the IFC Exclusion List and List of
    Restricted Activities for all activities supported under the transaction. For most other trade finance
    projects the LESS will require the FI to implement an ESMS to support the application of IFC’s Exclusion
    List, List of Restricted Activities, and any other requirements and/or eligibility criteria (e.g., as per the
    country-commodity matrix) in accordance with the Tip Sheet Compendium.

    3.3.3 Microfinance: If the FI is engaged in supporting only microfinance (including microfinance funds,
    microfinance holding companies and microinsurance companies), or IFC’s financing is intended only to
    support the FI’s lending or investments in this area, the LESS shall classify the project as Category FI-3,
    and require the FI to implement an ESMS to support the application of the IFC Exclusion List, List of
    Restricted Activities, and the relevant national laws and regulations.

    3.3.4 Commercial Banks and Non-Banking Financial Institutions: For FI investments where the FI is
    engaged in providing products such as equity, loans, leasing, insurance, guarantee products or factoring,
    and in the case of financial holding companies, the LESS shall categorize the project based on the
    expected portfolio risk and in accordance with the Tip Sheet Compendium, and require the FI to
    implement a ESMS to support application of the IFC Exclusion List, List of Restricted Activities, applicable
    national E&S regulations, and the IFC PSs, where required, in accordance with paragraph 3.2.2.

    3.3.5 Private Equity Funds: For investments in Private Equity Funds, the LESS will, in most cases,
    categorize the project as FI-1 or FI-2 based on the expected portfolio risk, and require the FI to
    implement an ESMS to support application of the IFC Exclusion List, List of Restricted Activities,
    applicable national E&S regulations, and the IFC PSs. In addition, the Fund Manager will be required to
    provide to IFC the ESDD and Corrective Action Plans developed for the first three investments and all
    high risk sub-projects for review and comments, prior to taking any proposed investment for approval
    by its Investment Committee, to ensure ESMS implementation is robust.

    3.3.6 Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and Distressed Assets: For FI investments involving the acquisition
    of Non-Performing Loans and/or distressed assets, the appraisal will confirm if such loans are purchased
    in pools and/or individually, if debtors have or are expected to have ceased operations/are bankrupt, or
    if the assets acquired will be reworked/operationally restructured by the Service Provider to determine
    the level of leverage by the FI. The LESS will require the FI to establish an ESMS for all investments
    involving NPLs or distressed assets. Where leverage is limited, the LESS will require the FI to implement
    an ESMS that ensures that the following are not supported: (i) excluded and restricted activities, (ii) debt
    with collateral that has E&S liabilities, and (iii) debtors with unsolved ongoing E&S compliance issues.
    The LESS will identify and flag the risks arising from the limited leverage, and inform relevant Manager
    CESI and Director CES, and record any unaddressed E&S risks that would remain on account of the

                                                                 Page 5 of 9

    limited leverage in the investment decision documents for IFC management and Board information and
    decision. The LESS will record the decision and supporting analysis in the ESRD FI. In all other cases
    (extensive leverage), the FI will, in addition, be required to work with the debtor, using commercially
    reasonable efforts, to bring about compliance with the national laws and regulations and the PSs (as per
    paragraph 3.3.2) after acquisition of the loans.

    3.3.7 Market Instruments with Limited or No Leverage: For investments where the FI is engaged in
    financing or investing in market instruments for activities with E&S risks, and where the FI has little or no
    leverage to carry out a reasonable review of the project’s risk, the LESS will require the FI to implement
    an ESMS. The ESMS will support the application of the IFC Exclusion List, the List of Restricted Activities
    and include a reputation risk screen in addition to any other applicable performance requirements as
    can be reasonably implemented in the scope of the transaction. The LESS will inform relevant Manager
    CESI and Director CES, record any unaddressed E&S risks that would remain on account of the limited
    leverage in the investment decision documents for IFC management (COC/CRC) and Board information
    and decision. The LESS will record the decision and supporting analysis in the ESRD FI.

    3.3.8 Other Types of FIs and Products: For all other types of FIs and/or products provided/proposed, the
    LESS will categorize the project and determine the applicable requirements in accordance with the Tip
    Sheet Compendium. For new products and offerings not yet included in the Tip Sheet Compendium, the
    LESS will consult with the SL, and where needed, the Manager CESI and Director CES, to determine the
    categorization and applicable requirements.

    3.4      Preparation of Appraisal Assessment and SII:

    3.4.1 Portfolio Data Review for E&S Risks: The LESS will request and review the portfolio information as
    provided in the Appraisal Questionnaire for Financial Institutions (see Rules and Tools) and any other
    information as needed, and determine the level of E&S risks of the financing supported under the
    project, categorize the project, and determine the applicable requirements in accordance with sections
    3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of this procedure. The portfolio review will include an assessment of the types of
    financing, tenor, transaction sizes, and industrial sectors of the portfolio to be supported; the FI’s
    business plan and strategy; exposure to Excluded Activities and Restricted Activities; top and high risk
    exposures; potential exposure to projects under CAO investigation and on the CES High Risk List;
    activities of subsidiaries (if applicable); and identify any country-/sector-specific E&S risks and E&S
    reputational risks. The LESS will record the portfolio assessment in ESRD FI.

    3.4.2 Review of the Client’s Labor Practices against the PS2 requirements as well as LFS Measures: 6
    The LESS will request and obtain information about the client’s labor practices as provided in the
    Questionnaire on Labor and Working Conditions and Life, Fire and Safety for Financial Institutions (See
    Rules and Tools). The assessment of the FI’s labor practices will focus on the FI’s HR policy and terms of
    employment, employee organizations, non-discrimination, and equal opportunity, as well as
    retrenchment and grievance mechanism; and the LFS review on regulatory compliance, operational LFS
    aspects and training, awareness, and competencies in this area. Where material gaps are identified, the

    3.4.3 Evaluation of the Client’s E&S Risk Management Practices including its ESMS as well as Staff
    Capacity and Commitment against the Requirements of PS1: The LESS will request information about
    the client’s E&S risk management practices as provided in the Appraisal Questionnaire for Financial
    Institutions (see Rules and Tools), and review it considering its adequacy to implement the applicable
    performance requirements. The review will include the following aspects of the client’s system and
    capacity commensurate with the nature of the activities supported:

        •    E&S policy and senior management approval thereof;
        •    ESDD procedures and tools to identify and avoid, and if avoidance is not possible, mitigate E&S
             risks and potential impacts;
        •    E&S provisions in legal documentation;
        •    Performance monitoring procedure and records, as relevant to E&S risk management;
        •    Reporting of E&S and ESMS performance to management and Board members (if applicable);
        •    External communication and grievance mechanism;
        •    Adequacy and quality of ESMS implementation to-date, including of ESDD documentation;
        •    The current organizational structure and staffing as relevant to E&S risks;
        •    Skills, capacity, and competencies of staff in E&S areas;
        •    Training and awareness of the client’s investment, legal, and credit officers on the organization’s
             E&S requirements and the ESMS; and
        •    Commitment of the client to undertake E&S risk management in line with IFC’s E&S
             requirements.

    3.4.4. Identification of E&S Risk Management and Staff Capacity Gaps: The LESS shall define any E&S
    actions that the client should undertake to address gaps to meet the requirements of the applicable
    performance requirements, and prepare an E&S Action Plan and determine timelines for its
    implementation taking into consideration the following criteria:

        •    Gaps in the ESMS procedures of FIs that are engaged in projects with either potentially significant
             E&S risks or risk exposure to IFC must be closed to ensure compliance with the applicable
             performance requirements before IFC Commitment or as a condition of IFC disbursement;
        •    Gaps in the ESMS procedures of FIs with either relatively low E&S risks or no immediate financing
             activities in risky areas must be closed according to a time-bound E&S Action Plan to be included
             in the legal agreements; and
        •    Significant gaps in the E&S performance (including outstanding E&S Action plan items) of existing
             clients must be closed through the process of commitment as conditions of commitment or as
             conditions of disbursement.

    The LESS will record the decision and supporting analysis, including the E&S Action Plan, in the ESRD FI.

    ESRP 8. FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENTS: IFC DISCLOSURE AND
    COMMITMENT

    1.     Purpose and Applicability

    1.1 This procedure describes the environmental and social (E&S) review process for financial
    intermediary (FI) investments, from the public disclosure of the proposed investment information in
    accordance with IFC’s 2012 Access to Information Policy (AIP), up to the signing of the legal agreements
    and review of Conditions of Commitment (COCs).

    2.     Procedure

    2.1 Summary of Investment Information (SII) Disclosure: Once the necessary clearance for SII E&S
    language is obtained in Environmental and Social Review Document (ESRD) FI, the Transaction Leader
    (TRL) will receive an email notifying him/her of the availability of the E&S language to be incorporated
    into the SII. When the TRL starts the SII workflow in IFCDocs, the SII will be automatically populated with
    the approved E&S language in its relevant sections, transmitted from ESRD FI. The TRL will then obtain
    the client’s written acceptance based on factual accuracy and approval for public release to the IFC
    Disclosure website no later than 30 days prior to the IFC Board’s consideration of the investment.

    2.2 Delayed Public Disclosure: Delayed disclosure is outlined in paragraph 14 of the AIP. According to
    the AIP, IFC may delay disclosure of certain information that it would otherwise make publicly available
    because of market conditions; or legal or regulatory requirements. For specific instructions on delayed
    disclosure procedures please check the AIP Staff Guidebook (available in Rules and Tools; see chapter IV
    Exceptions; section B: Delayed disclosure).

    2.3 Waiver to the disclosure duration: In some exceptional circumstances where the minimum time
    period cannot be met, waivers of the disclosure period for project ESRS must be cleared by the Lead
    Investment Department’s VP (see IFC’s operational procedure: Investment Operations – New Business
    paragraph 55). In these cases, the Board must be notified that the disclosure period was shortened
    including the rationale for such decision.

    2.4 Public Interest and Comments during Disclosure: Where there are inquiries or complaints raised
    during the disclosure period, refer to the Environmental and Social Review Procedure (ESRP) 5:
    Managing Eventualities in Investment Projects. The Lead Environmental and Social Specialist (LESS) will
    provide support to the Investment Department as needed to manage the inquiry or complaint. The
    Investment Department is responsible for preparing the response to the request for information, but

    Version 5, June 3, 2014



    2.5 Restarting Public Disclosure: Restarting the time period of public disclosure may be necessary
    under certain circumstances and the LESS is responsible for recognizing the need and for advising the
    TRL accordingly. Where new project information is obtained that is material to the E&S risks and/or
    impacts of the project, after the release of the SII but before the Board approval, the disclosure period
    must be restarted in accordance with the AIP.

    2.6 Preparation of E&S Contribution for the Board Paper: The LESS shall prepare the E&S language
    for the Board Paper following the corporate guidance (see Rules and Tools). The Board Paper
    contribution will be a succinct summary of the portfolio assessment, including categorization of the
    project, key E&S risks and impacts, high risk exposures and E&S reputational risk deriving from the
    existing or expected portfolio, exposure to Excluded and Restricted Activities; the client’s E&S risk
    management practices, level of existing E&S capacity and training required; and the key E&S
    requirements for the project as well as the client’s commitment to implement these. Any deviations
    from standard E&S requirements and the residual risk deriving from these will be clearly flagged for
    decision by the Board. The LESS will also review and comment on the E&S-related aspects prepared by
    the TRL in the IFC additionality section, DOTS indicators, and Risk and Issue section of the Board Paper.
    The TRL is responsible for obtaining clearance of the Board Paper from the LESS prior to its submission
    to the Board. The LESS will provide support, as necessary, to the project team for presentations to the
    Board, and upon request provide technical briefings to members of IFC’s Board of Directors.

    2.7 Project Team Lawyer Liaison and E&S Input to Investment Contract: Upon request by the TRL,
    the LESS will liaise with the Project Team Lawyer and provide inputs for the drafting of legal agreements
    including the E&S Action Plan specifying the COCs and Conditions for Disbursement for the project and
    Annual Environmental Performance Reports format, and where the standard E&S covenants require
    modifications. Where material alteration of the standard covenants is requested by the client, the LESS
    will consult with the Sector Lead (SL).

    2.8 Review of COCs: Prior to execution of the legal agreement, the TRL or the Portfolio Officer will be
    responsible for seeking LESS clearance that the E&S COCs have been satisfied. When such a clearance is
    sought, information will be obtained and reviewed as required to evidence the same in the ESRD FI,
    confirm if the COCs have been met, provide the clearance and upload the records to IFCDocs. The LESS
    will inform the TRL/Portfolio Officer if there are any E&S COCs that are not complied with, based on the
    above review. If the TRL/Portfolio Officer proposes to waive a COC, and if the LESS is supportive of the
    waiver, the LESS should document the justification of the waiver and send it to the SL and Manager CESI
    for approval. If the waiver is not approved, the LESS will inform the TRL/Portfolio Officer that CESI will
    not support the commitment until the COC is met. Waivers of E&S COCs must be documented in the
    ESRD FI and in IFCDocs.

    3.      Roles and Responsibilities

    3.1     The LESS is responsible for the following:
          • Providing the approved E&S language for the SII to the TRL;

    ESRP 9. FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENTS: SUPERVISION

    1.       Purpose and Applicability

    1.1 This procedure describes the environmental and social (E&S) review process during the
    supervision stage of financial intermediary (FI) investments from commitment until the project is closed
    as an IFC investment. The purpose of supervision is to obtain information to assess the status of the
    client’s compliance with the E&S requirements agreed upon; to assess the current level of E&S risk; to
    provide guidance to clients on how to address E&S risk management issues; and to identify
    opportunities for improvement and good practices that could be applied to similar projects.

    2.       Procedure

    2.1 Supervision Activities: Effective E&S supervision entails periodic reviews of the client’s E&S
    performance and compliance with IFC’s E&S requirements, including through the following key
    supervision tasks:

         •   Assessing the client’s level of compliance with the E&S requirements including all conditions of
             disbursement, Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) items and other E&S covenants
             included in the legal agreement;
         •   Review of E&S due diligence (ESDD) for subprojects provided by the client;
         •   Review of the Annual Environmental Performance Reports (AEPRs); and
         •   Undertaking Supervision Site Visits (SSVs) including sub-project site visits and ESDD reviews.

    The Lead Environmental and Social Specialist (LESS) will document and clearly communicate the risks
    and areas of non-compliance with the E&S requirements to the Portfolio Officer, and follow-up with the
    client as required to remedy and manage these.

    2.2 Assignment of LESS for Supervision: Once an FI project moves to portfolio, the Regional Team
    Leader(s) (RTL(s)) will discuss with the Sector Lead (SL) and agree on the assignment of the LESS to
    supervise the project going forward.

    2.3 Review of Conditions of Disbursement: Prior to disbursement the Transaction Leader (TRL) or the
    Portfolio Officer will be responsible for seeking LESS clearance that the E&S Conditions of Disbursement
    (CODs) have been satisfied. When such a clearance is sought, information will be obtained and reviewed
    as required to evidence the same in the ESRD FI, confirm if the CODs have been met, provide the
    clearance, and upload the records to IFCDocs. The LESS will inform the TRL/Portfolio Officer if there are
    any E&S CODs that are not complied with, based on the above review. If the TRL/Portfolio Officer
    proposes to waive a COD, and if the LESS is supportive of the waiver, the LESS should document the
    justification of the waiver and send it to the SL and Manager CESI for approval. If the waiver is not
    approved, the LESS will inform the TRL/Portfolio Officer that CESI will not support the disbursement until
    the COD is met. Waiver of E&S CODs must be documented in the ESRD FI and in IFCDocs.

    SUPERVISION
                                                                                   Approved: Morgan Landy, Director CES


    Version 5, June 3, 2014



    2.4 Review of Subproject ESDD: For projects that require IFC review of the first three ESDDs and that
    of all high risk sub-projects, the LESS reviews the ESDD received from the client for such projects
    according to the pre-agreed timeframe as defined in the investment agreements, and provides
    comments and recommendations to the client. The LESS should consult with other specialists including a
    specialist with sector-specific expertise relevant to the sub-project proposed, as needed.

    2.5 AEPR Processing and Review: The Portfolio Officer is responsible for ensuring that the client’s
    obligations including AEPR reporting are fulfilled. He/she is will request AEPRs and follow up on any
    questions about the adequacy of information provided with the client.

    When an AEPR is submitted by the client, the LESS will ensure that the information provided is
    adequate. If not, the LESS will ask the Portfolio Officer to obtain additional information from the client
    and ask the Regional Portfolio Assistant to leave “date received by IFC” blank in the Compliance Tracking
    System until IFC receives the AEPR in the appropriate format/content.

    The Investment Department Portfolio Assistant is primarily responsible for logging AEPR documents into
    iDesk. If clients send AEPRs directly to the LESS, the LESS will forward the AEPR to the relevant
    Investment Department Portfolio Assistant for compliance tracking log-in. When the AEPR is received in
    CESI, the CES ACS is responsible for logging the document into the CESI section of the iDesk timeline,
    preparing the AEPR Cover Sheet (see Rules and Tools – Document Formats) that provides instructions
    for the reviewing Specialist, and sending the AEPR to the reviewing Specialist.

    The LESS will review the AEPR, focusing on the client’s performance against the applicable E&S
    requirements as determined during project appraisal, the portfolio risk, and sub-project compliance
    with the applicable performance requirements, including:

        •    The status of the client’s implementation of the ESAP and timeline if relevant;
        •    The status of development of the client’s Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS);
        •    The quality of the implementation of the client’s ESMS, particularly the quality of ESDD at
             appraisal and during portfolio monitoring, and the compliance of sub-projects with the applicable
             requirements;
        •    The client’s E&S staff capacity and training needs;
        •    The portfolio supported and any changes thereof;
        •    The quality and timeliness of AEPR reporting;
        •    Key performance or information gaps relating to the client’s E&S performance;
        •    Status of remedial actions identified in previous AEPR reviews and supervision visits; and
        •    Key steps the client may need to take to improve performance.

    The LESS will ascertain whether or not:
       • The nature of the client’s business has changed significantly to indicate different applicable
          performance requirements from IFC;
       • There is sufficient evidence that the client is operating the ESMS as envisaged at the time of
          appraisal; and



                                                                 Page 2 of 9

    Version 5, June 3, 2014



        •    There is sufficient evidence that the client has applied the applicable performance requirements
             to its sub-projects.

    The LESS will complete the AEPR review (following the AEPR Review Guidance Note in Rules and Tools),
    record all key findings, decisions, and supporting analysis in the ESRD FI, generate the E&S Risk Rating
    (ESRR) in the ESRD FI, and provide the Portfolio Officer with the AEPR reviews findings including the E&S
    language for the Credit Risk Rating (CRR) report and ESRR score, and file them in IFCDocs.

    If there are gaps in the client’s performance or other issues of concern, the Portfolio Officer shall be
    alerted for timely follow-up by the Portfolio Department. If the AEPR report was submitted late, the
    LESS will ask the Portfolio Officer to communicate the need for timely reporting to the client. In
    coordination with the Portfolio Officer, the LESS should provide timely and clear explanations to the
    client on the actions needed to address performance gaps or other issues of concern.

    Once the AEPR review is completed, the LESS is responsible for assigning the Development Outcome
    Tracking System (DOTS) E&S rating and requesting the ACS to update it accordingly in the iDesk DOTS
    tab.

    2.6 AEPR Waivers: Waiver of IFC investment contract-mandated AEPR submission is exclusively for
    extraordinary circumstances. For example, the FI has not yet started its operations or has not yet made
    any investments or a Private Equity Fund has exited all its investments and no further monitoring is
    required. Waivers are granted for limited periods only (e.g., one year). The document entitled Petition
    for Waiver of Annual Environmental Performance Report should be used to request CESI Manager
    approval for AEPR waivers (see Rules and Tools). The LESS shall record any waivers in the ESRD FI.

    2.7 SSV Plan: CES RTLs are responsible for proposing a list of projects to be supervised every year at
    the beginning of the fiscal year (FY) based on the selection criteria below (see Table 1). Supervision
    priority should be given to FI clients with high risk, poor ESRRs, clients in the knowledge gap, or clients in
    the early stages of ESMS development and implementation. RTLs will finalize the list of targeted projects
    for the FY following discussion with the respective LESS, SL, FIG, and CES Quality Assurance team and
    obtain the approval of the CESI Manager for the final SSV Plan. The Plan will constitute the annual target
    of SSVs for that region and will be tracked on a regular basis.

    Other factors may dictate SSV frequency, including major E&S incident(s), non-governmental
    organization complaints, Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) investigations, an Expanded Project
    Supervision Report (XPSR), or an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) visit. Refer to ESRP 5: Managing
    Non-Routine Events in Investment Projects. If a SSV is proposed because of a circumstance described in
    ESRP 5, the LESS shall ensure consensus for mission travel among the RTL, TRL, or Portfolio Officer, and
    Manager CESI.

    2.8 Preparation for SSV: The LESS shall prepare for and plan the SSV by reviewing all appraisal and
    supervision records and documents. Additionally, the LESS shall review the client’s performance
    considering its applicable requirements, the requirements included in the ESAP and their respective
    timelines. The LESS should ensure that the Portfolio Officer or Portfolio Manager advises the client in

      Justification for removal of projects from the draft SSV Plan may include the following:

           • Financial Restructuring underway;
           • Constrained Engagement Projects: projects for which prospects of a resolution of issues with IFC are
             very low; and, where IFC leverage is limited;
           • The client was supervised in the previous FY and is on-track with addressing the outstanding
             performance gaps;
           • Other compelling factors discussed and agreed between the LESS and the RTL; and
           • Security concerns in country of client’s operations.



    advance of the proposed SSV, the purpose for the SSV, and recommended preparations. The SSV should
    include interview(s) and discussion(s) with the client and its representatives, review of ESDD
    documentation and sub-project site visits were applicable (see Guidance Note on FI Supervision
    Approach in Rules and Tools – Guidance).

    2.9 ESDD Reviews and Sub-Project Site Visits: For supervision of Private Equity Funds the LESS will
    select 1–3 sub-projects to visit to assess the Fund Manager’s implementation of the ESMS and
    compliance of the sub-projects with the applicable requirements. The selection of sub-projects should
    be focused on high risk sub-projects, projects for which the ESDD prepared or monitoring by the Fund
    Manager appears inadequate, projects with inadequate Corrective Action Plan implementation, where
    accidents or incidents have occurred, and any sub-projects deemed relevant to assess performance. For
    all other FI investments, the supervision will include a review of ESDD prepared by the client. The LESS
    will identify a sample of loan files to be reviewed in accordance with the Selection Criteria outlined
    below, and inform the client accordingly prior to the SSV. Site visits to sub-projects can be added if
    required. The selection of sub-projects to be visited should focus on high risk transactions.

    Circumstances permitting, after completing the SSV, the LESS or their designee should have a close out
    meeting with the client including presentation of findings, conclusions, and recommendations for
    corrective actions. If follow-up actions need to be implemented, the LESS should try to secure
    agreement with the client at this time. The Portfolio Officer is responsible for following up with the
    client on non-technical issues identified during the supervision visit regarding the client’s compliance
    with the E&S requirements.

    Version 5, June 3, 2014



    2.10 Documenting the SSV: The LESS shall document the SSV, along with key observations and
    interpretations, findings, and conclusions through completion of the FI BTOR, and ensure distribution of
    the report, containing the CRR E&S language, to the FIG Portfolio Manager and Portfolio Officer, as well
    as the CES RTL, SL, and regional FI Specialists along with the updated ESRR(S), and record the findings in
    the ESRD FI. All other relevant E&S documents provided by the client shall be uploaded to IFCDocs.

    2.11 Waiving Supervision Requirements: For portfolio clients for which a supervision waiver is
    warranted, for example, clients that have no enforceable reporting requirements or are in liquidation,
    the LESS will prepare a waiver request and shall obtain the approvals from Manager CESI and FIG
    Portfolio Manager for such a waiver. The approval, bearing signatures from both managers, should be
    filed in IFCDocs, with notification to the CES QA Team.

    2.12 Disclosure of ESAP status of FI-1 and FI-2 Projects and Sub-Projects of Private Equity Fund
    Clients: For FI-1 and FI-2 projects to which the 2012 Access to Information Policy (AIP) applies, the LESS
    shall update the implementation status of any ESAP items that were disclosed in the Summary of
    Investment Information prior to the project’s approval, after such information has become available
    (i.e., when such information is provided in the AEPR submitted by the client or is obtained during a SSV).
    The LESS shall record such information in ESRD FI by updating the ESAP item status in ESRP 9
    “Supplementary Action” section, and generate a two-column table from ESRD FI for disclosure at the
    Project Disclosure website. For private equity fund projects to which the 2012 AIP applies, the LESS shall
    review and verify the categorization of the fund’s sub-projects, prior to the disclosure of the relevant
    information pertaining to its high-risk sub-projects and any other sub-projects that may be disclosed on
    a best-efforts basis.

    2.13 Disclosure of Non-Public Information under Exceptional Circumstances: In exceptional
    circumstances, where an AEPR review or supervision visit, or information provided from other sources,
    indicates that the disclosure of certain non-public information would be likely to avert imminent and
    serious harm to public health or safety, and/or imminent and significant adverse impacts on the
    environment, the LESS shall immediately consult with the RTL and SL and inform the client to take
    suitable action, and shall record the findings in the ESRD FI. In the event that the client is unable to
    address the matter, the LESS will inform the Portfolio Officer and consult with the Manager CESI, and
    prepare recommendations for the Director CES and the Director of the Investment Department (and,
    where applicable, the Regional Director) in accordance with IFC’s AIP.

    2.14 XPSR: If the project is selected for evaluation as part of IFC’s XPSR program, the LESS will provide
    written input to the XPSR to the Portfolio Officer. The LESS prepares for the XPSR by reviewing the XPSR
    reporting template and guidelines available on IEG’s Intranet site (see Expanded Project Supervision
    Report in Rules and Tools) and all available historical project records including in IFCDocs, ESRD FI, the
    M-drive and through discussions with previous LESSs on the project. The LESS will schedule a SSV if
    necessary to assemble complete, up-to-date project information. Based upon the review, the LESS shall
    assess the project’s long-term E&S impact and IFC’s appraisal and supervision performance in
    accordance with the IEG guidelines and record the conclusions in the XPSR report template; request
    review and approval from the CESI SL; and when approved, send the completed XPSR contribution to
    the Portfolio Officer for incorporation into the XPSR. The LESS will upload the completed XPSR input to
    IFCDocs.

                                                                                    Approved: Morgan Landy, Director CES


    Version 5, June 3, 2014



    2.15 Managing Changed Circumstances: The Portfolio Officer should inform the LESS if the client is
    expected to change or has changed its business. If the client reports a plan to enter into a new business
    line, the LESS will evaluate the E&S implications on the FI portfolio of any proposed change in business.
    Based on this evaluation, the LESS will determine whether there would be any change in the applicable
    performance requirements that the FI would need to apply to its portfolio and require the client to
    adjust its ESMS. If there is a change in the performance requirements, the LESS will inform the Portfolio
    Officer for action.

    2.16 Managing Knowledge Gap (KG) Clients: KG clients are portfolio clients to which IFC 1st
    disbursement was made 15 or more months previously that do not yet have an ESRR(S) score; or,
    portfolio clients with an ESRR(S) score older than two years. The definition applies to portfolio clients
    with an existing IFC balance of more than $0, with reporting requirements, but, it does not apply to
    clients with the lead project being FI-3 with no E&S requirements. KG clients are mandatory for SSV in
    annual SSV planning, unless other circumstances warrant a supervision waiver. See paragraph 2.7 of this
    procedure for more information.

    2.17 High Risk List: The RTL is responsible for requesting regionally mapped CES Specialists to identify
    projects that have a high E&S risk and should therefore be flagged to CRC, seeking concurrence with the
    respective SL. High E&S risk may be attributed to projects due to poor E&S compliance (ESRR 4 and 3,
    where applicable), high portfolio risk, reputational risks to IFC, and/or CAO cases. For further guidance
    on identification, listing and updating of high risk list projects see ESRP 10 (Rules and Tools).

    2.18 Quarterly Portfolio E&S Compliance Reports: The ACS will provide, on behalf of CES the Portfolio
    Department, quarterly FI portfolio E&S compliance reports that summarize the E&S performance of
    each regional portfolio, and the compliance status of each client and request the Portfolio Officers of
    clients with compliance issues to follow up with the clients, involving the LESS as necessary to resolve
    outstanding issues.

    2.19 Managing Eventualities in Investment Projects: If during project supervision, a complaint is filed,
    there is interest from civil society organizations and or interest from IEG or CAO, refer to ESRP 5:
    Managing Eventualities in Investment Projects (see Rules and Tools).

    3.      Roles and Responsibilities

   1. Purpose and Applicability 
    
   1.1 The environmental and social (E&S) High‐Risk List (HRL) is a group of projects that require closer 
       scrutiny and supervision due either to highly significant E&S risks or because the projects have 
       attracted the attention of third parties, such as Civil Society Organizations and project‐affected 
       people and/or media for alleged E&S shortcomings, impacts, and associated reasons.  
    
   2. Procedure 

   2.1 Selection Criteria: 
       Placement of projects on the HRL shall adhere to the following criteria: 
        Criterion 1: All projects that are open Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) cases; 
        Criterion 2: All  projects with an Environmental and Social Risk Rating (ESRR) of 4; 
        Criterion 3: Selected projects with an ESRR of 3 that encompass very significant E&S risks and/or 
           with a sponsor that has demonstrated very poor E&S management or performance; and/or 
        Criterion 4: Projects that have attracted negative Civil Society Organization, public, or media

      Version 5, June 3, 2011




 ESRP 11. E&S REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVISORY SERVICES PROJECTS

 1. Purpose and Applicability

 1.1 To provide guidance for CESI on incorporation of E&S risk management considerations into Advisory
     Services (AS) projects. This procedure applies to all AS projects deemed High Risk by AS staff and
     those AS projects related to IFC investment services (IS).

 1.2 CESI Team for AS Support has been established to assist with coordination of CESI assistance to AS
     projects needs.

 1.3 The IFC Exclusion List (see Rules and Tools, Guidance), applies to all AS projects,

 2.     Procedure

 2.1 AS projects with an IS link

        For all AS projects for which the proposed beneficiary is a former or current IFC partner, the
        assigned CESI specialist will liaise with the CESI LESS identified in the iDesk Project Team to ensure
        coherence between the Investment and AS projects in terms of E&S requirements

        For all AS projects where the proposed beneficiary is a current IFC partner, the viability and
        acceptability of providing AS services to the partner will consider the supervision Environmental
        and Social Risk Rating (ESRR(S)) for the IFC partner. The AS Transaction Leader (TRL) will coordinate
        with the investment/portfolio officer and the CESI LESS identified in the iDesk Project Team to
        verify that the client has an ESRR score of 1 or 2 and is thus in good standing so that the AS project
        may proceed.

        If the partner’s E&S performance is ESRR(S) 3 or 4 (Partly Unsatisfactory or Unsatisfactory), the CESI
        specialist will inform the AS TRL that partner performance should be improved prior to approval
        and funding of any AS project. The CESI specialist, moreover, shall suggest areas for improvement
        to beneficially affect the ESRR(S) score; and, if requested in the offing, revisit the proposed AS
        project and reevaluate the partner’s E&S performance.

        If the AS TRL and CESI specialist believe that the timing of the AS project and its potential positive
        impact should not wait for improved partner performance, a Waiver to Provide Advisory Services
        shall be prepared by CESI and the AS TRL and submitted for approval by the RTL and the Manager
        CESI (see Rules and Tools, Document Formats). In general, a waiver may be approved if the
        proposed advisory services would positively affect one or more of the ESRR(S) scoring factors
        contributing to ESRR(S) 3 (Partly Unsatisfactory) or 4 (Unsatisfactory) score (e.g. Management
        Factors, Performance Factors, or Communication Factors).

        For AS projects being processed at the same time as an IS transaction, any specific environmental
        and social (E&S) requirements affecting the AS project will be discussed among CESI staff and the

                                                                1

11   E&S REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVISORY SERVICES
     PROJECTS
                                                                                Approved: William Bulmer, Director CES


     Version 5, June 3, 2011




       currently assigned CESI LESS to ensure that these mitigation measures are consistent with the E&S
       requirements for the IS transaction. In case of conflict, the E&S requirements for the IS transaction
       will prevail.

       If simultaneous processing is not feasible, the AS Unit Line Manager/Unit Manager may permit the
       AS transaction to be treated as a Standalone AS project in accordance with the processing
       requirements described below.

       When, from an E&S perspective, an AS project proposed for an IFC partner is viable, primarily by
       the ESRR(S) score as discussed above, the procedure for E&S risk management is similar to that for
       Stand Alone projects presented below and through use of the methodology defined in the Flow
       chart for AS project + IFC Investment (see Rules and Tools – Guidance).

 2.2 Standalone AS projects

      For AS projects not associated with an existing IFC partner or IS transaction, AS staff will review the
      proposed mandate and assign an E&S risk rating associated with the AS project (e.g. No, Low,
      Medium, High). The methodology for assessing the level of project risk by AS staff is defined in the
      Flowchart for Standalone AS (see Rules and Tools - Guidance).

      For High Risk AS products, the AS TRL shall request assignment of CESI staff to the project by
      contacting the CESI Team Leader for AS Support (see Rules and Tools - Guidance). A CESI specialist
      will be assigned to ensure that an appropriately qualified professional assists the AS TRL in project
      analysis and preparation of an AS E&S Memo (see Rules and Tools – Document Formats).

      The assigned CESI specialist shall provide recommendations to the AS TRL on the design of E&S
      good practices for the AS project and create a permanent, auditable record through completion of
      an AS E&S Memo (see Rules and Tools – Document Formats).

      The AS E&S Memo will contain an analysis of the risks considering the requirements of IFC’s
      Sustainability Framework, define specific ameliorative measures required to close observed gaps,
      and reduce identified risks to achieve consistency with the IFC Sustainability Framework.

 3. Roles and Responsibilities

 3.1 The Advisory Services (AS) TRL is responsible for:
     • Evaluating impacts and outcomes of a proposed AS project and determining if these could have
         potential E&S risks;

         support from CESI;
     • In case of existing investment projects having an ESRR(S) score of 3 or 4 and agreement among
         CESI and AS TRL that AS should proceed, preparing a Waiver to Provide Advisory Services and
         submitting the Waiver for approval to the RTL and the Manager CESI (see Rules and Tools,
         Document Formats);

   Team (QA Team).   
    
   2. Procedure 
    
   2.1 Proposing  New  or  Revised  E&S  Review  Procedures:    CESI  staff  may  suggest  new  or  revised  ESRP 
       procedures  to  enhance  investment  review  practices,  supervision  practices,  and  projects’  records.  
       Suggested  new  or  modified  E&S  Review  Procedures  should  be  submitted  to  QA  Team  (for  example 
       by  e‐mail)  describing  the  proposed  change  or  content  of  a  new  procedure  along  with  the  purpose, 
       the  reason  why  this  change  or  addition  is  deemed  necessary,  and  how  the  proposed  change  will 
       improve  written  instructions  and/or  current  practices.    Proposed  ESRP  Manual  additions  and 
       modifications  to  existing  procedures  in  ESRP  Manual,  if  implemented  should  be  summarized  by  the 
       QA  Team  in  an  explanatory  format  that  clearly  specifies  the  existing  situation,  the  rationale  for  a 
       proposed  change  or  new  procedure,  and  the  nature  of  suggested  changes  or  additions.  (See  Annex
