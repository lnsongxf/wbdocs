I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Nepal
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Nepal regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Nepal;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Nepal;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Nepal; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Nepal.

       Use data to help inform the Nepal country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In November and December 2012, 410 stakeholders of the World Bank in Nepal were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime
Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; women’s groups; and youth groups. A total of 310 stakeholders participated in
the country survey (76%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Nepal, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the World
Bank; the Bank’s future role in Nepal, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Nepal: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Nepal was headed
   in the right or wrong direction, the most important development priorities, and which areas
   would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Nepal.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Nepal, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, agreement with
   various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to
   reduce poverty in Nepal, with which groups the Bank should work more in Nepal, and how
   they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across twenty-six development areas, the extent to which the Bank’s work
   helps achieve sustainable development results in Nepal, and the extent to which the Bank
   meets Nepal’s needs for financial instruments and knowledge services.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities (i.e., Analysis, Studies, Research, Data,
   Reports, Conferences): Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they consult
   Bank knowledge work and activities in the work they do, the areas on which the Bank should
   focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the Bank disbursing funds
   promptly, as well as rating the extent to which the Nepal office is adequately staffed.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Nepal: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Nepal’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Nepal.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of
   agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how
   to find information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Nepal, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 186 respondents (47% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2009. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
        combined with those from the office of the President/Prime Minister, respondents from
        PMUs were combined with consultants on Bank projects, respondents from multilateral
        agencies were combined with those from bilateral agencies, respondents from the
        financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector,
        respondents from private foundations, CBOs trade unions, faith-based groups, NGOs, and
        women’s groups were combined into a CSO category, and the few respondents from
        independent government institutions and the judiciary were included in “Other”.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.1; this was
        statistically similar to the mean rating received in the FY ’09 country survey (6.0).
             Respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies and employees of ministries/
              implementation agencies had the highest levels of familiarity with the Bank
              whereas respondents from local government and youth groups had significantly
              lower levels of familiarity.
             Respondents from Kathmandu had significantly higher levels of familiarity with
              the Bank (6.4) compared to respondents from outside Kathmandu (5.8).
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
              significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Nepal, the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development
              results, and the Bank’s relevance to Nepal’s development.

IV. General Issues facing Nepal

Headed in the Right Direction

       When asked whether Nepal is headed in the right or wrong direction, nearly half of all
        respondents indicated that they were not sure.
             Although the majority of respondents from the office of the President/Prime
              Minister indicated that Nepal is headed in the right direction, pluralities of
              respondents across all other stakeholder groups indicated that they were not sure
              whether Nepal was headed in the right or wrong direction.

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Nepal, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s abi lity to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Nepal. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at gender.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’09 country survey were:
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to reduce poverty;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to bring about economic growth;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at encouraging greater transparency in governance;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to strengthen infrastructure development;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at help ing to strengthen environment and natural
                  resources management; and
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to strengthen the private sector.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related
        to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Nepal, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at tourism.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Nepal or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The

stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in Nepal. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in Nepal. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
