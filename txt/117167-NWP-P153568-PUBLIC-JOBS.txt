ABSTRACT
This report analyzes the World Bank Group (WBG) portfolio in Zambia focused on jobs, referred to as the
Jobs Portfolio, regarding its impact on outcomes related to Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access. The
review is presented within the context of Zambia’s jobs priorities: more good-quality jobs with
traditionally disadvantaged groups benefitting from opportunities to work. It finds that the Jobs Portfolio
is more focused on intermediate-level outcomes related to jobs, such as improving access to markets and
firm performance. A range of intervention types contributes to Job Creation (66 percent of the reviewed
portfolio), Job Quality (47 percent), and Job Access (51 percent). Activities focused on spatial development
in value chains tend to support Job Creation in the formal sector. Job Quality outcomes include enhanced
worker productivity in informal agriculture where the majority of Zambians still work. The WBG has
primarily supported Job Access through targeted interventions in lagging regions. Further, the combined
portfolios of the WBG and Let’s Work Partners show greater coverage of a range of Job Quality and Job
Access outcomes. Areas for future support to improve job outcomes include macroeconomic and
regulatory support, skills development, and targeted support for vulnerable populations and youth in
particular. In addition, projects need to be reinforced by sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems
tracking results explicitly related to jobs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report reviews the World Bank Group (WBG) portfolio in Zambia focused on jobs, referred to as
the Jobs Portfolio,1 in order to assess what the WB can do differently to support future job-rich growth.
The portfolio review covers 32 closed, active, and pipeline World Bank (WB) lending and International
Financial Corporation (IFC) investment projects related to jobs, which WBG teams articulated during
design. The selected projects took place in FY 2006-162, and represent 65 percent of the total WBG
portfolio in Zambia during this period. The WBG Jobs Group conducted this analysis in combination with
the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic3 that details the country’s jobs challenges from a macro, household, and firm
perspective, and a sectoral perspective of job creation potential in agribusiness value chains.4 This work
provides a basis for prioritizing job outcomes most relevant in Zambia. By analyzing trends and gaps in the
portfolio, this review identifies areas where the WBG could address Zambia’s jobs priorities in line with
the Government of the Republic of Zambia’s strategies and policies related to employment.5

The basis for this portfolio review is an evaluative tool known as the Jobs Conceptual Framework (JCF),6
which helps visualize the links between project interventions and job outcomes in a map of the portfolio
within a matrix. The JCF considers the types of interventions that the WBG has supported and their
potential link to outcomes of (a) job creation in the private sector (Job Creation); (b) improvements in the
quality of informal sector jobs (Job Quality); and (c) lower barriers to access jobs for vulnerable population
groups (Job Access).

The analysis highlights that the WBG Jobs Portfolio related to jobs in Zambia has focused on the
facilitating factors that contribute to job outcomes. The WBG Jobs Portfolio has largely focused on
enhancing access to/working of product markets (71 percent of the reviewed portfolio) and firm
performance and investment (62 percent).7 These are considered intermediate results in the JCF, in that
they are necessary conditions for jobs but do not directly create jobs, improve job quality, or connect
people to jobs. Definitions of job outcomes, including intermediate-level results to jobs, are in Annex D.



1 The total WBG portfolio  in Zambia includes 49 projects and has a total budget of $1.9 billion. The WBG Jobs Portfolio represents
65 percent of this portfolio, as regards the number of projects, and 80 percent, as regards the budget amount. The Jobs Portfolio
is defined as projects indicating Jobs as a theme in WBG systems as of June 30, 2016, and those identified by the Jobs Group as
having an explicit and substantive focus on a jobs challenge. For additional information on the jobs-relevant sample, see Annex
A.
2 The WBG fiscal year is defined as July 1 through June 30. Fiscal year (FY) 2016, for instance, refers to July 1, 2015 through June

30, 2016.

                                                                                                                                  7
The range of WBG interventions has contributed to these job outcomes for Zambia (see Figure 1)8:

                                Job Creation: Multiple interventions in the WBG portfolio (66 percent of the reviewed portfolio)
                                 have sought to contribute to at least one of the three outcomes related to Job Creation: job
                                 creation by employers in the formal sector, new enterprises, and entrepreneurship/self-
                                 employment. Analysis shows just 28 percent have focused on job creation by employers in the
                                 formal sector.
                                Job Quality: Outcomes related to improving job quality were in nearly half of total interventions
                                 related to jobs (47 percent). These interventions are particularly focused on informal agriculture,
                                 where the majority of Zambians still work. Under Job Quality, nearly 57 percent of WBG funding
                                 relates to earnings and livelihoods opportunities and over 39 percent to the enhancement of
                                 worker productivity, particularly among poor farmers.
                                Job Access: Improving access and opportunities for jobs was noted in nearly two-thirds of the
                                 total portfolio by committed investment amounts and about 40% of the portfolio by project
                                 count. There was limited focus on improving labor force participation and the working of the labor
                                 market.

Intermediate outcomes, as noted, are the focus of the WBG Jobs Portfolio in Zambia in the relative
short- to medium-term, with contributing effects to the higher-level outcomes in Job Creation, Job
Quality, and Job Access. Given that intermediate outcomes are more easily achievable within a given
project timeframe, it seems unsurprising that many projects have focused on supporting conditions for
private sector development as a precursor to job outcomes. Similarly, WBG results measurements have
focused on articulating intermediate outcomes.

8 The percentage shares of the total WBG portfolio in Zambia related to jobs do not sum to 100% since a given project-level
intervention may affect multiple job outcomes.

                                                                                                                                                  8
The WBG Zambia Jobs Portfolio analysis shows a concentration of activities in the energy and mining
infrastructure, representing the number of interventions and committed lending volumes. In terms of
number of interventions, projects with a component of financial access and entrepreneurship account for
a substantial share of the portfolio.9 Analyzing the portfolio according to committed lending amounts
yields a slightly different picture. There is greater focus on transport (22 percent of the total lending
allocation but 12.5 percent of number of interventions) and skills and training (25 percent). Both the
number and volumes of interventions must be taken into account given the often disproportionately large
investment volumes in infrastructure. Many sub-sectors within infrastructure often require explicit
thinking on jobs beyond direct effects such as in the construction of a new project.

The Jobs Portfolio of the Let’s Work Partnership10 (LWP) partners (referred to as donors) in Zambia have
focused more on Job Quality and Job Access outcomes. Of the 10 donor projects reviewed, the focus is
primarily on activities that support micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) development to raise
productivity with a focus on supporting linkages to agricultural value chains from rural, poorer parts of
the country. Examples include linking large commercial agro-processors, often in Lusaka, with smallholder
farmers and agribusinesses in remote markets across Zambia to improve access for agricultural inputs,
products, and financing. The activities of the LWP in the agriculture and agribusiness sector are diverse
but have a common theme of supporting jobs through more and better opportunities for smallholder
farmers in particular. Similarly, value chain development efforts are underway to support Zambia’s
building construction sector’s linkages to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with potential to create
jobs for youth.11

The analysis highlights several gaps in the WBG portfolio that require particular focus for a jobs strategy
in Zambia: macroeconomic/regulatory support, skills development beyond selected sectors, and
targeted support for vulnerable populations. Currently, only three projects12 target youth, with just over
$96 million or 6.4 percent of the portfolio despite Zambia’s demographics challenge. Further, the areas
where the WBG has concentrated activities typically lack job metrics at the project level. While the use of
indicators in project results frameworks has not been a corporate requirement, it is challenging to
articulate the contribution of WBG activities toward jobs solutions without tracking job-related results. In
addition, impact evaluations could be an area for investment in order to assess the longer-term and
higher-level results on jobs that are often difficult to attribute to project activities, such as jobs created.

To support a new generation of WBG operations focused on solutions for jobs, this review makes a
number of policy and operational recommendations:

        Macro-fiscal stabilization: As WBG and LWP engagement in macro and regulatory support is
         limited, the WBG could ramp up support to the government to foster inclusive growth and job
         creation, for instance, in the context of the Seventh National Development Plan. A Development
         Policy Operation (DPO) series focused on jobs as a cross-cutting topic could be one way to support
         macro-fiscal adjustments.
        Skills and education: Targeted support in human capital development is needed beyond the focus
         of the current portfolio on agricultural training. Expanding access to technical and vocational
         education and training (TVET) and improving the quality of secondary education can help meet
         growing demand for skills in the construction and tourism sectors.

        Infrastructure investments: The WBG should maintain the portfolio’s focus on energy, transport,
         and irrigation infrastructure. This is particularly important for rural and lagging areas in order to
         create access to markets. Increased consideration of job outcomes in project design and
         implementation can further enhance the impact of infrastructure interventions on jobs results,
         such as income and job opportunities in secondary towns.
        Spatial development/value chain development: High-potential value chains, such as agribusiness
         and construction, hold great potential for jobs results. Greater investments will be required to
         create market linkages that unlock job creation, result in productivity growth, and encourage
         labor mobility.
        Job opportunities for the most vulnerable: There should be greater focus on vulnerable groups,
         especially on youth, women, and lagging regions. Youth (aged 15-24) are a significant and
         increasing share of the working population, and are becoming less likely to be employed.13 Explicit
         attention is needed to ensure activities designed as jobs solutions for youth, and particularly girls.
         Women are less likely to find private waged work, less likely to be self-employed farmers, and
         much more likely to be unpaid family workers. In addition, geographical targeting may need
         consideration as the WBG is not active in select areas of high poverty density, such as the Northern
         Province.
As a cross-cutting recommendation, projects need to be reinforced by sound monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) systems tracking results related to jobs, including but not limited to Job Creation. A prospective
causal chain linking WBG activities to job outcomes must be examined, which can help with both assessing
progress in achieving results on jobs over time and designing data collection systems with clients. In
addition, teams may need to ramp up investing in impact evaluations to measure jobs created, changes
in worker productivity, incomes and poverty status, and gender and youth disaggregated analysis for job
access to shed light on the effectiveness of various WBG interventions for jobs.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report reviews the World Bank Group (WBG)’s portfolio in Zambia that is jobs-relevant, referred to
as the Jobs Portfolio, in order to examine what the WBG can do differently to support future job-rich
growth.14 The review identifies areas of focus over the past decade and gaps in the WBG portfolio in
Zambia that should be considered when planning future lending and investments. This analysis will inform
the forthcoming Country Partnership Framework15 (CPF) by providing guidance on the operations in
Zambia that could be prioritized for supporting the jobs agenda. The report also aims to identify how
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools can support effective design and implementation of jobs-focused
projects. The WBG Jobs Groups conducted this analysis in combination with the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic16
that details the country’s jobs challenges, and with a study of value chain potential for job creation.17 By
analyzing trends and gaps in the portfolio, the review points to areas where the WBG could address
Zambia’s jobs priorities, in response to the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ)’s strategies and
policies related to employment.

This portfolio review draws on a new evaluative tool that the WBG’s Jobs Group developed: the Jobs
Conceptual Framework (JCF). The JCF18 is an overarching framework that links common WBG
interventions with their potential to affect jobs-related outcomes. These outcomes focus on three
dimensions: (a) creating job opportunities in the formal sector (Job Creation); (b) enhancing quality and
productivity in the informal sector (Job Quality); and (c) promoting access to jobs for women, young
people, and the bottom 40 percent (Job Access). Job Access also refers to job access in lagging regions
that have limited natural, human, or productive capital endowments, or are in geographic locations with
limited connectivity. In addition, select intermediate outcomes for jobs are included, as these are often
preconditions for achieving results related to Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access. Figure 2 elaborates
on these jobs-related outcomes, and Annexes C and D provide definitions of the job interventions and job
outcomes, respectively. The WBG analyzed a range of interventions based on a typology across macro-,
meso-, and micro-levels targeting individuals and firms.




14 This report uses the World Development Report 2013 definition of a job, which comprises various types of income-generating
activities, including informal wage work, self-employment, farming, and sustainable livelihoods.
15 A Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is the central tool of management and the board for reviewing and guiding the WBG’s

country programs and gauging their effectiveness. The CPF identifies the key objectives and development results through which
the WBG intends to support a member country in its efforts to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner. The CPF then outlines a selective and flexible program that will help the country achieve the CPF objectives over a five-
year period.

This analysis covers jobs-relevant World Bank (WB) lending and International Financial Corporation
(IFC) investment projects over FY 2006-16, and active projects and programs of the Let’s Work
Partnership (LWP) as of 2016.19 This includes 32 closed, active, and pipeline WB lending and IFC
investment projects related to jobs in FY2006-16, representing 65 percent of all projects in the country in
this period (80 percent of the total amount invested), and 10 LWP projects. Jobs projects in the WBG
portfolio include projects the WBG teams have tagged indicating jobs as a key theme;20 and projects the
Jobs Group has reviewed as having an explicit and substantive link to job outcomes.21 The LWP’s Jobs
Portfolio was identified through desk review of publicly available project information to identify relevance
to jobs. The portfolio identified as job-relevant was then validated with respective LWP institutions in
Zambia: the African Development Bank (AfDB), the U.K. Department for International Development
(DFID), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency (SIDA), and the Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation. Annex A provides details on the
methodology used in this portfolio review.


19 This review analyzes the jobs focus of the operational lending and investment portfolio and associated outcomes, and therefore

does not include the WB’s Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) work. For the purpose of consistency across WB and IFC adviso ry
engagements, IFC advisory projects have been excluded, even though it is recognized that many are client-facing and may be
jobs-relevant.
20 Projects that are tagged in WBG systems with the jobs theme have an explicitly stated and substantive link to creating more,

better, and/or inclusive jobs.
21 The identification of projects as related to jobs by the Jobs Group is based on an in-depth review of project design and results

frameworks articulated by WBG teams in project documents.

2. ZAMBIA COUNTRY AND JOBS CONTEXT
This report presents analysis within the country and jobs contexts in Zambia, to provide a perspective
on recent economic trends with implications for jobs policies and programs. This section details the main
findings of the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic regarding the Zambian economy in general and the labor market
in particular, relevant to the portfolio review. The aim is to highlight the key job outcomes in the JCF where
particular focus is needed in the context of Zambia’s jobs challenges.

Zambia’s economy has been growing at a sufficient pace to create employment for the youthful
population, but is failing to create enough good jobs in high-productivity sectors. Despite a rapidly
growing workforce and unprecedented economic growth from 2000 to 2013, the headcount poverty has
not improved. The proportion of people falling below $1.90 per day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP)
(i.e., the international poverty line) rose to 64 percent in 2010, despite annualized average real economic
growth of nearly 9 percent. The jobs created in this period have been mostly in low-productivity sectors,
as the economy remains largely rural, agricultural, and informal.

Economic transformation is underway, based on structural change, urbanization, and formalization22,
but progress has been slow, and productivity is declining. Employment in Zambia has been shifting to
urban-based jobs in services and, to a lesser extent, industry. At the same time, the rural economy seems
to be formalizing, with an increase in formal jobs in agriculture, presumably on commercial farms and in
agro-processing. Labor productivity in agriculture is a key determinant of prosperity for the rural poor, as
more than 50 percent of Zambian workers and around 80 percent of poor Zambians are in agriculture,
according to the 2010 population census. Annualized average growth in value added per employee in
agriculture in Zambia was negative and declining until 2008. Only after 2008 did average labor productivity
in agriculture begin to grow, but movement of labor out of agriculture and into services and industry
caused part of the increase.

Many new jobs are in the informal sector in urban centers, where underemployment23 is rising,
especially for youth. It has been mostly young people who moved to the urban areas and found
employment in the service sectors. There have been healthy signs of increases in the shares of both formal
and waged jobs in Zambia. However, the bulk of the new jobs in urban-based services are in the informal
sector. By 2012 in urban areas, over 90 percent of youth underemployment was in service sectors,
compared with around 40 percent in 2008. The average number of hours worked by an informal service
worker in urban areas fell as more and more young people moved to towns and cities.

Consequently, earnings gaps in Zambia have widened. This includes earnings gap between formal and
informal workers, between rural and urban workers, between regions in the country, and between
unskilled and skilled workers. Women, especially young women, are moving into services or staying in
unproductive agriculture. Gaps also widened between public sector workers and the private sector, as the

22 In 2010 the data suggest that only 17 percent of Zambian employment was in waged work, and of this only 13 percent was
formal and just 7 percent was private and formal (6 percent, roughly half of the formal waged workers, were public sector
workers). Merotto, 2017.
23 Underemployment is defined as working less than 35 hours per week. Merotto, 2017.



                                                                                                                      14
government granted quite generous pay rises. These dual trends – in productivity and earnings – are
reflected in rising inequality in Zambia. They also partially explain why, despite globally high gross
domestic product (GDP) growth, Zambia has been less successful in reducing poverty than several African
countries whose economies have grown more slowly.

Zambia will need to create more formal jobs and improve the productivity of informal jobs. In the
context of slowing growth, lower copper prices, and lower tax revenues, government policies need to
prioritize job outcomes. The three pillars of recommendations of the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic24 in support
of Zambia’s jobs strategy are structured around desired job outcomes of Job Creation, Job Quality, and
Job Access:

           Job Creation: More jobs are required in the formal sector. In order to achieve this, the country
            needs a stable macro-fiscal framework and a business environment that allows existing firms to
            grow and encourages new firms to be created. Moreover, sectoral support should be provided to
            targeted value chains, and human capital development needs to be prioritized to expand
            secondary school enrolment and to strengthen technical and vocational education and training
            (TVET).
           Job Quality: Raising productivity is essential to achieve higher incomes and thus reduce poverty.
            This holds particularly true for agricultural productivity, as most of Zambia’s poor continue to be
            employed in agriculture. It is, therefore, important to improve rural energy, transport, and
            irrigation infrastructure; to strengthen smallholders’ market linkages; and to provide them with
            access to capital.
           Job Access: Youthful Zambia is growing rapidly, and the country will need to create jobs for those
            entering the labor market. Value chains such as the construction sector have great potential to
            create jobs for young people and should be supported in order to unlock growth. Moreover, it is
            important to create an environment in which young Zambians can create productive businesses.

The next section on portfolio analysis is in the context of these job outcomes, with emphasis on these
priorities for Zambia: more jobs of good quality with traditionally disadvantaged groups benefitting from
opportunities to work.

3. PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS
The WBG Jobs Portfolio25 in Zambia covers 32 closed, active, and pipeline WB lending and IFC
investment projects26 in the period FY 2006-16, with a total investment of $1.5 billion.27 This sub-set
represents 65 percent of the total number of projects in Zambia for this period (see Figure 3).28 The list of
jobs projects within the WBG Zambia portfolio is in Annex E.

This analysis of the WBG Jobs Portfolio in Zambia draws upon an evaluative tool known as the JCF. The
JCF was applied with inputs from the WBG country team, Jobs Group economists, and technical experts
in various sectors. Three dimensions of analysis are (a) the number of interventions affecting various job
outcomes as WBG teams articulated in the design stage; (b) the WB lending or IFC investment amounts in
U.S. dollars of these interventions per each job outcome; and (c) areas where the WBG and LWP are active
to identify concentrations and gaps. Each level of analysis is presented in a color-coded visual portfolio
map throughout this section (see Figure 6, Figure 8, and Figure 10).

25 This includes all projects tagged on jobs in the internal WBG system as of June 30, 2016. In addition, the Jobs Group reviewed
the Project Development Objective (PDO) and project description (components) in the project documentation in order to
identify jobs-relevant projects. The type of project documentation reviewed differed according to project status: for active
projects, the portfolio team reviewed Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) - or Project Concept Notes (PCNs) if no PADs were
available, for pipeline projects the team reviewed PCNs, and for closed projects the team reviewed Implementation Completion
and Results reports (ICRs). The project universe is obtained from Projects & Operations: The World Bank, available at
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/projects-portfolio; Annex A provides details on the methodology.
26 Due to their similarity in Project Development Objective (PDO) and design, the three phases of the Poverty Reduction

Support Credit (PRSC1-3) (P107218, P117370, and P126349) are combined for the purpose of this review. PRSC 1-3 are counted
as one project with an investment amount spanning the project sizes of all three phases.
27 The calculation of portfolio amounts takes into account the amount of World Bank Group commitments and excludes Trust

Funds and external donors’ shares.
28
   The total WBG portfolio in Zambia includes 49 projects and has a total budget of $1.9 billion. The WBG Jobs Portfolio
represents 65 percent of this portfolio, for the number of projects, and 80 percent of the budget amount (32 projects with
committed amounts of $1.5 billion).

                                                                                                                              16
The main sector focus of the WBG Jobs Portfolio in Zambia is agriculture (26 percent) and energy and
extractives (25 percent) (see Figure 5). Combined with transport (18 percent), these sectors account for
approximately 70 percent of the total value of projects. Active projects constitute 49 percent of the
analyzed investments ($728 million), 32 percent are in the pipeline ($478 million), and 19 percent are
closed ($284 million).

3.1 WBG OPERATIONS MAPPED TO JOB OUTCOMES
The portfolio has primarily focused on outcomes related to jobs at an intermediate level. Such
intermediate outcomes include access to/working of product markets; firm performance; and, to a lesser
degree, human capital development. The portfolio map in Figure 6 presents the 32 projects reviewed
disaggregated in 43 interventions, which refer to specific project components.29 The most frequently
supported interventions are in energy and mining infrastructure, access to finance or support to financial
systems, and livelihoods/CDD, 30 and skills and livelihoods (19% or 6 projects have components in one or

29 While the sample for the review contains 32 projects, some projects count toward multiple intervention types, resulting in 43
interventions overall.
30 Community-driven development (CDD) refers to an approach that gives control over planning decisions and investment

resources for local development projects to community groups. The World Bank has used the CDD approach across a range of
countries to support a variety of urgent needs: water supply and sewerage rehabilitation; school and health post construction,
nutrition programs for mothers and infants; building of rural access roads and support for micro-enterprise. Source: CDD

more of these interventions).31 The most frequently prioritized outcomes are access to and working of
product markets and firm performance / investment (71% and 62% by investment amount respectively)
as well as inclusive jobs (64% of investment) and earnings /livelihoods (57% of investment). The priority
job outcomes for Zambia identified in the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic are highlighted in yellow.

Intermediate Outcomes
Intermediate outcomes are deemed as jobs-relevant when they support firms’ ability to perform better,
grow, and hire more workers.32 This can be achieved by improving access to/working of product markets,


31  The count includes six energy/mining interventions, six finance/financial system interventions, six livelihoods/CDD
interventions, six skills and training interventions, five MSME/entrepreneurship interventions, four transport, four spatial
development, two irrigation, one land, one public administration and governance, one business regulation intervention, and one
trade and investment policy intervention.
32 In the case of infrastructure, the contribution toward jobs can be direct (those employed by the project itself) and indirect

(those supplying inputs to the project). For energy and mining, for instance, a further distinction could be made between workers
in the construction phase and those in the operation and maintenance phase. In most cases, the indirect effects are significantly
greater, but almost more challenging to measure in terms of the extent of earnings growth and the actual beneficiaries. The
availability of an input-output (IO) table would be needed to link the outputs of the project sector to all the supply sectors (indirect
effects) and calculate the various multiplier effects. In Zambia, efforts by government with the support of the ILO are underway
to develop a national social accounting matrix (SAM) using new IO tables that can support future such jobs estimation from such

                                                                                                                                    18
promoting firm performance, and strengthening human capital. From a jobs perspective, intermediate
outcomes are not the primary focus of this analysis, but are important to examine due to the high
concentration of WBG activities to date seeking to achieve these results. The main interventions aiming
to strengthen intermediate outcomes are investments in:

    -    energy/mining infrastructure;
    -    access to finance or support to financial system development;
    -    spatial development, including value chain development,; and
    -    MSME/entrepreneurship projects.

Infrastructure for energy is required to boost firm performance and the working of product markets.
Due to extensive and daily power cuts in the country,33 Zambian households, farms, and SMEs are
constrained in performance and expansion, which has implications for creating and maintaining
employment. A number of energy projects34 are focused on increasing electricity generation capacity. The
Guarantee for Scaling Solar Project, for instance, aims to “support the Government of the Republic of
Zambia (GRZ) to increase its electricity generation capacity and diversify its electricity generation
resources.”35 Existing and potential electricity consumers are expected to benefit as the excess generation
capacity from reduced load shedding will connect additional consumers to electricity.

Yet while this review included many of the energy projects as relevant to jobs, few track outcomes on jobs
in their results frameworks. As with many jobs projects reviewed, jobs indicators may not have been
available to select from at the time of project design; the results chain to job outcomes may have been
indirect; or monitoring such data may not have been feasible. Without supporting data, it is not possible
to determine whether employment, productivity, or the profile of workers among beneficiary firms have
changed.

WBG support to enhancing firm performance includes interventions for access to finance, such as IFC
investments in Zambian financial institutions.36 The ZANACO project is an example of a project
contributing to the jobs agenda through increasing access to finance for SMEs, especially in the
agricultural sector. 37 It aims to expand lending in less developed and rural regions of Zambia, where many
farmers and SMEs face difficulties in accessing working capital for inputs and infrastructure to grow their
enterprises. While jobs are not explicitly mentioned in project documents, IFC’s investment is

33 A growing shortfall in energy supply has been exacerbated in 2015 by a reduction in hydroelectric generation due to low water

levels at the country’s main reservoirs. This has increased power outages and impacted on all aspects of the economy,
contributing to slower economic growth in 2015 and higher production costs. Through 2016, ZESCO, the state energy company,
has expanded rolling black-outs (load-shedding) to at least eight hours per day on a rotational basis for the majority of its
household, commercial, and industrial consumers. Source: World Bank. 2015c. 6th Zambia Economic Brief: Powering the Zambian

strengthening Zambia’s agricultural finance market, which is arguably an important outcome for SMEs to
access finance, grow, and create jobs. This is representative of IFC’s work in the sector, which has focused
on improved access to financial markets more broadly, rather than on targeted direct support for SME
performance for job creation.

Multiple WBG interventions target economic empowerment and sustainable livelihoods for Zambians,
yet there is a limited focus on developing human capital.38 The Girls’ Education and Women’s
Empowerment and Livelihoods Project39 is just one example that focuses on developing the human capital
of poor and vulnerable women and girls. For working age women, the project aims to increase the
productivity of their livelihood activities and, through this, their earnings. Further, the project encourages
young girls to complete their secondary education by covering schooling fees. The project invests in
understanding solutions to jobs challenges through an impact evaluation, including on how different types
of capital (financial, human, social) contribute to women’s long-term earnings, helping to assess
contributions to Job Quality and Job Access outcomes.

Job Creation
Job Creation, as specified under the JCF, includes increasing job creation in the formal sector, supporting
the creation of new enterprises, and promoting entrepreneurs/self-employed. This discussion primarily
focuses on job creation in the formal sector as a priority sub-outcome for Zambia, based on
recommendations from the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic. The contribution in the portfolio to new enterprises
and entrepreneurship/self-employed is also analyzed.

A range of interventions support job creation in the formal sector, predominantly targeted by spatial
development interventions that include a specific aim to strengthen spatial connectivity,
agglomeration, or value chains. While investments in financial, transport, energy, and irrigation
infrastructure contribute to job creation in the formal sector, with one or two interventions each, spatial
development is the most frequently occurring type of intervention, with four. The sectoral focus of these
interventions is agribusiness, as projects aim to strengthen the supply chains of successful agribusinesses,
while expanding employment opportunities. For instance, the Agrivision project40 supports the large-scale
commercial farming of wheat, soy, maize, and milling. It aims to transfer technical knowledge on farming
best practices and contributes to direct employment for over 670 employees in the firm’s Zambia
operations. The construction sector presents another high-potential value chain for job creation.
Additional WBG support for this sector could unlock earning opportunities, especially for poorer Zambians
with lower education levels and youth.

Investments in energy infrastructure primarily address facilitating the creation of new enterprises, and
support to MSMEs primarily targets supporting entrepreneurs/self-employed. As noted, power outages
constitute a major constraint for existing firms and similarly raise the transaction costs to create new

enterprises. Five interventions in energy/mining infrastructure target this issue, such as the recently
approved Guarantee for Scaling Solar Project41 that seeks to address power shortages by increasing the
reliability and security of electricity supply. MSME/entrepreneurship interventions primarily target the
outcome of entrepreneurs/self-employed. Often in the agricultural sector, these projects equip potential
entrepreneurs with knowledge and capital in support of self-employment. The Livestock Development
and Health Project42 is an interesting example of a project that provides support to self-employed
smallholder producers. Rehabilitation of livestock infrastructure, such as slaughter facilities, and on-farm
investments are providing opportunities for processing and marketing by agricultural entrepreneurs.

Job Quality
The analysis highlights the fact that Job Quality outcomes tend to receive less attention than Job
Creation outcomes. The contribution of interventions toward sub-outcomes of Job Quality shows that
there are 30 percent fewer projects with components targeting results related to worker productivity,
working conditions and benefits, and earnings/livelihoods, compared to those related to Job Creation.
The Jobs Diagnostic points to the fact that most Zambians have jobs, but they are often of poor quality in
low-productivity, informal agriculture. This paper’s discussion, therefore, focuses on results for worker
productivity.

A combination of spatial development43, irrigation infrastructure interventions, skills and training, and
MSME/entrepreneurship (with two interventions each) address worker productivity. The Zambia
Agribusiness and Trade Project44 is an example of a spatial development intervention to promote
agricultural value chains. The project aims to increase productivity for smallholders and agribusiness SMEs
by strengthening market linkages with leading buyers, and by providing support to meet commercial
standards. Productivity increases are then expected to lead to firm growth and job creation among new
and existing SMEs, as well as to increased income for smallholders.45 Similarly, the Irrigation Development
and Support Project46 seeks to increase agricultural productivity among smallholder farmers. In addition
to expanding irrigation infrastructure, the project comprises a training program to enable the
establishment of water user associations and producer organizations. The project also seeks to equip
smallholders with the knowledge necessary to negotiate with commercial partners as their production
practices and yields improve.

Job Access
The WBG has supported access to income-generating opportunities through targeted interventions in
lagging regions. Overlaying the geographical focus areas in the WBG portfolio on a poverty map of Zambia
(see Figure 7) shows where vulnerable groups are targeted for support. While the map shows that, in
absolute terms, poverty is concentrated in areas with higher population density, the WB’s poverty analysis

notes that poverty rates are significantly higher in rural areas.47 Rural communities along the Zambezi
basin in the western and southern zones are among the poorest in the country. The Zambia Strengthening
Climate Resilience Project48 focuses on these areas that are susceptible to recurrent floods, droughts, and
socio-economic isolation. The project is intended to maximize the use of local labor, and its results
framework tracks the person-days of labor generated through the rehabilitation and maintenance of
canals.

In addition, the WB’s support for environmental remediation activities focuses on known contaminated
pollution hotspots in Kabwe and the Copperbelt Province in support of livelihood generation
opportunities for local communities. The Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and
Improvement Project49 seeks to reduce exposure to hazardous employment activities by providing
alternative livelihood opportunities within these vulnerable communities. In municipalities such as Kabwe
and Kitwe, which are some of Zambia’s poorest areas, with unemployment rates as high as 75 percent,
the WB, in collaboration with IFC, among others, is looking at economic activities for those currently
without access to good, safe jobs; such activities include agricultural land restoration, community-based
greening activities, and waste management. While aspects of improving job quality and access are part of
the project design through the specific interventions, they are reflected in results measurement to a lesser
extent. Annex B provides additional information on the project’s design and M&E recommendations.

Regionally, the WB is working to improve smallholder productivity in the Eastern, Western, and
Southern provinces, but gaps remain in the Northern region. While the smallholders are concentrated in
these selected areas, much of the agro-processing industry is concentrated in the central corridor from
Copperbelt to Livingstone. Identifying opportunities to strengthen backward linkages to the supply chains
of these firms would be important from a sustainable livelihoods/jobs perspective. Moreover, the WB is
currently not engaged in the Northern region, one of the poorest in the country.

3.2 WBG COMMITMENT AMOUNTS MAPPED TO JOB OUTCOMES
The WBG has allocated more funding to Job Quality and Job Access outcomes than the number of
interventions would indicate. Figure 8 shows the total value of interventions contributing to job
outcomes, and can be compared to the number of interventions in Figure 6. Three transport infrastructure
interventions, or 9 percent of all projects, address earnings/livelihoods outcomes, for instance, yet the
committed investment amount is $255 million, or 17 percent of all investments. The analysis is based on
the $1.5 billion invested in Zambia’s jobs-focused operations since 2006.




50   Note: Of 32 interventions in the WBG Jobs Portfolio, 13 had a component targeting vulnerable groups.

                                                                                                            23

From the perspectives of Zambia’s priority outcomes – job creation, worker productivity, and access and
opportunity – these differences from analysis of the amount of WBG commitments by intervention are
important:

        Job creation in formal sector: The WBG has invested a relatively smaller amount in job creation,
         according to the number of interventions. This is predominantly due to the relatively small
         investment amounts allocated to spatial development interventions, which represent the most
         frequent intervention type.

        Worker productivity: This priority has received a larger share of commitment amounts than the
         number of interventions suggests. The large investment amounts for irrigation/water
         infrastructure interventions explain this difference. The Zambia Irrigation Development Project52,
         for instance, amounts to $115 million, while IFC’s Zambeef Expansion Project53, which aims to
         expand the firm’s irrigation capacity, amounts to $70 million.



51 The presented analysis is based on projects’ commitment amounts, which may differ from actual disbursement amounts. The
prioritization of outcomes and intervention types is therefore based on original project design.

       Access and opportunity for jobs: A relatively larger investment amount is allocated to this
        outcome, according to the number of interventions. This is primarily due to large transport
        infrastructure interventions that benefit lagging regions. Analyzing targeted population groups
        shows that there is little focus on youth employment, in spite of Zambia’s demographics challenge
        (see Figure 9).

3.3 WBG AND DONOR OPERATIONS MAPPED TO JOB OUTCOMES
The combined WBG and donor portfolios show greater coverage of Job Quality and Job Access
outcomes, primarily driven by MSME, and entrepreneurship, and skills and training interventions (see
Figure 10). Both DFID and ILO have a high concentration of MSME and entrepreneurship-focused activities
to support the growth of worker productivity and access to jobs. These interventions seek to improve the
access to markets and firm performance for SMEs (intermediate outcomes), and to promote job creation
among existing enterprises. DFID’s Private Enterprise Programme, for instance, seeks to create over
26,500 jobs by 2019 by supporting SMEs with business development services and supply chain linkages.




                                                                                                                    25
Figure 10

Additional activities of donors’ jobs projects in Zambia include:

       Promoting MSME/entrepreneurship in key sectors for jobs. DFID and SIDA provide funding for
        the non-governmental organization (NGO) Musika, in support of MSME and entrepreneurship for
        earnings/livelihoods and access and opportunity for jobs. Operating across the country in lagging,
        rural areas, the NGO links smallholders to commercial partners and supports them with
        technology adoption and investments in productivity-enhancing assets, so that they can meet the
        standards of corporate partners. Musika works with IFC client Zambeef, among others, to support
        dairy smallholders in Mongu in the Western Province. In this context, Zambeef will support the
        construction of a milk processing plant, train small-scale dairy farmers on good animal husbandry,
        and provide a market for smallholders’ products.

       Targeting youth entrepreneurship in labor-intensive agricultural sectors. The ILO’s focus on
        decent work is tailored to the development of sustainable livelihoods for young women and men
        in rural areas of Zambia through the promotion of MSMEs. The Rural Youth Enterprise for Food
        Security initiative (branded as YAPASA) includes a focus on local production systems to unlock
        youth entrepreneurship as an engine of employment creation and to boost food security, for



                                                                                                       26
         example, by increasing production quantities. The initiative focuses on the soy bean and
         aquaculture sectors, two rural value chains with large job creation potential.

        Supporting SMEs in the construction value chain. The ILO’s Zambia Green Jobs Programme is
         another example of an MSME and entrepreneurship intervention providing access and
         opportunity for jobs. The program provides business development services, access to finance, and
         skills development to support MSMEs in becoming more productive and competitive in order to
         grow and create more decent jobs. More specifically, the objective is to “create at least 5,000
         decent green jobs particularly for young people and improve the quality of at least 2,000 jobs in
         MSMEs, which in turn will improve the incomes and livelihoods of at least 8,000 households that
         depend on the building construction sector.”54

        Offering skills and training on agricultural best practices for smallholders to raise productivity.
         The AfDB Livestock Infrastructure Support Project55 combines the development of livestock
         infrastructure with a skills and training component to “improve smallholder livestock production,
         productivity, market linkages and income of livestock farmers.” Farmers are trained in improved
         livestock rearing technologies, farmer organization, and community mobilization. They further
         obtain improved access to livestock service centers, milk collection centers, livestock marketing
         and slaughter facilities, and rural access roads. This engagement is expected to enhance worker
         productivity and earnings/livelihoods, thus contributing to outcomes on job quality.

The spatial focus of WBG and donor activities is complementary. Where the WBG is not active, such as in
the Northern region, donors such as AfDB are present. In Zambia’s Northern region, the Luapula and
Northern Provinces have some of the poorest wards in the country, are mostly rural, and have more than
50 percent of residents who are unable to satisfy basic food requirements.56 The AfDB Livestock
Infrastructure Support Project57 is located in the Northern and Muchinga Provinces and, as previously
explained, follows an integrated model that combines infrastructure development with skills and training
interventions.



3.4 JOBS-RELEVANCE OF WBG M&E SYSTEMS
Project performance is measured against the benchmark of results frameworks, but teams often lack
resources on jobs measurement and are discouraged from articulating links to jobs in their project
objective statements and results frameworks. Therefore, it is crucial to develop jobs-relevant M&E
systems with project implementation units (PIUs) in government to achieve the full potential of jobs
interventions. The WBG broadly and the Jobs Group specifically have been working to strengthen the jobs
focus in project M&E systems with task teams and clients.

Evidence from the portfolio suggests that jobs metrics are scarcely tracked in closed and active projects,
especially within the infrastructure sector. Many projects that impact the enabling environment for jobs
through energy or transport infrastructure currently do not capture jobs results in their results
frameworks. A few exceptions exist, such as irrigation projects that track increases in agricultural
productivity. In the future, it will be important to understand the employment rate in the targeted areas,
with the number of individuals employed, inactive, or unemployed; and for those working, the share of
farm versus non-farm jobs, which would help make the case that WBG activities are supporting better
jobs based on higher-productivity non-farm work.

Disaggregating indicators by gender is common across the portfolio, yet disaggregation by age has not
been mainstreamed. The results frameworks of reviewed projects generally disaggregate certain
indicators – in particular the number of beneficiaries – by participants’ gender. Monitoring the share of
young beneficiaries is not as common.




                                                                                                       28
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
To support a new generation of WBG operations focused on solutions for jobs and to further strengthen
the portfolio’s focus on Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access, the WBG should leverage IDA
resources in Zambia to support specific priority interventions that strongly impact jobs, and strengthen
results frameworks in projects. These recommendations on priority interventions reflect the structure of
the current portfolio. The JCF does not provide a theory of change, or elaborate on how a particular
activity will bring about results. The extent to which a given intervention is more or less relevant for
achieving an outcome related to jobs will vary based on the country, sectoral, and project context.



4.1 PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS
           Macro-fiscal stabilization: Additional focus on support to the GRZ can enable future inclusive
            growth and job creation, for instance, in the context of the Seventh National Development Plan.
            The portfolio analysis shows limited focus by the LWP in supporting targeted macroeconomic
            regulations to this end. Going forward, the WBG portfolio could include implementation support
            for necessary macro-fiscal adjustments where jobs-friendly revenue generation efforts are
            needed, potentially through a DPO series to support policy and institutional actions focused on
            jobs as a cross-cutting topic across sectors, such as energy and agriculture.

           Skills and education: Human capital development is at the very basis of obtaining a productive
            and well-paid job. Poor learning outcomes that have been stagnating for over a decade are
            indicative of structural quality challenges. Several projects reviewed do have skills and training
            dimensions,58 but they tend to be sub-components and limited to the agricultural sector. While
            this is valuable and important for agricultural productivity, broad-based skills development for
            Zambia’s youth will be necessary to find employment in higher-productivity sectors outside of
            agriculture. Improving the quality of secondary education and expanding access to tertiary
            education and the TVET system are therefore crucial to provide access to jobs, such as in the
            construction and tourism sectors. The pipeline Education Sector Enhancement Project59
            addresses some of these issues, such as providing access to higher secondary education and
            improving student learning in primary and lower secondary schools. Reinforcing these efforts and
            complementing them with a TVET component will be crucial to promote the human capital
            development required to underpin future development and job creation.

           Infrastructure investments: In Zambia, infrastructure-related activities, including energy,
            transport, and irrigation infrastructure, comprise nearly 60 percent of the total portfolio,
            measured by project size. Maintaining this focus will be important to improve access to markets
            and productivity growth in high-potential sectors for jobs, particularly in rural and lagging regions

58   Examples are the Irrigation Development Project (P102459) and the Strengthening Climate Resilience Project (P127254).

         outside of the central corridor from Copperbelt to Livingstone through Lusaka. Another possible
         area for the WBG and donors to consider investments is the information and communication
         technology (ICT) sector, where this review currently finds no engagements. Smallholders could
         benefit from well-designed ICT solutions that facilitate the delivery of information on market
         prices, production techniques, and weather- or pest-related early-warning communications.60
         However, current levels of human capital have to be taken into account when designing
         operational products, especially the high rate of illiteracy in rural areas, and particularly among
         women.

        Spatial/value chain development: Greater investment is needed in high-potential value chains
         for jobs, including agribusiness and construction, to support smallholder and SME productivity
         growth. While the portfolio shows a concentration in the number of spatial development
         interventions, the investment amounts are relatively low as they represent 6 percent of the total
         portfolio. This is particularly low since value chain development interventions often support
         enhancements to worker productivity, one of Zambia’s priority job outcomes. Support specifically
         targeting sectoral investments for jobs could include working with IFC investees to develop supply
         chains where more Zambian smallholders and SMEs benefit from market access and achieve
         productivity increases. Moreover, interventions that support secondary or small towns by
         promoting linkages of value chains will increase labor mobility, particularly in lagging areas. As
         urban centers develop that are closer to rural populations and more affordable than capital cities,
         financial and opportunity costs of labor mobility decrease. This encourages more individuals to
         consider moving for a job, which contributes to a more productive allocation of labor.

        Job opportunities for the most vulnerable: The analysis revealed a relatively low level of
         investment designed with vulnerable populations as target beneficiary groups. Only three
         interventions, with a little over $100 million, targeted youth, despite the well-noted demographic
         challenges in Zambia, especially with regard to youth employment. Similarly, improved
         geographical targeting is needed to consider areas of high poverty, such as the Northern Province,
         where the WBG is not currently engaged. High-potential opportunities include promoting the
         development of the building construction sector for youth employment, promoting women’s jobs
         in small animal husbandry, and maintaining the portfolio’s focus on rural entrepreneurship for
         women and youth in lagging regions.

A focus on simple project design and client capacity development is encouraged in order to ensure
effective, timely disbursement. The review of closed projects in the WBG portfolio found that client
capacity issues were a recurring difficulty.61 Moreover, data from the Country Management Unit (CMU)

60 World Bank.2015a. Supporting Women’s Agro-enterprises in Africa with ICT: A Feasibility Study in Zambia and Kenya . A World
Bank Study. Washington, DC: World Bank.
61 Five closed projects since 2006 in the WBG portfolio had positive ratings (one with a Satisfactory rating and four with a

Moderately Satisfactory rating), but do not necessarily indicate positive results related to jobs. For instance, the Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project “provided the rural communities with better access to (agriculture) markets, incom e-
generating opportunities, and essential social services.” However, this project showed shortcomings in terms of project
preparation and readiness for implementation. On the government’s side, there were issues of limited capacity due to delays in
appointing the board of directors and high staff turnover at road agencies. The Increased Access to Electricity Services Project
faced similar constraints of capacity shortcomings in the Rural Electrification Agency, one of the implementing agencies. The

                                                                                                                            30
indicate that a significant share of the active portfolio is at risk across a range of dimensions, such as
effectiveness delays, slow disbursement, and M&E.62 These findings may indicate that client capacity
development, in combination with simple project design, also requires investment to support job
outcomes.



4.2 JOBS-FOCUSED M&E SYSTEMS
Designing jobs-focused operations targeting results on Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access will
require greater focus on sound M&E systems that underpin their jobs impact. The WBG Jobs Group is
working with WB and IFC teams on mainstreaming the jobs agenda in lending and investment projects,
which will require a jobs lens to designing project M&E. The WBG Jobs Group is developing simple, jobs-
focused indicators as part of project monitoring and a Jobs M&E Toolkit.63 WB and IFC project teams are
also undertaking complementary jobs-focused impact evaluations.64 In order to achieve the full potential
of jobs-relevant interventions, it is recommended to:

        Embed jobs-related indicators in projects’ results frameworks. This will measure effects on jobs,
         based on a sound results chain linked to jobs. Articulating a clear results chain, where the job
         outcomes expected of a given intervention are based on research and evidence, is an important
         precondition to selecting indicators for tracking job outcomes. Table 1 provides a range of sample
         indicators.

                                      
                                     Number of newly created firms with at least one paid employees
                                      
                                     Number of self-employed project beneficiaries

 Connecting vulnerable            Labor force participation rate among project beneficiaries
 groups to jobs                   Average length of time for beneficiary firms to fill a vacancy, by type of

achieving development objectives.

64 Impact evaluations to capture higher-level job outcomes can include experimental and quasi-experimental designs, including

tracer surveys, value chain surveys, and other techniques suited for a given project or program context. In the case of IFC, there
are also examples of expanded appraisals among IFC investees, which seek to collect data on the status of employment in the
firm at baseline stage.

Annex B provides an in-depth look of how team task leaders (TTLs) can take a jobs perspective in the
project design and M&E plans through the use of job outcomes and indicators.

      Promote the disaggregation of indicators by age. Tracking job outcomes specifically for youth
       will be necessary to strengthen the portfolio’s inclusiveness dimension and to address Zambia’s
       demographics challenge. Where available, age-disaggregated data can be obtained from existing
       data sources such as Labor Force Surveys or project records, or should be included in the data
       collection instruments used to underpin project monitoring. While it is acknowledged that greater
       specificity in data collection entails additional time and costs, it might be justified to track project
       outcomes for this particularly important population group.

      Build capacity on M&E among client counterparts and implementing partners. Trainings to
       strengthen data collection capacity and to promote the selective use of impact evaluations will
       strengthen the evidence on the effectiveness of jobs interventions. Moreover, it is recommended
       to develop M&E information-sharing protocols within agencies, such as the Jobs Office in Cabinet
       Office, Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Ministry of National Development and Planning,
       and others, and thus help reduce the data collection burden for agencies.

ANNEX A: METHODOLOGY
This annex outlines the methodology the WBG Jobs Group used to review and map WBG projects65 to the
JCF, and how each version of the portfolio maps can be interpreted. The Jobs Group developed the
methodology for this portfolio review, based on A Jobs Conceptual Framework: Assessing World Bank
Group Interventions’ Links to Jobs (World Bank. 2017a, forthcoming. A Jobs Conceptual Framework:
Assessing World Bank Group Interventions’ Links to Jobs. A World Bank Study. Washington, DC: World
Bank.).

INTRODUCTION TO THE JCF
The JCF (see Table A1) articulates the link between an array of WBG interventions and job outcomes66.
One of the many purposes that the JCF serves is to assess the extent to which a given portfolio of
interventions aims at achieving specific job outcomes, and to identify gaps in the portfolio, areas where
further investments are needed, or operations that would need to be better coordinated.

Key Outcomes: What are the jobs results we seek?
The JCF reflects the main outcomes for jobs, organized under headings of Job Creation, Job Quality, and
Job Access (see Figure A1). The JCF represents a static snapshot of possible interventions and related
results, indicating areas with potential to be explored in more detail, rather than explaining how certain
interventions lead to specific results.

is based may vary.

Intermediate Outcomes. The JCF includes select intermediate outcomes that affect both labor supply and
labor demand. Interventions that aim at better working of product markets, improved investments, and
better firm performance are the main drivers of labor demand, while interventions aimed at fostering
human capital and employability will enhance labor supply. These intermediate outcomes in turn
contribute to final outcomes of Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access. The list is not exhaustive.

Job Creation outcomes relate to job creation for project beneficiaries, either directly or indirectly. Jobs
can be created directly, whether short- or long-term, for example, through public works or livelihoods.
More broadly, private sector firms create jobs, either by entry of new businesses or by growth and
expansion of existing firms, resulting in the hiring of more staff. In addition to wage employment, an
increase in entrepreneurship and self-employment create more jobs.

Job Quality outcomes encompass dimensions of job quality, including earnings, working conditions, and
benefits. Job Quality also includes worker productivity; the ability to perform better in the labor market
is an essential driver for earnings and firm productivity.

Job Access outcomes concern labor force participation, the functioning of labor markets, and access to
and opportunity for jobs, in particular for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market – women,
youth, and the bottom 40 percent, or for spatially disadvantaged population such as those in lagging
regions and in fragile and conflicted settings.

Key Interventions: What can we do to promote jobs?
In response to identified jobs challenges, the framework describes broad intervention categories that
affect job outcomes. An intervention can either be a project, or a “component,” since a given project may
contain several types of support (e.g., “skills and training” and “access to finance”). An intervention can
also influence several outcomes; for example, public works can both enhance labor force participation
and increase earnings.

While the list of interventions is not exhaustive, it covers a wide range of activities that are traditionally
most likely to affect the jobs agenda. The interventions can be interlinked, mutually dependent, and
reinforcing. More interventions improving macroeconomic conditions, such as public administration and
governance; taxation/fiscal policy; and trade and investment policy, generally at the national level, may
indirectly support the business environment and stimulate jobs, but it may be difficult to trace the direct
effect of job creation. Interventions affecting the “business environment” can be economy-wide or sector-
specific, industry-specific or geographic, but where targeted firms’ jobs results can be assessed. For
interventions at the micro-level, i.e., working directly with beneficiary firms or individuals, project
monitoring can measure attributable effects.

KEY STEPS OF PORTFOLIO REVIEW
The purpose of conducting a portfolio review using the JCF is to look at WBG and donor activities in a
given country through a jobs lens. The JCF serves as a structure to categorize the activities of individual
projects according to intervention type, capture the project’s expected outcomes, and visualize the
aggregate distribution of activities according to the number of interventions and level of spending across
jobs interventions and outcome types.


                                                                                                           35
The broad steps of the review are:

         1.   Defining the scope of the jobs-relevant portfolio under review.
         2.   Obtaining project documents that contain project information.
         3.   Identifying jobs-related interventions and outcomes based on project information.
         4.   Populating the JCF and creating portfolio maps.
         5.   Analyzing the jobs focus of the portfolio against the priorities identified in the Zambia Jobs
              Diagnostic.


Step 1. Defining the scope of the jobs-relevant portfolio under review
The reviewed portfolio is selected from the full universe of WBG Zambia portfolio over FY 2006-16 , a
period that covers approximately three phases of World Bank country frameworks in Zambia67, which
ensures the reviewed portfolio’s relevance to the status quo of the jobs agenda in the country. Out of the
full universe, jobs-relevant projects are selected for review. Jobs-relevant projects include projects tagged
using the Jobs Flag in WBG systems, defined as projects having an explicitly stated and substantive link to
the creating more, better, and/or inclusive jobs. In addition, the review covers projects that are not Jobs-
Flagged in the system but are nevertheless identified as jobs-relevant, based on the Jobs Group’s in-depth
review of the design, description, and results frameworks of the projects. The relevance of the selected
projects is further validated with WB and IFC country teams.

The scope of this review covers 20 WB Lending and 12 IFC Investment projects from FY 2006-16, as well
as 16 donor projects.68 Given the analytical nature of the WB Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) work
and the purpose of the review to strengthen the jobs focus of the operational portfolio, this review does
not include WB ASA work. For the purpose of consistency across WB and IFC advisory engagements, IFC
advisory projects were also excluded, while recognizing that many are client-facing and may be jobs-
relevant. The LWP portfolio was identified by electronic search for publicly available project information
using the Jobs Flag criteria, and validated by respective LWP institutions in Zambia.

Step 2. Obtaining project documents that contain project information.
Project documents are retrieved from WBG databases including Image Bank (for World Bank) and iDesk
(for IFC investment projects). More specifically, a review of varying sources of project information to
support the analytical work includes:

        For active, closed, and pipeline World Bank projects, Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) serve
         as the primary source of information that underlies the analysis.
        For pipeline projects69 where PADs are not yet available, Project Concept Note (PCNs) serve as
         primary source of information that underlies the analysis.
        For projects that have gone through restructuring, the Restructuring Papers are reviewed to
         ensure that the analysis captured the most up-to-date design and results framework of a project.
        The review refers to Implementation and Completion Reports (ICRs) to analyze the effectiveness
         and performance of closed projects where ICRs are available.

       For IFC investments, Board Papers serve as the primary source of information, while concept,
        approval, and commitment reports complement.

Step 3. Identifying jobs-related interventions and outcomes based on project information.
In order to categorize jobs intervention types and job outcomes, the Jobs Group reviewed the Project
Development Objective (PDO), project description (components), as well as the results frameworks in the
project documentation. The group then mapped projects based on standard definitions of job
intervention types (see Annex C) and job outcomes (see Annex D). One project can be mapped to multiple
intervention types if the project is composed of an array of diverse activities. Furthermore, a project could
be mapped to more than one intervention type if a single activity in a project fits into the criteria of
multiple intervention types, such as microfinance activities for entrepreneurs and SMEs which fit into the
Productive Assets–Finance/Financial Structures and MSME/Entrepreneurship category by nature. Often,
one intervention aims to affect multiple job outcomes along the intermediate, Job Creation, Job Quality,
and Job Access matrix.

Step 4. Populating the JCF and creating portfolio maps.
Once the Jobs Group identified the jobs intervention types and job outcomes of each project in the
portfolio, the data were populated into the JCF Excel tool which generates visualization of the portfolio
distributed across the JCF, referred to as portfolio maps. Each cell of the portfolio maps represents the
intensity of projects – that is, a greater number of interventions – that are mapped to a certain type of
jobs intervention with the aim of achieving a jobs outcome. Portfolio distribution is showcased through
two versions of portfolio maps: by number of interventions (see Figure 6 of the main text) and project
financial commitment (see Figure 8), respectively. The latter portfolio map (i.e., by project financial
commitment) accounted for the different commitment size of each project. Instead of counting the
number of interventions, a cell in the commitment portfolio map represents the total commitment (in US
dollars) mapped to a certain intervention and outcome.

Caveats: Some projects are captured more than once in the portfolio map, because one project can be
mapped to multiple intervention types and to multiple outcomes. Table A2 illustrates the case of counting
interventions more than once, using the example of transport infrastructure. The portfolio reviewed
includes a total of four transport infrastructure interventions, representing a commitment amount of
$330 million. Three of the four projects address the outcome Access to/Working of Product Markets,
representing $310 million; two projects representing $110 million address Job Creation by Employers;
three projects representing $255 million address Earnings/Livelihoods; and two projects representing
$220 million address Access to and Opportunity for Jobs. Since the interventions affect and count toward
different outcomes, the sum of investments addressing a specific outcome; i.e., $310 million, $110 million,
and $220 million exceed the total investment amount of $310 million. It is not possible to distribute
specific amounts to different outcomes, as an intervention contributes to multiple outcomes
simultaneously. The concentration of the lending amounts invested is therefore reflected in the darker
shades of blue accordingly, such as Access to/Working of Product Markets and Earnings/Livelihoods.

Step 5. Analyzing the jobs focus of the portfolio against the priorities identified in the Zambia Jobs
Diagnostic.
The visual map of the status of the WBG Jobs Portfolio in Zambia can be informative in itself. To serve as
a tool to identify areas that require greater attention and investment to support the jobs agenda, the
portfolio map was compared to the key priority outcomes identified in the Zambia Jobs Diagnostic. The
priorities identified in Zambia are centered on promoting job creation in the formal sector, improving
worker productivity, and enhancing access to jobs for women, youth, and the bottom 40 percent. Through
comparison with country jobs priorities, the review identified the challenges and opportunities associated
with the reviewed portfolio and further consolidated them into recommendations, as is discussed in the
main text of the report.

ANNEX B: EXAMPLES OF JOBS-FOCUSED
M&E IN WB PROJECTS
These three projects in the WB’s Zambia Jobs Portfolio are illustrative of opportunities to embed a jobs
lens in the design and M&E plans to support development outcomes on jobs.
Zambia Improved Rural Connectivity Project70
    Jobs Rationale: The Jobs Group team has found that most transport engagements focus on direct
       jobs according to local labor involved in construction and maintenance, and then those related to
       services and lower costs for firms (the second-order growth effects). The link between
       infrastructure investments and job creation has been less clear in the literature. However, there
       is some empirical evidence71 supporting the line of sight to poverty reduction through access to
       markets, enhanced productivity, and the flow of services and human capital. This context provides
       a justification for strengthening the jobs focus of infrastructure work in Zambia.
        Project Design: The Improved Rural Connectivity Project is an example of support aimed at
         improving the accessibility of communities in rural, lagging regions to jobs through more efficient
         road infrastructure. The primary component will be upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance
         of priority feeder road infrastructure in six provinces. The immediate beneficiaries are road users
         who will have reduced travel times and costs. In addition, rural farmers will have improved access
         to inputs and markets. Employment in road construction activities and related rural development
         will also have potential to create new income-generation opportunities among rural communities.
        Implications for M&E: Targeting accessibility and agricultural productivity is part of the project’s
         design related to Job Quality and Job Access, as in Table B1.

Bank of Chile. Working Paper 270; Khandker et al (2009) find that rural road investments reduce poverty, including through higher
agricultural production, higher wages, and lower input costs, and higher output prices (Khandker, S.R., Z. Bakht and G.B. Koolwal
(2009) The poverty impact of rural roads: evidence from Bangladesh. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 57(4), 685-
722); (2) Infrastructure development in Sub-Saharan Africa explains 1/2 of recent growth acceleration (Calderon, Cesar and Luis
Serven. 2010. Infrastructure in Latin America. World Bank. Policy Research Working Paper 5317); (3) An increase in infrastructure
investment equivalent to 1 percent of GDP would translate into an additional 3.4 million direct and indirect jobs in India,
1.5 million in the United States, 1.3 million in Brazil, and 700,000 in Indonesia. (McKinsey Global Institute, January 2013.

                                                                                                                             39
         From a jobs perspective, however, further attention is needed explicitly on measures of
         productivity gains related to improved connectivity to markets, particularly among rural farmers
         who comprise the majority of working Zambians. From a more jobs view specifically, it is
         important to understand the employment rate in the targeted areas prior to and after the
         interventions, according to the number of employed, inactive, or unemployed – and for those
         working, the share of farm vs. non-farm jobs.72 In addition, a beneficiary survey would shed light
         on the extent to which women, young people, and the bottom 40 percent are positively affected,
         and track earnings/income growth based on higher sales and output per worker.


Zambia Agribusiness and Trade Project73

        Jobs Rationale: The need for Zambia’s diversification program is reiterated in government policies
         and strategies related to jobs, at a time when the country needs to ramp up investments in key
         economic sectors, such as agriculture and services. Agribusiness and trade development can
         support better jobs for more Zambians, mostly women, and are key to increasing inclusive growth.
         Agro-based products can help diversify exports away from copper, and integrating smallholders
         into the supply chains of leading firms in these areas could – in principle - increase rural incomes
         as productivity increases.
        Project Design: The development objective is to contribute to increased market linkages and firm
         growth in agribusiness. Project interventions will have particular emphasis on improving the
         ability of emerging farmers and agribusiness SMEs to sustainably and commercially link into larger
         markets by structuring support around offtake opportunities that the private sector itself
         identifies as high potential. Targeted beneficiaries include small-scale, emerging farmers that
         could be integrated into value chains through enhanced productivity and SMEs that require
         supplier development support for linkages into supply chains of established end-markets and
         large buyers.
        Implications for M&E: The project seeks to affect intermediate outcomes related to jobs through
         enhanced farmer and SME performance in the agribusiness sector, which in turn supports
         entrepreneurship/self-employment, productivity, and earnings/livelihoods. Table B2 illustrates
         the jobs results expected based on project design.

important to understand the status of jobs over time.

                                                                                                                               40
            The theory of change for this type of engagement, namely public-private partnerships for
            agribusiness entrepreneurship, assumes that market links lead to higher value addition, growth,
            and earnings for(spatially proximate farmer groups. Those results should presumably have
            spillovers into the rural non-farm economy where individual producer groups benefit. Spatially
            proximate local economic development may also occur from livelihoods growth. An impact
            evaluation is planned to measure the expected longer term results. In particular, it will be
            important to understand how much vulnerable groups such as women, youth, and the bottom 40
            percent benefit, and the extent of job impacts.
Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and Improvement Project74

           Jobs Rationale: An important aspect of Zambia’s jobs challenge is support to vulnerable groups in
            rural and lagging regions. The vulnerability of populations affected by polluted mining areas
            cannot be overlooked, given the high rates of poverty incidence (an estimated 80 percent in the
            Central Province) and lack of access to good jobs (an estimated 75 percent unemployment rate).
            Residents often live in houses constructed of polluted materials, have poor health outcomes, and
            have little alternatives to income generation other than collecting scrap metals in contaminated
            sites.
           Project Design: Within this context, the forthcoming WB engagement in mining and
            environmental remediation seeks to “reduce environmental health risks including lead exposure
            to the local population in critically polluted mining areas in Kabwe, Kitwe, Mufulira and Chingola
            municipalities.” The project will support localized interventions, in the selected municipalities to
            undertake income-generation opportunities that will enhance community involvement in
            addressing environmental health risks, with specific attention to women and other vulnerable
            people in the community. The project does not attempt to address structural unemployment or
            lack of labor demand.
           Implications for M&E: Supporting opportunities for community-based enterprise development is
            important to promote income-generation activities outside of the hazardous areas. Table B3
            illustrates the intended results on earnings/livelihoods and access to and opportunities for jobs.

            Understanding the improved working conditions and labor force participation rate changes in the
            targeted areas over time would support the broader jobs-related story of the project. Supporting
            labor redeployment and employment services aimed at these local populations may be needed
            as complementary project activities. Examples of the kinds of support that may be needed include

on- and off-the-job education and training; temporary employment programs (public works) to
assist local communities with refurbishment of public infrastructure, support to schools, health
clinics, etc.; and business development services. In addition, baseline data collection is planned as
a priority in project M&E activities, which would ideally require tracking employment rates/labor
force participation in the targeted areas, earnings/income growth among beneficiaries, and
people with access to improved livelihood sources; and disaggregating key jobs-related measures
by gender and age.
