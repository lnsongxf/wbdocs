Executive summary
1.1. The capacity of institutions can enhance or constrain their ability to fulfil their
mandate and achieve intended outcomes. To assess the capacity of the nutrition service
delivery system in India, this study undertook a capacity assessment of the two key programs,
namely the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM) that form the mainstay of India’s nutrition delivery system. The ICDS is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) and was
restructured in 2012 to be implemented in a mission mode. However, the proposed
strengthened organizational structures at the national and state level are yet to be established.
The NRHM, a program of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), implements
several health services, including selected nutrition services. Overall, nutrition as a sector is
the responsibility of the MWCD, while the responsibilities for delivery of key nutrition
services are shared between the ICDS and NRHM.

1.2. Although several evaluations and assessments document the weaknesses in design and
implementation of the ICDS and the NRHM, a comprehensive institutional capacity
assessment of the two programs, particularly with respect to nutrition services has not yet
been undertaken, leaving a large gap. The present study is a first step in filling this gap.

1.3. The rapid expansion of the ICDS over the last few years, its recent restructuring and
strengthening, the launch of two additional programs for nutrition to be implemented using
the ICDS platform, namely the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) 1 and
SABLA,2 the approval of a multi-sectoral nutrition program in 200 high malnutrition burden
districts, and the World Bank supported ICDS Systems Strengthening and Nutrition
Improvement Project (ISSNIP) – all of which depend on the ICDS platform -- makes the
capacity assessment of the ICDS critical and timely.

1.4. The study takes a management approach to capacity assessment that looks at capacity
not in terms of what it is, but in terms of the factors that influence it. Such a definition helps
identify constraints to capacity as well as the measures aimed at building capacity. For the
purpose of this study, capacity is defined in operational terms. It lists the factors that must be
observed if an agency or system has full capacity. Thus, an organization or agency has the
capacity to deliver services only if it has:
 Effective leadership and management;
 An optimal division of labor and structure;
 Financial resources matching its mandate, managed and utilized fully and efficiently;
 Human resources, physical resources and information matching its operational
   requirements and it manages and utilizes all of these fully and efficiently; and
 Appropriate work practices and processes followed by its personnel.

The constraints to capacity in each of these areas have been assessed using operational
indicators (Table 1.1, chapter 1, Introduction). The study draws upon data from a review of
documentary material; semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs); and
systematic observation of selected service delivery.3 Much of the evidence is drawn from

   A pilot conditional cash transfer scheme launched in 2010 for pregnant and nursing mothers in 52 districts.

  A program for out-of-school adolescent girls launched in 2010 in 200 districts that inter alia provides nutrition counselling, food and
micronutrient supplements.

and two villages, with the states and districts drawn from those surveyed in the HUNGaMA Survey, 2011.

available publications, and the purpose of the FGDs was to validate and support the findings
from secondary data.

Key capacity constraints

1.      Capacity constraint due to inappropriate division of labor as assessed by
functional gaps, splits, overlaps, misplacements, differentiation and overload.
Conceptually, the institutional arrangements for delivery of direct nutrition services through
the two programs, the ICDS of the MWCD, Government of India (GoI) and the NRHM of the
MoHFW, GoI, optimizes the mutually synergistic services of the two departments. However,
it does impose the need for coordination. Both programs are community outreach programs,
target the same populations, and have common objectives in terms of reducing child mortality
and undernutrition. Moreover, since many nutrition interventions, such as micronutrient
supplementation, facility based treatment and management of children with severe acute
malnutrition are integral to the NRHM package of maternal and child health services together
with prevention and treatment of infection, it is appropriate to draw on these to complement
the nutrition services offered by the ICDS. Functionally, this does not constitute a split or
misplacement of functions and could in fact be a capacity enhancer if adequate coordination
mechanisms are functional. There is also scope for mutual synergies to be expanded beyond
what is currently defined, to achieve a reduction in child undernutrition.

Although the division of responsibilities for nutrition-related service delivery between the
ICDS and NRHM are clearly spelt out, with several coordination mechanisms defined and
institutionalized,4 adequate coordination between the two programs has continued to be a
problem. While well stated on paper, on-the-ground coordination remains poor, largely due to
weak supervision and management, inadequately defined work procedures, insufficient
training, inadequate understanding of ‘how to’ coordinate, and functional overload of staff
in both programs. This sub-optimal coordination has resulted in poor coverage and quality of
service delivery.

The division of labor within the ICDS constrains its capacity to deliver nutrition services.
Insufficient differentiation of critical functions and services, the lack of a dedicated
organizational home or dedicated person to manage the function or service have led to under-
developed and under-managed functions and services. Combined with the ICDS’ shortage of
staff, the insufficient functional differentiation also leads to functional overload on the
existing staff. Some functional splits also constrain capacity. For example, the training
function is split between the ICDS training institution, the National Institute of Public
Cooperation and Child Development (NIPPCD), and the training units in the MWCD and
the state ICDS directorates. The ICDS in Mission mode appears to address the issues of
inadequate differentiation and to reduce the functional overload at some levels. However, a
systematic functional and workload analysis has not yet been undertaken and it is, therefore,
not possible to assess the extent of workload optimization.

2.    Leadership capacity as assessed by the existence and quality of a conceptual
framework, vision, mission or strategy, and balance between continuity and change,
agenda overload and vacancies at the leadership level.

 The coordination mechanisms include monthly Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs) conducted jointly by the functionaries of both
programs, the establishment of Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs), joint planning and training.



                                                                  x
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



While at the national level India’s policy documents provide a comprehensive policy and
conceptual framework, and the national five-year plans clearly outline a vision and strategy
for nutrition and define targets for reducing undernutrition, there are substantial leadership
constraints at the MWCD, GoI which is India’s nodal ministry for nutrition. The lack of a
dedicated home for nutrition and a dedicated leader for nutrition in the MWCD, GoI and the
absence of nutrition in the vision and mission of the ministry are some of the biggest
constraints that have limited the leadership for nutrition as a sector. Furthermore, nutrition is
also not included in the vision, mission, or objectives of the MOHFW, GoI, which is the other
key ministry for delivering nutrition services. Nevertheless, it is laudable that despite this
constraint, the MWCD, GoI has over the past few years demonstrated significant leadership
in building commitment for nutrition and mobilizing resources for the sector. However, prior
to this, leadership and direction for nutrition from the MWCD, GoI was constrained.

The ICDS has only recently, under the ICDS Mission, articulated clear nutrition objectives
and targets with timelines. Nutrition is not reflected in the NRHM vision or mission and there
are no nutrition-related objectives. The vision, mission, and objectives are not mere
statements, but form critical assertions of aspirations and directions; they define for each
person in the agency the purpose of their work, as well as the role each has to play in helping
the organization achieve its mission. Besides, while staff down the ICDS chain is largely
aware of the national and ICDS vision for nutrition, in the NRHM the national vision for
nutrition is poorly understood, and NRHM functionaries do not see a role for themselves in
improving nutrition. This also shows poor communication of the visions and is yet another
leadership constraint.

Leadership constraints are also reflected in the choice of a strategy and its feasibility. The
ICDS strategy, with its multiple services, has been overly ambitious. More recently, the
addition of two more schemes to the ICDS platform has added to its delivery burden. The
ICDS has not had the resources – financial, physical, and human – to match its ambitious
mandate. Technically, it did not preferentially target pregnant women and children under two,
(rather the focus was on older children). Nor did it prioritize the most effective interventions
to improve nutrition, such as nutrition education for behavior change (rather it was focused
only on supplemental food distribution). In addition, despite the known weaknesses of the
strategy and without any change of strategic direction, the program was expanded
significantly in an attempt to attain national coverage. It is only recently that the strategy and
package of services have been revised, but there are still too many priorities. This also shows
that continuity and not change has been the defining characteristic of the ICDS and that
change has been hard to come by, even though it was needed to address known problems and
ineffective strategies.

The NRHM’s strategy focuses on prevention of micronutrient deficiencies and facility based
treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition. It has been relatively dynamic in
balancing continuity and change, and has begun to increasingly focus on nutrition, having
introduced Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) counseling by Accredited Social Health
Activists (ASHAs).

Within the ICDS, another capacity constraint is the shortage of leaders and senior managers
leading to their agenda overload. The overload, among other factors, contributes to
compromised management and leadership. The situation, however, appears much better in the
NRHM.

3.     The capacity constraints due to general management practices (GMPs) as
assessed by three management practices, namely supervision, accountability and work
processes and procedures.

Much of the weaknesses in the implementation of the ICDS are due to the weak management
practices in the program. The GMPs in the ICDS are poor and considerably constrain the
management of key functions and services. Supervision in the ICDS is very weak and is
largely directed at the supervision of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), while supervision along
the full chain of the ICDS hierarchy receives little attention. AWC supervision is ‘control’
focussed and the ‘support’ dimension is virtually non-existent. The key reasons for poor
supervision practices are: (i) lack or non-existence of a supervisory framework for the
complete function of supervision including support; (ii) lack of a culture of supervising as a
practice along the hierarchy; (iii) deficient supervisory skills; and (iv) a shortage of staff,
particularly at the supervisor level.

Although, in principle, a formal system of accountability - for conduct and performance -
exists on paper in the Indian public service, including the ICDS, in practice accountability is
poor, especially for performance. The practice of setting priorities or specific time bound
objectives or targets for individuals, teams, and managers, and monitoring them is not
prevalent, nor is that of holding people objectively accountable for performance. Corruption
is pervasive and bad performance is widespread, but few are held accountable. It is the
worker at the bottom of the chain, namely the Anganwadi Worker (AWW) who is mostly
held accountable and faces action for non-performance or misconduct, and managers are
largely not held accountable. The toleration of managers’ non-performance has culminated in
sub-optimal performance of various systems, as shown by the detailed analysis in the
chapters of this study. The restructured ICDS focuses on ways to strengthen accountability in
three key ways. These include: (i) community based monitoring and accreditation; (ii)
internal monitoring; and (iii) concurrent external monitoring. In addition, a grievance
redressal mechanism has been set up that includes arrangements at the village, block, district,
state and national levels.

Work procedures in the ICDS are not satisfactorily designed and are not compliant with good
work practices. There is a near absence in the ICDS of documented work processes as well as
those detailing the nature and scope of each activity to be conducted, with registers, and
checklists which are often not detailed enough to define the work procedures. As a result,
there are large variations in how activities are conducted, particularly at the AWC and sector
levels, leading to inefficient use of time and resources, loss of productivity or capacity, and
variation in the quality of services delivered.

4.      Human resource capacity as assessed by the size of the workforce, its knowledge,
skills and level of motivation.

The size of the ICDS workforce is insufficient to accomplish the quantity and quality of work
required to fulfil the ambitious ICDS mandate. The volume of work is too large for the
sanctioned staff to accomplish with the resources and time at their disposal, the burden of
non-ICDS tasks and the persistently large proportion of vacancies. While the ICDS Mission
will provide additional staff at all levels, thus increasing the size of the workforce, it will also
introduce additional activities to be implemented at the AWC level with no additional staff in
the vast majority of the AWCs, thus further raising workloads. Given the absence of any
functional or job analysis, it is not possible to assess the adequacy of the new norms, and the


                                                  xii
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



extent to which the size of the workforce will be optimized. On the other hand, in the
NRHM, the size of the workforce appears largely adequate and the vacancies are minimal.

A vast majority of the ICDS and NRHM workforce at all levels – field functionaries,
managers and leaders – do not possess the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively and
efficiently perform the functions expected of them. Workers lack the critical knowledge and
skills to satisfactorily deliver nutrition services, and managers lack the management skills to
manage the large and complex operation. The evidence indicates that the AWWs’ knowledge
of nutrition bears a positive association with the mothers’ practice of appropriate child care
behavior, and with the use of AWCs. These findings are significant – indicating that
enhancement in the AWWs’ knowledge could improve the child care practices of mothers,
upgrade anganwadi services, and thus contribute to improving child nutrition outcomes.
However, the knowledge and skills of the NRHM functionaries, especially those related to
nutrition, are not adequate.

The ICDS recruitment policies and criteria are not suited to recruiting people with the right
kind of skill mix, thereby placing the full onus of skill development on in-service training.
The capacity of the training system to provide to the ICDS workforce timely, adequate,
relevant and high-quality training has been severely constrained. The lack of a conceptual
framework and vision, inadequate strategic planning and resource mobilization, and sub-
optimal management are the key factors that have stalled the capacity of the training system
in building adequate knowledge, skills, and competencies of the ICDS workforce. The ICDS
acknowledges most of the issues outlined and is poised to undertake a training strengthening
effort, including the World Bank supported ISSNIP.

The motivation levels of functionaries in the ICDS as well as in the broader health system are
generally not high and are a constraint to optimal performance. The key factors contributing
to the low motivation levels include: (i) the authoritarian top-down culture; (ii) lack of
recognition, especially by managers who do not possess the skills to provide positive
feedback; (iii) apathy at all levels to resolve problems; (iv) poor work conditions; and (v) the
lack of adequate resources required to accomplish their tasks. It is clear from the
dissatisfaction expressed regarding these factors that addressing them would result in a
significant improvement in morale and motivation of the workforce, and hence in their
performance.

The restructured ICDS proposes to undertake several actions to strengthen human resources
(HR), such as developing a comprehensive human resource policy, creation of a dedicated
HR cadre for the ICDS, career progression mechanisms, and benefits such as pension
schemes. Strengthening the HR policy and management to address constraints such as work
overload at the operational level, e.g., for Child Development Project Officers (CDPOs),
supervisors and AWWs, and determining optimum number of positions based on a full
functional analysis of all job categories is critical. This will strengthen the ICDS’ service
delivery and contribute to its results.

5.     Monitoring, evaluation and information management capacity constraints as
assessed in terms of the existence and quality of a conceptual framework, availability of
relevant and reliable data and use of information.

The capacity of the ICDS and the NRHM to generate, analyze and use information to control
operations and track progress towards nutrition outcomes has many constraints. The ICDS


                                                 xiii
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



lacks a conceptual Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework, and the existing
framework in inadequate. No qualitative information is gathered and the evaluation
component of the ICDS M&E remains weak. While a considerable amount of data is
generated, there are gaps that constrain comprehensive monitoring. In particular, the data
generated falls short of providing the information needed to track the most crucial nutrition
services and outcomes, and the accuracy of the collected data is below standard. There is
inadequate analysis of the generated information and its use is marginal.

The M&E system of the NRHM does not mention nutrition in its conceptual framework.
Although the two key components of the NRHM monitoring system relevant to nutrition,
namely the Health Information Management System (HMIS), and the Mother and Child
Tracking System (MCTS) capture some nutrition indicators, their conceptual frameworks are
silent on nutrition. Concerns have been expressed regarding the accuracy of the NRHM data
as well as the volume of data collected. The analysis and use of nutrition related information
captured by the NRHM is limited.

The restructured ICDS, the revised Management Information System (MIS) being rolled out,
and the World Bank supported ISSNIP have set the stage for a conceptually clear and
strengthened ICDS M&E framework. The ICDS Mission suggests a more robust M&E
framework, and expands its scope to include research and other information. The revised MIS
being rolled out captures information that is more relevant to exercise control and track
outcomes, provides clear guidance to capture and report data which is likely to improve data
accuracy and has well-conceived data collection, management, processing and analysis
systems to promote greater usage. While somewhat information-heavy, the revised MIS does
reduce the volume of data currently collected and the associated opportunity cost. The HMIS
and MCTS could potentially be expanded to incorporate nutrition related information critical
to tracking and improving maternal and child nutrition.

Recommendations

While many recommendations have emerged from the study to strengthen the capacity of the
nutrition system, this section includes only those that can be game changers. These are:

1.      A dedicated organizational unit -- separate from that of the ICDS, or other nutrition
programs -- appropriately staffed, resourced and empowered, should be created in the
MWCD, GoI to provide national direction for nutrition, lend leadership for nutrition to other
sectors, organize policy discussions, and evaluate the impact of policies. This will require
providing the necessary technical and financial resources to enable it to exert the needed
stewardship for nutrition.

2.      A leadership development program should be instituted for leaders and top managers
of the ICDS as well as the NRHM. For leaders, the content should include ‘how to lead’,
‘how to develop conceptual frameworks and models’, ‘how to formulate vision statements,
policies and strategies’, and the importance of organizational culture. The management
development program, applicable for all senior and mid-level managers at the national, state
ICDS and district levels, should include the key management skills, such as ‘how to set
result-based objectives’, ‘how to develop operational plans’, and the techniques for key
analyses such as workload, feasibility, costing and work process. Simultaneously, all
managers should be incentivized by their supervisors to use these skills.

3. Major reforms in the ICDS HR and training systems are required. Piecemeal strengthening
of activities around the margins will not help. The following points are critical to the reform:

3.1. Examination of the existing ICDS staffing norms, including those proposed under the
restructured ICDS is essential. This must be based on three key analyses, namely: (i)
productivity analysis for each principal procedure undertaken by the functionaries such
supervision of an AWC, growth monitoring, and home visits; (ii) job analysis of each job,
based on a clear conceptual framework of the role of each; and (iii) a systematic workload
analysis.

3.2. The ICDS should consider bold revisions to its recruitment policies and criteria. For
example, a minimum level of knowledge and skills ought to be specified as prerequisites for
each position. This will result in the recruitment of better qualified and trainable staff,
requiring shorter and less steep learning curves, and make the ICDS training more effective
and less resource intensive.

3.3 Developing a well-conceived and full conceptual framework for the ICDS training
function and system is essential to provide the building blocks necessary for systematic
reform. Interalia this will include:(i) Establishing ‘proficient or skilled worker’ standards for
each category of the workforce based on a job content analysis; (ii) determining the skills
gap, by mapping the skills at entry through a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) against the
established standard; (iii) institutionalizing an appropriate quality assurance system that
defines the requisite standards of quality across the system; (iv) incorporating a robust M&E
system to routinely monitor key processes, trainee databases, and training outcomes; and (v)
exploring strategic options to clear the large training backlog and train the many entrants
expected to enter the ICDS workforce.

All this will be possible only by creating dedicated organizational homes for the HR and
training functions. Each should be headed by a high-level manager with overall responsibility
to change the face of HR and training in the ICDS. The HR reform will also enable a
paradigm shift from the present personnel management thinking into the more modern HR
development thinking. This essentially means moving from a view of personnel management
as a marginal element in corporate or organizational planning towards the view that HR
management is a central part of it.

                                       Introduction
1. Background and rationale for the study

1.1. India has a five decade long history of programs to deliver nutrition services at
the community level to improve the nutrition status of women and children. Since the
early sixties, India has had a plethora of national schemes for providing maternal and child
nutrition services. The Applied Nutrition Program initiated in the early sixties, followed by
other programs introduced in the seventies, such as the Composite Nutrition Program, Special
Nutrition Program and the Balwadi Feeding Program, continued to provide nutrition services
until the nineties. While the package of services, the scale, and the institutions for program
delivery varied from program to program, each one had a supplemental feeding component
and most incorporated some aspects of nutrition and health education. However, despite
being national in nature and covering most states, actual coverage of the programs was
patchy. Alongside these nutrition schemes, India, since the seventies, has also implemented
national programs -- vitamin A supplementation, iron-folate supplementation and salt
iodization -- to address micronutrient undernutrition. Coverage has also been a major issue
with the micronutrient programs. With the advent of the ICDS in 1975, all earlier schemes
were phased out or merged with the ICDS, and the micronutrient supplementation programs
continue through the maternal and child health programs MOHFW, (GoI), earlier the
Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) program and now through the NRHM.

1.2. India has an enabling nutrition policy framework and the GoI has programs in
all areas critical to addressing malnutrition. Yet, the progress in reducing
undernutrition has been disappointing. India’s nutrition policy framework includes both
direct and indirect nutrition interventions. In the direct category, where the ICDS and the
NRHM are the main government instruments, supplemental feeding, reducing micronutrient
deficiencies, food fortification and early child development (ECD) are addressed, while the
indirect interventions include food security, health care, women’s status and education,
communication and safety nets. Similarly, national programs that address the other critical
determinants of nutrition such as food security, water and sanitation, health care, and
women’s empowerment also exist. However, these programs, individually and collectively,
have not been able to make a significant dent in reducing undernutrition. With one-third of
the country’s children born with low birth-weight, 43 percent under-fives being underweight,
48 percent being stunted and 20 percent being wasted, almost 75 percent under three are
anemic (NFHS 3, 2005-06), 62 percent deficient in vitamin A (WHO, 2009) and over 13
million infants remain unprotected from iodine deficiency disorders (UNICEF, 2009).
Despite the many programs in existence and the major investments, progress in reducing
undernutrition has been poor.

1.3. The capacity of institutions plays a key role in their ability to fulfil their mandate
and achieve the intended outcomes. The implementation of policies and programs can only
be as good as the capacity of institutions responsible for them. The issues of capacity and the
factors constraining capacity are especially crucial for nutrition services, given the inter-
sectoral nature of the determinants of nutrition and that institutional arrangements for service
delivery generally involve multiple institutions, often across different sectors, with the need
to coordinate actions and interventions to ensure that they reach the intended beneficiaries
with the full package of services, so as to achieve for nutritional impact. A World Bank
                                                   Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



analysis, using data from the NFHS 3, 2005-06 and the HUNGaMA Survey 2011, indicates a
strong association between the prevalence of stunting in children and their adequacy in terms
of the triad of the determinants of nutrition at the immediate level, namely food intake, care
for children and women, and environmental health. The analysis showed much higher
stunting rates in children who do not have feeding, care or environmental health in adequate
measure, compared with those who are provided all of these adequately (50.5 percent v/s 19
percent5). The analysis further indicates that according to NFHS 3, 2005-06 data, only 1.2
percent of the children are adequate in all dimensions, 63.4 percent are inadequate in all
dimensions, and the remainder are adequate only in one or two measures. High levels of these
inadequacies in children are also demonstrated by the data from the HUNGaMA Survey 2011
across the surveyed districts (Kathuria and Newman, 2014). This is only one example of the
poor coverage of programs and the lack of effectiveness in reaching children with a package
of services that address the key determinants of nutrition. One of the principal reasons that
determine the coverage and effectiveness of programs is the overall capacity of institutions
responsible for them, including – their leadership and management capacity, human resource
capacity, capacity to manage financial, physical and information resources, and the capacity
to deliver good quality services. A lack of these can limit the ability of organizations to
fulfill their mandate, and compromise the success of the policies, strategies and programs. It
is thus necessary to assess the capacity of the institutional arrangements that exist for the
delivery of nutrition services in India.

1.4. The ICDS and the micronutrient programs delivered through the health system
form the mainstay of India’s nutrition service delivery system and are India’s most
significant investments in nutrition. India is just embarking on the development of
institutional arrangements for multi-sectoral coordination for nutrition.6 So far, the two main
programs and institutions involved in the delivery of nutrition services are the ICDS,
implemented through the MWCD, GoI and the related departments in the states, and the
NRHM, implemented by the MoHFW, GoI. This study therefore focuses on the capacity of
the ICDS and the units in the NRHM that deliver nutrition and nutrition related services.
Since the inception of the ICDS in 1975, India has steadfastly pursued its expansion in order
to achieve national coverage– scaling up from 33 blocks in 1975 to over 7,000 projects in
2013. The most rapid expansion of the ICDS happened during the period 2005-2012 when its
geographical coverage expanded from 700,000 habitations to over 1.3 million, thereby
covering almost all habitations in the country. The ICDS has undergone major restructuring
in the year 2012 and has received a large infusion of financial and human resources. To
strengthen the implementation and impact by sharpening its strategies and implementation
approaches, financial resources have increased from Rs. 444 billion in the 11th five year plan
to an allocation of Rs. 1,774.6 billion during the 12th five year plan; and an additional
500,000 employees are added to its existing strength of 2.7 million7 employees.

1.5. While several evaluations document the weaknesses in design and
implementation of the ICDS and the health sector, a comprehensive capacity assessment
of its institutions does not exist. Several program evaluations have identified the
weaknesses in design and, most importantly, in the implementation of nutrition services. The
ICDS program itself has been the subject of a large number of internal and external reviews.
While a large body of documentary evidence pertains to one or two aspects of the two

programs, a comprehensive institutional capacity assessment of the ICDS and NRHM
programs, particularly with respect to nutrition services, has not yet been undertaken and is a
large gap. The present study is a first step in fulfilling this gap and adds value insofar as it
uses an operational and management approach to capacity assessment that looks at capacity
not in terms of what it is, but in terms of the factors that influence it. It lists the factors that
must be observed for an agency or system to have full capacity. Such a definition is better
able to identify constraints to capacity and the measures aimed at building it.

1.6. The recent surge in investment and attention to nutrition programs, primarily
the ICDS and other programs based on the ICDS platform, makes a capacity
assessment timely and relevant. During the course of this study, a number of developments
led to an expansion of the landscape of the institutional arrangements for nutrition service
delivery. The most significant developments include: (i) consensus on a new national
operational conceptual framework, namely ‘Addressing India’s Nutrition Challenge’,
outlining the key nutrition issues including those within the purview of the ICDS and those
that are multi-sectoral and currently beyond the ICDS, while also proposing options to
effectively address these; (ii) the first meeting of the Prime Minister’s National Nutrition
Council in 2010 and its recommendations that charted the key directions for nutrition; (iii)
restructuring and strengthening of the ICDS in 2012; (iv) launch of two additional nutrition
programs in 2010 to be implemented using the ICDS platform, namely a pilot conditional
cash transfer scheme for pregnant and nursing mothers in 52 districts, the IGMSY and
SABLA, an empowerment program for out-of-school adolescent girls in 200 districts that,
inter alia, provides nutrition counseling, food and micronutrient supplements; (v) approval of
a multi-sectoral nutrition program in 200 high malnutrition burden districts in 2013; and (vi)
launch of World Bank supported ISSNIP in 2013. Underlying all these efforts has been a
very serious attempt to identify the weaknesses in the current nutrition system, adequately
address them and increase the resource allocation for nutrition. All these efforts to enhance
nutrition service delivery are linked critically to the ICDS platform, thus making the
assessment of capacity of the ICDS highly relevant and timely.

2. Purpose and objectives

The purpose of this study is to undertake an institutional capacity assessment of the
nutrition service delivery system in India, with a view to identifying the key capacity
constraints, as well as the necessary institutional reorganization, change and institutional
strengthening critical to address them. Strengthening capacity is critical to achieving effective
delivery of nutrition services and improving nutrition outcomes.

The key audiences for this study are policy makers, programmers, primarily the MWCD --
the nodal department for nutrition and implementer of the ICDS, the ICDS training
institutions, the NRHM and the MoHFW, GoI and associated institutions, the Planning
Commission, the World Bank, other development partners, civil society organizations and
stakeholders with an interest in nutrition.

3. Scope of this capacity assessment

For the purpose of this study, the nutrition service delivery system is defined as the system,
or set of systems to address undernutrition, including its actors, institutions, and resources
that deliver direct nutrition interventions. The institutional capacity assessment will primarily

focus on the nutrition system comprising two principal channels of the ICDS and selected
components of the health system.

3.1.1. Whose capacity is assessed and at what levels?

The study focuses on assessing the capacity of the principal channel or system delivering
nutrition services to pregnant, nursing mothers and children under three. This system involves
two agencies: the ICDS, a program implemented nationally by the Child Development
Division of the MWCD, GoI, and the NRHM, a program of the MoHFW, GoI.

While all nutrition services are delivered at the village level, primarily at the anganwadi
centres (AWCs), the capacity to deliver them depends not only on the centers but
significantly also on the design and management of these services at the national and state
levels, district and sub-district levels. The study therefore assesses capacity at all levels with
respect to what each is required to do (see Table 1.1).

3.1.2. Capacity to do what?

Of the many activities and functions undertaken by the two agencies mentioned, the study
focuses only on the capacity of the ICDS and the NRHM to deliver the nutrition services for
which each is responsible. This includes:

   -      Supplementary feeding
   -      Health and nutrition education
   -      Growth monitoring and promotion
   -      Immunization
   -      Ante-natal services for pregnant women
   -      Health check-ups and referrals
   -      Micronutrient supplementation

3.1.3. Which capacity areas will be assessed?

Of the operational capacity areas outlined in the conceptual framework presented below, the
study focuses on assessing the constraints in the following areas:
 Division of labor in the nutrition system
 Leadership

   Human resources matching its operational requirements, their management and efficient
    utilization, including training as its sub-system
   Monitoring, evaluation and the management of information
   General management practices -- supervision, accountability and work practices

4. Methodology

4.1. Conceptual Framework

4.1.1. Defining capacity: For the purpose of this study, capacity is defined in operational
terms. This definition looks at capacity not in terms of what it is, but in terms of the factors
that influence it. It lists the factors that must be observable if an agency or a system has full
capacity. Such a definition is more helpful in identifying constraints to capacity as well as
measures aimed at building capacity. The operational definition of capacity is:

A public sector agency has the capacity to deliver services if, and only if:
  (i) It has effective leadership and management;
   (ii) It has an optimal division of labor and structure within it;
  (iii) It has financial resources matching its mandate and manages and utilizes them fully
        and efficiently;
  (iv) It has human resources, physical resources and information matching its operational
        requirements and manages and utilizes all of these fully and efficiently; and
   (v) Its personnel follow appropriate work practices and processes.

4.1.2. Indicators of capacity constraints: Constraints to capacity in each of these areas and
the indicators for each constraint used in this study are listed in Table 1.2.

4.2.    Data collection methodology

A comprehensive list of questions to capture the indicators outlined in the conceptual
framework was developed. Data was collected through the following four channels:

    -   Review of documentary material
    -   Semi-structured interviews
    -   FGDs
    -   Systematic observation of selected service delivery

The interview and FGD questionnaires were developed and translated into Tamil for Tamil
Nadu and Hindi for Bihar. Two teams, comprising one team per state and consisting of one
supervisor and two researchers experienced in conducting FGDs, were trained in the use of
the instruments, and collected the data over a 15-day period in each state. The staff of the
World Bank visited both states to guide and supervise the work and conduct the senior level
interviews. The data with which to address the capacity constraints was collected at the
national level, and in each of the two states data was collected from two blocks and two
villages. The states and districts selected were drawn from those surveyed in the HUNGaMA
Survey, 2011. Since much of the evidence is drawn from available publications, the purpose
of the FGDs was to support the findings through primary data.

The HUNGaMA Survey, 2011 collected district level data from 112 rural districts in the
country that were selected on the basis of a child development district index developed for
UNICEF, India in 2009 for malnutrition and a number of other indicators. A total of 100
rural districts were selected from the bottom of this index, located in six states, namely Bihar,
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh and are referred to as the
100 focus districts in the HUNGaMA Survey, 2011. In addition, 12 rural districts ranked near
the top of the index were also selected for data collection. Six of the top ranking districts are
the top ranking rural districts in the six states (one district per state) with the 100 focus
districts; the remaining six are the top ranking rural districts, two each from Himachal
Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the three states whose rural districts led the all-India index
ranking.

For this study, using the HUNGaMA sample, the following states and districts were selected
for collecting primary data:

(a) States: Tamil Nadu and Bihar, representing one top ranking and one bottom ranking
state; and

(b) Districts: (i) From Bihar, Munger (top ranking) and Jamui (focus district); and (ii) from
Tamil Nadu, Kancheepuram (top ranking). Since, the HUNGaMA Survey, 2011 included
only the two top ranking districts for Tamil Nadu, Villipuram was selected as a not so well
performing district, in consultation with the ICDS officials in the state.

The blocks and AWCs, selected in each top ranking district for Tamil Nadu and Villipuram,
were based on the criteria of one good and one poorly performing, from the list indicated by
the ICDS officials at that level.

The interviews and FGDs conducted, processes observed and documentary material reviewed
were as follows:

4.3.   Data analysis and reporting

The data collected was collated and analyzed to identify the key capacity constraints, and
proper measures to address the constraints. New statistical analysis was carried out using
HUNGaMA Survey, 2011 data to determine the association and correlation related to the
operational areas of capacity that were possible with the data.

5. Structure of the report

The report consists of the following seven chapters. The present chapter provides the context
and the rationale for the study, and outlines the methodology. Chapter 2 describes the
nutrition system in detail and discusses the capacity issues related to the division of labor
(DoL) between the two primary programs of the nutrition system and within the ICDS.
Chapter 3 delves into the factors that constrain leadership capacity at all levels Chapter 4
discusses the key capacity constraints related to HR that limit the effective delivery of
nutrition services. Chapter 5 discusses the training system as a sub-system of HR and its
capacity constraints, and Chapter 6 covers the capacity assessment pertaining to monitoring,
evaluation and management of information in the nutrition system. Chapter 7 discusses the
capacity constraints related to GMPs in the ICDS, especially focusing on supervision,
accountability and work practices and procedures.

Each chapter follows a similar structure. After briefly introducing the topic of discussion, it
presents a detailed conceptual framework for capacity assessment with indicators used to
assess capacity, discusses the findings and offers suggestions to address the capacity
constraints identified. Tables, figures and boxes are included to highlight time-trends and
findings, good practices, and draw attention to specific issues.

A complete bibliography is provided at the end of the report.

    The Nutrition Service Delivery System and Division of Labor within the
                                    System

Introduction
The term nutrition service delivery system used in this capacity assessment study refers to the
system or set of systems that deliver direct nutrition interventions to mothers and children
under three to address undernutrition. It includes the actors, institutions and resources within
the system that have a bearing on and reflect the capacity. Direct nutrition interventions are
delivered through two principal channels, namely the ICDS and selected components of the
health system. This chapter gives a brief description of the organization of the system, its
role, functions and services – vertically from the national to the village and grassroots level,
and horizontally at the national level for leadership, policy and strategic direction.

This description is followed by a detailed analysis of the DoL between the ICDS and the
NRHM, the two primary programs that deliver nutrition services, and the manner in which it
enhances or constrains capacity for the delivery of nutrition services.

For any service to be delivered effectively and efficiently, it is critical that: (i) all key
functions8 associated with its delivery are identified; (ii) each functional area is adequately
identified, developed, executed and monitored; and (iii) there is clear division of
responsibilities, with coordination between the agencies delivering the service.

The lack of full functional clarity and sub-optimal design of work and its division among
work units or organizations can result in poor performance and significant inefficiencies.
Thus, it can be a capacity constraint.

In the context of delivery and outcomes of nutrition services in India, where the ICDS and the
NRHM have key roles, an examination of the division of functions and their coordination is
significant as this could be a capacity enabler or constraint. ‘Convergence’ of the ICDS and
health services has remained elusive, despite several efforts by both programs to bring about
effective ‘convergence’. Given this background, the present chapter seeks to answer the
following broad questions:

     1. How does the organization and distribution of functions between and within the two
        primary agencies responsible for delivery of nutrition services enhance or constrain
        the capacity of the system to deliver these effectively?

     2. What are the possible ways of addressing these capacity constraints?

The conceptual framework, following the description of the nutrition system, examines the
key factors associated with the DoL, between the ICDS and the NRHM, and within the ICDS
that constrain capacity of the system, and suggests ways of overcoming these constraints.
However, as the delivery of nutrition services by the NRHM forms only a small part of its
8
 A function is defined as a cluster of tasks that are linked together to produce an integrated, defined output or result. All tasks must be
present for the output or result to be produced and all are often managed in a unified way in one organizational unit (or a cluster of units). A
task is defined as a planned sequence of interlinked activities, the outputs of which serve as inputs to the performance of a function.

package of services, a full examination of DoL in the NRHM is outside the scope of the
study. Thus, within agency DoL is limited to the ICDS.

1. Key national level institutions for nutrition policy and programs (Figure 2.1).

1.1    The Prime Minister’s National Council on India’s Nutrition Challenges is the
highest body for policy direction, review and coordination between multiple ministries
concerned with nutrition outcomes. Constituted in 2008, the council is chaired by the
Prime Minister and its members include the ministers of nine ministries9 with a key sectoral
role for nutrition, the deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission (PC), GoI and
representatives of civil society. Secretaries of the related line ministries are special invitees to
the council. The council first met in November 2010.

In addition, a National Advisory Council (NAC) chaired by the president of the political
party heading the national government has been providing policy direction and advice on
programming of resources, focused on the development sector, since 2004. This supra-
government advisory body consists mostly of eminent development and human rights experts
and individuals from civil society organizations.

                           Programme Committee                        coordination
                                                                      committee

                                               Planning Commission


                         MoHFW                         MWCD                 National Mission
                                                                            Steering Group




1.2     The Planning Commission, GoI plays a key role in determining government
policies, priorities, strategies and allocation of resources. Also chaired by the Prime
Minister, the PC set up in 1950 is responsible for developing five-year plans for the
government, reviewing central and state annual plans, and determining the allocation of
resources to the ministries and states. The PC has several divisions, with nutrition coming
under two of them, namely health, family welfare and nutrition and, secondly, women and
child development. The deputy chairperson is usually an eminent economist, social scientist,
retired senior bureaucrat or senior political leader, its members are political appointees,
generally eminent individuals of repute from civil society or former bureaucrats.

1.3    The MWCD is the nodal ministry for nutrition in India. The MWCD, GoI has
overall responsibility for nutrition in India, with the mandate to: (i) set nutrition policy

Human Resource Development; Agriculture, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution; Finance; Health and Family Welfare;
Women and Child Development; Rural Development; Urban Development; Information and Broadcasting; and Panchayati Raj.

                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



directions and programs; (ii) coordinate with other ministries on action relating to nutrition in
their realms; (iii) undertake advocacy and education relating to nutrition; (iv) implement a
portfolio of nutrition programs, the largest being the ICDS which is the national flagship
program. The other programs with nutrition or nutrition-related components include IGMSY
and SABLA, a national Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign to
create awareness about nutrition and a multi-sector program in 200 high malnutrition burden
districts. Additionally, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB), a technical body under the
MWCD, GoI provides some technical support to the ministry in nutrition related functions
and in coordinating the implementation of the national nutrition policy.

1.4     The MoHFW, GoI is the other key ministry that, together with the ICDS delivers
several nutrition services. The MoHFW, GoI with the MWCD, GoI oversees the delivery of
health and nutrition services through the ICDS platform and mechanisms such as VHNDs
that enable joint service provision by ICDS workers and health workers at the village level.

1.5    Institutional arrangements for multi-sectoral nutrition action and coordination
have recently been defined. The National Mission Steering Group (NMSG) and the
Empowered Program Committee (M-EPC) are the highest administrative and technical
bodies for planning, implementation, monitoring and supervision of the key nutrition
programs, namely the ICDS Mission and the recent Multi-sectoral Nutrition Program. An
Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee (IMCC) headed by the Cabinet Secretary is
proposed to be created for coordinating nutrition matters at the national level.

2.      The vertical organizational structure of the nutrition service delivery system. The
set up of the vertical structure from the national level to the village level is described briefly
below (Figure 2.2)

2.1. The MWCD, GoI and the MoHFW, GoI, the two ministries critical to the
nutrition sector, operate at all levels as two different entities, as do their respective
programs, namely the ICDS and the NRHM. At the national level, the ICDS is the
responsibility of the MWCD, GoI, assigned to the Child Development (CD) division headed
by a joint secretary (JS). The division and the JS handle programs and responsibilities besides
the ICDS. The ICDS was recently restructured in 2012 for implementation in mission mode
and full-fledged mission directorates at the national and state levels are to be established.
The NRHM is the responsibility of the MoHFW, GoI and implements several health services
of which nutrition services form a small component. It is headed by an additional secretary
who is designated as its mission director. One official in the child health division of the
MoHFW is designated as the nodal officer for nutrition.

At the state level: The ICDS in most states lies under the Department of Women and Child
Development (DWCD) through which it is implemented. However, some states have placed
the ICDS under their departments of social welfare. Nevertheless, in all states, the state
director of the ICDS is responsible for managing the program and is generally drawn from
the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or the Central Services. Below the director are
officials responsible for functional areas such as monitoring, training, IEC and administration
but there are no technical persons either for nutrition or for Early Childhood Care and
Education (ECCE).

In the states, the department of health and family welfare is headed by the Secretary (Health)
and the NRHM has an executive director (ED) of the state health society (an IAS officer of

middle level seniority), who heads all H&FW operations under the program. Below the ED,
NRHM are a number of technocrats (technical personnel, who are all doctors by training)
with the responsibility of leading individual national health programs. The components of
H&FW relevant to nutrition are covered under the maternal and child health program. In
some states, under the ED there is a further position of Director, Public Health or Primary
Health, NRHM, responsible for implementation of all health programs in the field.

At the district level: The ICDS implementation is overseen by a district program officer
(DPO) who reports to the State Director, ICDS. Some states also have a regional deputy
director (RDD) between the district and state levels and three or four DPOs report to an RDD
(who is a senior DPO but not an IAS officer). The staffing for the district project office is
minimal, wherein the DPO’s administrative support consists of one office superintendent, one
statistical assistant, one accountant, and one clerk.
At the district level, the district health mission is headed by the chairperson of the zila
parishad with the district collector as its co-chair and chief medical officer as mission
director. To support the district health mission, every district has an integrated District Health
Society (DHS). The operations of the health department are led by the Chief Medical Officer
(CMO), usually the senior most doctor in public service in the state. In several districts, there
are nutrition rehabilitation centers (NRCs), special units located at the district hospital for the
treatment of severely acute malnourished children. The medical superintendent of the hospital
has overall responsibility for the NRC activities.

At the block level: The CDPO is in charge of ICDS project with responsibilities for
planning, managing, organizing and implementing the ICDS and the delivery of its services.
S/he also plays the role of an educator and communicator for the staff and community. The
ICDS supervisors (usually organized into a sector) support and oversee the management of
approximately 25 AWCs, each of which is the primary service delivery unit of the ICDS
program and caters to a population of approximately 400 to 800. Each AWC has an AWW
assisted by an AWH, both being local women volunteers and not government employees and
are each paid an honorarium. The BMO is in charge of health functions at the block level
including the delivery of primary health care which consists of a three-tier structure, namely
the sub-center which is the most peripheral and the first contact point between the primary
health care system and the community, catering to a population of 5,000. The Primary Health
Centers (PHCs) cater to a population of 30,000 and a community health care center (CHC)
which serves as the referral for PHC and caters to a population of 120,000. From the health
department, at the village level, it is the ASHA workers, who deliver health and nutrition
related services. The ASHAs are women from the community who act as link workers and
are trained in some maternal and child health issues. They are guided by ANMs who are
health workers positioned at the PHC. While the ASHAs are paid performance based
incentives for specific tasks performed, the ANMs are paid employees of the health
department.

3.1    Four of the six ICDS services are delivered in coordination with the health
sector. While nutrition as a sector is the responsibility of the MWCD, GoI, the
implementation and provision of four key ICDS services is shared between the ICDS and the
NRHM (Table 2.1). In addition, the NRHM within its overall maternal and child health
mandate delivers several direct nutrition services such as iron-folic acid (IFA) supplements to
pregnant women, Vitamin A and IFA supplements to young children, nutrition and health
education, and treatment and management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) at facilities
including Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs). It is therefore important that the division
of functions and coordination between the two programs maximize mutual support to
improving nutrition outcomes and optimizing efficient use of resources.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators

For optimum productivity and efficiency of an organization, all functions and tasks required
to fulfil its mandate must be fully identified, developed and grouped appropriately, and
responsibilities of these be appropriately assigned to staff with appropriate skills. Table 2.2
lists the operational indicators used to assess the effectiveness of the division of work among
organizations or organizational units. For detailed analytical framework, including glossary,

Findings

1. DoL between the ICDS and the NRHM
An in-depth analysis of the division of functions and coordination arrangements between
the ICDS and the NRHM indicates that the division of responsibilities for nutrition-related
service delivery are clearly defined with several coordination mechanisms designed and
institutionalized. However, on-the-ground coordination is sub-optimal and there is a need
for greater role clarity and better coordination between the programs. There is an
opportunity for the ICDS and the NRHM to expand mutual synergies. Going forward,
these must be explored to maximize the efficient use of resources and reduce child
undernutrition.

1.1     Conceptually, the DoL for the delivery of nutrition services between the ICDS
and the NRHM optimizes the mutually synergistic services of the two programs. While
this does not constitute a functional split, it does impose the need for coordination.
Whereas the responsibilities for delivering direct nutrition interventions are divided between
the two programs, for several reasons this division appears logical for using resources
efficiently and achieving the desired outcomes, provided that effective coordination exists, as
seen below:
 The ICDS is by design a program that seeks to achieve effective coordination of policy
and implementation amongst various departments to promote child development. Similarly,
the NRHM has a synergistic approach to achieving health which it relates to the determinants
of good health, namely nutrition, sanitation, hygiene and safe drinking water;
       Since nutrition and infection are inter-related, the key health interventions, especially
those that promote maternal and child care and prevent and treat infections, must reach all
mothers and young children. These interventions lie in the domain of the NRHM, along with
the treatment and management of children with severe acute malnutrition who need to be
admitted to facilities. The AWCs, therefore, often serve as the hub for provision of health
services, especially in villages where there are no health sub-centers;10
       Both programs are community outreach programs, target the same populations, and
have common objectives of reducing child mortality and undernutrition. However, each
provides a different set of services, for which the roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
and differentiated, at least on paper.
In order to ensure that this DoL facilitates synergistic provision and uptake of services from
the two programs, it is essential that: (i) roles and responsibilities of the two agencies are
clearly defined and understood at all levels; (ii) coordination mechanisms are clearly defined,
enforced and monitored; (iii) norms and standards for the services to be delivered are
established; and (iv) time and work-loads of the two sets of functionaries at each level, in
particular at the ground level, permits them to engage with and assist each other in
accordance with defined arrangements.

Therefore, considering the overall schema of how nutrition and health services are placed,
there is value in optimizing on the synergies of the two programs. This is distinct from a
functional split. However, it remains important to have full clarity of roles, avoid overlaps
and gaps and to ensure adequate coordination. Further, the synergistic placement of the two
programs offer the scope for better linking of the two programs in ways beyond what exist
now and for the health sector to play a larger role in improving nutrition than it does now.
The synergistic maternal and child health services provided by the two programs listed in
Table 2.3 highlights how they can optimize mutual service delivery.

1.2    The DoL between the ICDS and the NRHM and the responsibilities of each
program are largely well articulated. However, some overlaps and gaps exist. The ICDS
and NRHM guidelines both clearly lay out their roles and responsibilities for nutrition
services, including those for the activities to be conducted jointly.

1.2.1 Some overlaps exist at the frontline service delivery level. The roles of AWWs and
ANMs in the delivery of health and nutrition services through the ICDS platform were
defined prior to the deployment of ASHAs. It was made it clear that the AWW would assist

10
  A health sub-center exists for every population of 5,000, but not in all villages, whereas the AWCs are based on a population of 800 and
therefore exist in almost all villages, and many large villages have more than one AWC.



                                                                     16

the ANM in identifying and registering pregnant women, immunization and referral services.
After the deployment of ASHAs, in most states, some duplication of effort has emerged. For
example, community mobilization for immunization, preparing due-lists for immunization,
identification and registration of pregnant women, and IYCF counseling which were earlier
done by AWWs have now been assigned to ASHAs by the NRHM. Furthermore, the
ASHA’s role is now expanding to include IYCF counseling. These overlaps were explicitly
mentioned in the FGDs by the AWWs, who also felt that they should be relieved of these
responsibilities since the ASHAs conduct these activities as well. In the states where there are
no ASHAs, the AWWs and ANMs continue to work jointly for household surveys,
registration of antenatal mothers, health and nutrition education, distribution of
micronutrients, de-worming of children, immunization and diarrhoea management. There is
no overlap in this case. Similarly, population surveys are done both by the ICDS and the
NRHM and could become more efficient if done jointly. However, the boundaries of the
NRHM and ICDS blocks in several states do not match, although some states have reconciled
the boundaries.

1.2.3 Some gaps exist in the nutrition-related policy and program guidelines as also in
service delivery. The MoHFW, GoI has taken the leadership in developing policy and
program guidelines and protocols for the prevention and treatment of micronutrient
deficiencies, management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and treatment of associated

complications. Recent examples of these initiatives include the introduction of weekly iron-
folate supplementation (WIFS) for anemia prevention in adolescent girls, through the ICDS
and school health programs, zinc supplementation as an adjunct to oral rehydration solution
(ORS) therapy during diarrhoea, and operational guidelines on facility-based management of
children with SAM where such children are referred to the NRC, (MOHFW, GoI, 2011).
Some areas where guidelines and clarity are further required include management of SAM
children without medical complications at the community level, therapeutic foods for feeding
children with severe and moderate acute malnutrition, and harmonization of NRHM and
ICDS criteria for referral to NRCs. While over 79 percent of the children under three remain
anemic (NFHS-3), iron-folate supplementation of children does not receive due attention, and
delivery of zinc supplements in accordance with protocols together with ORS for diarrhea
management is minimal. Despite both services being in place for several years, their delivery
continues to be weak. Also, at the implementation level, primary data from Tamil Nadu
indicated confusion between the AWW and ANM with respect to the responsibility for
maintaining growth charts included in the mother-child protection card (MCP). As a result
these were not being maintained by either.

1.3      Except the top leadership in the health sector and the NRHM, awareness of the
role of NRHM functionaries in improving nutrition is poor. The FGDs indicated that
NRHM functionaries did not see a clear role for themselves in the overall effort to reduce
undernutrition or its prevention and considered this to fall in the domain of the ICDS. They
perceived their role in the treatment of malnutrition at NRCs, and in the provision of
micronutrients. However, on further probing, they did concede that they play an important
role in providing allied health activities like pre-and post-natal care, IYCF practices,
immunization, vitamin and mineral supplementation which are important for improving the
nutritional status of mothers and children. At the field level, the FGDs and interviews
indicated a lack of role clarity for activities conducted jointly by ICDS and NRHM
functionaries such as maintenance of joint MCPs, growth charts, immunization records and
antenatal care records. It also emerged that while the ICDS functionaries were largely clear
about their own role as well as that of the NRHM functionaries in the delivery of nutrition
services, this was not the case with NRHM functionaries. The possible reasons for this lack
of clarity amongst NRHM functionaries include the lack of priority for nutrition under the
NRHM as indicated by the absence of nutrition in NRHM vision, mission and most other
documents (for details see discussion in chapter 3, Leadership) and the absence of any
nutrition indicator amongst the core indicators regularly tracked by NRHM functionaries, and
the lack of communication of their role up and down the NRHM hierarchy. Limited
interactions between ICDS and NRHM at various levels could also contribute to the lack of
clarity.

1.4      Despite the many coordination mechanisms defined to better coordinate the
services delivered by the two programs, on-the-ground coordination is sub-optimal and
continues to constrain the optimum delivery of nutrition services. The convergence of
health and nutrition services has been a recognized but persistent problem, and both agencies
have made efforts to institutionalize coordination mechanisms and develop common tools
and guidelines. However, there continues to be a need to enforce better coordination and, in
many instances, better define the operational level task regarding ‘who does what’. The key
institutional mechanisms for coordination, namely the ICDS and NRHM services, are
discussed below.

over 6.5 million in 2012-13 (MoHFW, GoI 2013). However, actual implementation of
VHNDs remains largely limited to ante-natal checkup and immunization days. Growth
monitoring and promotion activities, nutrition counseling and education, iron-folate
supplementation of children and health check-ups are mostly neglected. The many key issues
that constrain adequate coordination though VHNDs are:
       At the village level there is poor understanding of the VHND, each worker’s roles and
responsibilities, inadequate capacity, lack of training and support;
       At the block, district and state levels, there is poor enforcement of guidelines,
inadequate supervision and monitoring of VHNDs by both agencies, and lack of attention to
the quality of service delivery. These indicate poor management and necessitate
strengthening the management of the VHND mechanism by both the ICDS and the NRHM.

Furthermore, while the VHND guidelines are very detailed and include checklists for the
functionaries and supervisors of both agencies, there remain some gaps on the following
points: (i) work procedures for the delivery of each service are not defined, (ii) there is little
clarity on ‘who does what’ with respect to the services to be delivered by the triad of AWW,
ASHA and ANM; (iii) and despite the emphasis on ensuring ‘satisfactory quality of services’,
quality standards are not stated and monitoring is largely confined to tracking the number of
VHNDs held. Senior managers at the national level should ensure that the VHND work
procedures are defined, standard operation procedures (SoPs) are developed and quality
standards are defined and disseminated. Senior managers at the state and district levels should
ensure that the guidelines are disseminated further down in a timely manner and implemented
in the right spirit.

1.4.2 VHSNC serve as coordination mechanisms for the ICDS, NRHM and PRIs. The
VHSNC mechanism was created in 2011 by adding nutrition functions to the scope of the
NRHM’s erstwhile village health and sanitation committees (VHSCs). Its function goes
beyond the coordination between the ICDS and NRHM and also involves the PRIs. While the
VHSNC functions under the PRI, along with PRI members; NRHM and ICDS functionaries
(female multipurpose health worker, ANM, AWW, ASHA) serve as key members, with the
AWW often being the convener.

While more than half a million VHSNCs are functional (MOHFW, GoI, 2012), their
effectiveness on the ground is limited. Although the roles and responsibilities of the
committees and accountability mechanisms are well defined on paper, the primary data
collected for this study indicates considerable variation in awareness about these committees
amongst the functionaries designated as key members as well as the PRI representatives on
the committee. For example, while most health functionaries were aware of the committee
and its role, this was not the case with the ICDS functionaries. In Bihar, a majority of the
ICDS functionaries were not aware of the existence of VHSNCs and their role, and had not
met any VHSNC member in the past six months. In Tamil Nadu, the situation was mixed and
while many CDPOs, supervisors and AWWs were aware about VHSNC, many CDPOs were
not aware of the expanded scope of the VHSCs that included nutrition.

The lack of adequate training, non-timely flow of funds, dependence on the ASHA for
functionality, weak participation and inadequate representation of marginalized communities


                                                 19
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



have also constrained the functioning of VHSNCs (6th CRM, 2012 and 8th JRM, 2011). The
nutrition-related responsibilities of the VHSNC include inter alia tasks such as carrying out
surveys on nutrition status and nutritional deficiencies, inclusion of nutritional needs in
village health plans and promotion of best nutritional practices. These tasks require
specialized skills, and the current capacities and lack of training of the members are
constraints to the functioning of these committees.

The poor functioning of the VHSNCs, the lack of clarity on the ground, and inadequate
training is a reflection of inadequate management of resources to build the capacity of the
VHSNCs at the district and state levels. Clear work procedures for the proper functioning of
the committee will enhance their functioning, coordination mechanisms between the three
key departments at the district and state levels are needed to ensure appropriate attention and
management by each.

1.3.1 Joint planning, training, review meetings and field visits by the NRHM and ICDS
functionaries are also mechanisms for bringing about the necessary coordination in the
delivery of services. While government orders and guidelines have been issued from time to
time, including jointly by the top leadership of the MWCD, GoI and the MoHFW, GoI, their
implementation varies because of several reasons: (i) In many instances the geographical
jurisdiction of the NRHM sub-center, the ICDS AWC and ICDS project and health blocks
differ, making joint planning, action and monitoring difficult. Several states have harmonized
these, but the issue remains a constraint in several areas; (ii) Joint training for NRHM and
ICDS functionaries on integrated management of neonatal and childhood illnesses (IMNCI)
have been conducted by the NRHM. However, the FGDs with AWWs in Bihar indicated that
while the training helped enhance their knowledge on child care especially breast feeding
practices, it did not lead to more effective joint work such as counseling of mothers, or
improvements in referrals of undernourished or sick children; (iii) The MCP card, a recently
rolled out tool to be used by both the NRHM and the ICDS to track mothers and children for
health and nutrition purposes was used minimally by both ASHAs and AWWs, in Tamil
Nadu.

1.4     Lack of effective coordination leads to many missed opportunities. The lack of
coordination leads to insufficient coverage of beneficiaries and services, inconsistent data
reporting and monitoring, insufficient utilization of resources and some duplication of work.
The key areas that continue to suffer from poor or sub-optimal coordination include
identification of undernourished children, their referral and management at the community or
facility level, referral of sick children, nutrition and health counseling, identification and
management of low birth weight children, vitamin A and iron-folate supplementation for
children, administration of zinc supplements along with ORS for diarrhoea management.
Although the NRCs exist, the weak referral systems prevent all children requiring admission
to NRCs from being referred. Furthermore, there is lack of consistency between the referral
criteria of the AWW (weight-for-age) and the entry criteria for the NRC (low weight-for-
height or nutritional edema). Due to this mismatch many children are needlessly referred and
sent back from the NRC (Prasad et al, 2012). Besides, the children treated at the NRCs need
adequate follow-up at the community level to ensure that they do not slip back into severe
undernutrition but this follow-up by both the ANM and the AWW is poor.

1.5    The NRHM can play a larger role in improving nutrition. As nutrition has an
important role in reduction of maternal, infant and child mortality, and the fact that both the
ICDS and the NRHM provide services to the same set of mothers and children, there are


                                                20
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



many opportunities for the NRHM to coordinate with the ICDS in strengthening the nutrition
service delivery such as: (i) MCTS, which at present does not adequately capture nutrition-
related indicators, could track marginalized communities; (ii) Reinforcing the correct use of
the recently introduced MCP card by both systems may help in strengthening growth
monitoring and promotion; (iii) Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) offers a valuable opportunity
to promote early and exclusive breastfeeding. A cadre of facility-based counselors could be
created or existing staff equipped with skills to reach mothers availing of institutional
deliveries (Ved and Jain, 2011).

2. DoL in the ICDS

Inadequate differentiation of functions in the ICDS is a significant capacity constraint.
Several functions that ought to be separate are put together in the same unit or assigned to
the same person and there is no dedicated functional home or personnel for most functions
and services. The staff is required to perform multiple functions without necessarily having
the skills to perform all of them. This results in creating heavy workloads for staff and
compromised ability to perform all functions satisfactorily.

2.1      In the ICDS there is insufficient differentiation of functions and critical functions
do not have dedicated organizational homes or dedicated persons to manage the
functions. In the current organizational structure of the ICDS at the national and state levels,
several unrelated functions are placed together in a unit and responsibilities for multiple
functions, often un-related, are assigned to the same people, and individuals also work across
several units. For example, at the national level, officials responsible for training or
monitoring also deal with many other subjects. Furthermore, many functions, especially the
technical functions, such as nutrition, growth monitoring, ECCE and Nutrition and Health
Education (NHEd) and the responsibility for developing a short- to medium- term vision for
that functional area or serve its planning, control and evaluation are not assigned to any
individuals, thus constraining the capacity of the program to deliver them optimally and
achieve desired results. At the district level, there is further lack of differentiation. The
district is the key level where management of the ICDS operation, district planning, training,
monitoring, problem solving ought to happen. However, given the total lack of functional
units or differentiated functional responsibility at that level, the management of functions at
the district level is severely constrained.

2.2     Insufficient functional differentiation and shortage of staff has led to functional
overload in the ICDS. Functional overload occurs in the ICDS at various levels and is due to
two main reasons: firstly, due to the lack of functional differentiation and, secondly, because
of the shortage of staff all functions get assigned to the staff in position. This results at all
levels in staff being assigned multiple functions and carrying unmanageable workloads (see
chapter 4, Availability, Competence and Management of Human Resources for a detailed
discussion of workloads and staff shortage). Functional overload, coupled with inadequate
skills and training for handling the diverse but specialized functions, and the shortage of staff,
limit their capacity to adequately carry out the functions assigned to them.

2.3     Some functional splits and misplacement also exist in the manner of functional
organization in the ICDS. There also are examples of functional splits in the ICDS. For
instance, the training function is split between the MWCD, GoI training unit and the ICDS
training institution, the NIPCCD. Whereas the ministry in coordination with states is
responsible for the training of supervisors, AWWs, and AWHs, the NIPCCD is responsible


                                                 21
                                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



for CDPO training and training of trainers. As a result, planning, budgeting, monitoring for
training conducted by the NIPCCD and the states happens separately and without
coordination between them, making it difficult to get an overall picture of the training
function that includes planning, budgeting and monitoring, thus contributing to the training
capacity constraints. Besides, functional misplacements exist in the FNB, the technical body
that assists the MWCD, GoI in nutrition. A recent assessment of the FNB supported by the
World Bank noted that several FNB functions, such as operation of food quality control
laboratories and directly conducting nutrition demonstrations on VHNDs that reach less than
one percent of the women in program areas, are misplaced functions and are not aligned to
meet the strategic policy and program support required of the FNB by the MWCD, GoI and
the ICDS.

2.4     The institutional structures proposed under the restructured ICDS, to an extent,
address the issues of inadequate differentiation but there appear to be some functional
splits and the continued lack of dedicated homes or units. The proposed ICDS mission
directorate organizational structures at all levels - national, state, district and block – show a
good separation of key functions, with dedicated units and personnel to manage them. At the
national level, dedicated units and personnel have been assigned for nutrition and health
services, ECCE, monitoring and evaluation, research, policy and planning, coordination and
logistics, and finance and expenditure, with additional arrangements for technical support in
several key functional areas11 through a proposed national ICDS mission resource center.
The state and district level structures largely mirror the functional units at the national level,
and at the block level also personnel are dedicated to coordinate health and nutrition services,
ECCE services, monitoring and evaluation and nutrition surveillance. For health and
nutrition, in the larger states, three sub-units -- nutrition, health and IYCF – are proposed,
thus reflecting the establishment of functional homes for the priority areas related to nutrition.
In this context, two issues become apparent: (i) it is unclear if there is a dedicated functional
unit for HR at the national and state level, this being a very important function that the ICDS
hopes to reform and strengthen; and (ii) training and IEC are placed in one functional unit,
whereas IEC and training are two separate specialized functions that are not directly related,
and require different skill sets, thus contributing to a potential functional misplacement that
could constrain capacity (MWCD,2012).

2.5     The restructured ICDS is likely to reduce functional overload at some levels but
at the operational level the problem appears to be compounded. New contractual
positions - technical, managerial and operational - have been created at all levels to
significantly augment the current sanctioned staff strength of the ICDS. For example, 25
contractual positions at the national mission directorate and 30 positions at the national ICDS
mission resource center, 14 positions at the state level, six positions at the district level, and
three positions at the block level will be added to carry out various functions. This is
expected to considerably reduce the work overload of the ICDS staff and make it more
manageable. However, a systematic functional and workload analysis has not yet been
undertaken and it is therefore not possible to assess the extent of workload optimization.
Moreover, there are no additional envisaged positions of CDPO, supervisor or AWW except
for a second AWW in approximately 10 percent of the AWCs but, although with the addition
of new activities, a greater functional overload than currently exists at these levels is
expected.


11
 These include policy planning, nutrition (IYCF and micronutrients), ECCE, health, advocacy and public education, monitoring and
evaluation, training and capacity building and grievance redressal.



                                                                  22
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



The restructured ICDS appears to largely address the key issues of insufficient functional
differentiation and functional overload, including creating dedicated units and positions for
many critical functions. However, the personnel leading the functional areas should also be
empowered with the ability to perform their roles effectively and at the same time be held
accountable for the achievement of results.

Recommendations:
This analysis clearly indicates that: (i) the intended synergy between the ICDS and the
NRHM for nutrition service delivery is hampered by ineffective coordination; and (ii) DoL
constraints in the ICDS need to be addressed to enhance its effectiveness. Thus, two sets of
recommendations are presented here to address the two categories of DoL constraints.

A.     To improve the effectiveness of the DoL between the NRHM and the ICDS:

i)      Nutrition should not only be accorded a higher priority in the NRHM but also
explicitly stated in its vision and mission documents, as well as in the job descriptions of its
functionaries. The national and state leaders of the health system and the NRHM should
clearly communicate the key role that the program plays in improving nutrition along with
the ICDS to all levels in their respective organizations. Besides, inclusion of a nutrition
indicator in the core NRHM indicator list will strengthen the focus on the program’s nutrition
related functions at the implementing level.

ii)      To improve on-the-ground functioning of the two primary coordination mechanisms
between the ICDS and the NRHM, namely the VHND and the VHSNCs, the following
critical points must be addressed:

      Clearly define the roles of ICDS and NRHM functionaries in terms of ‘who does
what’ at VHNDs, and the operational role of the VHSNCs;
     Define work processes and procedures, i.e., establish Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs) for VHNDs as well as supervision and monitoring of the functioning of VHNDs and
VHSNCs;
      Establish quality standards for conducting VHNDs and for the functioning of
VHSNCs.
    Clearly and frequently communicate the above to both sets of functionaries, and enhance
supervision and monitoring to ensure implementation of the guidelines and SOPs to ensure
delivery of the full package of services that ought to be delivered at VHNDs and not merely
immunization and antenatal checks;
    Where required, the geographical boundaries of the two programs should be harmonized.

iii)    Identification of malnourished children, their management and follow-up, especially
for those requiring referral to facilities is a critical gap that needs to be urgently addressed.
Given the important role, the ICDS and NRHM have in this respect, identification, referral
and follow-up of undernourished children should be jointly undertaken during the VHNDs.

iv)     The health sector can play a larger role in improving nutrition. With a greater number
of deliveries now taking place at the facilities, the NRHM should ensure initiation of
breastfeeding immediately after birth and counseling of mothers to exclusively breastfeed for


                                                 23
                                   Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



six months. The joint use of the NRHM’s MCTS by both programs must be explored, and the
use of MCP cards must be strengthened.

B. To address DoL constraints within the ICDS, particularly the key issue of insufficient
functional differentiation, the following structure and function issues require further
attention:

 Given the criticality of the HR function in the management and delivery of such a large
and ambitious program, a separate functional home and leadership for HR in the ICDS
mission is essential. The current ICDS mission’s organizational structure does not specify
where the HR function lies.
 The structure for several functions such as training, M&E, policy and planning, as well
as technical services like nutrition, health and ECCE, appear to be split between two homes,
namely the mission directorate and the National ICDS Mission Resource Center. The
proposed framework does not specify where overall responsibility for the functions lies.
Hence, in the new structure, the ICDS should develop high-level conceptual frameworks, or
ToRs, for the organizational units as well as technically sound job descriptions in order to
remove functional gaps and overlaps.
 A functional analysis of all ICDS job categories is required (see chapter 4, Availability,
Competence and Management of Human Resources in the System).

                                                            Leadership
Introduction
Leaders provide direction to the sectors, organizations and people that they lead. They define
the vision for the future, develop strategies and plans, mobilize resources, guide the
implementation of strategies and plans, and coordinate, control and evaluate the impact of the
policies, strategies and changes required for greater effectiveness.

In recent years, India has demonstrated impressive leadership, including that at the highest
level, to address its large undernutrition problem. In November 2009, the Prime Minister’s
National Nutrition Council for India’s Nutrition Challenges outlined the key future directions
for nutrition in the country.12 The broad directions laid out by this council are being pursued
through new programs and strengthening of existing ones, under the leadership of the
MWCD, GoI which is the nodal ministry of nutrition in India.

Given the importance of leadership in providing direction to sectors, programs and
organizations, this chapter focuses on leadership of the nutrition sector, and the delivery of
nutrition services in particular. In this report, the term ‘leaders’ includes top level leaders in
the national ministries of MWCD and MoHFW, the NRHM and the related departments and
program structures at the state, district and project levels. The report seeks to answer the
broad question:

What are the factors that enhance and constrain leadership capacity for: (i) nutrition as a
sector in India; and (ii) the delivery of nutrition services through the two principal
programs, the ICDS and the NRHM?

After briefly describing the analytical framework and indicators of leadership capacity used
in the analysis, this chapter discusses the key factors that have enabled or constrained the
capacity of leaders and managers to exert leadership, firstly, for nutrition as a sector, and
secondly, for the ICDS and the NRHM components responsible for delivering nutrition
services alongside the ICDS, at the national, state, district and block levels. It then suggests
the ways in which the capacity constraints could be addressed.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators
Leaders perform five key tasks and the quality of these serve as indicators of leadership
quality. These are: (i) provide direction to the sector or organization and define its future in
terms of desired outputs; (ii) develop strategies for achieving the desired outputs, ensuring
that these are followed by careful planning; (iii) mobilize people and other resources for the
implementation of the strategies and plans; (iv) continually articulate and communicate the


12
  These include: (i) strengthen and restructure the ICDS program to enable a special focus on pregnant and nursing mothers and children
under three, provide flexibility for local action, and forge institutional convergence with other national programs in health and sanitation,
particularly at the district and village levels; (ii) design a multi-sectoral plan in 200 high burden districts with institutional mechanism to
converge the national programs at the state, district, block and village levels; (iii) implement a nation-wide information, education and
communication campaign against malnutrition to address issues of the status of women, care of pregnant mothers and children under two,
breastfeeding, and the importance of balanced nutrition, health, hygiene and sanitation; and (iv) the need for GoI ministries and departments
of health, drinking water supply and sanitation, school education, agriculture and food and public distribution to bring about a strong
nutrition focus in their programs.

direction, strategies and plans; and (v) ensure unity of effort and keep organizations in the
sector, and people in the organizations on track, pursuing the direction given.

The extent to which each of these tasks is carried out can serve as an indicator of leadership
capacity.

The tools that leaders use to provide direction consist of the conceptual frameworks, vision,
mission and strategies. The existence of effective written statements of vision, mission and
strategy are also indicators of the strength of leadership (see Box 3.1 for definition of
effective vision, mission and strategy statements). Awareness of the importance of these
tools, and the ability to formulate and use them are therefore necessary.

                                   Box 3.1: Vision, Mission and Strategy
Vision is where a country or organization wishes to be, and the role it wants to play, usually in the medium to long term.
An effective vision offers a timeframe for its achievement and guides the selection of strategies, helping to choose
between those that take longer but deliver better results (sometimes even at a lower cost) and those that take lesser time
but with less favorable results (sometimes at a higher cost). A vision is weak without a timeframe, making it difficult to
set intermediate or shorter term operational goals and monitoring indicators, or being left with goals that are too modest to
achieve the vision. This often results in poor performance as there are no time-related benchmarks against which
performance can be measured, and even minimal progress ends up being viewed positively.

Mission is what an organization has to do based on its vision. It specifies targets, time and results, outlining in
quantitative terms not only what must be done, but also what must be achieved and by when, and may include other
performance parameters, such as quality and cost. It is the role of leadership to translate the long-term vision into shorter-
term missions, to determine the costs of these missions and to mobilize the funds needed by submitting budgetary plans
that reflect these costs. In practice, the full process is rarely followed. More often than not, governments and organizations
skip the formulation of missions and go straight into making budgetary plans.

Strategy is the way or combination of ways that a country or organization sets out to achieve its vision. There is almost
always more than one way of getting from one point to the other, and strategy is often about choice. It is important to find
all potential ways for getting from one point to the other and to choose the most promising way or ways and prioritize
them. There is rarely sufficient time, and there are rarely sufficient resources, to do everything that can be done. If
priorities are not set for people in the organization, then the people set their own priorities. Since strategies generally
consist of a relatively large number of actions, or strategic thrusts, leaders need to prioritize them. No strategy is complete
without such prioritization.



Effective leaders develop comprehensive conceptual frameworks for the sector or each
important function or problem that needs to be resolved. These articulate the working
hypotheses of dealing with a complex phenomenon – a system, process, function or behavior.
The working hypotheses describe, in particular, the structure of the phenomenon, its building
blocks, the relationships in the building blocks, and the manner in which they work
individually and collectively.

The vision, mission and objectives are not mere statements, but critical assertions of what any
organization aspires to achieve, and these define for each person within the agency the
purpose of their work, as well as the role each has to play in helping the organization achieve
its mission. Therefore, communication of the vision, mission and strategy are important and
effective leaders continually communicate the direction that they want the organization to
follow, explaining the strategies behind their plans, the visions behind their strategies and the
conceptual frameworks behind their visions. They incorporate messages of direction in daily
briefings, utilizing every opportunity to link the specifics of a situation with the bigger
picture. Not only do effective leaders talk about the direction, they also demonstrate their
commitment to it by personal example and resource allocation. This helps bridge the gap
between organizational strategy and the objectives of the average employee, often referred to


                                                              26

as the strategy-performance gap. Research indicates that less than 10 percent of all strategies
are effectively executed, one of the reasons for the gap being insufficient communication and
articulation of strategy (Kaplan and Norton, 1996).

Using these capacity indicators, the following section discusses: (i) the key findings related to
the definition of India’s national vision and mission to improve the nutrition status of women
and young children; (ii) the definition of the nutrition vision, mission and strategy for the two
key programs delivering nutrition services, namely the ICDS and the NRHM; (iii) the balance
between continuity and change; and (iv) the number of leaders required to take leadership of
the sector and the key programs.

 Findings
The absence of a dedicated organizational home for nutrition and a dedicated leader for
nutrition in the MWCD, GoI, and the non-existence of nutrition in the vision and mission
of the ministry are constraints for nutrition as a sector. Furthermore, nutrition is also not
included in the vision and mission of the MOHFW, GoI, which is the other key ministry
for delivering nutrition services. Leadership constraints are also reflected in the choice of
strategy and its feasibility. The ICDS strategy, with its mandate to deliver multiple services,
has been overly ambitious. The shortage of leaders and senior managers in the ICDS is
another leadership constraint.

1. Conceptual framework and organizational home for nutrition

While at the national level India’s policy documents provide a comprehensive policy and
conceptual framework for nutrition, the absence of a dedicated home for nutrition and a
dedicated leader for nutrition in the nodal GoI ministry of nutrition, the MWCD,



                                                       27
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



constrains leadership for the nutrition sector in India. This key gap also exists at the state
level.

1.1 India’s policy documents provide the broad sectoral conceptual framework for
nutrition. Several states have also outlined their own conceptual frameworks. The
National Nutrition Policy (NNP) adopted in 1993 and the National Plan of Action for
Nutrition (NPAN) formulated in 1995 spell out the conceptual framework for the nutrition
sector in India. A more recent framework is reflected in the MWCD, GoI strategy paper,
‘Addressing India’s Nutrition Challenges’ (2010), jointly developed by the MWCD, GoI,
MoHFW, GoI and the Planning Commission.

1.1.1 The NNP and NPAN provide a fairly comprehensive policy and conceptual
framework for nutrition. The framework includes both: (i) the direct nutrition policy
instruments to address malnutrition in the short to medium term (e.g., expanding the safety
net, improving coverage of the vulnerable, supplemental feeding, reducing micronutrient
deficiencies and food fortification); and (ii) the indirect longer term institutional and
structural arrangements that recognize the inter-sectoral nature of nutrition (e.g., food
security, dietary improvements, food production and distribution, health and family welfare
measures, communication, economic access, women’s status, research and nutrition
surveillance). The NPAN identifies the roles of approximately 14 different ministries and
departments in improving nutrition, outlining specific areas and actions for their involvement
and designates the MWCD, GoI as the coordinating agency for implementation of the plan.

1.1.2 The strategy paper ‘Addressing India’s Nutrition Challenges’ (2010) outlines the
most recent framework for improving nutrition. Developed jointly by the MWCD, GoI and
MoHFW, GoI in consultation with the Planning Commission and the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce,
the paper re-affirms the GoI priority and commitment to nutrition. It focuses on preventive
action during the first 1,000 days of life for addressing undernutrition, within a
comprehensive framework of universal health care, women’s empowerment and child
development, and with a continuum of care across the life cycle, from the family and
community to the AWC, carrying on to health centers and facilities. It further outlines the
conceptual framework for multi-sectoral action to prevent and reduce undernutrition in a
time-bound manner with the commitment of those involved.

1.1.3 Several states have articulated their own conceptual frameworks for nutrition.
Drawing upon the national conceptual frameworks, several states, especially those with a
high malnutrition burden have articulated their own nutrition conceptual frameworks to
reduce undernutrition. Named differently in different states, such as nutrition mission
document or framework, or state nutrition strategy, most have been prepared with the
assistance of development agencies and they are the equivalents of a conceptual framework
that articulates the hypothesis behind the action proposed to address undernutrition (see
Annex 2 for examples of summaries of such documents from selected states).

1.2 The MWCD, GoI is the designated nodal organizational home for nutrition in the
country. However, the ministry has no dedicated unit for nutrition, nor is there
dedicated leadership for nutrition. This key gap also exists at the state level. The NNP
assigns nodal responsibility for nutrition to the MWCD, GoI (earlier the Department of
Women and Child Development) and the NPAN elaborates its role further ‘to coordinate,
monitor and, wherever required, regulate the implementation of the National Plan of Action
on Nutrition’ through an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the secretary, WCD, GoI. The


                                                28
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



NPAN also outlines the setting up of a nutrition cell in the MWCD, GoI to enable it to
function as the nodal agency for implementation of the NNP and the NPAN.

1.2.1 While the MWCD, GoI is the nodal ministry for nutrition in India, there is no
dedicated unit or division for nutrition, nor is there a dedicated senior level leader for
nutrition. The nutrition cell envisaged as the nodal agency for nutrition has not been set up in
the MWCD, GoI even today. The sectoral responsibility for nutrition in the MWCD, GoI is
bundled with the ICDS under one of the two child development divisions of the ministry.
This is also the case with leadership for nutrition. As a result, sectoral responsibility for
nutrition has not received the attention it deserves in the ministry or in the overall policy
discourse and actions on nutrition, with the ICDS and, more recently, the other new nutrition-
related schemes taking center stage with respect to leadership, discourse and actions.

1.2.2 The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB), amongst its many disparate functions, is also
mandated to provide technical support for nutrition to the MWCD, GoI and the states, but
does not have the capacity required to fulfill the desired role. An assessment of the FNB
undertaken by the World Bank at the request of the MWCD, GoI points out that its current
roles, responsibilities, structure and capacities do not meet the MWCD, GoI’s need for
technical support in nutrition. The report recommends a full reorganization of the FNB
(World Bank, 2013).

1.2.3 The lack of a dedicated unit in the MWCD, GoI has constrained its ability to lead and
coordinate nutrition action across various sectors. The role of the MWCD, GoI as the nodal
agency defined in the NPAN remains to be fully implemented and several important
leadership initiatives assigned to the MWCD, GoI remain unfulfilled, such as:
 The NPAN notes that the MWCD, GoI should establish a national nutrition surveillance
system to monitor the nutrition situation at all levels through grassroot level workers and
communities. It also assigns to the MWCD, GoI the responsibility for commissioning
operational research on nutrition issues of national importance defined in the NPAN.
Unfortunately, no action has been taken in these areas.
 The 11thfive-year plan had outlined several thrust areas for nutrition. Two of these - food
fortification and promotion of community and household production of fruits and vegetables -
were not linked in the plan to any program or implementing agency and ended up being ‘un-
owned mandates’, and therefore saw no progress. The MWCD, GoI as the nodal coordinator
for nutrition across all agencies, should have ensured that the thrust areas were pursued and
action implemented by the departments concerned.

1.2.4 In recent years, the leadership demonstrated by the MWCD, GoI for nutrition is
critical and must be sustained. Despite the lack of a dedicated nutrition unit, over the past
four years, it has demonstrated leadership in defining national priorities for nutrition.
Engaging with other key ministries, including the PC, and other principal stakeholders, it led
the effort to build consensus on options to address India’s huge undernutrition challenge. This
culminated in the high-level National Nutrition Council, headed by the Prime Minister,
making important recommendations to improve nutrition (refer footnote 12). The MWCD,
GoI laudably fulfilled its leadership responsibility and accomplished the following actions to
pursue the four recommendations: (i) launched a national IEC multi-media campaign to
create awareness about nutrition; (ii) led the ICDS reform and its restructuring; (iii) launched
a new multi-sectoral nutrition program for 200 high malnutrition burden districts; and (iv)
engaged with the allied ministries to lend greater focus on nutrition in their programs.

1.2.5 The lack of a dedicated functional home and leadership for nutrition at the national
level is mirrored at the state level. As at the national level, the states too have no dedicated
unit or leader for nutrition, being bundled with the ICDS under the same leader and the same
unit. The consequences are similar to those at the national level whereby leadership,
discourse and policy discussion are limited to the ICDS and the nutrition action in its domain,
whereas the leadership for cross-sectoral nutrition thinking, action and coordination is
marginal.

2. Vision, mission and strategy for nutrition

The national five-year plans outline a vision and strategy for nutrition and define targets
for reducing undernutrition. However, the absence of nutrition in the vision, mission and
objectives of the nodal ministry for nutrition, namely the MWCD, GoI and in the vision,
mission or objectives of the MoHFW, GoI (which is the other key ministry for delivering
nutrition services) reflects a key leadership constraint. As a result, nutrition receives low
priority in the NRHM; the role of the NRHM vis-à-vis nutrition is poorly communicated
down the program hierarchy, and the functionaries’ awareness of their role in improving
nutrition is poor. While ICDS functionaries are generally aware of the national vision to
improve undernutrition, the lack of specific targets inhibits clarity of purpose.
Furthermore, the ICDS program strategies have not prioritized the most effective
interventions and the groups most vulnerable to undernutrition. Besides, the mismatch
between its ambitious mandate and the physical, financial and human resources available
have constrained the effectiveness of the program.

2.1     India’s national plan documents reflect strong vision statements and outline
clear national strategies to improve nutrition. India’s national five-year plans articulate the
country’s five-year vision and priorities and the financial outlays for each of the sectors as
well as for major national programs. The 10th, 11th and 12th five-year plans provide clear
direction at the national level to reduce undernutrition (see Box 3.2).

2.1.1 Each five-year plan has set clear targets for the reduction of undernutrition within its
timeframe.The five-year plans have set targets for key indicators, such as reduction in the
prevalence of underweight in children and micronutrient deficiencies (Box 3.2). The plan
documents further define clear sectoral and program strategies to move the country in the
desired direction.

2.1.2 However, targets appear to be aspirational rather than realistic. The targets in the
plans appear to be largely aspirational, since the magnitude of the reduction in undernutrition
expected in each plan is too large to be achieved over a five year period. Moreover, the
strategies outlined and the financial outlays provided do not match the targets. Thus, despite
most strategies being in implementation for several years, they have not yielded the desired
results. The largest outlays have been made for provision of supplemental food through the
ICDS, a strategy that has not brought about much improvement in child or maternal nutrition.
Furthermore, the plan documents do not indicate additional outlays for many of the strategies,
including ‘intensifying nutrition and health education to improve infant and child feeding and
caring practices such as exclusive breastfeeding for six months and introduction of semi-
solids at six months (10th five-year plan)’, ‘horticulture interventions, food fortification (11th
five-year plan)’ and ‘combating micronutrient deficiencies and promoting optimal IYCF (12th
five-year plan)’

      Box 3.2: Vision, strategy and approach in the 10th, 11th and 12th five-year plans
                                                  The 12th five-year plan (2012 – 2017)
Vision: Prevention and reduction of undernutrition in children under three years to half of NFHS 3 level (40.4% under-weight, 22.9%
wasted and 44.9% stunted as per NFHS -3 data) by 2017. The prevalence of under-weight children is expected to be 29 percent by 2015,
and 27 percent by 2017and reduction of anemia among women in the 15-49 year bracket to 28 percent.
Strategy:
          Convergent action on nutrition focusing on multi-stakeholder strategies
          Combating micronutrient deficiencies in a holistic manner: supplementation, food fortification, dietary diversification,
           horticultural interventions and IEC
          Strengthening and restructuring of the ICDS with special emphasis on pregnant and lactating mothers and children under three
          Promoting optimal infant and young child feeding practices
Approach: Re-design and reinforce the package of ICDS services, including a new component of Child Care and Nutrition Counseling for
mothers of children under three years, increase focus on infant and young child feeding, health, hygiene, psycho-social care, early learning
and care of girls and women, ensure convergence with related sectors such as NRHM, TSC, NRDWP, SSA, MGNREGA through joint
planning, joint monitoring of key results and indicators and defined roles and accountabilities and strengthen training of anganwadi and
ASHA workers on issues relating to nutrition; implement ISSNIP in 162 high burden districts; and link IGMSY to the umbrella ICDS
mission.

                                                  The 11th five-year plan (2007 – 2012)
Vision: During the plan period, reduce malnutrition in children under three to half (from 45.9 percent to 23 percent), and reduce anemia in
women and girls by 50 percent (from 56 percent to 28 percent).
Strategy: The plan outlines a five-pronged strategy to improve micronutrient deficiencies:
                     Dietary diversification
                     Nutrient supplementation
                     Horticulture interventions
                     Food fortification
                     Public health measures
Approach: The NRHM and the ICDS to stress on implementation of these strategies; emphasize the monitoring of micronutrient
deficiencies through district level household surveys and expansion of the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) under the
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and include de-worming of children as a strategy to be promoted through the ICDS and
schools. It provides direction for ICDS restructuring and strengthening, with greater focus on children under three, district planning,
engagement of local governments, panchayats, food procurement and supervision, improved fund flow to the district level, strengthening
convergence between the ICDS and health and goes deeper in defining some ways to improve convergence.

                                                     The 10th five-year plan (2002-2007)
Vision: During the plan period, reduce under-weight children under three from 47 percent to 40 percent; reduce severe undernutrition in
children of 0-6 years by 50 percent; reduce prevalence of anemia by 25 percent and that of moderate and severe anemia by 50 percent and
eliminate vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem; and reduce Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) to less than 10 percent by 2010.
Strategies:
           Strengthen specific services to address undernutrition, for example ‘reaching children in the 6 -36 month age group, pregnant
      and lactating women
           Intensify nutrition and health education to improve infant and child feeding and caring practices such as exclusive
      breastfeeding for six months and introduction of semi-solids at six months
           Administer vitamin A supplements according to schedule and iron-foliate supplements when needed
           Identify and treat the undernourished, for example ‘screening for nutritional deficiencies in vulnerable groups and initiating
      appropriate remedial measures, including screening pregnant women for undernutrition and anemia and providing appropriate
      interventions, and screening all children to identify and treat those severely undernourished, or whose growth is faltering, weigh all
      newborns soon after birth, identify low birth weight babies and refer to hospitals for treatment those with birth weight belo w 2.2 kg’.
Approach: The ICDS and the NRHM to lay stress on the implementation of these strategies, as well as enhancing the quality and impact
of the ICDS substantially through training, supervision of ICDS personnel, improved community ownership and establishing a reliable
monitoring and evaluation mechanism and improving inter-sectoral convergence.




2.2     While the national five-year plans define targets for reducing undernutrition,
nutrition is not explicit in the vision, mission and objectives of either of the two
ministries that have a key role in improving nutrition, namely the MWCD, GoI and the
MOHFW, GoI. Each ministry is expected to state its priorities and outline its vision, mission
and objectives, including the activities and outcomes to be achieved. An analysis of the
results framework documents (RFDs) of the MWCD, GoI and the MoHFW, GoI indicates the
following:




                                                                      31
                                           Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



2.2.1 The MWCD, GoI’s strategic documents do not articulate a vision, strategy or
objectives for nutrition, nor do they reflect its leadership role in nutrition. Despite being the
ministry in-charge of nutrition in India, with a clear mandate to set nutrition policy directions
and programs, coordinate with other ministries on actions relating to nutrition, the MWCD,
GoI RFD and its strategic plan (2011-2016) does not include any vision, mission or objective
for nutrition beyond the ICDS, or with respect to its leadership role for the nutrition sector
(see Box 3.3). The MWCD, GoI vision and mission are centered around its two divisions
(besides the financial division), namely women and child development. Had there been a
dedicated nutrition unit, the ministry’s sectoral role might have been reflected in its RFD,
with a higher chance of holistic nutrition objectives being formulated, rather than being
confined to those related to the programs which the ministry implements.

2.2.2 The MoHFW, GoI also has a key role in addressing undernutrition, yet its vision and
strategy are silent on nutrition. While several direct nutrition interventions and their delivery
fall within the domain of the MOHFW, GoI, primarily the NRHM, such as delivery of
micronutrients to pregnant, nursing mothers and children, nutrition counseling, and
management of severe undernutrition, the ministry’s RFD for 2013-14 has no reference to
nutrition in its vision, mission or objectives (see Box 3.4).

2.3     At the core of India’s national straegy to address undernutrition is the ICDS
program of the MWCD, GoI and the NRHM program of the MoHFW, GoI. The ICDS is
the national flagship nutrition program and the key strategy to address undernutrition.
Conceived as being an inter-sectoral program, the ICDS draws upon and coordinates with the
services of other sectors, primarily the NRHM, and remains the largest program to address
nutrition. Additional strategies have been adopted in recent years to improve nutrition of
adolescent girls and increase the focus on pregnant and nursing mothers with the introduction
in 2010 of two new pilot programs, namely the IGSMY, a conditional cash transfer scheme to
promote better maternal nutrition and exclusive breast feeding, and SABLA, an adolescent
empowerment program that includes nutrition education and anemia prevention. The
nutrition related vision, mission and strategies of the ICDS and the NRHM are discussed in
the following paragraphs.

2.3.1 Although being implemented for over 35 years, the ICDS has only recently defined
clear nutrition objectives and targets with timelines. Until its recently approved restructuring,
the ICDS vision and mission had not defined targets for improving nutrition. However, this
gap has recently been addressed, and clear nutrition outcomes with indicators and targets are



                                                     33
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



now outlined in the ICDS mission framework document. In addition, the revised MIS for the
program includes meaningful indicators to track nutrition outcomes.

2.3.2 The ambitious ICDS strategy was technically, financially and operationally not very
feasible and constrained in its impact. The ICDS strategy places nutrition as an integral part
of child development, in which nutrition services are delivered as part of a basket of services
for pregnant-nursing mothers and children up to six years, in coordination with other sectoral
programs, primarily the NRHM. The services include supplementary nutrition, nutrition and
health education, immunization, ECCE, health check-ups and referrals. The large number of
services in the ICDS package has made its mandate very ambitious.

(i)     Several studies and evaluations of the ICDS have pointed out the reasons for its
failure in creating the desired impact (Ahmed 2005; Gragnolati et al 2005; Right to Food
Campaign 2007). The key reasons are that the strategy:

 did not preferentially target pregnant women and children under two and, instead, focused
on older children;
 did not prioritize the most effective interventions to improve nutrition such as nutrition
education for behavior change centered around feeding and caring practices, especially for
pregnant women and young children; and
 was overly focused on supplemental food distribution that diverted effort, time and
resources away from addressing the more important determinants of undernutrition.

(ii)   The ICDS did not have the financial, human and physical resources to match its
ambitious mandate. While this study does not focus on assessing the adequacy of financial
resources for nutrition, the shortage of human resources and material resources shows that the
ICDS does not have the wherewithal to implement its complex and ambitious mandate. For
example:

 The size of the ICDS workforce comprising leaders, managers and frontline workers is
inadequate to effectively implement the ICDS strategy. Primary and secondary data indicates
that there is a huge mismatch between the volume of ICDS work and the people available to
accomplish it and that functionaries at all levels work beyond their capacities. As discussed in
chapter 4, Availability, Competence and Management of Human Resources: (a) an AWW
spends more than 4.5 hours per day to perform a fraction of the full set of responsibilities; (b)
supervisors are occupied with other ICDS and non-ICDS tasks and are left with only
approximately five days to perform supervisory visits to AWCs, which is an important part of
their job; (c) CDPOs are overstretched and spend approximately 26 days a month attending
meetings, performing administrative tasks, apart from other WCD and non-ICDS tasks that
add to their large volume of work; (d) sanctioned positions remain vacant for prolonged
periods; and (e) data indicates that leaders are involved in operations, managers are stretched,
and officials are assigned responsibilities for several functions.

 The shortage of material resources constrains the ICDS in implementing its strategy. The
ICDS lacks the proper physical infrastructure, equipment and supplies necessary to deliver
good quality nutrition services to its beneficiaries. The data indicates that not even 50 per
cent of AWCs in the country operate from their own buildings, a large percentage do not
have adequate space to carry out daily operations, basic amenities like toilet and clean
drinking water are not available, as is also the case with availability of equipment and other

necessary supplies. The availability of resources is much worse in districts where nutrition
outcomes are the poorest (see Figure 3.1 in Section 2.3.5).

2.3.3 While the weaknesses of the ICDS strategy were known, the program continued to be
expanded without addressing the issues .In order to address undernutrition, the ICDS was
expanded to ‘universalize’ its coverage by establishing an ICDS center in each habitation of
the country. This strategic choice, while rapidly expanding the program and establishing
AWCs in almost every village during 2005-2013, also meant that each new AWC and the
total of approximately1.3 million AWCs also inherited the weaknesses of the existing ICDS
model, and the likelihood of the same sub-optimal impact. An alternate strategic option
could have been to address the weaknesses, test the strengthened model and then expand the
ICDS; yet another could have first targeted the high malnutrition burden areas with intensive
effort. The restructuring and strengthening of the program has recently been undertaken, after
achieving the proposed expansion. While in retrospect arguments can be made for or against
either strategic option, a robust analysis of all strategic options remains critical to selecting
the most appropriate one. It appears that such an analysis was not undertaken for the ICDS.

2.3.4 The restructuring of the ICDS and its implementation in mission mode, much like the
NRHM, has addressed many technical weaknesses in its strategy and will have significantly
more resources. However, it continues to have too many priorities. The ICDS mission
addresses the key weaknesses in its earlier strategy to improve nutrition. It has improved the
focus on pregnant, nursing mothers and children under three, and has designed a separate
component for care and counseling, for community mobilization and awareness, and for
health related services including strengthening referrals, and identification of malnourished
children. It also outlines several new implementation approaches for the delivery of these
services and several management reforms including decentralized planning, management and
flexible architecture. It is considerably better resourced in terms of the physical and material,
financial, technical and human resources and management structures, and outlines the
strengthening of key systems, such as HR, training, M&E and accountability among others.
However, the program continues to have too many priorities; and having too many priorities
is equivalent to having none. Given the scale of the program and the huge change envisaged,
the phasing of ICDS priorities needs to be based on a more robust analysis of the resources
finally made available to the program.

2.3.5 The ICDS needs a deliberate strategy to prioritize the strengthening of nutrition
service delivery in the worst off districts .Data from the HUNGaMA Survey (2011)
conducted in 100 focus districts13 demonstrates striking differences in the levels of
undernutrition and provision of nutrition services in AWCs across the three types of districts
surveyed (Focus Districts, Best Districts in Focus States and Best Districts in Best States).
The incidence of stunting is over 53 percent for children in Focus Districts, compared with 39
percent in Good Districts in Focus States, and 33 percent in Good Districts in Good States.
There are differences in the household wealth index and the village development index (data
not shown) across types of districts, which is likely to contribute to higher levels of
undernutrition in the Focus Districts. However, the availability and quality of nutrition


13
  The districts were selected using a Child Development Index developed in 2009 by Indicus Analytics for UNICEF India. The 100 rural
districts that ranked at the bottom of the index – referred to as the ‘100 focus districts’ - were surveyed. These districts belong to the
following six states: Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (referred to as the Focus States). The survey
also covered the 'best' district from each Focus State and the six 'best districts' from the Child Development Index. The best districts
comprised two each from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh.




                                                                   35

services also vary considerably across the types of districts (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). The
analysis of the HUNGaMA data shows that nutrition resources and quality of services are
also strongly correlated with the nutrition outcomes in the districts. Thus, where the need is

                                                                         weakest. The variation and

                                                                mission statements include no
                                                                mention of nutrition. The
                                                                NRHM, which is the key
                                                                program that delivers several
                                                                nutrition services alongside the
                                                                ICDS, has no stated nutrition
                                                                objectives or targets. While the
                                                                NRHM program document
                                                                (2005-12) does acknowledge
nutrition, sanitation, hygiene and safe drinking water as determinants of good health, and
does include it as part of the preparation and implementation of an inter-sectoral district
health plan, it does not include any specific nutrition outcome indicators. Although at the
operational level, some nutrition related indicators such as iron-folate distribution to pregnant
women and number of VHNDs are tracked, these are not included in the core list of
indicators that are reviewed periodically and are thus accorded lower priority. A further
discussion on these points is included in the chapter 6 on monitoring, evaluation, and the
management of information in the nutrition system.

2.4      The NRHM strategy for nutrition focuses on the management of severely
undernourished children and the prevention and treatment of anemia in pregnant
women. The strategies pursued by the NRHM include developing technical guidelines for the
management of severe undernutrition – both at facilities and at the community level,
undertaking appropriate management of children with severe undernutrition at facilities
through: (i) setting up and managing NRCs at district hospitals, especially in states and
districts where the burden of undernutrition is particularly high; (ii) delivering micronutrients
to mothers and children per policy and protocols; and (iii) coordinating with the ICDS for
converging health and nutrition services, referral of sick and severely undernourished
children. Recognizing that it could play a larger role in prevention of undernutrition, the


                                                    36
                                      Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



NRHM has adopted the strategy to train ASHAs in nutrition counseling. However, data
collected from different levels in Bihar and Tamil Nadu indicated that the NRHM staff at
various levels does not see a role for themselves in the prevention of undernutrition. As a
result, coordination with the ICDS in the preventive aspects is sub-optimal, and even VHND
strategy implementation dwells largely on conducting immunization. Thus, even the
opportunity for the VHND to identify undernourished children, counsel their mothers, and
refer severely undernourished children is not used. Most children in the NRCs come through
hospital admissions whereas institutional referral linkage with the ICDS is weak. It is ironic
that the NRCs in Bihar (at the time of field data collection) were sub-optimally utilized, even
though Bihar has a high prevalence of severely undernourished children.

2.5     While most states follow the strategies of centrally sponsored schemes, namely
the ICDS and the NRHM, some states have defined their own visions and targets for
nutrition. As the ICDS and the NRHM are both centrally sponsored programs, the states
follow the strategic directions laid out nationally. The GoI is responsible for policy and
guideline formulation, allocation of funds, M&E, while the state governments are responsible
for the delivery of all ICDS services, training, staff appointments, human resources, other
administrative issues and monitoring and supervision of the programs. While most states
merely implement the programs in the light of their high undernutrition rates, several states
such as Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have
formulated state-specific nutrition missions or strategies, targeted towards improvement of
the nutritional status of children and women. Some states such as Madhya Pradesh and Tamil
Nadu have given clear targets for reducing undernutrition in children and anemia among
women of the reproductive age group. The nutrition documents of other states such as
Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra lay down the overall goal of improving the
nutritional status of children and women but do not provide definite targets or timelines.
Though the states have articulated their nutrition strategies, their comprehensiveness varies as
does the commitment of funds (see Annex 3).

2.6     While the staff at all levels of the ICDS hierarchy is aware of the national vision
and its own vision for nutrition, in the case of the NRHM the national vision for
nutrition is poorly understood. Among the workers at the block and central levels
interviewed for this study, all ICDS workers were aware of the vision to reduce
undernutrition, many health workers were not. Within the ICDS, the most frequently
mentioned service to improve nutrition was ‘supplementary feeding’, while other services
such as growth monitoring, counseling, IFA tablets, immunization were mentioned only
when further probed. The FGDs and interviews indicated that except at the highest
leadership levels in the MoHFW, GoI and the state H&FW departments, most officials
including the senior level ones of the NRHM (in their first response) did not think of nutrition
as a subject but as the responsibility of the ICDS. Invariably, the key service to address
undernutrition was identified as ‘supplementary feeding’ by the ICDS. Only with prompting
or deeper probing did they acknowledge the NRHM’s role in the distribution of
micronutrients, treatment of severe undernutrition, and conducting monthly VHNDs. In this
regard, the statements of a senior health ministry official that “there isn’t a clearly articulated
nutrition vision,” or that of a chief surgeon who is “unaware of a vision for nutrition,” or
BMOs who said they did not know of any vision for nutrition in the NHRM are quite telling.
This again underscores the importance of including and repeatedly disseminating nutrition in
the vision, mission and objectives of the MoHFW, GoI and MWCD, GoI and in the NRHM.

3   Balance between continuity and change

Until its restructuring in 2012, the ICDS has been a largely static program and has not
been able to maintain a sustainable balance between continuity and change. While it has
adopted some new approaches in improving service delivery, it was unable to change its
strategy significantly. The NRHM, since its inception in 2005, has generally been able to
strike a better balance and has added activities to increase its focus on nutrition.

3.1     Overall, continuity and not change has been the defining characteristic of ICDS
strategies. The ICDS has until its recent restructuring been a relatively static program, and
most strategies and operational policies have not been altered since its inception in 1975. It is
the role of leaders to regulate the necessary direction of change, and its timing and pace. They
need to keep a sustainable balance between the two needs – the need to change and the need
to keep the pace of change realistic. The ICDS has not kept a sustainable balance between
continuity and change. While some refinements in the implementation approach have been
made, major strategic changes have remained elusive.

3.1.1 Even though strategies and operational policies have not undergone much change,
the ICDS has adopted learning from good practices and refined its implementation approach.
While the system generally lacked dynamism to bring about the required change, the ICDS
has made efforts to introduce and institutionalize new implementation approaches based on
learning from good practices, particularly from experiences in development partner-supported
areas. Several states too have, within the existing strategic framework, introduced innovative
approaches to enhance implementation. These include conducting VHNDs to bring about
better coordination between the delivery of health and nutrition services, take home rations
for pregnant and nursing mothers and children under three, and the use of local customs to
promote appropriate infant and young child feeding practices.

3.1.2 In recent years, the ICDS has demonstrated the ability to change through several new
initiatives. Over the past few years, the ICDS has undertaken several analyses and steps for
major systemic improvements and filling the gaps. Some key initiatives include the design,
testing and roll-out of a new MIS, a nutrition resource e-platform for knowledge sharing, an
ECCE draft policy and curriculum framework, adoption of the WHO child growth standards
and designing a joint mother and child protection card. The most significant and large change
is the restructuring of the ICDS (see para 2.3.4).

3.1.3 The much needed change in strategies to address the known problems has, however,
been slow. The ICDS is one of the most widely studied programs, and a large number of
assessments, reports and papers by various stakeholders speak of its many weaknesses and
the unsatisfactory impact of its strategies. These include the need for the ICDS to: (i)
strengthen the focus on pregnant, nursing mothers and children under three to improve
nutrition; (ii) increase the program focus on counseling and promote behavior change; and
(iii) catch growth faltering early on to prevent undernutrition. Despite the extensive
information available on the most effective strategies to address undernutrition, and shifts
required in the ICDS strategies to enhance the nutrition impact, the ICDS has not, until its
recent restructuring, introduced any major change in its strategy. Similarly, there are major
shortcomings in the ICDS training system, borne out by evaluations and studies, which have
offered recommendations to address the weaknesses, but little action has been taken.
Currently, training reform is under consideration to address the key issues.

                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



3.2 The NRHM has achieved a better balance between continuity and change. The
NRHM, since its inception in 2005, has taken a number of steps to increase its focus on
nutrition and to explicitly include nutrition-related activities in its annual plans. The annual
program implementation plans (PIPs), which form the mechanism for annual planning in the
NRHM, now include training for frontline workers on lactation management and the
strengthening of convergence with the ICDS through platforms such as VHNDs. Recognizing
the need to strengthen nutrition counseling at the community level, this was added to the
training modules for ASHAs and, in 2011, the VHSC was expanded to include nutrition in its
mandate and renamed as VHSNC.

4.     Agenda overload and shortage of leaders

There is no dedicated leader for nutrition, or for the ICDS program, and leaders
responsible for both have many other competing priorities. Since they are also responsible
for operational issues, there is an agenda overload at the leadership level. In the NRHM,
the overall situation appears better, although nutrition is not accorded a high priority by its
leaders and officials.

4.1     The acute shortage of leaders and senior managers in the ICDS leads to an
agenda overload for its leaders. The situation in the NRHM appears much better.
Considering the ambitious and complex mandate of the ICDS, at the MWCD, GoI and state
levels, leadership positions (including senior managers who are also leaders) are too few.
Furthermore, the ICDS is only one of several programs, schemes and sectors entrusted to
leaders in key decision-making positions. Thus, there is no dedicated top level leader for such
a large and complex program. Besides, there are no technical advisors to assist the top
leaders, there being only one or two senior manager or leader positions to fulfill mostly
operational roles. However, all decision-making authority rests only with the top leader,
usually the secretary or the joint secretary in the MWCD, GoI and the secretary or principal
secretary in the states, and these include most operational decisions. As a result, leaders at the
state and national levels are heavily involved with management and operational
responsibilities and day-to-day problem solving, and critical leadership functions get
neglected. Similarly, at the next level, senior managers are very few and usually not
dedicated to heading their functional and technical areas such as training, monitoring,
nutrition and ECCE.

4.1.1 At the district level, the paucity of staff (sanctioned positions and vacancies)
compromises the DPO’s ability to lead and comprehensively manage the ICDS. Interviews
with officials at the district, state and national levels pointed towards the mismatch between
the volume of work and people available to accomplish it, and the fact that everyone worked
beyond their capacities. Similarly at the CDPO level, the key operational leadership and
management position, the work overload is huge. For example, the staffing norms for the
district project office provide for five administrative staff to support the DPO, who is
expected to perform all functions such as monitoring, coordination within the ICDS and with
other key departments, and supervision. A large number of sanctioned positions remain
vacant for prolonged periods. In the test sample of 65 DPO offices, more than 30 percent of
the positions for office superintendent and statistical assistant were vacant in 2011 (CAG,
2012). Regardless of the size of the project, which could have twice the number of AWCs, or
more than the norm, there was only one CDPO sanctioned per project. This overload, among
other factors, contributes to compromises in management (chapter 4, Availability,
Competence and Management of Human Resources in the System). Thus, leaders are


                                                 39
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



involved in operations, managers are stretched, and officials are assigned responsibilities for
several functions, regardless of existing workload, skill sets or training. The ICDS has
expanded manifold and new programs added for the same managers, creating an agenda
overload at all levels.

4.1.2 Vacancies, particularly at the senior and mid-management levels further aggravate
the agenda overload of the leaders. While top level leadership positions at the national and
state levels are filled promptly, the vacancies for managers at the national, state, district and
block levels remain high (chapter 4, Availability, Competence and Management of Human
Resources in the System). Since vacancies take long to fill, acting personnel are appointed to
take care of critical functions, primarily to meet signatory functions. The most critical in
terms of vacancies is the CDPO position that has to lead and manage on-the-ground
implementation of the strategy envisioned by the top management. However, approximately a
third of these are vacant and, as a result, the corresponding one-third of the program has no
leadership at the operational level and the management suffers.

4.2     Under the NRHM, the situation appears much better. The establishment of the
NRHM, well-staffed mission directorates with technical and managerial staff at the national,
state and district levels and improved staffing in the field, has led to better availability of
leaders and managers than that in the ICDS. Nevertheless, interviews with medical officers at
different levels, especially in Bihar, did convey an agenda overload at the district and block
levels, with one officer leading more than one program due to many vacant positions, and the
shortage of medical officers.

Recommendations
Among the most significant factors that have constrained the leadership for nutrition in the
country are the absence of a dedicated organizational home and lack of leaders. Even though
during the past few years the MWCD, GoI has exerted laudable leadership in the nutrition
sector, the capacity constraints discussed so far continue to hinder its leadership role. There
are still several areas that require leadership and attention, including nutrition surveillance,
research, evaluation of program strategies, food fortification, and the emerging double burden
of malnutrition in the country.

In this scenario, the recommendations are:
1.       It is critical to establish in the MWCD, GoI a dedicated organizational unit led by a
senior official to: (i) take leadership of the sector; (ii) provide strategic direction including
that related to other sectors; (iii) convene the necessary policy discussions; (iv) commission
research and assessments; and (v) ensure surveillance of trends for both undernutrition,
overweight and obesity. It is also important that the unit be appropriately staffed, resourced
and empowered to take full stewardship of the sector. The GoI will, therefore, have to
provide the necessary financial and human resources to enable it to exert stewardship. In the
case of the MWCD, GoI this will essentially require separating the overall nutrition
stewardship function from its function as implementer of the ICDS and other nutrition
schemes.
2.      The MWCD, GoI, being the country’s nodal ministry for nutrition, must explicitly
include nutrition in its vision and mission statements in strategy documents and RFDs.
Nutrition should be at par with the two key areas, namely women and children, in the
ministry’s vision and mission statements. Similarly, the vision and mission statements of the

MoHFW, GoI and the NRHM must articulate their commitment to their role in improving
nutrition.
3.       Much of what is desired as change is already incorporated in the restructured ICDS
implementation framework. The reform will be challenging and, if implemented well, can be
a game changer. Leadership and its enabling factors will play a critical role in successful
implementation. The ICDS mission strategy continues to be very ambitious, and also
continues to have a large number of objectives and activities. Operationally, having too many
priorities is tantamount to having none, since the time and resources available may hamper
achieving all of them at the same time. It is, therefore, suggested that:

 as one of the first steps in the course of its implementation, the ICDS mission should align
its priorities better with the resources available, and set clear and realistic time bound targets
that should be communicated frequently down to the grassroot level; and
 since implementation takes place at the state level and results are measured by what
happens on the ground, given the varying capacities, context and issues, with resultant
differences in the targets that each state can achieve, it will be important to arrive at a
common understanding of targets and timelines with each state.
4.      Since the implementation and quality of the ICDS is weakest in the areas with the
greatest needs, it must articulate an explicit strategy to prioritize the districts with the poorest
health, nutrition and wealth indices, and develop clear guidelines for its implementation and
management. It should spell out the implications of such a strategy, that enables: (i) provision
of additional resources – physical, financial and human (including priority staffing of vacant
positions) – in these areas; and (ii) tighter management, including monitoring and
supervision.
5.      One of the basic issues that the ICDS needs to resolve is the development of written
conceptual frameworks for each functional area as these would guide the holistic
development of each area. The top leaders should ensure that senior managers, who are also
leaders, develop these so that each function is fully built up and operationalized.
6.      Implement a leadership development program for top leaders and senior managers.
 For leaders, the content should include experiential learning on how to lead, how to develop
 conceptual frameworks and models, how to formulate vision statements, policies and
 strategies and set the tone for organizational culture, both through direction to the
 organization and personal example.

  Availability, Competence and Management of Human Resources in the
                                System

Introduction
The capacity of an organization to deliver its mandate is influenced, among others factors, by
its human resources (HR). Human resources are the most valuable of all resources in any
organization or agency, and their effective management is one of its most critical functions.

This chapter focuses on an analysis of the critical issues that enable or constrain the current
workforce in the ICDS and the health system to adequately and efficiently deliver high
quality nutrition services, under their respective mandates, to improve the nutritional status of
pregnant nursing mothers and children under three years of age. Using an analytical
framework described in the first section below, the next three sections discuss the three key
capacity constraints outlined in the conceptual framework, followed by the final section
outlining some suggestions to improve the availability, management and motivation of
human resources in the nutrition system. The three key questions sought to be answered here
are:

 1. Do the people working currently for the ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission
    (NRHM), at operational and management levels (from the village to the district), have
    adequate capacity to carry out their agency’s mandate to improve nutrition, fully and
    effectively?

 2. Do the MWCD and the relevant departments in the states managing the ICDS HR
    function have the ability to recruit people with such capacity or with adequate
    potential capacity and then: (a) develop them to the level necessary; and (b) engage
    them productively? If not, what are the constraints?

 3. If the ability is not strong enough, what can be done about it?

The analysis presented in the following pages leads us to conclude that the shortage of staff
with required knowledge, skills and motivation to deliver the ambitious ICDS mandate is one
of the most important constraints limiting its capacity to improve the nutrition of women and
children under three years. The lack of professional management of the ICDS HR function
has affected it ability to plan, recruit and develop its huge and increasing workforce to match
the program’s growing needs. The recently restructured ICDS proposes to reform the ICDS
HR system, a step that could make a critical difference to fulfilling its mandate. The findings
and suggestions discussed in this chapter are relevant to the proposed reform.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators

The combined effect of three key factors, namely the size of the workforce, its knowledge
and skills and level of motivation, enables or constrains an agency’s ability to function
effectively and achieve its mandate. The size of the workforce should be based on a
systematic and objective analysis of workloads at each level or unit; personnel at each level
should possess the right mix of knowledge and skills to enable them to carry out their tasks
                                         Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



effectively and efficiently; and they must be well motivated to achieve their goals. Each of
these factors is discussed in detail in the analytical framework described in Annex 1.
The following indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of HR (Table 4.1):

                                                   sick or coming late to work

The following sections discuss each of the three constraints at length in terms of the present
situation, their causes and consequences on nutrition services, and offer suggestions to
address the constraints.

Findings
Evidence from the primary and secondary sources discussed in the following sections,
leads to the conclusion that inadequate HR capacity is one key reason that constrains the
capacity of the ICDS to deliver nutrition services efficiently and effectively. The staff at
their current levels of efficiency is insufficient for accomplishing the volume of work in the
time allocated with the resources at their disposal. Most do not possess the knowledge and
skills needed to perform their roles fully and effectively. Moreover, their motivation levels
are low. The HR capacity in the NRHM to deliver nutrition services, while better than that
in the ICDS, is also constrained by sub-optimal knowledge, skills and motivation.

1.   Size of the workforce

The size of the ICDS workforce appears insufficient to accomplish the quantity and quality
of work required to fulfill the ambitious ICDS mandate This is because the volume of work
is very large for the sanctioned staff to accomplish with: (i) the resources available to
them; (ii) the time at their disposal; (iii) non-ICDS tasks adding to the volume of work; and
(iv) a large proportion of sanctioned positions remaining vacant for prolonged periods.

1.1    The time required by the AWW, supervisor and CDPO to accomplish their full
range of mandated activities exceeds the time available to them.

1.1.1 While several studies speak of the high workload of the AWW, most provide time
estimates for her daily tasks or only some of these. No systematic workload analysis is
available that provides comprehensive estimates of the full range of tasks assigned to the
AWW. Table 4.2 lists the AWW’s ICDS tasks and notes the time estimates from two reports
for the activities with available data. Table 4.2 clearly indicates that even though the time


                                                     43

   estimates do not cover the full range of the AWW’s daily tasks, and do not factor in the time
   for activities to be performed periodically, the time actually spent by the AWW exceeds the
   time of 4.5 hours of work sanctioned to the AWW in almost all states. Furthermore, it
   indicates that PSE supplementary feeding and record keeping take up a very significant
   portion of the AWW’s time.

  Study commissioned by the World Bank. The data was collected through structured questionnaire
administered to AWWs in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
Note: Under the restructured ICDS, the working hours are proposed to be extended to six hours with four
hours dedicated to PSE.

   1.1.2 For the supervisor or CDPO, we found no data for their volume of work or time-work
   estimates. In order to obtain some indicative data and arrive at preliminary estimates on the
   time spent by supervisors and CDPOs on various tasks, primary data was gathered from a
   small sample of supervisors14 and CDPOs.15 While the sample is small and has limitations,
   given the dearth of data on supervisor and CDPO workloads, these estimates serve as pointers
   to the likely mismatch between the time required to perform the various tasks assigned to
   supervisors and CDPOs and the time available to them, and underscore the need for a larger
   and more systematic time and work study to assess workloads of supervisors and CDPOs.
   Table 4.3 presents the data in this analysis.

   14
      This is based on a small sample of 33 supervisors in one district of Andhra Pradesh through structured questionnaires. This district
   offered the opportunity to estimate workloads in a situation where most supervisor staffing was relatively better, and additional AWC
   supervision load modest (approximately 50% of the supervisors had additional AWCs to manage and the average number of AWCs for the
   sample was 25); also none of the supervisors reported that they were assigned additional administrative or clerical tasks at the block level.

1.1.3 The volume of work of the ICDS at district offices, state directorates and at the
national level is too large to be managed by the number of positions sanctioned. While the
ICDS has expanded manifold in terms of its geographical coverage, the sanctioned
complement of officials and staff at the central, state and district level continues largely as
before. The district office is the most appropriate unit for comprehensive management of the
ICDS operations, including planning, implementation, coordination, monitoring, ensuring
quality and problem solving. However, the staffing pattern for the district project office
(Table 4.4) is minimal and does not appear to enable it to appropriately perform these

officials are assigned responsibilities for several functions. Responsibilities for all functions
and tasks are assigned to the staff in position regardless of their existing workload, skill sets
or training, and each member of the staff holds responsibility for several functions.

1.2     Many non-ICDS tasks, including several related to other WCD schemes, add to
the volume of work of ICDS staff. AWWs are called upon to assist in other government
programs such as socio-economic surveys, sanitation campaign, facilitation of self-help
groups, collection of village level data, various public health programs, census, elections is
well documented (Desai et al, 2012; Planning Commission, 2011; Thakare et al, 2011;
Pratichi India, 2009; Citizens’ Initiative for the Rights of Children Under Six, 2006; Dash,
2006; Gragnolati et al, 2005). Recent estimates from 20 states show that while there are
variations from state to state, on an average an AWW spends approximately six hours a day
for about 14 days in a year on non-ICDS work. Of particular concern is the data from Odisha,
Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh16 (Planning Commission, 2011). Supervisors and
CDPOs also get drawn into additional tasks such as elections, conduct of public
examinations, government events, and campaigns. Besides, they have also been assigned
responsibilities for other WCD schemes that include IGMSY, SABLA and ICPS which,
while complementing the ICDS, add to their regular workloads. Primary level data from
Andhra Pradesh indicated that supervisors spend on an average nine days per month for work
related to the IGMSY as it involves cash transfers and requires intensive work. The CDPOs
spent approximately five days per month on work related to domestic violence, child
marriage and child rights. During the FGDs conducted as part of this study, the AWWs,
supervisors and CDPOs confirmed that their involvement in non-ICDS duties added to their
workload, diverted them from ICDS tasks, and at times non-ICDS tasks assumed greater
importance than their core ICDS responsibilities. This is also substantiated by studies
(Midstream Marketing and Research Pvt Ltd, 2005). Although at the district and state levels,
additional staff is sanctioned for implementation of the IGMSY, at the project level the
scheme is implemented through the ICDS functionaries.

1.3     The restructured ICDS, recognizing the shortage of staff in the ICDS provides
for additional positions at the national, state, district and block levels. However, it also
adds several tasks to the AWW’s and Supervisor’s list of tasks, thereby adding further
to their volume of work. To improve the availability of personnel, the restructured ICDS has
increased the size of the workforce at the national, state and district levels, while also
allowing the states to fill positions temporarily on contract until regular appointments are
made, so as to avoid interruption in service delivery due to vacancies. However, there is little
additional support for on-the-ground implementation; and no change in the CDPO, supervisor
or AWW staffing norms even though several new tasks are added for the AWWs to
accomplish and for the supervisors and CDPOs to supervise. For example, a monthly ECCE
day, Sneha Shivirs and additional counselling are proposed to be conducted. Further, the
total working hours of the AWC are proposed to be extended by 1.5 hours daily (from the
current 4.5 hours to six hours per day), with PSE hours extended by two hours (from 2 to 4
hours). This creates an additional daily crunch of half an hour further skewing the AWW’s
work-time ratio. Under the restructured ICDS, a second AWW is sanctioned in 10 percent of
the project areas, primarily in the high malnutrition-burden areas, alongwith some additional
technical support for counseling in these blocks. However, the norm for the number of
supervisors and CDPOs in these areas too remains unchanged, even though the number of
AWWs for the supervisor to supervise is twice that of the existing numbers. Further, in the
16
  Odisha: 3 hours per day for 59 days per year; Maharashtra: 4 hours per day for 21 days per year; Bihar: 7 hours per day for 21 days per
year; and Uttar Pradesh: 7 hours per day for 16 days per year.



                                                                    46

remaining 90 percent of AWCs, the additional tasks will have to be done by the same
AWWs. As the large body of evidence suggests, the workloads of the AWW, supervisor and
CDPO cadres are unmanageable and the existing staffing norms unrealistic. However, no
objective workload analysis has been undertaken even to support the ICDS restructuring.

1.4     The norms for the ratio of subordinates to managers, particularly at the project
level are not rational.

1.4.1 The staffing norms for CDPOs do not take into account the number of AWCs under
their jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the number of AWCs under a project, only one CDPO
position is sanctioned. The system
applies the same staffing norm to all
projects regardless of size. Figure
4.1 illustrates the considerable
variation in the number of AWCs
under the projects, and the large
proportion of projects exceeding the
norm of approximately 100 AWCs,
several with AWCs almost twice the
norm. Thus the number of AWWs
and supervisors that they are
required to supervise is twice that of the CDPOs who have to manage approximately 100
AWCs.

1.4.2 Staffing norms for district offices are also uniform across districts irrespective of of
the district size and number of projects they have. District offices with a very small staff
sanction are expected to exercise supervision of and provide leadership to all projects in the
district. Again, the staffing norms are not based on the number of ICDS projects to be
supervised, but are the same across all districts, except that one additional statistical assistant
is provided in districts with more than 10 projects.

1.4.3 The pervasive, persistent and large numbers of vacancies exacerbate the shortage of
staff in the ICDS. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 show the consistently large number of vacancies of
supervisors, CDPOs, project staff (totaling 254) and in district offices (totaling 65). In 2012,
several states had large number of supervisor vacancies. For example, Bihar, West Bengal,
Assam and Uttar Pradesh had 86 percent, 54 percent, 44 percent and 35 percent supervisor
positions vacant (MWCD, GoI, 2012). Although vacancies at the AWW level are
proportionately lower, given the very large number of AWCs, this translates into 59,000

AWCs operating without an AWW as of March 2012.17 Owing to the large number of vacant
supervisor positions, supervisors are assigned responsibility of supervising AWCs additional
sector(s)/sub-sectors. Besides, they may also be assigned direct responsibility for AWCs
when AWW positions are vacant, and administrative and clerical duties at the project office,
including preparing bills, getting them cashed in the treasury, consolidating reports,
especially where statistical assistant, assistant and clerical positions remain vacant. Analysis
of the MWCD (2012) data showed that the effective average workload of a supervisor is 40
centers18 against the norm of 25 AWCs.

1.4.4 Owing to the large number of vacant CDPO positions, several CDPOs are assigned an
additional charge of blocks, and their workload increases exponentially depending on the
number of blocks for which they hold additional charge. Data from MWCD indicates that on
an average a CDPO is in charge of 220 AWCs19 against the norm of 100 AWCs.

1.4.5 The many vacancies at the district ICDS offices add to staff shortage. While there are
inter-state and intra-state disparities in the staffing of sanctioned positions at the district
level, data from a sample of 65 DPO offices (Figure 4.3) indicates the persistently large
shortage of staff at the district offices due to sanctioned positions lying vacant.

1.5    The mismatch between supervisors and CDPOs workloads and the time at their
disposal constrains their ability to exercise optimal supervision. For supervisors, high
workload and time constraints limit the time and attention they can give to the primary
responsibility of supervising the functioning of AWCs. Supervisors interviewed during the
FGDs for this study noted that the multitude of other tasks sometimes prevented their visiting
AWCs for 10-15 days at a stretch. Thus, the most important function of supervisory visits to
AWCs was compromised, entailing the number of visits, or the quality of visits, and often
both.

 The most recent evaluation of the ICDS notes that CDPO visits to AWCs are minimal,
averaging only one visit in six months, and focused largely on checking records and registers
(Planning Commission, 2011). Data from the CDPO structured questionnaires indicates that
the paucity of time and the pressure of meeting the norm of visiting 100 AWCs per quarter do
not allow monitoring and supervision of all activities required. Consequently, supervision is
limited to undertaking a few activities, thereby also compromising the quality of AWC visits.

1.6    Several factors have constrained the ability of the ICDS to ensure and manage
the availability of the right numbers of staff.

1.6.1 Staffing norms are not supported by workload analysis. The ICDS has thus far not
undertaken any assessment of the number of persons required at different levels to carry out
the functions and tasks required to fulfil its mandate. The data in the foregoing sections
clearly shows the unmanageable volume of work to be accomplished by the sanctioned
complement of staff. However, staffing norms established since the inception of the ICDS
continue to be followed without assessment of workloads. Regardless of the volume of work,
the ICDS was required in the 10th five -year plan to reduce program staff by at least 20
percent, as a result of which positions at the projects and district offices were reduced,
thereby increasing workloads of the CDPOs and supervisors (see Table 4.5). However, no

additional resources or mobility support was provided to enhance the efficiency of the staff in
managing the increased workloads, nor were the norms for AWC visits revised to
accommodate the additional workload. If a solid workload analysis had been available, it
might have helped the ICDS to better justify the staff positions.

1.6.1.1 Furthermore, the ICDS has continued to add new responsibilities for other schemes to
its existing staff such as their        Table 4.5: Staffing norms for ICDS block-level positions
involvement in SABLA and
IGMSY.               Moreover,     Block-level position norms           Block-level position norms

departments or are on long Peon
leave, are either highly
delayed or not made, thus adding to the workload of existing staff. For example, the
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (M&E) at the MWCD consists of five people to monitor the
data of over 1.3 million AWCs across India. In 2004-05 there were 0.7 million AWC and CD
bureau (under whose jurisdiction ICDS lies) had five assistant level staff in 2012. Today,
with over 1.3 million AWCs there are only two assistants.

1.6.2 Prevailing recruitment practices and processes are not efficient and have constrained
the timely appointment of staff to fill sanctioned positions, and in retention of appointed staff.
The MWCD provides recruitment criteria and guidelines to the states, and the states are
responsible for recruiting staff for projects and districts offices. Since the ICDS lacks policies
to appoint its own dedicated cadre for the CDPOs, with the exception of a few states who
directly recruit CDPOs for the ICDS, the CDPOs get drawn from other departments on
deputation, generally for a few years. Therefore, long-term retention of CDPOs is a problem.
Supervisors are usually recruited through state public service commissions and the
recruitment cycle can be quite long. Moreover, 25 percent of supervisor positions, reserved to
be filled through promotion from the ranks of the AWW, conditional on ten years of
satisfactory performance as an AWW, remain vacant for prolonged periods. Delays in
constituting selection committees, political interference and corruption could also lead to
positions staying vacant for long. In many instances, appointments are challenged by
candidates or other citizens on grounds of impropriety and an injunction obtained from the
court to stay the appointment and it can be years before the appointment can stand. The lack
of an integrated personnel information system and poor personnel/ human resource sections
within the department makes proper planning or monitoring impossible. Most ICDS
departments are serviced by a manually operated database of staff. As a result, ad hoc
measures are taken regarding deployment of staff which usually means ‘easy’ posts are filled
up and posts in more remote/difficult areas are not. (Biswas and Verma, 2009). Kickbacks for
transfers and postings to preferred locations were also mentioned during FGDs as a reason for
poor deployment.

1.7     In the NRHM, largely established population coverage norms are met and
staffing of frontline workers is generally satisfactory. The delivery of nutrition services
constitutes a very small part of the overall services delivered by the health system, and is thus


                                                   49
                                             Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



a relatively small component of the overall volume of work of the functionaries of the
system. Therefore, the study does not attempt to assess the overall workload of the health
functionaries to assess the adequacy of the sanctioned positions and, instead, limits the scope
to an examination of two key factors which could constrain the ANM’s ability to extend the
required nutrition services to mothers and children, and the access of pregnant women, sick
and undernourished children to healthcare facilities , namely: (i) the actual coverage of
populations by health facilities; and (ii) the staffing of field level positions against the norms.

1.7.1 The effective coverage of rural populations by health sub-centers and primary health
centers is generally close to the established norms. While ASHAs provide services on a
village basis, the effective population to be served by ANMs, and thus their volume of work,
is determined by the population covered by the health sub-center. Table 4.6 indicates that the
ANMs’ volume of work as assessed             Table 4.6: Coverage of rural population by health
by the average population served by                              Facilities
the sub-center appears to be                                      Norm         Average coverage
satisfactory, although it is possible                                             (March 2012)
that there exist state, district and Sub-Center              3000 – 5000       5615

the average coverage of the primary health center (PHC) which is the first referral facility at
which medical doctors are available, while somewhat higher than the norm, could be
considered generally adequate. Therefore, the absence of health care centers is not a
constraint in the access of sick and undernourished children to a doctor and this has to be
seen in the light of vacant positions.

1.7.2 Vacancies for ANMs are few, but those for their supervisor, the lady health
visitor are high. The availability of key staff associated with the delivery of nutrition
services at the village level, that is the ANMs and
ASHAs, is generally satisfactory (Figure 4.4).                  Fig 4.4: Staffing shortfall, NRHM

However, over a third of the LHV positions are                          HW(F)/ ANM                           LHV
vacant and thus the ones in position are stretched by                    % of sanctioned post vacant
having to deal with the additional load of covering                    Source: Rural Health Statistics in India, 2012

larger areas and supervising more ANMs than the
norm. As on March 2012, only four percent of PHCs were without a doctor but in the CHCs
the shortfall of specialists was acute in most states (Rural Health Statistics in India, 2012).

To conclude, although the staffing in the NRHM appears largely satisfactory, ICDS capacity
has been very constrained by its shortage of staff. Data suggest that the sanctioned
complement of staff is inadequate to deliver its mandate. Even though the restructured ICDS
has augmented the staffing at all levels, it remains important for ICDS to conduct workload
analysis of all positions to inform staffing norms. Given the persistent and large number of
vacancies and the delays in recruiting people, the ICDS must consider improving its

recruitment processes and making them more transparent. Needless to say, the absence of
necessary staff has adversely affected the implementation, administration, monitoring and
supervision of the scheme and has contributed to the many shortcomings in the ICDS.

2.     Knowledge and Skills

A triangulation of existing data, reports and the FGDs undertaken as part of this study
indicates that at all levels – amongst field functionaries, managers and leaders – a vast
majority of the ICDS and NRHM workforce does not possess the necessary knowledge and
skills to effectively and efficiently perform the functions expected of them, specifically
those pertaining to delivery of nutrition services.

2.1      AWW knowledge and skills are poor in several critical areas that impact
nutrition. According to the HUNGaMA Survey (2011) that covered 3,149 AWCs and 2,207
AWWs           across       three          Fig 4.5: AWW's perceptions: factors to keep children healthy

breastfeeding for six months and timely complementary feeding, seeking medical treatment
for a sick child, and food and environmental hygiene appears to be particularly poor amongst
a large proportion of workers’ (Figure 4.5). While the AWWs’ knowledge of nutrition is not
satisfactory even in the best districts of the best states, the knowledge gaps are highest in the
districts with the worst nutrition indicators. Further, there are differences between the
knowledge of workers in the focus districts and the best districts in those states, indicating
that workers in worse off districts even within the same state have a poorer knowledge of
nutrition. Several studies have documented the shortcomings in the AWWs’ knowledge in
areas critical to nutrition, such as growth monitoring and promotion, antenatal care, iron and
folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, importance of institutional delivery and
continued breastfeeding of children during illness.

2.2         Knowledge gaps also exist amongst CDPOs, supervisors and ICDS managers;
and the knowledge and skills most crucial for improving nutrition are the weakest. The
CDPOs and supervisors are responsible for technical and administrative guidance and support
                                                               to AWWs, therefore they need to

                                                               knowledge and skill of CDPOs for
interpreting growth charts is also documented in another study (Kapil et al, 1991). Growth
monitoring and promotion (GMP), while one of the most crucial interventions, is also one of
the weakest. The AWWs lack competence in plotting and interpreting growth charts and
using them to counsel mothers (Citizens’ Initiative for the Rights of Children Under Six,
2006; Chattopadhyay, 2004; NIPCCD, 2004; Nibha Rani Burman, 2001; Vasundhara and
Harish, 1993; Gopalan, 1992). Another area where AWW competencies are poor is ‘record
keeping’ It is perhaps for this reason that
                                                                      Fig 4.7: Growth Monitoring Skills of

counseling,                   community         mobilization,
identification and management of moderately and severely undernourished children require
strengthening, particularly for AWWs and supervisors. The supervisors expressed a need to
strengthen their skills in planning and problem solving, preparation of audio-visual material
and updating their knowledge on nutrition interventions during the first thousand days of life
and for adolescent girls. There are gaps in the literature regarding the knowledge and skills
of functionaries and officials, and knowledge and skills related to on complementary

feeding, even though the topic of complementary feeding remains critical in India given the
poor status of quality and quantity of complementary foods given to young children.

2.3      Critical knowledge and skills regarding nutrition require attention in the health
system: The literature on nutrition, maternal and child health related knowledge and skills of
health personnel, particularly MOs, ANMs, and ASHAs, are sparse. Only a few small-scale,
state-specific studies throw light on the issue. Thus, not surprisingly, depending on the
location and sample size, the findings from these are mixed. Some studies found ANMs and
ASHAs to have good knowledge about breastfeeding techniques, exclusive breastfeeding,
initiation of breastfeeding and its advantages, and confidence in managing breastfeeding
related problems. (Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, 2009, Shrivastava and
Shrivastava, 2012). Others indicate gaps and the need to strengthen the knowledge and skills
for all categories of personnel in clinical, technical and managerial aspects, particularly in
conducting referrals and behavior change communication (Tamil Nadu Health Systems
Project, 2004). With particular reference to ASHAs, despite training, the lacunae in their
knowledge regarding various aspects of child health morbidity were noted, for instance over
67 percent lacked knowledge of vitamin A deficiency and its prevention, and over 20 percent
were unable to identify the need to refer sick children, particularly those with diarrhoea and
unable to drink or breastfeed, and with acute respiratory tract infections (Shrivastava and
Shrivastava, 2012). The FGDs conducted as part of this study in Tamil Nadu and Bihar
pointed to the need to build the knowledge and skill of leaders in the ICDS and health
systems. A senior official from the health department in Tamil Nadu remarked, “All staff
needs training in nutrition, including the Commissioner.”

Health workers’ knowledge is crucial to the efficacy of the health system. A study in Uttar
Pradesh found a positive correlation between health workers’ knowledge and household
practices of newborn care, including breastfeeding in the first hour of life. Mothers visited by
ANMs with higher knowledge were more likely to show better care behavior such as ante-
natal checks, early initiation of breastfeeding and the newborn receiving a check by a skilled
provider in the first week of life, than those visited by ANMs with poor knowledge (Agarwal
et al, 2012). Similarly, ASHAs educated up to intermediate level and above performed more
of the assigned responsibilities than those with high school education or lower levels. The
ASHAs with schooling below grade eight also had difficulty in maintaining the records
(Kansal et al, 2012).

During FGDs conducted as part of this study, the ANMs reported that they do not have
required skills to treat malnourished children, and are particularly unable to find the root
cause of undernutrition when counselling mothers. The ASHAs reported difficulties in
managing pregnancy related complications. Medical officers felt that health workers, in
particular ANMs and ASHAs, lacked effective communication and counselling skills, and
required periodic training in these areas. Large numbers of health functionaries also lack the
knowledge about the role of zinc supplementation in management of diarrhoea, were unaware
of protocols for zinc as an adjunct to diarrhoea management, IFA supplementation for
children and their skills in managing diarrhoea needed significant strengthening (8th JRM,
2011).

2.4      The gaps in knowledge and skills of functionaries contributes to constraining the
nutrition impact of ICDS. New analysis of the HUNGaMA survey data throws valuable
light in this regard.

2.4.1 The AWWs’ knowledge of nutrition bears a positive association with the mothers’
practice of appropriate child care behavior, and with use of AWCs; therefore their poor
knowledge is a significant constraint to important nutrition services. Analysis of the
HUNGaMA Survey data indicates that the AWWs’ knowledge is related in two ways to
pathways that have the potential to improving child nutrition:

(a)      there is a positive association between AWW's knowledge and mothers’ knowledge,
as well with the practice of appropriate child care behaviors by mothers (controlled for

there is an increase in
mother's       practice     of
appropriate child care
behaviors with an increase
in AWW's knowledge of
health,     nutrition     and
hygiene practices (see
Figure 4.8). For this
analysis, the AWW’s
knowledge of health and
nutrition practices was
measured         using       a
composite               AWW
knowledge Index20 and appropriate child care behavior was measured as a composite Child
Care Practice Index.21 There is also a positive association between the use of counselling
services by mothers and their knowledge; and

(b) A similar regression analysis controlling for the AWWs’ age, AWWs’ experience,
supervision visits, village index and type of district, indicates a positive association between
AWW's knowledge and AWC use,
                                        Figure 4.9: Association between AWW knowledge
that is, an increase in AWC use is

seen where AWWs have better
knowledge (Figure 4.9). These
findings have great significance –
they indicate that improving the
AWWs’          knowledge       could
potentially play an important role
in improving child care practices of
mothers, as well as improve the
uptake of anganwadi services. The
Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition
Program       (TINP)      has    also
demonstrated those community-based workers’ skills in weighing children; plotting curves
and growth monitoring can contribute to the success of large-scale nutrition programs.

   The variables used in the AWW knowledge index include: (i)breastfeeding soon after birth; (ii) exclusive breastfeeding up to six months;
(iii) beginning supplementary food at six months; (iv) supplementary vitamins; (v) adequate food; (xi) balanced diet; (xii) timely and full
immunization; (xiii) going to doctor if child falls ill; and (ix) washing hands with soap.
21
   The variables used in the Child Care Practice Index include: (i) child’s first food; (ii) breastfeeding within an hour; (iii) colostrum feeding;
(iv) exclusive breastfeeding for six months; (v) complementary food introduced at 6-8 months; (ix) child breastfed for at least 12 months;
(vii) child taken to doctor when sick; (viii) adequate dietary diversity; and (ix) adequate use of soap.

2.4.2 Inadequate knowledge, skills including supervision and management skills constrain
focus on the most critical nutrition activities. Inadequate understanding of the most effective
ICDS interventions to improve nutrition has contributed to the lack of focus on activities such
as micronutrient supplementation, growth monitoring and promotion, nutrition and health
counselling through home visits and group counselling sessions with mothers. Furthermore,
the supervisors’ and CDPOs’ lack of knowledge and skills limits their ability to provide the
necessary technical guidance and support to the AWWs. The positive association between
supervisor visits and AWWs’ knowledge suggests that knowledgeable and skilled supervisors
could play a critical role in enhancing AWWs’ knowledge and building their skills (see
chapter 7, General Management Practices).

Critical to the effective delivery of interventions for preventing undernutrition, identification
of undernourished children and their appropriate management, are skills in communication
and counselling, the full set of growth monitoring and promotion skills including
identification of growth faltering, its management and referrals as necessary. However, the
foregoing paragraphs illustrate that these skills are among the weakest in ICDS across the
cadres of AWWs, supervisors and CDPOs.

2.5     Two underlying factors – inadequacy in the recruitment criteria and practices,
and insufficiency in training – have contributed to the poor status of knowledge and
skills.

2.5.1 The ICDS recruitment policies and criteria are not suited to recruiting people with
the right kind of skill mix, thereby placing the full onus of skills development upon on-the-job
training. Besides, the efficiency of recruitment practices and process could be improved.

2.5.1.1 Recruitment criteria are generic, and largely specify only the educational
qualifications required. There is a very insufficient defined selection criterion, beyond
minimum educational qualifications, for the recruitment of AWWs, AWHs, supervisors and
CDPOs. An inference from this is that the focus of the ICDS recruitment policy is to appoint
trainable people whose skills and competencies ICDS could build through training (see Box
4.1) An implicit assumption here is that the requisite school and further educational
qualifications equip the candidates for a basic understanding of concepts that are essential to
each job level, and that they can therefore be trained to develop job-specific knowledge and
skills. However, there are strong indications that this assumption may not be valid. For
example, while approximately 79 percent of the AWWs meet the minimum educational level
of matriculation, and 83 percent have completed grade eight, the educational level required
for AWWs prior to 2007 (HUNGaMA Survey, 2011), yet, despite training AWWs continue
to have difficulty in plotting growth charts and in maintaining records. It is plausible that
despite meeting the prescribed educational qualifications, they do not have the necessary
competence in plotting graphs and interpreting them or in accounting. The assumption behind
recruiting matriculates is perhaps that they would come with a basic understanding of plotting
and interpreting graphs and charts and can maintain the required records. The recruitment
criteria should therefore include a set of basic skills for each category based on the job
description for which candidates must be tested prior to recruitment. In addition, some further
basic skills such as computer literacy could be considered as prerequisites, at least for all
block, district and state-level positions. Nevertheless, many years after the IT revolution, the
ICDS continues to bear the burden of training even current recruits in basic computer literacy
which in most organizations is a qualification that candidates must possess to become eligible
for applying.

                          Box 4.1: Recruitment criteria for ICDS functionaries
     AWW: A female volunteer in the age group of 18-42 years residing in the said village or AWC area. The minimum educational
     qualification required is matriculation which is relaxed to Class VIII for tribal and SC candidates (DWCD, Odisha, 2007).

     Supervisor: A female in the age-group of 21-45 years, preferably a graduate in social work, home science or related field.
     Should have an aptitude to work in rural or tribal areas (NIPCCD, 2006)

     CDPO: A female with a master’s degree in Child Development, Social Work, Home Science, Nutrition, any other allied field.
     She is also required to have abilities to get along with other members of project team, voluntary workers and leaders and other
     non-officials. A CDPO has not to be necessarily ‘desk bound’ but should be able to reach people as she has to supervise
     clientele, workers and community leaders over 100 villages or slum sub-units. (NIPCCD, 2006)


     :
2.5.1.2 Appointment by promotion often results in hiring candidates who are not suitable
(FGDs). For example, AWWs who are promoted as supervisors when nearing retirement may
not be able or willing to travel. Another example is the appointment or promotion to CDPO
rank from various bureaucratic streams, such as clerical or other staff from diverse
departments (mostly male) with little exposure to child development and without the
necessary technical skills.

2.5.1.3 Recruitment criteria are often violated and the recruitment politicized. The criteria in
place for recruitment of ICDS workers, even though generic, are often violated in practice.
The ‘local residence’ criterion concerning AWWs, for example, was violated in 20 percent of
AWWs nationally and by 53 percent in West Bengal and 44 percent in Tamil Nadu (Planning
Commission, 2011). Submission of fake certificates is reportedly not uncommon in Bihar
(FGDs). Politics and graft in the recruitment of AWWs is also common. During the FGDs it
was widely reported that substantial bribes, up to Rs. 200,000 are paid for these
appointments.

2.5.2 The quantity and quality of training imparted to ICDS functionaries has not produced
the desired outcomes in terms of building the required knowledge, skills and competencies.
The ICDS has failed to develop the knowledge and skills of its workforce up to the necessary
level. Thus, workers lack critical knowledge and skills to satisfactorily deliver nutrition
services, and managers lack management skills to manage the large and complex operations.
Section 2 highlights the lack of required knowledge and skills amongst functionaries and
managers. Since, the ICDS does not recruit pre-qualified people for most jobs, it depends on
its training system to develop the knowledge and skills of its workforce. In such a scenario
the training and the training system assumes great importance. Thus it is discussed in detail as
a subset of the HR system, in chapter 5.

To sum up, a large percentage of the ICDS workforce do not possess the required knowledge
and skills to effectively perform their functions. The positive association between workers’
knowledge and positive child care practices of mothers indicates that with better knowledge
and skills of workers, the potential impact of the ICDS to improve nutrition could be
significantly enhanced. Therefore, the ICDS must invest in building a workforce that has the
necessary knowledge and skills to perform their roles.

3.       Motivation

The motivation levels of functionaries in the ICDS as well as in the broader health system
are generally not high.



                                                                  56
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



3.1      The level of motivation of ICDS functionaries is generally not high. While there is
widespread acknowledgement of the poor motivational levels amongst ICDS and health
functionaries, some of which is documented, no data speaks to any specific indicator of
motivation, including the two outlined in the analytical framework. The discussion, therefore,
draws heavily on information obtained through FGDs and interviews conducted during this
study. Information drawn from the FGDs in Bihar and Tamil Nadu and the review of
literature indicates that the motivational level of AWWs to carry out their tasks is not very
high. However, in Tamil Nadu, the motivational levels of AWWs were rated quite high for
over 60 percent of the cadre. The motivational levels of supervisors in Bihar were mixed,
being rated ‘not very high’ by some CDPOs and ‘good’ by others. The motivational levels of
CDPOs are also not high. On the other hand, in Tamil Nadu, the motivational levels of
CDPOs were reported to be ‘high’, ascribed mainly to the fact that a large number of CDPOs
were earlier Community Nutrition Instructresses (CNI) from TINP.

3.2    Poor work conditions, lack of adequate resources required to accomplish their
tasks, and organizational culture contribute to the low motivational levels. These were
found to be the key reasons for the poor motivation levels of the ICDS functionaries.

3.2.1 For AWWs, the reasons for low motivational levels are poor remuneration, delayed
payment of salaries, work overload, assignment of non-ICDS work, low community status
and the voluntary nature of the job (Sampath, 2008; FORCES, 2006; Gragnolati et al, 2005;
CBGA and UNICEF, 2011 and FGDs). The FGDs in Bihar revealed that ‘fear of suspension’
was the largest demotivating factor for the AWWs, followed by insecurity regarding
retirement. The context in Bihar for the fear of suspension at that time was the state
government’s drive to make unannounced visits and suspend AWWs for any deviation in the
functioning of the AWC, particularly if the center was found closed or had discrepancies in
the accounting of supplemental food. In Tamil Nadu, despite the promotional avenue to the
rank of supervisor offered to them, most AWWs had no desire to opt for it, because of issues
associated with pension rules that would lead to a lower pension if they retired as supervisors.

3.2.2 The FGDs and a review of literature indicated that lack of promotional opportunities
and lack of travel support for the required travel to distant places are also major contributors
to the low motivational levels of supervisors in Bihar. The supervisors in Tamil Nadu felt that
appreciation of their work and joint visits with CDPOs to AWCs were important in raising
their motivational levels.

3.2.3 Some of the major reasons cited for the low motivational levels of CDPOs were poor
work conditions including low quality office infrastructure, lack of transport, lack of
promotional avenues, fear of transfers to more ‘difficult areas’ with even fewer resources,
and having to perform clerical work in addition to their technical and managerial duties (Rani
and Devi, 2004). While the Bihar FGDs support these findings, the CDPOs in Tamil Nadu
had high motivational levels and TINP evaluations show that TINP was able to create a cadre
of highly motivated individuals. In this context, it is possible that the former CNIs brought
the motivational attribute to their current positions.

3.2.4 While the MWCD has made efforts to address some of the factors contributing to the
low motivation levels in the ICDS, a larger and more comprehensive effort is required.
Efforts made by the MWCD include enhancing honoraria for AWWs, although this is still on
the lower side of market wages. In states, such as Tamil Nadu, the state contributes to the
AWWs’ honoraria and has in lieu introduced extended work. Several benefits such as paid


                                                 57
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



maternity leave, insurance, and scholarships for children have been introduced together with
awards at the national and state levels to recognize exemplary workers. Though helpful, these
efforts are few and far between. A larger, holistic effort is required.

3.3     The level of motivation of NHRM functionaries from the district level
downwards is varied, with some categories of workers less motivated than others. Most
information on the motivation levels of NRHM functionaries comes from the FGDs and
presents a mixed picture. These indicate that medical officers and ASHAs, particularly in
Bihar, have low motivational levels. For ASHAs, the temporary form of their appointment,
poor incentive structure with payments often delayed, and the lack of regular remuneration
were reportedly the main demotivating factors; while for ANMs low salary structure and lack
of promotion avenues were the key factors. For medical officers, the low motivational levels
resulted from low remuneration, high patient load and the high work load due to large
number of vacancies, administrative work including difficulty in dealing with routine
administrative procedures such as having leave sanctioned, resource constraints, and lack of
promotional avenues.

The appointment of contractual employees under the NRHM has contributed considerably to
better availability of human resources. However, this has also led to a general sense of
demotivation, primarily among contractual employees due to the differential remuneration
and terms of appointment between regular and contractual staff although both categories
perform the same functions (NRHM, 2011 and 2012).

For the ASHAs, one study notes that the three main motivating factors for becoming an
ASHA are financial incentives, the prestige attached to the position and improvement in
health facilities of the area (Bajpai and Dholakia, 2011). However, these factors did not
emerge in the FGDs conducted for this study.

To sum up, motivational levels across the ICDS are largely not very high and are a constraint
to optimal performance. The key factors contributing to the low motivation levels include the
authoritarian top-down culture, lack of recognition, especially by managers who do not
possess the skills to provide positive feedback, and apathy at all levels to resolve problems. It
is clear from the dissatisfaction expressed regarding these factors that addressing them would
result in a significant improvement in morale and motivation of the workforce, and hence in
their performance. Given that motivation levels were generally higher among all ICDS staff
in Tamil Nadu, for AWWs, supervisors and CDPOs, an in-depth understanding of the
motivational factors operating in Tamil Nadu possibly such as higher pay, better and
continuous training, better supervision and support, could provide learning for the ICDS.

The high workload of the staff, the consistently large proportion of vacancies, the lack of
people with required skills mix at all levels, and the low levels of motivation of the workforce
indicates that the MWCD and the relevant departments in the states managing the ICDS HR
function have been unable to ensure availability of a workforce of the right size and skills to
deliver its ambitious mandate. Like several public sector programs, it has not been able to
provide the right incentives and work environment to develop a motivated workforce.

The HR policy reform proposed under the restructured ICDS could be a potential opportunity
to address motivation issues as part of broader reform. The proposed development of a
comprehensive human resource policy, including creation of a dedicated HR cadre for the
ICDS, providing for career progression, and benefits such as pension schemes are key factors


                                                 58
                                         Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



 that could improve motivation levels. Strengthening the HR policy and management to
 address some of the constraints discussed in this chapter, such as issues related to work
 overload at the operational level, that is, for CDPOs, supervisors and AWWs and a full
 functional analysis under the restructured ICDS will be important, and will benefit
 strengthening ICDS service delivery and contribute to achievement of results.

 Recommendations
 1.      Reform of the ICDS HR system is proposed in the restructured ICDS. It is
 recommended that the ICDS take bold steps in this direction and use the opportunity to make
 a paradigm shift from the current personnel management thinking into the more modern HR
 development thinking. This essentially means moving from a view of personnel management
 as a marginal element in corporate or organizational planning towards the view that HR
 management is a central part of it. As part of this shift, it will be critical to move the HR
 focus from: (i) legal and contractual relations with personnel towards a focus on human
 interaction and relations; (ii) monitoring and containing the ‘poor’ behavior of staff towards
 nurturing, developing and facilitating ‘good’ behavior; (iii) passively following given
 directions and instructions by personnel to their actively taking initiative; (iv) formal
 organizational procedures towards organizational value and culture; and (v) individual
 performance towards team performance.

 2.      Given its more than 2.7 million workforce, one of the most immediate actions that the
 ICDS must take is to develop a computerized database of employees. This is critical to detect
 vacancies and their location, know the training status of staff and managers, and thereby
 assess realistic training needs and targets, enable transparency in transfers and promotions.

 3.      Examination of the existing ICDS staffing norms, including those proposed under the
 restructured ICDS is essential. The norms for all key jobs in the ICDS, not just the jobs of
 AWWs, supervisors and CDPOs must be assessed to determine the number of positions in
 each job. Three key analyses outlined below should be undertaken to establish staffing
 norms:

 (i) Productivity analysis for each key procedure undertaken by functionaries for example,
    supervision of an AWC, growth monitoring, and home visits, to see if it can be improved,
    made more efficient, and if necessary redesign the process (detailed discussion on ‘work
    practices and procedures’ is included in Chapter 7, General Management Practices) ;

(ii) Job analysis of each job, based on a clear conceptual framework of the role of each, and
    that takes into consideration the redesigned processes, involved in that particular job .
    Besides, all non-ICDS tasks must be detached from all jobs. Based on this analysis, the
    content of each job must be redesigned, if necessary. The job content so analysed and/or
    redesigned will also serve to form the basis for revising job descriptions and recruitment
    criteria discussed under recommendation 4;

(iii)      Workload analysis must be carried out to determine: (a) the number of beneficiaries that
        are to be served and the number of units of service that must be delivered in every service
        area, assuming full coverage; and (b) the number of units of standard level service that can
        be delivered by a job holder within a given period of time in each job.




                                                     59
                                       Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



4.     The ICDS should consider bold revisions to its recruitment policies, criteria and
processes. Key measures include:

  (i)      Redesign guidelines and instructions for recruitment in line with the job analysis and
      revised job content for each position as recommended above. Professionally and
      technically sound job descriptions must be written, specifying all the key skills and
      competencies of a ‘fully qualified worker’. The recruitment criteria, that is, the
      fundamental skills and competencies that all new recruits for each job must possess,
      should be distilled from the fully qualified worker profile, and should include
      requirements such as communication skills and basic computer literacy, at least for the
      positions of supervisor and above.
 (ii)      A minimum level of knowledge and skills ought to be specified as prerequisites for
      each position. Recognizing the difficulty in finding candidates possessing prior knowledge
      related to child development and nutrition, the ICDS could consider developing and
      making publicly available study material for prospective candidates to prepare to compete
      for positions based on merit. This will result in recruitment of better qualified and
      trainable staff, requiring shorter and less steep learning curves, and make ICDS training
      more effective and less resource intensive. Further, at least for positions of supervisors and
      upwards, basic computer skills should be a prerequisite.
(iii)      Recruitment should be streamlined, including promotional avenues, made more
      transparent and efficient. Setting timelines for each step, holding those responsible
      accountable for delays, public website display of the results of each step and the time
      taken are some possible steps that can be taken.

5.      Action to improve motivation must be taken. In this context, it is necessary to change
the authoritarian top-down culture and implement good HR management practices. This will
require consistent effort from leaders, including leading by example, sensitization of
managers and providing them with incentives to motivate the staff managed by them. A
module on motivation must be incorporated in the leadership and management development
program for leaders and managers. Managers may be held accountable for the results and
performance management may be included in the contracts of the employees at least for the
contractual staff. The ICDS should also experiment with performance based incentives to
motivate employees to perform well. Ensuring that working condition standards are met,
especially in remote and resource poor areas will be important.

6.    Given the huge skills gap, it is critical to build the skills of ICDS personnel.
Recommendations pertaining to training to improve knowledge and skills of the ICDS
workforce are outlined in chapter 5, The Training Sub-System.

                               The Training Sub-System
Introduction

Training plays a key role in equipping the workforce of an organization with the knowledge,
skills and competencies required to carry out their jobs. The chapter on Human Resources
and their Management demonstrated that the knowledge, skills and competencies of the ICDS
workforce, in general fall short of what is required for them to fulfill their roles effectively
and deliver the mandate of the ICDS. Further, the ICDS recruitment criteria and policies are
not specific and do not specify entry level knowledge and skills, other than a minimum level
of schooling. In such a situation, training is central to building the necessary knowledge and
skills of recruited personnel, including leaders and managers, to effectively perform their
jobs.

This chapter assesses the capacity of the ICDS training system, with particular attention to
two key questions:

1. Has the ICDS training system been able to provide its workforce (field functionaries,
   managers and leaders) with timely and adequate training in terms of quantity,
   relevance and quality to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies required for
   them to perform their functions fully and effectively?

2. If not, what are the constraints in the training system and what can be done to address
   them?

This chapter includes an assessment of the training capacity of the ICDS only and does not
analyse the capacity of the training system of the NRHM. The scope of the health systems
training is vast, with the delivery of nutrition services forming only a fraction of the maternal
and child health package, as also the fact that the health system recruits skilled personnel
(nurses, doctors and paramedics), therefore its analysis has not been included in the scope of
the study.

The conceptual framework and indicators for the training capacity assessment are described
briefly below, followed by the key findings and capacity gaps, the reasons for the constraints,
and suggestions to address the gaps.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators

Availability of timely, relevant and adequate training in terms of quality and quantity is
essential for human resource development, performance and motivation of staff. Training
outcomes or the gains in learning, skills, and competencies are the best direct measures of
training quality. However, no data on these measures is available. Therefore, to assess the
quality of ICDS training, this study uses indirect measures, such as the factors that contribute
to the quality of training. Table 5.1 outlines the key indicators to assess training capacity.

                                   (Note: Given the absence of information on the extent to which the content
                                   taught is learned and skills acquired, which are the direct measures of
                                   training quality, the factors tabulated above and influence training outcomes
                                   are used.)



Findings
A review of the data indicates that the capacity of the training system to provide timely and
adequate training that is relevant and of high quality to the ICDS workforce has been
severely constrained. The lack of a conceptual framework and vision, inadequate strategic
planning and resource mobilization, and sub-optimal management are the key factors that
have hindered the ICDS system in building the knowledge, skills, and competencies of its
workforce, which in turn limits the ability of the program to achieve results.

1. Availability of timely and adequate quantity of training
The training system has not been able to deliver the required training to the ICDS
workforce in a timely manner. The large backlog in training, for both initial and refresher
training, and the persistent shortfall in meeting training targets indicate that a large
proportion of the ICDS workforce does not receive initial training in time, and a
substantial number of them do not receive the training or refresher training in accordance
with established norms.

1.1      Training of functionaries has persistently fallen short of annual targets. No
standard methodology is prescribed for setting training targets. Most states and union
territories set their training targets based on considerations of the number of untrained
personnel at the time, the planned number of personnel to be recruited during the year, and
often also the number of operational training facilities in their states. The NIPCCD, which is
responsible for CDPO training, sets its own targets, often without consulting the states
regarding their CDPO and ACDPO training needs. The ICDS does not maintain a training
registry or trainee database and hence the exact numbers of untrained personnel at any time is
difficult to ascertain, either to set training targets by the state or to review the training plans
of the ICDS (CAG, 2012). The lack of this information and a prescribed methodology for
setting annual training targets makes target setting appear arbitrary (MWCD, GoI, 2012).
Nonetheless, since the states factor in the number of operational training institutions while
setting targets, the targets are likely to underestimate the actual numbers requiring training,
and the estimates of untrained functionaries based on the achievement of targets are likely to
be conservative. For the initial job training courses, an argument could be made that the


                                                       62

shortfalls are due to delays in the planned recruitment. While this argument might hold to
some extent for job training courses, there certainly is a large gap between the 2011-12
annual targets for refresher training of CDPOs, supervisors and AWWs, and the actual

                                       them returning to their home departments from where
                                       they were deputed, and others coming in. Given the
                                       absence of personnel databases in the ICDS, this
                                       information is not available within the system, so it is
                                       not possible to assess the actual numbers of CDPOs
                                       requiring training every year. Nevertheless, using the
                                       data for new ICDS projects as an indicator of the
                                       CDPOs requiring training, the backlog in CDPO job
                                       training might be small.


1.2     The refresher training backlog is very large and indicates too little training
compared to the norm. There is also a need to re-examine the norms. According to ICDS
refresher training norm of one refresher training for each functionary in two years,
approximately half of the ICDS workforce is eligible for refresher training every year. A
snapshot of the estimates of the workforce to be trained in 2012 against the targets show that
the targets were a small fraction of the requirement, with the achievement forming a very
small portion of the workforce (Figure 5.4). A recent report has pointed out that at the current
pace of refresher training, the CDPOs, supervisors, AWWs and anganwadi helper (AWHs )
would receive referesher training once in 14, six, eight and nine years, respectively compared
with the requriement of training which is once in two years (CAG report, 2012). Given the
extensive lack of knowledge and skills even amongst those who have been trained, it is


                                                                            63
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



necessary to examine
the adequacy of the
refresher     training
norms of six days of
refresher     training
every two years for
AWWs, five days for
the AWHs, and seven
days every two years for supervisors and CDPOs.

1.3     Leaders and managers in the ICDS, other than the CDPOs, receive almost no
training to equip them with management skills for managing the large and complex
program. There is no formal training program or training norms for leaders and managers in
the ICDS beyond the rank of CDPO. The NIPCCD does conduct some orientation training
for DPOs, but the efforts are not mainstreamed or institutionalized, neither is there any
defined curricula or content, and the focus is primarily on providing an orientation to the
ICDS program, its functioning, and new upcoming schemes and programs of the Ministry.
Good managment training is seriously lacking for managers throughout the ICDS and the
management of every function in the ICDS is constrained due to the lack of managerial skills
of the managers. The status of GMPs in the ICDS point to the dire need for such training to
be provided to all ICDS managers and good leadership training to the senior leaders (see
chapter 7, General Management Practices). Given the absence of leadership and management
training, the leaders and managers in the ICDS do not possess the skills to develop conceptual
frameworks, articulate and communicate the program and their units’ vision to the staff they
lead and manage, set objectives for them, empower them, mentor, coach and supervise them,
and manage their performance.

1.4     With the ICDS restructuring and the large number of new staff to be added at
all levels, the demands on the training system will increase manifold. Over 5,00,000 new
functionaries are proposed to be appointed under the restructured ICDS. Although an
augmentation of the training infrastructure and system is proposed as well and discussions on
the reform of the training system are on, the development of training programs for new cadres
and training such large numbers will be very challenging for a system that presently cannot
cope with the training requirements of even the current numbers of CDPOs, supervisors,
AWWs and AWHs, and lacks norms and provision for management training for middle level
and senior level officials (MWCD, 2013).

1.5     Several factors constrained the capacity of the ICDS training system to deliver
adequate quantity of training. While the ICDS program expanded rapidly, the constraints
of the training system, inadequate resource allocation, shortage of training institutions and
inefficient fund flows prevented it from providing the requisite training to the ICDS
functionaries.

1.5.1 Financial resources were constrained. While the training requirements increase
manifold due to the ICDS expansion, financial allocations remained constant. Over the past
decade, although the number of ICDS projects increased every year, the training budgets
remained constant and, in fact, declined after the World Bank-supported training program
UDISHA ended in 2004 (Figure 5.5). The steep increase in 2009-10 is on account of the
revision of financial norms rather than an increase in training facilities or numbers trained.
Between 2004-05, that is after the end of UDISHA , financial allocations for training

calculated per block
almost halved, from
Rs. 0.123 million per
project in 2004-05 to
Rs. 0.52 million in
2008-09.

1.5.2 With training
loads        increasing
exponentially due to
the ICDS expansion,
the      number       of
functional AWTCs and
MLTCs         decreased
instead of increasing.
Although the number
of functionaries to be trained increased rapidly, after the end of UDISHA in 2006, instead of
an increase in the number of institutions to train frontline workers and supervisors, the
number of training institutions decreased (Figure 5.6). The training infrastructure was poor in
                                                                some states.        For example,
                                                                during 2006-11, there were no
                                                                MLTCs in Jharkhand, and
                                                                therefore no training was
                                                                provided to supervisors, which
                                                                meant that over 52 percent of the
                                                                694 supervisors in the state at
                                                                the time had not received the
                                                                initial job training (CAG, 2012).
                                                                This situation was due to closure
                                                                of some inefficient institutions,
                                                                and the lack of interest on the
part of NGOs to start additional institutions.

1.5.2.1 The reasons for the lack of expansion of training infrastructure include the sanction
of an inadequate number of institutions and the inability of the system to operationalize the
full strength of sanctioned
institutions (Table 5.2). The           Table 5.2: Status of ICDS training infrastructure

responsible for opening new training centers based on requirements, after the approval of the
MWCD, GoI which is provided after a satisfactory verification of facilities proposed by the
NIPCCD. Table 5.2 shows that out of the 161 AWTCs sanctioned between 2007 and 2009,
merely eight became functional, over a period of 30 months, and the rest remained non-
functional. In the case of the MLTCs, two were operationalized and 12 remained non-
operational. Besides, despite the sanction of an additional 21 MLTCs in September 2009,


                                                 65
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



none could be operationalized over the next 18 months and, in fact, 12 AWTCs and 3 MLTCs
were closed. This operational distortion has arisen due to: (i) poor coordination between
different levels; (ii) poor management; (iii) inefficiency and lack of accountability in the
system of establishing and closing training institutions; (iv) lack of interest in NGOs to
accept short-term annual training contracts offered by the ICDS to run AWTCs and MLTCs,
given the investment required to set up the institution; and (v) opening and closing of
AWTCs and MLTCs at the whims and fancies of officials in the states (Gopal, 2009).

1.5.3 Erratic flow of funds and poor coordination deter the full utilization of existing
training institutions. Even though the State Training Action Plan (STRAP) cycle is not
coordinated with the financial cycle, the training calendars are prepared according to the
financial year. Thus, approximately two quarters are lost before STRAPs are approved and
training begins, even though the states might request the use of unutilized resources from the
previous year. Since the release of funds to training institutions is delayed in several states,
many institutions are unable to run training programs for the expected 300 days in a year.
Several states prepare training calendars without any consultation with training centers, and
there is a lack of coordination between the state ICDS directorate, training centers and
districts and blocks to ensure timely deputation of the required number of trainees. Very
often, trainees who have already received initial training are deputed again for the same
training (Gopal, 2009).

1.5.4 The ICDS training resources were also partially redirected to cover training for
several new schemes of the ministry. In the year 2010, the MWCD, GoI launched several new
schemes which were to be implemented using the ICDS infrastructure. These included
SABLA, a scheme for adolescent girls in 2010, Indira Gandhi Matratva Samriddhi Yojana
(IGMSY), a CCT for pregnant nursing women in 2010, and the Integrated Child Protection
Scheme (ICPS) in 2010. Instead of creating additional training institutions and capacity or
augmenting the capacity of existing institutions, the already stretched ICDS training
resources were diverted for providing the training related to these schemes. Furthermore, the
effectiveness or impact of vertical training, a new category introduced recently, has not been
assessed. While innovations in training are desirable, their continuation and expansion
without objective information on their effectiveness or impact, diverts scarce capacity from
timely delivery of even the bare essential courses to the workforce.

2    Relevance of training
The relevance of ICDS training – both in terms of the extent to which curricula and
content match job needs and the extent to which they match the skills gap – is not known,
although there are indications of likely problems.

2.1     Training curricula and content have not been systematically assessed for their
relevance to job needs or trainees’ needs. The lack of systematic assessment of curricula
and content continues to be a big gap. While the curricula have been designed on the basis of
job descriptions of different categories of functionaries, no systematic assessment of the
curricula and content, including the duration of the training, has been undertaken to
determine the adequacy to build their required job skills and competencies. However,
disregarding the absence of this information or systematic testing of trainees’ knowledge and
mapping their competencies, the curriculum and course durations have been progressively
reduced. (This is discussed further under quality of training in section 3).




                                                 66
                                          Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



2.2      The training programs are not backed by systematic Training Needs Assessment
(TNA). Despite the training operations carrying on beyond 30 years, with specialized training
institutions, and recommendation resulting from the evaluation of UDISHA, the ICDS has yet
to conduct the critically important TNA. In the absence of TNA, the expectation that trainees
will, on completing the training program, imbibe the knowledge and develop the expected
level of skill is unreliable.

3    Quality of training

An examination of the factors contributing to the quality of training suggests that the
quality of ICDS training is poor because of: (i) inadequate training infrastructure; (ii)
shortage of instructors and their deficient knowledge and skills; (iii) inadequate attention
to monitoring of training facilities and trainers; and (iv) lack of assessment of pedagogy,
curriculum and content.

3.1      Training institutions, primarily AWTCs and MLTCs have poor infrastructure
and many lack even basic facilities for training and living. The major difficulties in
organizing effective training as identified by trainers are: (i) most AWTCs lack basic
facilities including audio-visual aids, reference books, space for demonstration, provision of
supplies for preparing teaching and training aids; and (ii) old editions of books and other
training and communication material (Gadkar and NIPCCD, 2006; NIPCCD, 2005a,b).
Figure 5.7 shows the availability of teaching infrastructure at the AWTC (NIPCCD, 2012).
Besides, a test check by the CAG audit team in Andhra Pradesh found that six out of the 12
AWTCs and MLTCs checked did not have white boards, flip charts, display boards and
supporting equipment, such as printers and photocopiers (CAG, 2012).

3.2      Trainers at the AWTCs and MLTCs do not possess the requisite qualification
and experience. A recent evaluation of AWTCs in 23 states notes that approximately 60
percent of the instructors in AWTCs possess the qualifications stipulated in the guidelines
issued by MWCD, GoI, namely master’s degree in social work, nutrition or child
development (NIPCCD, 2012). The UDISHA evaluation, perhaps the only one that tested the
knowledge of instructors in AWTCs and MLTCs, found that only 51percent knew the correct
steps of growth monitoring, 53 percent were aware of the importance of institutional delivery
and 81 percent knew about exclusive breastfeeding (UDISHA, 2008). State-specific AWTC
evaluation studies conducted by the
NIPCCD found that instructors did not                   Fig 5.7: Status of infrastructure at AWTC
have the prescribed qualifications, their                                               Source: NIPCCD, 2012

educational background did not match
the subjects they taught, and they had no          80
field knowledge or experience of the               60
ICDS. Besides, vacant instructor
                                                   40
positions, high turnover of staff at the
training centers and untrained instructors         20
remains a persistent problem (Gadkar
                                                    0

b). The poor availability of trained and
knowledgeable staff at the AWTC
training facilities is largely due to high staff turnover because of less than market pay, poor
facilities at the institutions, and insufficient training of the instructors (MWCD, GoI, 2009).
The ad hoc opening and closing of training centers in some states also is one of the reasons


                                                      67
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



for the loss of trained manpower that had gained not only sufficient experiences but deep
insights into the training process (Gopal, 2009). An example from Rajasthan, where most
trainers were men and untrained, shows the importance of socio-cultural factors, as the men-
only training teams could hardly be expected to provide effective guidance to AWWs in
Rajasthan (Circus, 2006).

3.3      Lack of comprehensive monitoring of training institutions, training courses and
training outcomes, has affected training quality. Although monitoring mechanisms exist
at the central and state level, they are not well conceived, coordinated and pay little attention
to quality and efficacy is suspect. The bodies for review and monitoring of training, namely
the National Training Task Force (NTTF) at the central level and the State Training Task
Force (STTF) are largely non-functional. The monitoring of training at the state level is poor
and visits to the training centers by state officials, if any, are perfunctory and there is no
feedback or follow-up to the visits. (Gopal, 2009). The NIPCCD, which is the agency with
primary responsibility of providing technical support to the AWTCs and MLTCs has a
dedicated Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) and State Monitoring Units (SMUs) in 24 states,
set up through formal MOUs with approximately 60 medical or home science colleges. The
defined functions of the CMU-SMU construct include monitoring of training institutions,
namely the AWTCs and the MLTCs, through visits, data verification and consolidation,
preparing periodic monitoring reports and providing on-the-spot guidance and capacity
building. Since 2008, four consolidated AWTC monitoring reports have been generated that
essentially capture data on components, such as administration and management of AWTCs,
staff position, infrastructure, availability of training learning material and equipment, library
facilities, training methodologies and evaluation of trainees. These visits, however, do not
pay attention to monitoring efficiency, overall performance, training outcomes, skills of
trainers, and delivery of training. Besides, apart from the mere collation of information from
SMUs, there is no system for review of findings and instituting corrective action. The
training division at the MWCD, GoI receives and reviews quarterly progress reports from the
states. However, detailed annual reviews of state training performance by the training
division, introduced as part of UDISHA have been discontinued over the past few years.
Thus, a complete monitoring system that tracks training performance, quality and outcomes
and uses the information to bring about necessary changes is lacking.

3.4     Ad hoc changes in training program duration have affected quality. Table 5.3
shows the reduction in duration of job training courses for ICDS functionaries over time. It is
disconcerting that changes in the length and duration of training were neither backed by any
assessment nor has the
impact of the changes                       Table 5.3: Duration of ICDS training courses

evaluation, virtually no
information is available on an assessment of the sufficiency of the duration of ICDS training
courses. The UDISHA evaluation has observed that the reduction in the number of job
training days (for AWWs from 72 to 52 in 2003-04 and 52 to 30 in 2005-06 has adversely
affected the quality of training (UDISHA, 2008). It further noted the need to revisit the
course curriculum in order to improve the quality of training imparted to ICDS functionaries
as well as the trainers, and recommended that the training include more practical sessions and
field visits to improve the skill sets of AWWs and supervisors. It also introduced flexibility in



                                                 68
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



the curriculum by allowing the states to modify the curriculum by 25 percent, which enabled
innovations in training.

3.5     Training programs are not systematically assessed, nor are the knowledge and
skills developed by trainees post-training systematically evaluated. There is no system for
regular feedback on training programs or other methods of assessing training programs in
terms of their objectives. While generally at the end of training, the knowledge of trainees is
tested, there is no follow up with trainees who require further skill building in specific areas,
either by the training system or in the field. Moreover, the certificate given to trainees on
completion of training is one of participation, instead of certification of a ‘skilled worker’.
Mentoring and coaching by supervisors, while extremely important for continually building
capacity, remains weak (see chapter 7, General Management Practices). The workers
therefore come for training and return, without the system at all ascertaining if they became
equipped to perform their jobs satisfactorily.

3.6     Weakening of the capacity of the national training institution has affected
training quality. While a full review of the capacity of the NIPCCD has not been carried out
so far and falls outside the scope of this review, there are indications of weakening of
capacity of this apex institute for ICDS training. This has occurred particularly in view of the
reduction in human resources due to financial constraints, and relocation of some of the
faculty to a new regional center, whereas the demands on the institute have gone up with the
expansion of the ICDS, its recent restructuring and launch of several new schemes. This has
affected the development of new training material, monitoring of training at AWTCs and
MLTCs and research related to the ICDS (MWCD, GoI, 2013; MWCD, GoI, 2012).

4    Overarching constraints to the quantity and quality of training.

The lack of leadership and management of training are the two key constraints that have
affected training. At the leadership level, the lack of a conceptual framework, vision,
strategy and dynamism to evaluate and change have limited the capacity of the training
system. Management constraints include the lack of adequate management structures,
management skills, staff shortage, functional overload of managers responsible for
training, and poor GMPs.

4.1     The lack of a conceptual framework in the ICDS training system is a key reason
for its inability to deliver high-quality training in adequate amount to ICDS
functionaries and build a skilled workforce. A written conceptual framework would have
spelt out both the theory and the role of the training function, and in doing so outlined all the
elements required by the system to ensure effective training and ensured the development of a
good training system. To illustrate, for effective training a requisite in the conceptual
framework would have been to analyze the roles of all categories of workers and determine
for each the key skills and competencies required. Had this been spelled out, by implication,
the system would have established for each category a ‘proficient worker standard’.
Similarly, recognizing the theory of timely training, if initial training is delayed, people will
work inefficiently and may (often do) acquire sub-optimal or even dysfunctional work habits
and practices that have to be undone later on making training much more difficult, the system
would have developed and implemented strategies to deliver timely initial training. Likewise,
recognizing the need to deliver good quality training, the development of quality standards
would have been ensured. Such a conceptual framework would, at a minimum, have ensured

that the basic essentials for any training system, such as a trainees’ database, and a TNA
system in the ICDS is not missed out.

4.2     Inadequate strategic planning ahead to expand training capacity to train the
large, but anticipated volume/load of training due to the expansion of ICDS. During
1999-2006 under UDISHA, in a national training program supported by the World Bank,
more than 927,600 functionaries received job training and 759,250 received refresher
training, and this cleared the then large training backlog (UDISHA, 2008). However, these
gains were not sustained and the backlog has again accumulated as the ICDS expanded
rapidly from 4,608 projects in 2001-02 to 6,908 projects in 2012 and a large number of
functionaries entered the ICDS workforce. Training such a rapidly increasing workforce is a
daunting task, requiring good strategic planning, consideration of new options and ways of
doing business. However, despite the existence of bodies such as the NTTF at the central
level and STTF at the state level to provide strategic direction, there continued to be a lack of
effective strategic planning and mobilization of required resources. This hampered the
expansion and capacity building capability of the training system to train the rapidly
increasing ICDS workforce. Had all strategic options been considered, including building of
strategic partnerships, approaches such as the use of IT and blended learning programs to
deliver quality and timely training, it is probable that the situation would have been far better.

4.3     The training system has lacked dynamism to address known weaknesses and
gaps. Beyond strengthening the training system under UDISHA, the system has
demonstrated little dynamism to institute change to either meet the changing needs of the
ICDS or to address the weaknesses in the system that were evaluated. For example, the
UDISHA program evaluation made several recommendations to strengthen the training
system, including TNA to guide curriculum setting, computerized state and district level
trainee databases, examining training backlogs, conducting mop-up training, strengthening
and empowering state training teams to take policy decisions, strengthening curriculum in
growth monitoring and management of children with malnutrition where the knowledge and
performance of ICDS functionaries was particularly weak, according priority to training of
trainers and improving funds flow to the training institutions. However, so far these
recommendations have not been implemented. Over the past two years, leaders and senior
managers in the training system have assessed the weaknesses of the training system and
have shown commitment to undertaking a reform of the training system.

4.4    Management structures for training are weak at all levels.

4.4.1 At the national level, training management functions are split between two agencies
but the two need to be better coordinated. At the national level, the management structure
and functions are split between the training division in the MWCD, GoI and the NIPCCD.
The training division in the ministry is responsible for functions, such as budgeting, financial
allocation, revision of norms, periodic reviews and monitoring of physical and financial
progress. The NIPCCD is responsible for managing the aspects related to training courses,
curriculum, content and teaching methodology and monitoring of training institutions and
quality. While, such a division of responsibilities has some merit in that it brings in technical
expertise from the NIPCCD to the management of training, it also has problems, in so far as
it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for planning, periodic reviews, monitoring and
evaluation, and follow-up. For example, for a holistic picture, although CDPO training
targets and budgets should be reflected in the STRAP, these do not form part of the STRAP
and are prepared by the NIPCCD virtually with very little consultation with the states. As a


                                                 70
                                      Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



result, the targets are likely to be arbitrary and the states have little engagement in CDPO
training, except for deputing CDPOs in accordance with the NIPCCD’s request.

4.4.2 At the national, state and district levels, structures appropriate to the functions
required for managing training do not exist. The training division at the national level
includes five persons, none being exclusively assigned for training or with roles and
responsibilities clearly defined, apart from being assigned other responsibilities as well. At
the state level, there is no separate ICDS training cell within the directorate of WCD or Social
Welfare (Gopal, 2009). With the exception of a few states, such as Tamil Nadu, at the state
level, an official in the rank of assistant director or deputy director in the WCD department is
designated as the state nodal training officer, with the training nodal function being one of
several other functions assigned to him/her. Again at the district level, most states have no
management structure or manager who is responsible for training management. Given the
decentralized system of the ICDS training, the state and district level functions are critical to
adequate management of training in planning, implementation, monitoring and coordination.
Thus, the lack of appropriate training management structures at these levels is a critical gap
that contributes to the poor management of training.

4.4.3 Several HR issues, including shortage of staff, lack of management skills and the lack
of role clarity constrain adequate management of training at all levels. There is a shortage of
HR for training management, there being five persons in the national training division, each
with multiple responsibilities of which training is only one. Besides, a single person is
designated as nodal training officer but performs many other functions, and no one at the
district level is assigned training responsibilities, it is rolled into the role of the DPO. What is
expected of them in terms of training management is not clearly defined. Their heavy
workloads limit their ability to devote adequate time and attention to training. They
themselves receive no training, either in management or in fulfilling their roles (Gopal,
2009), and thus lack essential management skills to manage the training, and are also not
empowered to make decisions. Lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, lack of time
and management skills and the absence of a decision making authority has compromised the
ability at all levels to adequately manage the key functions required for holistic management,
namely adequate planning, supervision, monitoring and coordination. Many of the issues
discussed earlier, such as the lack of trainee databases, delays in establishing training centers,
and their sub-optimal monitoring are examples of leadership and management constraints.

4.5      Three key developments in recent years hold the promise of strengthening the
ICDS training system. These are: (i) the ICDS mission which acknowledges the need to
strengthen ICDS training and incorporates several key measures to do so, including
upgrading the training infrastructure, strengthening the training institutions (NIPCCD,
AWTCs and MLTCs and setting up state training institutions in 10 states), creating a
separate ICDS training resource center (ICDS-TRC), establishing strengthened training
management structures at the national, state and district levels and building the capacity of
officials managing training. It also notes strengthening curricula and content backed by a
TNA; (ii) the World Bank supported ISSNIP, which as part of its efforts to reinforce systems
includes strengthening of the training and capacity building systems of the ICDS. This, inter
alia, includes review and revision of training modules, TNA, and testing innovative capacity
building approaches; and (iii) a national consultation on training led by leaders and managers
from the MWCD and NIPCCD during October 2013 to outline the agenda for training
reform. The consultation included officials from the states, and multiple stakeholders and
comprehensively examined the gaps and weaknesses in the training system, acknowledged


                                                  71
                                      Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



them with remarkable candour, and developed an action plan to strengthen ICDS training.
However, strong leadership and technical rigor during the implementation of the reform will
be important.

To conclude, the gap between the required and actual training capacity is large and has
resulted in large numbers of untrained or insufficiently trained workers being placed to
perform functions for which they are not qualified. The evidence highlighted in section 2 on
knowledge and skills in chapter 4 (Availability, Competence and Management of Human
Resources in the System) shows the positive association between AWWs’ knowledge and
mothers’ practices for feeding and caring of infants and young children, which in turn shows
a positive association with prevalence of stunting in children. Further, four best-practices in
the ICDS that demonstrated a positive though modest impact on nutrition outcomes indicate
that building capacity of workers and volunteers to enhance their skills and competencies was
critical. While each approach used a mix to build capacity, such as systematic training
sessions, joint health and ICDS training and mobile training teams, each had also ensured
support for skill development and supportive supervision to supplement the ICDS training
(Micronutrient Initiative, 2007). Thus, the constraints in the ICDS training capacity,
including the expansion of the ICDS, without commensurate augmentation of training
capacity and quality has affected the ICDS implementation and impact and proved costly for
the program.

Recommendations
The findings in this chapter clearly indicate the need for major reforms in the ICDS training
system, and that piecemeal or marginal strengthening of training activities will not help. The
need for reform is acknowledged by the ICDS and there is a serious attempt to address the
weaknesses identified. The ICDS Mission framework recognizes training as one of the key
areas to be strengthened and the national consultation on training, October 2013 was a further
step towards reform. Since much of the existing system needs reform, it will be important to
plan the reform sequence carefully to ensure that activities critical to a holistic approach are
prioritized. These are enumerated below:

1.       The foremost need is to develop a well-conceived conceptual framework for the ICDS
training function and system. This will serve to provide the theory or hypothesis of the
training function, and its implications for the ICDS training system, thus providing the
building blocks for a strengthened system, and charting the key actions required. A few of the
critical ones are outlined below:

  (i)      Establishing ‘proficient or skilled worker’ standards for each category of the
      workforce based on job content analysis for that category, and define the skills level to be
      built during pre-service training and then through follow-up in-service trainings. The job
      analysis and proficiency standards should not be limited to just CDPO, supervisor, AWW
      and AWH job categories, but also include managers performing different functions.
 (ii)      Determining the skills gap to be addressed through training by mapping skills of staff
      at entry (determined through a TNA) against the proficiency standard referred to in the
      previous point. The skills gap should form the basis of defining training curricula, content
      and norms such as frequency and duration of training.
(iii)      Institutionalizing a quality assurance system that defines appropriate standards of
      quality across the system for trainers, training institutions, pedagogy, and monitors these
      on an ongoing basis, and enables corrective action. Accreditation such as ISO 9001 could


                                                  72
                                                       Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



    be considered in each case to assess quality needs to be assured, define those in
    measurable terms and determine the means of periodic measurement.
(iv)     Incorporating a robust monitoring and evaluation system to routinely monitor key
    processes, trainee databases, and training outcomes, that is, the gains in knowledge and
    skills as a result of the training, and periodically evaluate the impact of the strategies being
    implemented.
 (v)     Exploring strategic options to clear the big training backlog and train the large
    numbers of entrants expected to enter the ICDS workforce (discussed further under
    recommendation 5).
(vi)     Therefore, the first strategic step would be to get the people and the data in order to
    develop conceptual frameworks, vision and strategies discussed further in the second and
    third recommendations.

2.     The next recommendation is to cost the overall reform and mobilize the financial
resources required to undertake the reform. No strategy is ever cost-free and only a well-
costed and well-funded strategy determines the success of all downstream steps and their
impact. The ICDS therefore needs sufficient, earmarked allocation for training,
commensurate with the magnitude of reform needed and the numbers to be trained. The costs
must be based on rigorous data and methods to stand the test of scrutiny for allocations.

3.      It is necessary to establish a dedicated organizational home or unit for training. The
unit must be headed by a high-level manager who is provided with the resources needed and
reports to the ICDS Mission Director, with overall responsibility to change the face of
training in the ICDS, develop the conceptual framework, vision and all other lower level
strategies and plans, implement and manage them. Ideally, the incentive structure for this
manager should be tied to ambitious but realistic performance targets with corresponding
rewards and penalties.22

4.      The training structures proposed under the ICDS Mission directorate are unclear
regarding whether the key responsibility of training lies with the directorate’s training unit or
with the national ICDS Mission resource center under the NIPCCD. As presently proposed,
both units report independently to the Mission Director and this perpetuates the existing
functional split of the training function between the ministry and the NIPCCD with resultant
leadership ambiguity for the function. Similarly, the role of the national and state level
taskforces, their composition, interface and accountability vis-a-vis the top training manager
is unclear and should be carefully considered and spelt out.

5.     Clearing the backlog and gearing up to train a large number of entrants, including the
development and delivery of several new categories of courses will require a mix of
approaches, including new ones, such as:

 (i)     Determine the backlog and the capacity of the training infrastructure such as physical
    facilities, trainers and materials to train the number required, and estimate the cost of
    clearing the backlog. While this exercise would have to be undertaken at the state level,
    the methodology for such an assessment could be developed at the national level and
    provided to all the states with clear guidance. On provision of this information and a


22
  To illustrate, appointing the person on a fixed term contract that is not automatically renewed and can be terminated if the person has not
delivered satisfactorily and, on the other hand, having an escalating salary that is agreed upon prior to appointment, which goes up when
objectives are fully met.



                                                                     73
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



    multi-year plan to clear the backlog, the states should be given a one-time grant to clear
    the backlog, and the initiative should be managed nationally by a full-time manager.
(ii)     Augment the existing capacity of the training system through new approaches such as:
   o Optimizing the efficiency of existing training institutions to train larger numbers
   through improved management ,that is planning, timing, and improved funds flow;
   o Dealing on priority with poor quality of trainers and the development of ‘teacher-
   proof’ teaching material;
   o Using blended learning courses that deliver some modules through new approaches
   such as mandatory distance learning preferably with the use of IT, prior to deputation for
   face-to-face training. This may reduce face-to-face learning duration, thus allowing
   existing institutions to train larger numbers in the same period. For AWWs and AWHs,
   where IT training might be a constraint, developing and providing self-learning material
   that contains much of the knowledge and skills needed by new recruits, who would be
   tested for achieving a certain level of knowledge and skills prior to face-to-face training.
   Similarly, as part of periodic in-service training, the provision of IT training modules and
   tools and development of interactive self-learning modules could be considered;
   o Developing mobile training teams to impart training in the field, and prioritizing
   districts with the largest loads of untrained functionaries. There are examples from states
   such as Tamil Nadu where mobile training teams support the overall training effort (see
   Box 5.1); and
   o Delivering refresher or on-going training at the block level by two or three trained
   supervisors and the CDPO. Use of videos and IT in training, and ‘teacher-proof training
   material’ could make this a possible and effective option. Continuous training and
   capacity building by supervisors and trainers at the field level is also an option, such as
   in the TINP where CNWs received initial and regular in-service training by CNIs (see
   box 5.2) and the incremental learning system in Andhra Pradesh (see Box 5.3).

6. Several points that apply to the overall ICDS system are also critical to strengthen
     training, the most important being:
 (i)     The need for adequate management structures and the right number of people at
    different levels to undertake the training function. Although augmented management
    structures have been proposed under the ICDS Mission’s broad framework, it is also
    necessary to evaluate the norms based on the functional analysis recommended in the
    chapter 4, Availability, Competence and Management of Human Resources in the System;
    and
(ii)     As with all managers in the ICDS, those responsible for training need to undergo a
    good management development program. This will build their management skills and
    contribute to changing the management culture in the ICDS.

                         Box 5.1: TINP Training Model
Training of frontline workers under the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project
                                     (TINP)

One of the TINPs had a unique field-based system of training, including continuous
training for frontline workers. The community nutrition workers (CNWs) received their
initial training as well as regular in-service training at the block headquarters by the
community nutrition instructress (CNIs).

Initial training of CNWs: the CNWs were given a two-month training in small groups of
25 trainees. The emphasis was on practical training with a 300-hour curriculum divided
as follows: 115 hours of practical work, 72 hours of field work and 113 hours of theory.
The content included substantive segments on growth patterns, health problems,
nutrition and prevention of dehydration as well as on administration of community
nutrition centers and communication skills. Training was delivered by the CNI,
nutrition supervisors and health staff. The final week of initial CNW training was also
attended by female MPHWs from the same area in light of the linkage of their roles.

In-service training of CNWs: Each CNW received three in-service training sessions
each month. The first was a regular three-hour session run by the instructress for 50
CNWs and five supervisors in each block. In addition, the instructress provided
afternoon in-training sessions twice a month for each group of CNWs and their
supervisor to sharpen their skills in weighing, plotting curves and keeping records.
Special attention was paid to workers whose performance was weak. Also, trainees
learned in a situation with which they were familiar. The trainer built up a long-term
relationship with workers, enabling them to modify their training plan to suit trainees’
needs and make training evaluation integral to the process.

Community Nutrition Instructress: Each CNI was responsible for initial and in-service
training of 50 CNWs and five nutrition supervisors in the assigned block, and supported
nutrition education in the block. The CNI held a postgraduate degree in nutrition, home
science or related fields, preferably with experience in teaching field workers. The CNI
received two months job training, the key elements of which included: objectives of
project and methods of implementation; teaching techniques; organization of practical
and field work; measurement of weight, height and arm circumference; checking and
maintenance of equipment; recording results on growth charts and their interpretation;
protein energy malnutrition diagnosis with difference between stunting and wasting;
ORT; diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency and nutritional anaemia; use of communication
media and materials; use and preparation of teaching aids and training material; health
services available to community and liaison; preparation and delivery of supplementary
foods; relationships with community and public officials; supervision and management;
and project administration, financial control and reporting.

                     Box 5.2: Tamil Nadu Decentralized Model of Training
Tamil Nadu’s ICDS training model is different from that of other states. While the training is funded by
the GoI as in other states, following GoI norms, curriculum, duration and budget, the state has taken the
initiative in assuming full responsibility for the training of the ICDS workforce and has institutionalized a
system where the entire frontline worker training is decentralized down to the block level. The key
features of Tamil Nadu’s training system are as follows:

   A state training institute (STI) at Chennai, on par with the NIPCCD, has overall responsibility for all
    of the state’s ICDS training needs. It conducts on-site job and refresher training for CDPOs, district
    officers, training of trainers for block and project level trainers including orientation and refresher
    training. The STI is also responsible for preparation of guidelines and curriculum. The STI has a lean
    faculty comprising a joint coordinator for training, assistant director for training, senior instructress,
    junior instructress and warden cum instructress.
   Supervisor training (both job and refresher) is conducted by MLTCs, as in other states.
   All frontline workers, AWWs and AWHs are trained at the block level. Instead of establishing
    AWTCs to train AWWs, Tamil Nadu has developed a well-trained and experienced cadre of block
    and project level trainers, located them at the project level for providing job and refresher training to
    AWWs, orientation and refresher training to AWHs, and other innovative training like IYCF training.
    There is one trainer for every block and project, and most trainers are highly experienced in nutrition,
    health, child development and are continuing since the TINP-1. In addition, two mobile training
    teams, each with three instructors conducts training in projects where there are no trainers.
   District level training teams, consisting of four members supervise the project level training, guide
    the trainers and also go to the field and conduct follow-up visits to AWC.

Advantages of the decentralized training pattern: Since trainers are available in each project, AWW and
AWH training is carried out simultaneously across all projects. Therefore, it is timely and there is little
backlog. Training is offered on an ongoing basis, and is hence regular. As the trainers are located at the
project level, they are aware of the training needs of workers, and thus impart training that is responsive
to their needs. It is also of better quality as the trainers have training as well as field experience.

    Box 5.3: Incremental Learning System in Andhra Pradesh: a system for continuous
                   knowledge and skill building for ICDS functionaries
The Incremental Learning System (ILS), implemented in Andhra Pradesh as part of the USAID-CARE
supported Integrated Nutrition and Health Project (INHP), was conceptualized in response to the many
challenges faced by INHP in bringing about and sustaining change in knowledge, skills and implementation
practices of ICDS functionaries, particularly:
 The content focus of ICDS (and RCH) training in the selected interventions was diffused, and one or more
     training sessions, however intense, were insufficient to bring about substantial change;
 Sustaining change in implementation practices of frontline workers required corresponding changes in
     supervision and monitoring practices at successively higher levels as well;
 Since the program monitored only the inputs, there was little clarity on how program inputs were linked to
     outcomes, and building this clarity meant considerable unlearning besides new learning;
 To be effective, facilitation had to be almost continuous. Without consistent follow-up and hand-holding,
     things tended to quickly flow back to business-as-usual;
 Supervisors were the most appropriately positioned to be facilitators of change, provided they in turn could
     be helped to change.

The ILS was thus developed as a carefully structured, sequential cascade of capacity and skill-building sessions
at all operational levels of the ICDS. It entails:

   Restructuring of the monthly meetings of ICDS and RCH personnel at district and block levels and enabling
    joint ICDS-RCH sector meetings to include discussions on the selected interventions to be strengthened;
 Creation of district and block-level resource groups, constituted largely by program staff from ICDS and
    RCH, to function as facilitators;
 Development of standardized tools and processes representing the ‘good practices’ to be replicated;
 Creation of separate modules for at least eight monthly learning cycles, each module comprising
    incremental content built upon the previous one, and potentially extendable to more cycles;
 Develop a two-day training session for each level, with instructions for the first steps of change, and
    assignment of specific implementation tasks. At each subsequent interaction, the previous content was
    reviewed to see if satisfactory progress was achieved. Only after progress was seen, fresh content from the
    next module was layered;
 Tracking of quality of learning in the cascade through a mobile monitoring team, consisting of a small sub-
    set of the facilitators.
The ILS in Andhra Pradesh demonstrated high level of energy among all functionaries and there was always a
demand for repeating the cycles of the ILS. The ILS meetings provided a very useful operational structure for
convergence between ICDS and RCH functionaries. Some of the district and block officials of Andhra Pradesh
who participated in the ILS process have gained substantial operational and technical capacities within a short
period of time.

     Monitoring, Evaluation and the Management of Information in the
                             Nutrition System

Introduction
Monitoring and evaluation are core functions in organizations. In modern organizations, these
form part of the broader knowledge management (KM) function which is the process of
capturing, analysing, developing, sharing, and effectively using organizational knowledge.

One purpose for which information is captured and analysed is that of control, to ensure that
the organization is following the planned direction, operations are progressing as planned, on
time, and at the anticipated cost – this is the function of monitoring. Another purpose of
capturing information is to determine whether intended outcomes and impacts are being
achieved – this is the function of evaluation.

Monitoring helps identify areas requiring improvement and is used extensively by managers
to control daily operations, while evaluation helps identify the success or failure of strategies
and interventions in achieving the desired outcomes. This information is useful for
ascertaining if changes in strategic direction are required to better achieve outcomes.

The scope of the KM function in the ICDS has so far been limited to monitoring and
evaluation. However, the new ICDS Mission framework does allude to an expanded scope,
adding research to the functions of monitoring and evaluation. Since the scope of KM in the
ICDS so far was limited to monitoring and evaluation, this chapter focuses on monitoring and
evaluation as well as management of information. Given the important role played by
monitoring, evaluation and the management of information in the control of operations, apart
from adaptation and change when the original objectives, design and plan do not achieve the
desired outcomes, they are important contributors to the capacity of organizations.

This chapter focuses on the following key questions:

Do the ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have adequate capacity to
monitor and evaluate nutrition services and their delivery to ensure the achievement of
desired child nutrition outcomes? If not, what action can be taken to strengthen the
monitoring, evaluation and management of information in the system?

This section presents briefly the conceptual framework and indicators used to analyse the
ICDS and the NRHM monitoring and evaluation systems. The findings that emerge from the
analysis follow in the next section. In the end, suggestions are offered to address the
constraints diagnosed in the analysis.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators
The KM function encompasses capturing, analysing, developing, sharing and effectively
utilizing organizational knowledge to inform organizational direction, policies, resource
allocation and development and implementation of plans and programs. Monitoring is a
generic management process for exercising control in organizations and to ensure that
                                        Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



activities are implemented according to the operational objectives, design and plan, and are
‘on track’. Evaluation is used to draw conclusions and usually focusses on assessment of
outputs and outcomes. Its primary purpose is to improve operations or change course.
Monitoring and evaluation are inter-related. It is thus paramount that the monitoring and
evaluation framework differentiates between: (i) the information and data to be monitored for
control of activities and for evaluating results; (ii) the frequency with which data is to be
collected, analysed, and used; (iii) the users of the information; and (iv) which information
would be analysed by whom and used in which manner.

Findings
The capacity of the ICDS to generate, analyse and use information to control operations
and track progress towards nutrition outcomes has many constraints. It lacks an adequate
conceptual framework for the M&E function; the most crucial data required to track
progress of nutrition activities and outcomes is not gathered; the data generated through
the system is not reliable; and there is minimal analysis and use of the information
gathered. The proposed strengthening of the system under the ICDS Mission and the
revision of the ICDS MIS have seemingly overcome many of these constraints, paving the
way for collection of meaningful and reliable data, its appropriate analysis and use. The
M&E system of the NRHM does not mention nutrition in its conceptual framework and
gathers data on very few nutrition indicators. However, in coordination with the ICDS, it
does offer opportunities to meaningfully track nutritional indicators to ensure early and
appropriate action for preventing and managing undernutrition.

The findings related to each of the key areas of capacity constraints and indicators are
discussed in the following sections:

1. Conceptual framework

The current ICDS M&E system lacks an explicit conceptual framework, and the implicit
framework on which it is based is weak. A revised MIS is being rolled out, and the
proposed architecture for the M&E system under the ICDS Mission indicates a more

comprehensive conceptualization of the function. The NRHM monitoring and data
management system while conceptually well developed, tracks only a few indicators
pertaining to nutrition. Expanding the scope of the system to include information relevant
to improving nutrition, in coordination with the ICDS will be valuable for both the NRHM
and the ICDS programs.

1.1. The ICDS does not have a written and explicit framework for its M&E function,
and the implicit framework in inadequate. The impact framework on which the current
M&E is based is inadequate as indicated by the many gaps in the system. While the design of
the existing M&E system and the MIS may have been guided by an implicit framework, this
was evidently not examined methodically and remained inadequate. In the absence of an
adequate M&E conceptual framework for monitoring, the data collected is not fully aligned
with the data needed for better operational decisions, analysis and tracking of outputs,
outcomes and impact, and for better policy and strategy analysis. Besides, there is very little
analysis and use of the data, as discussed later (see section 3).

1.2. There is no dedicated functional home for M&E and no dedicated leader for the
function. As discussed earlier (chapter 2, The Nutrition Service Delivery System and
Division of Labor within the System), there is not enough functional differentiation within
the ICDS, and as is the case with several other functions, no unit or division or leader is
dedicated to developing and managing the M&E function. If the ICDS had a dedicated leader
and organizational unit with adequate human resources and expertise, it would have better
chances for the ICDS to have a better conceptualized and designed the M&E system to
manage, monitor, and evaluate information.

1.3. There is a poor understanding of the M&E framework amongst the staff, who
therefore do not appreciate the full purpose of collecting data and using it. The
monitoring framework does not spell out the hypothesis or theory for the use of information
in decision-making. Neither does it clearly articulate the information needed by each to
control operations effectively for achieving their objectives, or how to use the information.
As a result, functionaries and managers do not fully understand the purpose of the
information they collect and report, or its relevance for the control of activities and operations
or to detect problems or achievement of the ICDS’ overall policy objectives, strategies, and
desired outcomes. Instead, they see only three activities, namely making AWC visits,
collecting, collating and reporting monthly data through monthly progress reports (MPR) and
conducting review meetings at specific levels, as monitoring activities, and perform each as
an activity with no purpose other than only to meet the need to report. Furthermore, since at
the operational level they receive no feedback or outputs of the analyses of the data they
collect, or see its use for action, their perception of the purposelessness of collecting the data
is reinforced.

1.4. The evaluation component of the ICDS M&E is weak. Of the five major
evaluations of the ICDS conducted since its inception in 1975,23 two were commissioned by
the MWCD, GoI. This shows that the evaluation component in the ICDS M&E framework
does not lay down the conduct of periodic and regular evaluation. However, evaluation of
ICDS projects or of specific components therein supported by development agencies have
been undertaken from time to time, ostensibly because evaluation was incorporated in those

project frameworks. For example evaluations of various World Bank-supported projects –
ICDS III, UDISHA and USAID-CARE supported INHP have been conducted. This
demonstrates the importance of a strong evaluation component as part of the M&E
framework to ensure that it is periodically undertaken to inform the program strategies and
policies. Besides, the ICDS is one of the most widely assessed programs, and a large number
of assessments, reports and papers by various stakeholders speak of the impact of its
strategies and their implementation, including the most recent evaluation by the Programme
Evaluation Organization (PEO) of the Planning Commission and the HUNGaMA Survey that
surveyed several aspects of the program. There are also examples from some state WCD
departments such as in Rajasthan24 and Karnataka25 that commissioned assessment and
evaluation of the ICDS by external agencies. While recently cognizance of the findings of
major studies and reports has been taken to inform the ICDS restructuring, the use of
evidence to examine its implication for the program has not been a usual practice in the
ICDS.

1.5. Three recent initiatives, namely the restructured ICDS, a revised MIS that is
being rolled-out, and the World Bank supported ICDS Systems Strengthening and
Nutrition Improvement Project (ISSNIP), have set the stage for conceptual clarity in the
ICDS evolving a sound monitoring and evaluation framework. Whereas the restructured
ICDS lays out the broad architecture for its future monitoring and evaluation system, a newly
designed MIS is being incrementally rolled out, and the World Bank supported ISSNIP
project will further strengthen monitoring and evaluation in the ICDS.

1.5.1. The M&E framework under the ICDS Mission suggests the outline of a more robust
M&E framework. It also expands its scope to include research and other information,
recommending the evolution of a KM system. The architecture outlined for the M&E and
research system in the ICDS Mission suggests efforts to strengthen many of the weaknesses
in the earlier M&E such as: (i) the outlining of a set of input, output, and outcome indicators
for evidence based monitoring; (ii) a five-tier monitoring and review mechanism from the
central to AWC levels with review committees at each of the five levels, namely national,
state, district, block, and anganwadi, using real time data through ICT and mapping; (iii)
conducting annual program reviews jointly with the NRHM and other stakeholders; and (iv)
community monitoring mechanisms to gather qualitative data. The framework also defines
the evaluation aspect, proposing third party evaluation to review the impact of the program,
with periodic external, household and facility surveys to track the effectiveness of activities.
Though the research element proposed with M&E is not further defined, it is necessary that
the ICDS mission develops not only a comprehensive M&E and research conceptual
framework, but also considers developing a full-fledged KM framework. A few key points
illustrating a conceptual framework for KM are shown in Box 6.1.

1.5.2. The revised ICDS MIS, while not yet having articulated a conceptual framework for
the system, provides the nearest equivalent of a conceptual framework in one of its training
manuals. The manual provides conceptual clarity on all aspects of the generation,
management and use of information, its relevance and importance. It specifies the type of
data and information to be collected, when and from where, and assigns clear responsibilities
for collection and analysis of data and information. From the control perspective, it has been
focussed on the critical tasks to be accomplished for achieving the ICDS outcomes,
particularly in health and nutrition education and behavior change. To provide conceptual

       Box 6.1: Conceptual framework on the function of information management
Use of information to:
 1. Provide direction for action – the information will be used to help leaders and managers develop
 visions, missions, policies, strategies and strategic plans.
 2. Help obtain resources – the information will be used to convince the government and external providers
 to provide financial and other resources.
 3. Allocate resources – the information will be used to link resource allocation to operational requirements
 that is to norms and standards.
 4. Implement plans and programs – the information will be used to develop operational plans and then
 monitor daily operations; information will also be used for exercising accountability.
 5. Conduct research studies and evaluation – the information will be used to monitor the utilization and
 efficiency of resources, as well as the working of processes over time; it will be used to evaluate costs,
 outputs, and outcomes.
 6. Manage change – the information will be used to validate the need for change and to convince people
 that the change is needed.

Users of the information:
 1. Managers in the organization’s headquarters.
 2. Managers at other high levels in the organization.
 3. Managers at de-concentrated or decentralized field offices of the organization.
 4. Customers and clients of the organization.
 5. External users in relevant categories.
 6. Other stakeholders, such as international aid agencies, civil society agencies, researchers at universities,
 and the media.

Key tasks involved in the function, for which it is necessary to have adequate capacity:
 1. Design the types of information to be used and determine the sources of this information, the methods of
 collecting, storing, moving, accessing, and using it.
 2. Collect the information at source and aggregate it.
 3. Process the information for use.
 4. Store the information in data banks.
 5. Move the information to users when needed.
 6. Provide access to the information for all users when needed.
 7. Actually use it for decision-making.

clarity to all functionaries, the induction training program provides detailed orientation to
ICDS officials and by deliberate design makes the ICDS supervisor central to managing the
induction training. The training takes the functionaries through the purpose, relevance and the
conceptual framework of the new MIS. It will now be important to expand the conceptual
framework by including incremental features to complement the MIS.

1.5.3. Under the mission, dedicated monitoring, evaluation and research units at the
national and state levels headed by a program manager are proposed. At the national level, a
small M&E unit in the ICDS Mission Directorate, complemented by an M&E unit at the
national ICDS Mission Resource Center is proposed. The purpose of the resource center is to
provide technical assistance and expertise to the national and state ICDS Missions. However,
it is not clear where the leadership for the M&E and research function lies. From the
management perspective clarity of roles, responsibilities, and coordination between the two
will be critical. At the state and district level, dedicated staff has been assigned for M&E and,
at the project level, a nutrition surveillance coordinator has also been assigned. The
assignment of staff for M&E at all levels will fill a crucial existing gap, namely that of
functional leadership and dedicated staff for M&E.

1.6    Although the NRHM has a well-defined conceptual framework for M&E of the
program’s health components, nutrition finds a marginal place in it. Overall the
program’s M&E framework is comprehensive, describing the aspects to be monitored, by
whom and at what periodicity the required data is to be generated, its analysis, use and
storage, and arrangements for training of staff. Functionaries at different levels are aware of
the indicators and their frequency to be monitored. Dedicated units for M&E exist at the
national, state, district, CHC and PHC levels and senior managers have been assigned at the
national and state levels to lead the M&E function. (MoHFW, GoI, 2008).

1.6.1 While the two key components of the NRHM monitoring system relevant to nutrition,
the Health Information Management System (HMIS), and the Mother and Child Tracking
System (MCTS) do capture some nutrition indicators, their conceptual frameworks are silent
on nutrition. The HMIS, designed to capture public health data from both public and private
institutions in rural and urban areas across the country, is envisaged as a single window
facility for all public health data for the MoHFW, GoI. The MCTS, which is essentially a
name based tracking system enables tracking ante-natal care check-ups (ANCs) and the
immunization status of individual pregnant women and, following their delivery, that of their
children. The MCTS incorporates a feature to provide the frontline heath functionaries,
namely ANMs and ASHAs, with lists of all pregnant women who are due to receive their
ANCs and post-natal care checkups (PNCs) and of all children due to receive their
vaccinations. Between the two systems, few nutrition related indicators are captured, namely:
(i) for pregnant women: IFA supplementation and presence of anemia, birth-weight of
infants, and whether breastfeeding was initiated within one hour after birth; and (ii) for
children: immunization and administration of vitamin A supplements. However, the
conceptual framework of each does not include a specific reference to nutrition, either in
terms of monitoring objectives or in the manuals for functionaries. This is indicative of the
low priority to nutrition in the health sector and is likely to contribute to the large proportion
of health functionaries at all levels in the health system not seeing themselves as having an
important role to play in improving nutrition.

1.6.2 The HMIS and MCTS could potentially provide some critical information relevant to
tracking and improving maternal and child nutrition. Since nutrition and health are closely
related and nutrition has a key role in reducing maternal, infant and child mortality, which is
a shared objective of both programs, and the fact that both the ICDS and the NRHM provide
services to the same mothers and children, it is necessary to expand the health monitoring
systems, particularly the MCTS, to include other nutrition indicators. As the MCTS tracks
each child by name, it should be expanded in coordination with the ICDS to track children’s
growth, to enable early detection of faltering growth followed by action in coordination with
the ICDS. This could contribute significantly to prevention of undernutrition and in tracking
children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) who need referral to health facilities but could
be managed at the community level. Facility-based management of children with SAM is the
direct responsibility of the NRHM, but there are gaps in the referral of these children to
health facilities. The ICDS weighs children periodically and the MCTS could use this
information for the tracking system, and explore options for inter-operability of the system
with the ICDS. This would bridge the information gap between the ICDS and health systems
and ensure that every child needing attention for nutrition is known to the health and ICDS
functionaries and managers for support to become well nourished.

1.6.3 The NRHM’s periodic Common Review Missions (CRM) and Joint Review Missions
(JRM) have made some observations to strengthen the NRHM’s role in improving nutrition.


                                                 83
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



The CRMs and JRMs, conducted by the NRHM with stakeholder engagement are
opportunities to holistically review all aspects of the NRHM, gather qualitative information,
understand key issues and agree upon solutions. The JRMs and CRMs have in their review
observed that while Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs) were operational at the district
and block levels, their utilization needed improvement, given the large number of
malnourished children, and the need to link the NRCs with community-based treatment of
malnutrition (8th JRM, 2011). The need was also noted to make the NRCs functional by
providing for trained staff and strengthening its linkages with the VHNDs, so that children
with SAM could be identified and referred to the NRCs for treatment (6th CRM, 2012).

2    Availability of relevant and reliable data

While a large amount of data is generated in the existing ICDS M&E system, there are
gaps that constrain comprehensive monitoring. In particular, the data falls short on
accuracy and relevance to track the most crucial nutrition services and outcomes. The
revised MIS being rolled out attempts to address these concerns and includes more
meaningful indicators. In the case of NRHM, very little information relevant to tracking
nutrition indicators is generated; the volume of data generated is large and there are
concerns regarding the accuracy of the data.

2.1     The information collected by the current ICDS MIS is not fully congruent with
information needed to exercise adequate control or tracking of the most important
outcomes at the operational level. Whereas far too much information is collected, it falls
short of the requirement for monitoring all activities important to improving nutrition.

2.1.1 Only selected activities are tracked and the system does not allow comprehensive
monitoring of all key activities to improve nutrition. The maximum focus of gathering,
collating and reporting information is on the data related to supplemental feeding. However,
information relevant to some crucial activities to improve nutrition such as counselling and
making home visits is not tracked. Furthermore, no data is collected on the critical behavior
and practices of feeding young children, which could help at the frontline level, to gauge
whether counselling is effective or how it could be improved. The system does gather
information and report on the nutritional status (grades of undernutrition based on weight-for-
age) of children up to six years but this is only a snapshot of the aggregate numbers of
children in each category of undernutrition and does not show the extent to which
undernourished children improve month to month, or how many slip into undernutrition.
Such information would be relevant and meaningful to AWWs and their managers in
addressing undernutrition.

2.1.2 No qualitative information is gathered. Qualitative information plays an important
role in understanding why things may or may not work well. This input is essential for
appropriate changes at the operational level to improve processes, efficiency and the result of
activities. Although the intent of including interaction with the community during AWC
visits by the supervisors and CDPOs appears to be to gather qualitative information on the
program performance and its responsiveness to community needs, there is no systematic way
of capturing it, collating it, triangulating with quantitative information and using it.

2.1.3 Frequent requests for information indicate that some of the required information
might be missing. The FGDs in Bihar and Tamil Nadu indicated that functionaries get
frequent requests for information over and above what is reported through the formal system.


                                                84
                                      Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



This shows that all information needs of the higher levels are not met through the system or
that the required information is not available at that level due to problems with data flow,
processing and accessibility.

2.1.4 Too much unnecessary information is collected and reported, the opportunity cost of
which is very high. The existing ICDS MIS generates a huge amount of data transcribed from
registers maintained at AWCs, varying from 11-35 in number, depending on the state and
includes inter alia information pertaining to demographics, resources available and in use,
PSE activities, and nutritional status of children up to six years. Besides, the states MPRs
provide project wise status of operational AWCs, including staffing, number of beneficiaries,
and nutrition status of children. The AWWs therefore spend a disproportionately high amount
of time filling registers and maintaining records (ranging between 12-99 minutes per day),
while a large part of time at sector meetings is devoted to MPR review and completion, and
then to the review at block level, and at times at the district and state levels too. All this time
spent, much of it taken away from implementation and service delivery, results in virtually no
corrective action. Thus the system has abnormally high opportunity cost.

2.2     High priority at all levels to submission of MPRs ensures that the complete set of
aggregated and reported information is available in time. Information from the FGDs
shows that the one priority which is clearly understood by AWWs, supervisors and CDPOs is
submission of MPRs within the stipulated date. For example, AWWs from Bihar reported
that failure to submit monthly reports by the due date resulted in threats of deduction of
salary, providing a written explanation for the delay (spashtikaran) or criticism in meetings
which would be highly degrading or frustrating. Sector meetings devote almost all the time to
collecting, reconciling and consolidating sector MPRs and the aggregated national MPRs
show that data is regularly generated from over 90 percent of the AWCs and aggregated at
the state level.

2.3 The accuracy of information collected through the system is suspect. Several
studies point out the lack of accuracy and reliability of data reported through the ICDS MIS
(Planning Commission, 2011; District Health Society of Valsad, 2009; Saxena and
Srivastava, 2009; SEDEM, 2005). As seen earlier, AWWs lack the skills and competencies
in maintaining records and reporting. This is likely to be one of the several reasons for the
poor quality of data. State level officials in Tamil Nadu reported during the FGDs that, as
grassroot level workers are overloaded, the data is collected hurriedly and therefore neither
reliable nor updated regularly. They also said there is a tendency to provide false
information in order to avoid adverse comments during monthly meetings. Moreover, as the
data is not scrutinized or used, its accuracy continues to be poor.

2.4     The new MIS eliminates many of the constraints of the existing MIS. The revised
MIS is designed to gather information that is more relevant and meaningful to users at each
level and, though still information heavy, is likely to improve data relevance, reliability and
use.

2.4.1 The system is designed to capture information that is more relevant to exercise
control and track outcomes. The system captures both quantitative and qualitative data
related to the most crucial work processes and services delivered at the AWCs. It focuses on
information about outcomes, inputs and processes, and the indicators are congruent with the
process indicators outlined in the ICDS Mission’s broad framework for implementation, such
as increase in the percentage of early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth,


                                                  85

exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age, timely introduction complementary feeding
after six months and children’s weight . However, information pertaining to undernutrition
continues to be collected in the earlier way, showing only the number of children in each
grade. However information pertaining to how many undernourished children improve or do
not improve month to month, or how many children are becoming undernourished, which is
more relevant for field-level functionaries, is not included. In line with the changes, the AWC
registers have been redesigned to help the AWWs capture the required information, and the
AWC monthly progress report and the block monthly progress report formats have been
modified.

2.4.2 Accuracy of data is likely to improve because of clear guidance to capture and report
data. The training manual for the revised MIS induction training provides clear instructions
on how and when to record data and information for each information head in all 11
prescribed registers of the ICDS. The manual leaves no ambiguity about the revised MIS, and
is therefore likely to result in more accurate and reliable data, although actual improvements
remain to be seen. As part of the strengthening of the M&E system under the World Bank
project, ISSNIP, the development of data validation mechanisms have been proposed to
improve the accuracy and reliability of data. The revised MIS has been piloted and tested in
approximately 1,000 AWCs (one block each in six states), thus providing reasonable
assurance that the formats prescribed are workable, structured to record the required data,
convenient to use, and can be filled in by workers in reasonable time (MWCD, GoI, 2012).

2.4.3 The revised MIS does show some promise of reducing time and opportunity cost,
although it continues to be information heavy. The revised MIS has attempted to reduce the
human and opportunity costs of monitoring by simplifying and streamlining registers, and
making them easier for AWWs’ use, including reporting on only relevant and required data.
Thus, other than the information on the total population of the project, the revised MPR does
not require reporting data that is unlikely to change on a monthly basis, and this reduces the
time and burden of reporting. As all information from the AWC MPRs is not transmitted
upwards, it reduces the time spent in preparation of the block MPR and its review at every
level in the ICDS.

2.5     Concerns regarding accuracy of the NRHM data as well as the volume of data
collected. The JRMs and CRMs have noted concerns regarding the lack of accuracy and poor
quality of the NRHM data pool. The reasons for poor data quality are related largely to issues
such as poor internet connectivity, insufficient staff, lack of clarity, system design issues and
weak supervision (6th CRM report, 2012). The issue of lack of consistency in recording
formats within the state and between states has been neglected. The large volume of data
collected has also been noted. For example, some states had as many as 38 registers at the
sub-center level (8th JRM report, 2011).

3    Use of information

Currently, there is very little analysis and use of information generated either by the ICDS
system or the nutrition related information of the NRHM M&E system. However, the
revised ICDS MIS, structured to promote the required analysis and use of information
relevant to each user’s job, is expected to improve data analysis and use.

3.1    Under the existing monitoring system, there is little analysis beyond collation of
data and the use of information is minimal. There is almost no processing and analysis of


                                                 86
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



data to translate it into meaningful information or output reports. For example, while each
state prepares an MPR with the project-wise status of the number of operational AWCs,
staffing, number of beneficiaries reached, nutrition status of children amongst others, the
information and data is not compared with targets for the reporting month and neither is there
any trend analysis (World Bank, 2007). Besides, no analysis is undertaken to make the
information useful for operational decision-making, or to review progress towards achieving
the ICDS objectives. Since there are no clear targets or plans at the operational level (there
are only coverage norms), there are no benchmarks against which to track progress, making it
impossible to measure or judge if operations are progressing as planned, on-course and on
time and to identify other variations in cost or scope. The reasons for minimal use of
information include a lack of skills to manage and interpret information, and not enough
appreciation of the value of information for decision making. Several studies document the
poor use of data (CAG, 2012 and Biswas and Verma, 2009), including the poor use of
nutritional status information to take steps to improve nutrition (Clifton D’Rozario, 2011).

3.2     Nonetheless, there are some good examples of use of data. The FGDs highlighted
examples of good review of data and its use for taking corrective action. In Tamil Nadu, the
state level review of the MPR is used to identify gaps in the field and corrective actions
proposed. Similarly, CDPOs in the state reported that the DPO reviews the block's
performance every month, with focus on the numbers of severely and moderately
underweight children, comparing the progress with the previous month and with achievement
of targets. During the district review, discussions pertaining to observations from AWC
visits, including suggestions to improve performance, are undertaken and CDPOs with
innovative and successful strategies and best practices are shown appreciation and asked to
share the information with the others.

3.3     Under the revised MIS, data management, processing and analysis systems are
well conceived to promote greater usage. Unlike the existing MIS, not all data collected at
the AWCs, and reported in the AWC MPRs is transmitted upward, and only data relevant to
the next level is sent up. For example, the system clearly lays out, among other aspects, data
pertaining to ‘Analysis of Important Behaviors and Services’ is not meant to be transmitted
up and is meant for discussions between the supervisor and the AWW to improve the latter’s
work processes and service delivery. Similarly, the new block MPR is designed to provide
reporting on process level indicators that are in line with those defined in the ICDS Mission.
It also includes a section to note achievements, problems faced and resolved during the
month by the CDPO. The block MPR not only collates the AWC MPRs, but also processes
the information, converting it to percentage achievements and efficiencies, thereby making it
more meaningful for M&E and corrective action.

3.4     The NRHM HMIS and MTS have constraints of data analysis and usage. Several
reports note the sub-optimal use of HMIS data. While some states analyse the information
from the HMIS, and use the analysis for the preparation of their PIPs, the HMIS is largely not
used for monitoring the program at PHC, block, district or state level (8th JRM, 2011). Poor
data quality and problems related to the technical design of the HMIS system limits local
analysis and these are some of the key reasons for the limited analysis and usage of data
especially at the district level (6th CRM, 2012). The absence of integration of the MCTS with
the HMIS, software and hardware issues need to be addressed to improve data usage and
avoid duplication of effort (8th JRM report, 2011). The analysis and use of nutrition related
information captured by the NRHM is limited. The state PIPs focus on 21 indicators which



                                                87
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



are called state-specific goals and service delivery targets. These are not regularly reviewed at
most levels.

Recommendations
The ICDS mission framework lays out the architectural contours of the ICDS’ future M&E
system, and proposes to set up a dedicated functional unit at the national and state levels to
design and manage the ICDS M&E function. The ICDS MIS has been revised and is
currently being rolled out. The revised MIS addresses many of the constraints and
shortcomings of the existing ICDS MIS, and the ongoing World Bank support to the ICDS
includes further strengthening of the M&E system. These developments present an
unprecedented opportunity to give the ICDS a new generation M&E system, as well as set the
stage for the ICDS to integrate it within a broader KM system.

1.      The ICDS Mission information framework has added research along with the M&E
function. It also refers to the use of jan sunvais and other community-based monitoring
mechanisms, reviews and assessments such as joint review missions, that will generate
information. For effectively organizing, processing, sharing and using the information from
all sources, the most important step is for the ICDS to develop a conceptual framework,
ideally for KM, but at a minimum for the M&E function. The importance of a comprehensive
written conceptual framework to ensure that relevant data is collected, processed, analysed
and used on a timely basis to control operations, track outcomes and determine if policies and
strategies have the desired impact, has been shown in the discussion on conceptual
framework. Box 6.1 provides some key points that serve as building blocks for developing a
good framework. In order to move in this direction, it will be important to appoint a high
level manager with principal responsibility to develop the conceptual framework for the
design of the system, and oversee its design, implementation and management.

2.      The content of the new MIS should be reviewed against the conceptual framework
developed with a view to prioritizing what needs to be reported and how frequently. This
might result in reducing the volume of data generated, and possibly make space for other
information of higher importance. One of the missing pieces at this point is periodic tracking
of changes in the nutritional status of individual children. While this is supposed to be done
through individual MCP cards, for bringing this information into the monitoring system to
enable appropriate action, it is important for AWWs to report periodically on the nutritional
status of each child or pregnant mother under her care by name, so that the supervisor can
monitor progress (or lack of it) and support the AWW in this critical task. Similarly, if each
supervisor has to report the status of these children and mothers under the care of subordinate
AWCs, there will be an incentive to pressurize the AWWs in these centers to deliver the
results. Such tracking of the nutrition status of individual children and mothers might be best
done by integrating this information with the MCTS (see recommendation 6).

3.      The revised MIS has already taken steps to improve the reliability and accuracy of
data, such as providing clear guidance and direction, good training, and emphasis on the use
of data at each level. This should lead to improvements in data reliability. In addition, the
revised MIS should consider instituting some data validation mechanisms, such as random
checks, verification of a specified percentage of data. Pilots to test data validation
mechanisms are planned under the ISSNIP project, to inform the ICDS M&E of such
methods and enable their use throughout the program.

4.      Given the minimal data analysis and use for exercising control and decision making,
the ICDS should make serious efforts to promote data analysis and its greater use at each
level. This may involve developing standard data analysis templates, building the skills of
personnel at all levels to interpret and use data for decision making. A beginning in this
direction has been made with the revised MIS. The ICDS must promote a culture that values
data analysis and use. This could be done in several possible ways. One way would be to start
at the top. High level managers should start using analyses on a national or state level and
present their analyses to the next level of managers, and require them to use similar analyses
with personnel at the next lower level and for their own entities, such as districts heads for
CDPOs, CDPOs for supervisors, and supervisors for AWWs. Another way is to mandate that
all work plans be based on the analysis of specific data relevant to the work plan.

5.     The ICDS must also use effectively, any data generated by any organization that
could potentially throw light on any aspects of the program, including performing its own
analysis on the raw data, if necessary, such as from the HUNGaMA Survey and ICDS
evaluation. It must acquire expertise that will support undertaking such analyses.

6.      The potential for use of the MCTS as a system to track the nutrition status of children,
pregnant mothers and adolescent girls as well as include other important nutrition indicators
should be seriously explored. Inter-operability of information between the NRHM and ICDS
programs will not only be efficient but will also serve each program’s interest. Since the
ICDS and the NRHM target the same set of mothers and children, it is in their common
interest to track indicators that support both programs in health and nutrition of mothers and
children. A common tracking system will help ensure that the most vulnerable and the ones
needing attention are on the radar screens of the functionaries and managers of both, the
ICDS and the NRHM.

                               General Management Practices

Introduction
Management practices are the practices that managers follow when they manage people,
resources and operations. Some management practices relate particularly to the management
of specific groups of people, specific operations and specific resources; many are however
common to the management of all people, resources and operations. Such practices, called
general management practices (GMPs) are practised by managers and leaders. The number of
GMPs is large. It is, therefore, useful to group them in smaller number of categories. They
can be grouped into the following seven categories: (i) setting of objectives; (ii) operational
planning; (iii) empowerment; (iv) supervision; (v) coordination; (vi) accountability; and (vii)
sound work processes and procedures.

GMPs are indicators of institutional capacity, the rationale being that good management
practices enhance capacity while poor ones constrain capacity. Therefore, this chapter
addresses the following key question:

To what extent do managers in the ICDS follow good GMPs? What, if any, are the factors
that constrain managers in following good GMPs, and how can these be overcome?

The chapter presents a brief GMP conceptual framework and capacity indicators, and then
makes a detailed examination of three of the GMPs, namely, supervision, accountability and
work practices and procedures.

Analytical framework and capacity assessment indicators
The cumulative effect of seven highly interdependent GMPs, namely setting of objectives,
operational planning, empowerment, supervision, coordination, accountability and work
practices and procedures, can greatly enhance or constrain the capacity of an organization.
The detailed analytical framework for GMPs is described in Annex 1. Operational indicators
to assess the effectiveness of these seven GMPs are outlined in Table 7.1. The chapter
examines three of these GMPs.

Findings
Findings pertaining to the three GMPs, namely supervision, accountability and work
practices and procedures are discussed below.

1.     Supervision

Supervision is one of the most important generic tasks of management. All managers
supervise their immediate subordinates. It is necessary to distinguish between this generic
task, which ought to be carried out by all managers at all levels in the ICDS and Health, and
the job of the immediate managers of all AWWs who are called supervisors. This discussion
concerns the generic task and how it is carried out by all managers, including the supervisors.

The supervision analytical framework

Supervision combines two elements, namely, oversight and support. Oversight refers to the
activity of watching the performance of subordinates when they carry out operations for the
purpose of control. Support refers to the activity of guiding, coaching, mentoring and
motivating subordinate staff. Most of the time, support is given as an integral part of
oversight.

The effectiveness of supervision depends on: (i) what managers watch while supervising; (ii)
what they focus on while supporting; and (iii) the frequency and intensity of supervision.
Good managers watch what their subordinates devote their time and effort to, making sure
that these are in line with organizational priorities. They pay attention to how their
subordinates carry out their jobs, looking for opportunities to improve the tools and methods
of operation. Having identified such opportunities, managers move into the support mode and
guide and train their subordinates to perform better. However, even good managers often fall
into the trap of focusing only on what is being monitored by their organizations. Thus, if their
organizations monitor only the ‘how much’ and not the ‘how well’, or ‘at what cost’, they too
tend to watch only the ‘how much’ and spend supervision time on ways to enhance it, to the
exclusion of the other two imperatives.

Finally, since supervision is a generic management task carried out by managers at different
levels of management, what managers focus on while supervising also differs. When top
managers supervise senior managers under them they focus on how the senior managers
interpret strategy and manage operations; when operational managers supervise workers, they
focus on how the workers carry out specific work tasks.

Findings

Overall, there is a weak culture of supervision in the ICDS. It is generally focussed only on
the supervision of AWCs, while supervision along the hierarchy receives little attention.
Further, supervision is focussed more on the control dimension, whereas the support
element is weak; the frequency of supervision is sub-optimal and the quality of supervision
is weak. Key reasons for the weak supervision are shortage of staff and lack of supervisory
skills.

1.1. Supervision in the ICDS focuses primarily on supervision of AWCs and at other
levels the practice of supervision is almost non-existent. Most, if not all, literature on


                                                 91
                                       Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



supervision in the ICDS, deals with supervisory activities only at the AWC level – whether
exercised by the supervisors, or by visiting CDPOs and DPOs. They seem to ignore the fact
that supervision is required at all levels and make no comment on how executives at the level
of state ministries supervise the DPOs, how DPOs supervise the CDPOs and how CDPOs
supervise the supervisors. The evidence suggests that high level ministry officials seldom
visit DPOs, the DPOs seldom visit CDPOs, and the CDPOs seldom visit supervisors.
However, the opposite is true whereby supervisors go to meetings with the CDPOs and
CDPOs go to meetings with the DPOs. These meetings are often described as supervisory in
nature, but unlike effective supervision meetings, are conducted in large groups, not one-on-
one, and consist predominantly of oversight, not support.

1.2. Even at the AWC level, there is not enough supervision, and its quality leaves
much to be desired. There is ample evidence in the literature and in this study that the
supervision of AWCs is one of the weakest points of the ICDS. (Haddad and Zeitlyn, 2009;
Saxena, 2009; Pratichi (India) Trust, 2009; Huff-Rousselle et al, 2007; Srinivasan et al, 2007,
Gragnolati et al, 2005). These study reports refer to it as ‘poor’, ‘lacking’, or ‘non-existent’.
The main weaknesses of supervision in the ICDS are:

1.2.1. It is highly ‘oversight-centric’, and the ‘support’ aspect is minimal, if not absent.
Visits to the AWC form the primary mechanism to exercise supervision. There are norms for
the number of visits to be made by supervisors, CDPOs, DPOs and other officials (see Table
7.2), and checklists for visits lay out what should be ‘overseen’ during the AWC visit.
Approximately 50 percent of the CDPOs and supervisors admitted that they did not provide
any support and guidance during their AWC visits (UDISHA, 2008). The AWWs generally
have low literacy levels, coarse skills which need continuous training, are overburdened with
many activities, have low levels of motivation, and are ultimately held responsible for the
timely and effective delivery of all services under the ICDS. This makes the supervision of
AWC activities by the supervisor and other officials an important task, which if carried out
systematically, would help in both effective delivery of services and in enabling the AWW
develop and refine her knowledge and skills.

     Source: MWCD, GoI, 2010.

1.2.2. Despite the focus on the number of visits, the frequency of supervisory visits to the
AWCs by all categories of officials falls short of the prescribed norm. Despite the focus on
the number of visits, a large number of reports document the erratic patterns of visits to the
AWCs by all categories of supervisors. Although the HUNGaMA Survey 2011 reports that
70 percent of the AWCs had received a supervisor’s visit in the one month prior to the survey


                                                   92
                                               Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



(HUNGaMA Survey Report, 2011), several other reports note much poorer supervision
statistics. Data from 20 states shows that on an average a supervisor made only five AWC
visits in six months, ranging from two in Bihar to eight in Haryana. In the case of CDPOs, on
an average only one visit to an AWC was made in six months, ranging from two in
Chhattisgarh and Haryana to none in Assam. The DPOs had not made even one supervisory
visit to any AWC (Planning Commission, 2011). Several reports have documented that a
large proportion of AWCs are not visited by any functionary for prolonged periods (Planning
Commission, 2011; Pratichi (India) Trust, 2009; Gupta, 2007; Biswas and Verma, 2009;
IIHMR, 2000 and Usha, 2006).

1.2.3. The quality and content of supervision is weak. The effectiveness of the supervisory
visit depends on what the supervisors, CDPOs and DPOs focus on, or do not focus on, during
their visits. A central preoccupation of the supervisory visit is checking records and registers,
and too much time is spent on this with too little time devoted to other activities including
mentoring and providing guidance (Planning Commission, 2011; UNICEF, 2007 and 2009;
Pratichi (India) Trust, 2009; Gangur, 2007; FOCUS, 2006; Gupta, 2007; IIHMR, 2000).
Supervisors tend to focus – both in their oversight and support tasks - on the indicators being
monitored by the system, that is, the numbers of beneficiaries and foodstock. Several reports
suggest that supervision visits are often very short, their quality rather weak, and the number
of visits too few (see Box 7.1). While supervisory checklists prescribe checking aspects, such
as infrastructure, cooking and distribution of food, as well as activities, such as
immunization, food distribution, pre-school education, weighing, health checkups, VHND
observation and interaction with the community, the information collected from the field and
from documents indicate no concrete evidence to show whether these checklists are used in
practice.
                                   Box 7.1: Quality of supervisory visits
 “Visits made by the CDPO were found to be very low in almost all the states, with the average being just one in six
 months” – Planning Commission, 2011

 “Only 29 percent centers were reportedly visited by Child Development Project Officers (CDPO) in the year prior to the
 survey……. While asked about visits by officials’ many AWWs responded –‘konodini aseni’- ‘the officials never
 visited’.” – Pratichi (India) Trust, 2009

 “It is observed almost two third of the AWCs were supervised at least once in a month, with nearly 13% being never
 visited by the Supervisory staff…..In Bihar, the CDPO had visited the AWCs only once in a ye ar. The frequency of visit
 by the DPO to AWCs was almost conspicuous by its absence, though the DPO did visit some AWCs once in a year or
 once in six months” – DB Gupta, 2007

 “More than three-fourth of the supervisory staff were found to be unable to move in the field or make any visits to the
 Anganwadi center” – GoB and UNICEF, 2007

 “In Jharkhand, almost half of the sample AWCs were never visited, and only 13% of the AWCs were visited once in a
 month by the supervisor” – DB Gupta, 2007

 “It was found that visits by CDPO Supervisors to the AWCs were inadequate and some AWCs were never visited by
 CDPOs in a span of three years” – Biswas and Verma, 2009

 “Around 93% of AWWs said that supervisors visits once in 3 months and around 98% of AWWs said that ACDPO and/
 or CDPOs visit their centers once a year” – MN Usha, 2006

 “The numbers of visits made by the medical officer was quite low, with the average for six months being only one” –
 Planning Commission, 2011

1.3.    The reasons for weak supervision in the ICDS are many and include, among
others, a weak culture of supervision, staff shortage and lack of skills and resources.

1.3.1. Shortage of staff, heavy workload, and lack of vehicular resources affect the number
of supervisory visits that officials can make. Several studies and field data collected for this
study indicate stark differences in the frequency of visits made by the supervisors, ranging
from one per week to one per month. Owing to the large number of vacancies at the
supervisor level, the average number of AWCs to be supervised by an in-position supervisor
varies
considerably
(see Fig. 7.1)
ranging from
22 centers per
supervisor in
Goa to 322
centers     per
supervisor in
Bihar.      The
large number
of vacancies
of supervisors
and     CDPOs
and their heavy workloads (discussed in detail in HR) combined together considerably limit
the number and of quality visits to AWCs that they can undertake. Further, lack of vehicles
for supervisory visits, highlighted during and the added travel time due to use of public
transport for supervisory visits further limits their time for actual supervisory activities.

1.3.2. Lack of supervisory skills and supervisory tools is one of the key reasons for poor
supervision. The manner and quality of supervision in the ICDS discussed earlier, including
the lack of emphasis on the ‘support’ aspect of supervision and the lack of setting objectives
by supervisors is, among other factors, due to a lack of supervisory skills amongst managers.
During the FGDs, supervisors emphasized that their problem-solving and counselling skills
needed to be strengthened. The supervisory guidelines do not sufficiently strengthen
supportive supervision and, in fact, only focus on the number of visits to be undertaken.
There are no uniform and comprehensive checklists for supervisors or managers to guide
them in the critical areas to be supervised during visits to the AWCs. The analysis of the
training curriculum of CDPOs and supervisors also indicates that supportive supervision does
not get due emphasis.

1.3.3. The general weakness of supervision at all levels, starting at the top, contributes to
poor supervision in the system. If supervision by the supervisors at the AWC level is weak,
this is among other reasons, due to the fact that supervisors are themselves poorly supervised
by the CDPOs who, in turn, are not supervised well, or perhaps not at all, by the DPOs; this
sequence continues. There is a chain of causality: managers supervise subordinates on those
things which they are supervised on, and this happens all along the hierarchy. The lack of
supervision at each level indicates that the managers are detached from what is actually
happening in the field level.

1.4. The ICDS restructuring and the revised ICDS MIS emphasize the support aspect
of supervision as well as the right things to focus on. Recognizing the lack of support in


                                                 94
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



the supervision framework, the restructured ICDS proposes to strengthen ‘supportive
supervision’. The revised ICDS MIS system, with its focus on monitoring details of activities
carried out at the AWC, at the Village Health and Nutrition Day, including indicators of
behavior change will draw attention to these during supervisory visits, and the training
focuses on building an understanding of the content of monitoring and supervision, and the
reasons for this focus. With the aim to strengthen supervision, in the ICDS Mission, a cluster
office is proposed be set up in strategically located AWCs for managing a cluster of 17-25
AWCs. At present, the supervisor has not been assigned any specific office and performs the
work only by field visits made from block office. It is expected that, if strategically located,
the supervisor will be able to supervise and monitor the work of AWCs much better and also
become available to the AWWs for guidance and consultation. However, the focus of
supervision still continues to be ‘supervision of the AWW by the supervisor’ and not the
supervision of all levels in the chain. Besides, many constraints such as shortage of field
supervisory staff, CDPOs, supervisors and their workloads, and lack of transport remain
unaddressed.

To conclude, the ICDS is without a good, systematic, well-thought conceptual framework for
the function of supervision. Such a framework should not only distinguish between the
specific role of supervisors at the bottom of the pyramid and the generic task of supervision at
all levels of management, it should also provide guidance on what needs to be supervised at
each level. It must inform not only the supervisors about what to look at when they visit a
center, but also the CDPOs about what to look at when they supervise supervisors.

2. Accountability

In the context of management practices, accountability refers to the requirement of public
officials taking responsibility for their actions. It is defined as “a proactive process by which
public officials inform about and justify their plans of action, their behavior, and results and
are sanctioned accordingly” (World Bank, 2005). According to the World Bank (2003),
accountability is ensured when the incentives to service providers are aligned with the
ultimate preferences of citizens, and when providers are made directly accountable to people.

This section analyzes ‘accountability’ in the ICDS and NRHM and examines whether it is
practised as a good GMP and the extent to which officials in the ICDS and NRHM are held
accountable. It then suggests ways in which accountability could be strengthened.

Accountability Analytical Framework

From the management perspective, accountability must accompany responsibility and
authority. Officials are primarily accountable for: (a) their performance; and (b) their
conduct. Accountability for performance implies: (i) that officials are required to, and will,
give a full account of what and how they did whatever they did at work; and (ii) that they will
bear the consequences, that is if they behave or perform poorly they would have to pay a
price. It is not enough to follow the rules, because public officials can follow all of them and
still not act effectively enough to achieve the desired policy outcomes. Therefore,
individually accepting the responsibility for delivering the results agreed upon between
manager and employee forms an important aspect of accountability. A basic premise of
accountability for performance is that managers set priorities and objectives for individual
workers whom they supervise. Effective managers set periodic objectives or targets that are
based on the priorities of their organizations. Such objectives are clear and specific, time-


                                                 95
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



bound, measurable, and challenging yet realistic. As in the case of priorities, the objectives
ought to be result-oriented, implying that the required results must be expressed in
measurable quantities and qualities. If many, or most, managers do not insist on results, or if
it is just not the norm in an organization for managers to insist on results, then the
performance of the organization is likely to be modest, poor or approach failure.
Accountability for conduct implies ensuring that officials obey the law and do not abuse their
power. The most common types of abuse of power are: (i) corruption, which enriches public
officials; (ii) clientelism, which channels public resources unfairly to specific groups; and
(iii) capture, which provides rents to opportunistic economic actors.

Three requirements must be met in order to have accountability: (i) it should be clear to the
officials what they are accountable for. In other words, their performance objectives must be
spelt out very clearly and precisely; (ii) there must be good monitoring of their behavior and
performance; and (iii) misbehavior and poor performance must be penalized.

Findings

While, in principle, a formal system of accountability for conduct and for performance
exists in the Indian Public Service including the ICDS, in practice the tendency is to focus
more on rules and less on performance. In addition, the predominant emphasis is on
penalizing activities that breach the rules and result in poor performance and much less to
reward rule-based behavior and good performance.

2.1. The framework for ‘accountability for performance’ is not very well developed
in the ICDS and the related practices are weak. The exercise of performance-related
accountability is dependent on two other management practices: (i) the setting of clear
objectives and targets; and (ii) monitoring their achievement.

2.1.1 The practice of setting priorities or time-bound objectives or targets for individuals,
teams and managers and monitoring them is not prevalent in the ICDS and NRHM. During
the FGDs, some AWWs reported that no priorities were set for them by the CDPOs or
supervisors and hence they had to set their own priorities, while several AWWs mentioned
they were given priorities and objectives. However, these priorities were not consistent; they
listed all ICDS objectives and activities, or were often very general, such as “we have
nutrition-related priorities”. None of the AWWs described the objectives in terms of the
results or outcomes to be achieved. Interestingly, different AWWs, supervisors, CDPOs and
DPOs within the same districts reported these priorities in different order, clearly reflecting
the lack of a guiding and binding order of priorities. In the case of health, all participants
reported having priorities, which included everything that they were doing but had no
common list of priorities and no common order among them. A large number of AWWs
reported that they set their own targets for their centers, since their supervisors did not. As
with priorities, the targets that the AWWs set for themselves were described in terms of
activities. None of the targets were expressed in clear quantitative terms and were therefore
not measurable. To the extent that they were quantitative, they related only to the number of
beneficiaries that would receive services, the number of supervisory visits to be made, and
not to the results of services received.

2.1.2 There is no focus on holding the functionaries accountable for achieving the
outcomes. One of the most important requirements for improving nutrition is to hold all
functionaries, and not just the AWWs, accountable for the outcomes that improve the


                                                96
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



nutrition of children. Some of the most critical outcomes would be improvement in the
feeding and caring behavior of mothers and, ultimately, a reduction in the number of children
who are not growing well, whose nutrition status is not worsening, and an increase in the
number of undernourished children whose nutrition status is improving. If supervisors
focussed on these critical aspects, set objectives related to these and monitored the
achievements of related results, that is held the level below them accountable for the
outcomes and supported them in achieving these in the required ways, the focus would shift
from just counting the numbers to whom services were extended to achieving these
outcomes. For such a shift to occur, the ICDS’ accountability for the performance framework
must ensure a focus on results and not just processes.

2.2     The AWWs and the ANMs are generally held accountable for non-performance.
The CDPOs, supervisors and AWWs, all acknowledge their collective responsibility for
overall AWC performance, as is evident from the FGDs in Bihar and Tamil Nadu. However,
in reality, the AWWs are alone held responsible for non-performance, and face disciplinary
action. Supervisory visits by the officials are more authoritative than supportive, or guiding
in nature. Hence, supervisors and CDPOs fail to provide the necessary support to improve
AWWs and AWCs performance. Therefore, despite the acknowledgement of collective
accountability, the AWWs do not receive support in implementing the program and the
CDPOs and supervisors are not held accountable for their failure to provide the necessary
support.

2.3     Accountability for performance at the managerial and leadership levels is
particularly weak. While the overall accountability system for performance in the ICDS is
weak, the chain of accountability is particularly feeble when it comes to holding managers
and leaders accountable for their performance. Given that senior managers and leaders
manage functional areas and organizational units at the national, state, district or even block
level, their performance or non-performance is a matter of importance and can make large
scale differences to the results. Since they play an important role in providing direction,
managing the performance of hundreds of people whom they supervise, empower them,
motivate them, build their skills through training, ensure sound work practices and
procedures, and build organizational culture, it is indeed surprising that there are almost no
demands of accountability on the managers. The bulk of those who seem to be punished for
not following the rules or for poor performance are the AWWs at the AWC level. No
questions are put to managers and, more importantly, no action is taken when training targets
are not met, or when recruitments are inordinately delayed, or when supervision is inadequate
and program quality poor, and so on. If any questions are asked, these might only concern the
number of AWC visits made or not made by managers.

2.4     At the operational level, the aspect for which accountability is demanded is
submission of MPRs in time. There is a systemic culture of focusing on numbers and
AWWs, supervisors, CDPOs and DPOs all focus on activities that need to be reported in the
monthly reports. Timely MPR submission is given the highest priority at the field level. For
example, AWWs from Bihar reported that failure to submit monthly reports by the due date
resulted in threats of deduction of salary, providing a written explanation for the delay
(spashtikaran) or criticism in meetings which would be highly degrading or frustrating. As
discussed in the section dealing with supervision (see point 1.2.3), the focus of supervision
and monitoring is on filling up registers, collation of information and onward transmission,
and submission of reports in time. Accountability for accuracy of data, service quality and
meaningful results receives little emphasis.


                                                97
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity




2.4.1 There is little accountability for the data reported and the reliability of data
generated is questionable. Many reports, including those from the NRHM, suggest that the
ICDS reports on coverage, nutritional status and other parameters do not represent ground
realities (Planning Commission, 2011). The data from Bihar shows the same number of
beneficiaries for pre-school education (PSE) and supplementary nutrition (SNP) in three
consecutive years, whereas these are likely to be the targets provided and reflect a 100
percent coverage (2009, 2011 and 2012). In this regard, the field data indicated that providing
information that reflects, or may be interpreted as reflecting, implementation problems and
issues are generally not viewed kindly by the senior officials, and those who report this run
the risk of annoying them and being reprimanded. Therefore, instead of seeking support to
improve the outputs and outcomes of work, the subordinate staff tries to avert the risk of
being called to account by providing information that reflects positive numbers and progress
that superiors like to see. Reporting of challenges and problems is not encouraged.

2.5     Despite the system’s focus on ‘following the rules’, accountability for conduct is
generally poor. Several reports refer to corrupt practices in the ICDS, related particularly to
recruitment and the food meant for supplemental feeding (Planning Commission, 2011;
Report on Gram Sabha for Social Audit of ICDS Programme, 2007 and Citizen’s Initiative
for the Rights of Children under Six, 2006).While this study was not designed to examine the
issues of corruption, many references to corruption and irregularities were made by
respondents at all levels in the FGDs and interviews. Whereas the following points are made
in the context of the ICDS, the broader context of public accountability in India within which
the ICDS operates is relevant. Some arguments state that though de jure policies might
appear in place, yet in de facto implementation and delivery, there is rampant corruption,
absenteeism, indifference, incompetence, inefficiency or outright failure (Posani and Aiyar,
2009), and that the Indian state, its institutions, and the rules that govern them are structured
to avoid accountability altogether (Mehta, 2003 and Saxena, 2004).

2.5.1 Irregularities, corruption and rent seeking appear to be pervasive. Workers and
officials at virtually every level stated corruption as a key constraint to recruiting the right
kind of people, their motivation and commitment, and even in getting routine work
accomplished. To quote one such statement, “Money is collected at every level – for
appointments, transfers, even for cashing training vouchers at the treasury.” In Bihar, where
cash for purchase of food is sent to the AWCs, irregularities at all levels in the chain appeared
to be common. The AWWs even mentioned rent-seeking by the Pradhan’s of gram
panchayats, whose signatures are required to withdraw cash. False or doctored certificates
and mark sheets submitted by candidates at the time of application, bribes and political
interference were constraints to appointing qualified and competent personnel, and many felt
that an entrance test to test basic skills was necessary to ensure that the right persons got the
jobs.

2.5.2 Several initiatives to check leakages and enhance accountability have been made by
the MWCD and the states, particularly Bihar. Initiatives by some states to bring about
transparency include online publication of lists of applicants, along with their CVs, and the
results of the selection for the posts of supervisors, AWWs and helpers. A number of states
including Bihar, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have experimented with social audits to meet
the prime objective of making the ICDS system and administration transparent and
accountable. These audits have brought out the issues concerning leakages in food delivery,
poor AWC infrastructure, unethical working by the functionaries, low awareness among the


                                                 98
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



beneficiaries, delayed payments and many more. In Bihar, to enforce basic rules, such as
ensuring that AWCs open every day for the prescribed number of hours, and to curb
leakages, the state government instituted a system of unannounced spot checks at AWCs,
followed by severe action including suspension in the case of violations. As a result, a large
number of AWWs, some supervisors and CDPOs were suspended. While this resulted in
extensive improvements in ensuring that the AWCs opened daily and, as reported in an FGD
by a senior official, 85 percent of the AWCs are now open, at every level from the district to
the AWC, the officials appeared demotivated due to the environment of fear that had been
generated.

2.6     The restructured ICDS focuses on ways to strengthen accountability. One of the
goals of the ICDS Mission is to ensure good governance and accountability. The framework
proposes three key ways of enhancing accountability in the ICDS: (i) community based
monitoring and accreditation; (ii) internal monitoring; and (iii) concurrent external
monitoring. Direct accountability of the ICDS mission system to the community and
beneficiaries is envisioned through periodic public hearings and social audits. Besides,
periodic external, household and facility surveys along with supervision, missions are
proposed to track the effectiveness of ICDS activities and to monitor the outcomes. A
grievance redressal mechanism including redressal arrangements at village, block, district,
state and national level are broadly outlined and a web-enabled system is proposed to allow
beneficiaries to register their grievances. Evolving a transparent appointment and selection
policy is also proposed.

To sum up, despite the existence of a formal, largely punitive system on paper, there is in the
public service, and within it in the ICDS, a very high tolerance for misbehaviour and
ineffective performance. Corruption is pervasive and poor performance is widespread. Yet,
relative to the magnitude of corruption and poor performance in the ICDS, few in it are held
accountable. It is the worker at the bottom of the chain, the AWW who is usually held
accountable and faces action for non-performance or misconduct. The chain of accountability
at managerial levels is particularly weak. Poor accountability has led to a culture where non-
performance and inappropriate conduct are perpetuated. The tolerance for the non-
performance of managers has led to sub-optimal performance of the systems.

3    Work Practices and Procedures

In a large program such as the ICDS, where services are delivered through more than 1.3
million AWCs that serve as the service points, ensuring implementation of the program with
minimal variation across locations and multiple points, and delivering services of a defined
standard in an efficient and effective manner is both crucial and challenging. This requires
building up an understanding among all involved in program execution about what is to be
achieved and the manner of doing so. Therefore, it is critical that the ICDS defines and adopts
carefully designed work practices, processes and procedures that promote the maximum
possible efficiency and achievement of results.

The quality of the design of SOPs or work procedures can be indicators of capacity.
Productive practices, processes and procedures are likely to result in appropriate quantity and
quality of process outputs with given resources, thereby enhancing capacity, whereas poorly
designed and defined work procedures can constrain capacity.




                                                99
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



The literature on the analysis of the ICDS work practices and procedure is very scanty. This
chapter bases its analysis on data collected through FGDs conducted for this study and draws
heavily on the step-by-step analysis of work procedures in 2009-2010 by the CARE-USAID
Integrated Nutrition and Health Project (INHP) in Chhattisgarh (CG) and Andhra Pradesh
(AP), which was also updated in this study. The INHP undertook a work analysis related to
five key processes impinging on nutrition, namely, fixed nutrition and health days, prioritized
home contacts, structured sector meetings, supportive supervision and food commodity
supply chain management (only in AP), after which SOPs were developed, documented and
implemented on a pilot basis in selected districts of the two states. Andhra Pradesh
subsequently expanded the effort across the state.

3. Work Practices and Procedures Analytical Framework

Practice is the way of doing something, or the way of performing a given task. A process is a
set of related activities, actions and tasks directed towards a predetermined aim and carried
out in sequence step-by-step to produce a specific product or service. Procedure, also
referred to as SOP, is a prescribed or established process that is often written down for
ensuring uniformity in implementation.

Processes contribute to capacity when they are structured and sequenced in the most efficient
way, that is when they avoid waste of time and resources and use the least effort to produce
the best possible results. Capacity is a product of productive work, practices and processes,
and enhanced productivity leads to higher capacity. Procedures are descriptions of processes
and it is necessary to document these descriptions in order to minimize variations in
implementation across locations and thereby to enhance capacity across the program. Thus,
the quality of work processes and documented work procedures are significant in their
contribution to productivity, effectiveness and efficiency.

Findings

Work procedures in the ICDS are not satisfactorily designed and not compliant with good
work procedures. As a result, there are large variations in how activities are conducted,
particularly at the AWC and sector level, thereby affecting program quality and results.
The lack of established and documented procedures further leads to non-efficient use of
time and resources and a loss of productivity and capacity.

3.1     There is virtual absence in the ICDS of documented work processes and
procedures detailing how each activity is to be conducted. The nature and scope of the
activities that need to be conducted are not clearly determined, and if determined, are
sub-optimally or poorly designed.

3.1.1 Operational manuals and work procedures for ICDS activities and their sequence, in
which they need to be conducted, resources required, expected outputs and functionaries’
responsibilities have either not been defined or contain inadequate details and are poorly
designed. In the absence of defined work processes and procedures, AWWs and supervisors,
are left largely to conduct the activities based on their own understanding of what is to be
done, developed by reading official orders and guidelines, or through training programs, and
training material:




                                                100
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



       For instance, there is no step-by-step definition of what needs to be done, when and
by whom during monthly sector meetings, meetings that take up considerable time of all
AWWs and supervisors. At most sector meetings, a disproportionately large proportion of the
time is devoted to the preparation, review, and revision of AWC MPRs. Some AWWs
prepare and revise their individual reports with the help of the supervisor at the meeting,
resulting in wastage of the time of all others. The disproportionately large time spent on
MPRs also takes away from other important aspects of the sector meeting, such as discussion
of issues and problems, sharing program updates and guidance on performance. As a result,
the meeting does not accomplish its purpose. Had the procedure for conducting the sector
meeting been clearly defined and communicated across the program, it would have
contributed to greater efficiency and effectiveness in conducting sector meetings and
increased productivity throughout more than 50,000 sectors in the ICDS.
       Home visits conducted by the AWW for nutrition and health counselling is yet
another example where training material provides adequate information on prioritization of
beneficiaries for home visit, whom to interact with during the home visit and counselling.
This largely forms the basis upon which AWWs conduct home visits. However, there remain
several areas that are not well designed and defined. For example, the practice is to record
home visits in the AWW’s diary. However, because this manner of recording the home visit
does not allow for arranging pregnant women based on the expected date of delivery, it does
not help the worker in determining which women are to be visited on priority, nor is it helpful
in tracing the previous visit details, such as the counselling provided, and the areas for
follow-up, thus leading to loss of efficiency and effectiveness. A well-designed work
procedure would have taken these aspects into consideration and increased productivity and
increased capacity. Taking cognizance of this, the ICDS while revising their MIS has
included a home visit planner as one of the 11 essential registers and provided detailed
instructions on how and when to fill it (MWCD, 2012).

3.1.2 Government orders and guidelines, formats, registers, checklists often provide
the only definition of work procedures. Not being detailed enough, they are not the
equivalent of well-designed work procedures. Official orders and guidelines invariably are
policy directives and program guidelines that provide broad direction for the work or specify
norms, such as the number of beneficiaries, number of supervision visits to be undertaken and
so on. They do not holistically address: (i) the operational details and step-by-step description
of how the activities in a procedure are to be conducted; (ii) the sequence in which they need
to be conducted; (iii) the resources required; (iv) the expected outputs; and (v) the defined
responsibilities and authorities for ensuring uniformity in operation. Similarly, the definition
of work processes in most checklists and guideline formats is left to personal interpretation,
and therefore there is no uniformity in implementation, effectiveness and efficiency of ICDS
work processes across the program.
        An examination of how the VHND was conducted as part of the INHP work process
analysis in AP and CG showed that AWWs and supervisors showed that functionaries
undertook the various VHND activities based on their understanding of the VHND
guidelines. AWWs and supervisors were aware that the main aim of the VHND was to ensure
that beneficiaries who receive THR should also receive services, such as immunization,
ANC, NHEd and growth monitoring. In actual fact, however, there was considerable
variation and the VHND was being conducted in very many different ways. For example,
many AWWs gave THR to the beneficiaries as the first service, after which many
beneficiaries left the AWC without availing of the other services (food, being the most
tangible, is often valued more than the other services, and once received many beneficiaries


                                                 101
                                                Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



left), thus defeating the very purpose of the VHND. In other cases, the AWWs gave THR
only after immunization, ANC, NHEd and growth monitoring had been conducted, thus
ensuring that each service was delivered before the beneficiaries left the AWC. Many AWWs
also reported that a VHND had been conducted, even in instances when no health functionary
had attended the VHND and health services had not been delivered. In some places, the
AWWs prepared ‘due lists’ to track all children who needed to be immunized at a particular
VHND; in other instances, the AWWs relied only on their memory or the ANM’s
immunization register to track children who needed immunization on the VHND. In short,
there is no established most efficient and effective way to conduct VHNDs and ensure that
mothers and children receive the health and nutrition services that the ICDS and NRHM are
supposed to provide. Even today, in most places, at VHNDs, the full set of health and
nutrition services are not delivered and VHNDs are largely immunization and THR
distribution days, despite some detailed guidelines from the NRHM, MoHFW (2007).
        One well-designed procedure is the set of guidelines (Government of Odisha, 2011)
for the implementation of hot cooked meals and morning snacks for supplementary nutrition
under the ICDS and hot cooked meal for emergency feeding program in eight KBK districts26
of the state. Comprehensive operational details are provided for each activity for supplying
hot cooked meals for supplementary nutrition under the ICDS scheme. The guidelines
systematically include details related to feeding norms, weekly menus, ration sizes, quality
parameters, procurement procedure, composition of procurement teams that decide upon the
supplier and the price, checks on quality, the commodities provided under the central scheme
(like rice) and the ones that need to be procured locally, quantities to be procured, recipes and
their preparation, methods of funds provision, monitoring procedure, and formats for
recording data and information. The functionaries responsible have been identified, including
whom to contact in case of problems.

3.2    In the absence of documented SOPs for work processes, the implementation
quality is varied, and effectiveness and efficiency are both compromised.

3.2.1 The virtual absence of defined work practices and the inadequacy of those that do
exist, adversely affect the quality of service delivery at the AWCs. Hence, the functionaries
adopt their own way of doing things and delivering services, based on their own
understanding, skills, motivation and convenience. Data from the FGDs indicates that the
ICDS has defined the norms for service delivery of the nutrition service in this program for
ration size, type of food, number of home visits to be conducted by an AWW, frequency and
number of visits to the AWCs to be carried out by supervisors and CDPOs, growth
monitoring, and conducting VHND. However, the primary consideration is meeting the
numbers without much regard for the quality of service provided. There is more or less very
little attention to services where guidelines are minimal, such as referral services,
identification of undernourished children or those who are not improving or becoming
undernourished early, and the appropriate action needed. The variation reported by the
AWWs in the number of monthly home visits conducted is extremely large, ranging from 5-
50 in Bihar and from less than 50 to more than 150 in Tamil Nadu. If the procedure of a
home visit was well defined and documented, and there was a benchmark of the time to be
devoted to one home visit, it is possible that these variations would be minimized. It is
therefore clear that the ICDS operations are affected by the immense variability in the
execution of key activities, leading to ambiguity regarding which services are rendered and
which are not, and how they are rendered, thereby affecting service quality.

3.2.2 The absence of adequately defined work procedures also affects supervision and
monitoring. Well-designed work procedures serve as benchmarks for what constitutes an
acceptable way of accomplishing the procedure. These in turn are used by supervisors to
judge or measure how activities are being performed, identify specific steps in which
subordinates need support, based on which they are then able to provide that support rather
than give general advice. In other words, work procedures can strengthen both oversight and
support functions of supervision.

3.2.3 There are implications also for training. Well-defined work procedures can also serve
as guiding factors for the content of training programs that build skills. They help identify the
knowledge and skills required for conducting each step of a work procedure and clearly
indicate to trainers how each task is required to be accomplished, thus bringing more
specificity to hands-on training, as also to joint trainings which are a tool to improve
coordination.
3.2.4 Efficiency and productivity losses result from a lack of well-designed and documented
work procedures. In the absence of well-designed and documented procedures, functionaries
devise their own methodologies for carrying out assigned tasks based on their individual
understanding, background, skills, capacities, perceptions and experiences, and even
convenience. These methodologies may not be the most efficient, as in the case of sector
meetings and home visits discussed earlier. Further, the absence of a defined and documented
SOP for work processes is likely to be a major contributing factor for the observed variation
in the quantum of time spent on conducting ICDS activities by AWWs, such as
supplementary nutrition and home visits. For example, the range of time spent daily by the
AWWs for: (i) preparing and distributing supplemental food is 24-51 minutes; (ii) pre-
school education is 90-190 minutes; (iii) filling up records and registers is 12-99 minutes;
and (iv) conducting home visits is 34-63 minutes. Similar variations are also found in the
activities conducted by supervisors and CDPOs. These variations have a direct bearing on the
quality of services and work efficiency. The immense variability in time spent by the AWWs,
supervisors and CDPOs on different activities is discussed in detail in chapter 4, Availability,
Competence and Management of Human Resources in the System.

Clearly, efficiencies vary and one activity gets assigned more time at the cost of another,
perhaps more important one. In a program as large as the ICDS, there is simply no other way
of assuring efficiency and quality but by conducting a productivity analysis and designing
and defining appropriate work procedures, documenting and sharing them across
functionaries, supervisors, training institutions and trainers. This will lead to a common
understanding and operationalization of the ‘how’ aspect and enable working towards
efficiency gains as well as effective delivery of services.

4. Summary of Management Capacity Constraints

This section draws upon the analyses from the earlier chapters and summarizes the
management capacity issues in the ICDS. While the issues summarized here are examined in
detail in the individual functional areas, a discussion on these is highly pertinent in the
context of overall management.

The weak management capacity at all levels in the ICDS is one of the biggest constraints
limiting the functioning of other operational areas. This finding is significant and contrary
to the widely held view that the failure in the ICDS is at the level of the AWC and due to
the poor capacity of the AWW.

                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity




4.1. Lack of adequate human resource management structures have constrained the
ICDS capacity to deliver its services adequately and efficiently. There is shortage of staff
with required knowledge, skills and motivation; vacancies continue for prolonged periods at
the ICDS departments in the states and at the ICDS division in the MWCD. The recruitment
criteria that ICDS currently has are generic and are not suited to recruit people with right kind
of skill mix. The prime focus is to appoint trainable people whose skills and competencies
could build through on-the-job training.

4.2. Weak management structures for training at all levels have hindered the ICDS
system in building the knowledge, skills and competencies of its workforce. At the
national level, the management structure and thus the functions are split between the training
division at the MWCD and NIPCCD but it is unclear as to who is ultimately responsible for
planning, periodic reviews, monitoring and evaluation and follow-up actions. There is a
shortage of human resources for training management and the personnel are not clear of what
is expected of them in terms of training management. Further, there is a lack of conceptual
framework and vision, inadequate strategic planning and resource mobilization which
constrain the commensurate expansion and capacity building of the training system.

4.3. The data collected under ICDS MIS is neither analysed nor fully aligned with the
data needed for better operational decisions or to review progress towards achieving the
ICDS objectives. There is neither a dedicated leader nor dedicated functional home for M&E
and as a result, the ICDS MIS lacks an adequate conceptual framework for M&E functions,
data crucial to track the progress of nutrition activities and outcomes is not gathered and there
are issues regarding reliability of data and its minimal use.

4.4. Lack of other GMPs like setting of objectives, priority setting and empowerment
further constrain the ICDS to attain its ambitious mandate. Underlying all of these
management constraints are the key GMPs outlined in the framework besides the three
discussed, the others namely the setting of objectives, operational planning, empowering and
coordination are also key to contributing to the poor management capacity.

4.4.1. The practice of setting priorities or specific time bound objectives for individuals,
teams and managers is not prevalent in the ICDS. While some reported that no priorities
were set for them by their managers or supervisors and that they set their own priorities,
several mentioned that these were set. However, the priorities described were not consistent
and were described either in terms of priority groups to be served or in terms of activities to
be delivered. The setting of targets, while reported by some is however not a universal
practice followed by all managers in the ICDS and the NRHM. At each level of management,
while some functionaries did note that they/their managers do set objectives and targets, there
were respondents who reported that no targets were set for them by their own managers.
There is no focus on results, targets are not expressed in clear quantitative terms and are
therefore not measurable. To the extent that they are quantitative, they relate only to the
number of beneficiaries to receive services, the number of supervisory visits to be made and
so on, and not to the results of services received.

4.4.2. Operational planning is not undertaken at all levels and by all managers. Planning is
an essential part of management, and all managers at the operational level need to undertake
plans for the operational unit they manage. ICDS has been a centrally driven program with all
plans developed at the national level and there is little operational planning. Planning related


                                                 104
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



to organization of work, formation of teams, allocation and division of work are generally
defined centrally. Work planning, assignment and redistribution are undertaken to manage
the workload when vacancies exist or arise.

4.4.3. In public sector programs including the ICDS, authority is highly centralized and
there is virtually very little devolution of authority. Even if the senior managers want, they
cannot delegate authority, since rules do not permit it. Furthermore, seniors often do not
regard it important to give employees much information or share with them much analysis.
Subordinates, in turn, do not think they should solve problems. They push all problems
upward and expect their supervisors and managers to resolve them. Ability is constrained
because resources with people at every level to achieve their objectives are limited. Further,
the sheer volume of work and their time constraints (see chapter 4, Availability, Competence
and Management of Human Resources in the System) do not permit them the necessary time
to devote to support, mentor and coach those whom they supervise. Therefore, the majority of
the functionaries feel disempowered – neither do they have adequate opportunity nor the
ability. At each level, managers feel disempowered to motivate their staff, to manage
performance, to take initiative or to solve problems.

4.4.4. The management reforms proposed under the restructured ICDS include a focus on
decentralization. Recognizing the need to move away from the centralized nature of the
program, the shift towards decentralizes planning and management in the restructured ICDS
is indeed a very positive trend and presents a real opportunity to make this a key component
of the management reform. This, however, will need bold changes to the organizational
culture, including decentralization of decision making authority to local levels. Top leaders
must ensure that managers, especially at the district levels and below are required to develop
operational plans and held accountable for their implementation, provided the requisite skills
to do so, are empowered to make operational decisions and resolve problems. Not only will
this improve management of the program, it will also contribute to improving motivation,
empowerment, and accountability.

Recommendations
Many weaknesses in the implementation of the ICDS are due to the poor management
practices in the program. If not addressed, they will continue to severely constrain program
implementation, efficiency, productivity and quality of services. This is especially critical
given that in the restructured ICDS, a large number of managers will be recruited. Hence, it is
important that the quality of the overall program management system and culture, which is
dependent on GMPs, is transformed and upgraded. Keeping this in mind, the following
recommendations are worth considering by the ICDS:

1.      A management development program for all senior and mid-level managers at the
national level and state ICDS departments, and at the district level should be introduced. The
content should include all the key management skills, such as how to set result-based
objectives, how to develop operational plans, as well as the use of important techniques, such
as workload analysis, feasibility analysis, costing analysis and work process analysis.

2.     The ICDS leadership should ensure decentralization of management and require that
managers at all levels set annual objectives based on outputs and results as well as develop
operational plans for their areas. Leaders should assign responsibilities to higher level
managers to monitor and ensure that this is done, appraise lower level managers and their


                                                105
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



subordinates, based on these objectives, and then implement this performance management
system right through the ICDS. This will enhance accountability for performance in a cost-
effective manner.

It is critical to design and implement a program aimed at improving supervision over the next
few years. The program should include: (i) appointment of a high-level program manager to
oversee and manage the entire program for the period; (ii) development of a conceptual
framework for the nature, role and scope of supervision, which will include the right kind of
data needed to carry out such supervision and will specify the skills and competencies needed
for supervisions and, thus, the kind of training that supervisors would need to get; (iii)
development of, if necessary through a series of pilots, a sound procedure for supervision
that must be followed by all supervisors; (iv) an analysis of the efficiency gains in making
supervisory visits by provision of transport facilities to supervisors and assessment of relative
costs appointing large numbers additional supervisors and provision of transport; (v)
identification of the most important data required to be collected during supervision,
development of the data collection system for this and the individual reports to be produced
by each supervisor; (vi) development of district, state and national summary supervision
reports that focus on key national trends and are provided periodically to top management at
each of these levels; and (vii) training of all supervisors and then launching the system.

3.       Although the restructured ICDS has defined a framework to enhance accountability, it
still has a long way to go. A change of culture that values accountability and embraces good
management practices to enhance accountability is required. Building accountability that
relies on civic engagement in which ordinary citizens and civil society organizations
participate directly or indirectly in extracting accountability from the government is the key.

One example of a social accountability mechanism which is grounded in a positive-sum,
rewards-based view of accountability is the Citizen Report Card. The use of this instrument is
on the rise throughout the world. In recent years, the system of report cards has been
supported by the World Bank in Uganda, Albania, the Philippines, and Peru. This system has
also been adopted by municipal presidents in the Ukraine and numerous cities in India. The
experience that began this energetic innovation is the scorecard organized by the Public
Affairs Center (PAC) in Bengaluru in 1994, and then repeated in 1999 and 2003. Steps in
planning and organizing a report card are described in (India: Public Affairs Center, 2005)
and include strengthening leaders at the local level and strengthening Panchayati Raj
Institutions (PRI) to make the system more effective, transparent and accountable for delivery
of services, so that workers can be held responsible for their actions or for non-performance.

4.      In order to ensure efficiency in program implementation and enhance the quality and
effectiveness of service delivery and the predictability of results across the program, it is
imperative that the ICDS embark on a productivity improvement campaign. This will involve
getting specialists to analyse all processes and procedures and improve or totally re-design
them if necessary, taking into account all financial and other constraints, and document them
as SOPs. The SOPs will not only inform the functionaries as to what is expected from the
process, but also serve as ready reckoners for them in conducting their activities effectively
and efficiently, and as benchmarks for supervision. A beginning in this direction has been
made by the ICDS in AP and CG, and can be further built upon. The ICDS should adopt this
strategy of defining and documenting the work and management processes across the
program, while allowing for local flexibility. It will also be important to periodically review
the documented SOPs for their applicability, appropriateness and adequacy, and develop and


                                                 106
                                    Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



update these when changes or new activities are introduced or when a better way of doing the
same thing is found. However, to avoid confusion, all updating must ensure that at any point
of time only one SOP exists.

5.       Given the huge scale of its operations, the ICDS should consider introducing an audit
program as a tool for monitoring and verifying the effective implementation of policies and
documented SOPs. Audit conducted by trained and competent personnel is a systematic,
independent and documented process for obtaining verifiable audit evidence relevant to the
set of policies, SOPs and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which they have
been fulfilled. Establishing such a system will require assigning the responsibility for
managing audit programs, establishing audit program objectives, coordinating auditing
activities and providing sufficient audit team resources.

As mentioned in the GMP framework, most of the GMPs are inter-related and aim at bringing
about significant changes required in the management of the ICDS. Simultaneous work on
all these GMPs is necessary. The organizational culture will remain a critical underlying part
of the improvement in the GMPs.

               Annex 1: Detailed capacity assessment analytical framework

Capacity area: Division of Labor
From a management point of view full functional clarity as to the nature and scope of each
role, function and task is essential to achieving results, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
This means that all functions must be identified, developed, grouped appropriately and
assigned to units or individuals, in a way that ensures that there are no functional splits, gaps
or overlaps as these result in poor performance.

The design of work and its division among organizations, or organizational units ought to
follow certain rules and the extent to which they are followed impacts capacity. The extent to
which certain rules of DoL are being met are indicators of DoL constraints.

 Functional gaps exist when an important role/function/task is not being carried out and/or
led and managed by any agency or organizational unit. They constrain capacity just like the
lack of an organizational home. Functional gaps become capacity constraints because there is
no unitary command and it is difficult to retain overall accountability for the function.
Unclear division of work leads to misinterpretation of the responsibilities of others, or
conscious decisions to let others take action resulting in frequent functional overlaps, gaps
and conflicts.

 Functional splits or fragmentation occur when tasks or functions that belong together
into one role and placed in one organization are divided among several roles and placed in
several organizations/units. Because it is difficult to get an overall picture of the function due
to its fragmentation, it often becomes difficult to coordinate it due to the large number of
‘fragments’. In some instances, fragmentation is technically not feasible, such as when the
volume of additional work or coordination effort required to produce the output outweighs
the benefit of splitting the task/function, fragmentation is best avoided. In others,
fragmentation is unavoidable or may even be necessary, in which case any constraints to
capacity can be overcome by excellent coordination ensured by putting in place all the
mechanisms and work practices required to do so.

 Functional overlaps exist when several agencies or organizational units carry out the
same role/function/task and serve the same clients or group of clients. They constrain
capacity since they result in role conflicts, duplication of effort, under-utilization of
resources, wastage and higher costs.

Functional overlaps are acceptable, and not considered a constraint when a country is divided
into geographical regions and the delivery of services is based on it, or in decentralized
systems when there are many field agencies/offices with identical functions, but they serve
different groups or geographically separate populations, and there is no duplication of effort.
On the contrary, they can improve capacity if, and only if (a) they have identical norms and
standards, and resources based on identical (or justifiably different) norms and (b) they are
well coordinated and well monitored from a central/national agency/office.

 Coordination within and among organizations is necessary. It becomes a capacity
constraint when coordination is difficult or is lacking as a result of which significant
inefficiencies and wastage occur, for which it is not possible to hold any organization,
organizational unit, or individual staff members accountable.

                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity




 Functional differentiation: It is important for a function to have an organizational home
or unit and clear leadership. When a function has an organizational home and leadership,
there is a better chance that the leader will: formulate a conceptual framework, a
vision/mission, and a strategy for it; develop plans for its implementation; apply standards
and norms to it; guide, monitor and control its execution; and enforce accountability for it.

 Functional overload happens when too many functions are placed in one organizational
unit. People who are carrying out other functions in this unit can also carry out these
functions efficiently, but they fail to do so because of time constraints.

 Functional fog refers to cases where the roles/ functions/ tasks are not defined and
worded well enough, letting managers interpret the role/ function/ tasks of their organization/
unit themselves, the way they see it and/or want it to be.

Capacity area: Leadership

The five key tasks of leadership are: (i) provide direction to the sector or organization and
define its future in terms of desired outputs; (ii) develop strategies for achieving the desired
outputs, ensuring that these are followed by careful planning; (iii) mobilize people and other
resources for the implementation of the strategies and plans; (iv) continually articulate and
communicate the direction, strategies and plans; and (v) ensure unity of effort and keep
organizations in the sector, and people in the organizations on track, pursuing the direction
given.

The extent to which each of these tasks is carried out can serve as an indicator of leadership
capacity.

The tools that leaders use to provide direction are conceptual frameworks, vision, mission
and strategies. The existence of effective written statements of vision, mission and strategy
are also indicators of the strength of leadership (see Box 3.1 for definition of effective vision,
mission and strategy statements). Awareness of the importance of these tools, and the ability
to formulate and use them are therefore necessary.

Effective leaders develop comprehensive conceptual frameworks for the sector or each
important function or problem that needs to be resolved. These articulate the working
hypotheses of dealing with a complex phenomenon – a system, process, function or behavior.
The working hypotheses describe, in particular, the structure of the phenomenon, its building
blocks, the relationships in the building blocks, and the manner in which they work
individually and collectively.

Vision, mission and objectives are not mere statements, but critical assertions of what any
organization aspires to achieve, and these define for each person within the agency the
purpose of their work, as well as the role each has to play in helping the organization achieve
its mission. Therefore, communication of the vision, mission and strategy are important and
effective leaders continually communicate the direction that they want the organization to
follow, explaining the strategies behind their plans, the visions behind their strategies and the
conceptual frameworks behind their visions. They incorporate messages of direction in daily
briefings, utilizing every opportunity to link the specifics of a situation with the bigger
picture. Not only do effective leaders talk about the direction, they also demonstrate their


                                                 114
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



commitment to it by personal example and resource allocation. This helps bridge the gap
between organizational strategy and the objectives of the average employee, often referred to
as the strategy-performance gap. Research indicates that less than 10 percent of strategies are
effectively executed, one of the reasons for the gap being insufficient communication and
articulation of strategy (Kaplan and Norton, 1996).

Capacity area: Human Resources in the System

The combined effect of three key factors, namely the size of the workforce, its knowledge
and skills and level of motivation, enables or constrains an agency’s ability to function
effectively and achieve its mandate. These are described below.

1.   Size of workforce
An optimum number of people must be available to accomplish the volume of work
necessary for achieving an agency’s mandate. While too few will lead to compromises in the
quantity and quality of work, too many will lead to inefficiencies. The number of persons
required to carry out the functions and tasks necessary to fulfil the organization’s goals is
determined by two factors, namely workload and efficiency. Workload is the amount of work
that an individual worker, a group of people, or an organization must carry out in a given
time, to fulfill the expectations set out in the vision, mission, strategies and plans of the
organization. Efficiency refers to the extent to which time, effort and resources are used well,
that is without wastage. Therefore, staff planning and specifying norms for the number and
ratio of staff at each level is an important HR management function. Effective management
of this function requires that the number of staff be fully aligned with workloads and be based
on systematic and objective analysis of workloads at each level or unit.

2.   Knowledge and skills
Adequate knowledge and the right mix of skills are required to carry out each function or task
effectively. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, ‘knowledge’ refers to the
information possessed, while ‘skill’ refers to the ability of using knowledge and applying it in
a given context. Effective management involves selecting people with the right mix of
knowledge and skills and developing their knowledge and skills to the desired level to enable
them to carry out the tasks effectively and efficiently. Therefore, specifications of knowledge
and skills for each category of workers and managers must be identified and then used to
guide recruitment norms and criteria, and to inform training programs. In the ICDS context,
where recruitment criteria are quite generic and the program relies heavily on the training
system to impart the requisite knowledge and build the necessary skills of its workforce.
Therefore, given the critical importance of training, it is dealt with in a separate chapter as a
sub-system of HR.

3.   Motivation
People must be motivated to achieve their goals. Motivation is the drive, internal or external,
that leads individuals towards their goals (Singh and Tiwari, 2011). Motivation is goal-
directed, and therefore cannot remain outside the goals of any organization whether public,
private, or non-profit (Olajide, 2000). Clarity of roles and objectives, access to knowledge
and resources, remuneration, physical conditions at work and organizational culture are some
of the factors that affect a worker’s motivational levels. Organizational culture plays an
important role in enhancing the motivational levels of individuals. A culture that provides to
individual workers objectives and priorities that are seen as important and challenging,


                                                 115
                                      Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



provides a sense of forward momentum for progress, promotes trust, respect and
communication between managers and subordinates and encourages constructive feedback
can contribute significantly to enhancing motivation. Lack of motivation can be a capacity
constraint since it leads to under-utilization of human talent and resources and unutilized
capacity.

Capacity area: The Training Sub-System

Training forms a very important component of human resource development, performance
and motivation. Three elements are critical for effective training, namely: the availability of
training that is timely and adequate in quantity, is relevant, and of high quality. This chapter
analyses each of these elements in detail to examine the constraints that limit the capacity of
the ICDS training system.

Availability of adequate training essentially includes two aspects to meet the needs of
trainees: (i) timely initial training; and (ii) periodic training provided subsequently.
Training is considered adequate when the initial training, referred to as orientation and on-job
training, is provided in a timely manner to newly recruited personnel, and thereafter provided
periodically at specified intervals or to meet special training needs to enhance skills and
competencies and build new skills and knowledge. Provision of initial training in time is
important because, if delayed, the personnel will work inefficiently and acquire sub-optimal
or dysfunctional work habits and practices that may have to be undone, thereby making
subsequent training much more difficult.

The relevance of training depends on the extent to which its content matches the skill gaps of
the trainees. This requires a job analysis to understand the knowledge, skills and
competencies required for each job category, and an assessment of entry level skill gaps of
trainees. The curriculum and content of training should be based on this analysis.
Quality is the extent to which relevant content is taught and actually learnt by the trainees and
the extent to which training helps them in skill development. Teaching and learning are two
different dynamic processes and teaching does not automatically lead to learning (Vermont
and Verloop, 1999). While the former essentially aims to transmit knowledge from an
external source to the learner, the latter is an active, constructive, and self-directed process in
which learners build up internal knowledge or personal interpretations of their learning
experiences (Bednar et al, 1991). The ability of instructors to transmit knowledge and the
readiness of the functionaries to imbibe, retain, and use this knowledge is therefore vital for
high-quality and effective training.

Capacity area: Monitoring, Evaluation, and the Management of Information in the
Nutrition System

The KM function encompasses capturing, analysing, developing, sharing, and effectively
using organizational knowledge. The purpose of KM is to provide direction that is to
formulate the conceptual framework, vision, mission, policies, and strategies, in order to
obtain and allocate financial and other resources, for the development and implementation of
plans or programs, to exercise accountability or for research. The information may also be
used to validate the need for change.

                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



Monitoring is a generic management process for exercising control in organizations and to
ensure that activities are implemented according to the operational objectives, design and
plan, and are ‘on track’. Therefore, a prerequisite for effective monitoring is that at the
operational level, there should be clear objectives and plans against which progress can be
compared. Monitoring in the absence of these is meaningless.

Monitoring takes place at multiple levels of management. Supervisors are expected to
monitor the workers and the activities under them; mid-level managers are supposed to
monitor the supervisors, senior managers have to monitor the mid-level and top-level
managers, who are the leaders in their organizations, are required to monitor the organization
and its operations as a whole. Nevertheless, the focus differs at each level. Usually, at the
lower and mid-level, the focus of monitoring is mainly on exercising control, whereas at the
higher levels, the focus is on assessing what changes might be required.

Evaluation is used to draw conclusions, its purpose being to improve operations or change
course. Evaluation provides the basis for adaptation and change in strategy either to improve
operations or, where the original objectives, design and plan are not achieving the desired
outcomes, to identify the changes needed for achieving them.

Management of information refers to the gathering of data required for monitoring and
evaluation, and its organization, processing, and analysis for monitoring and course
correction if needed.

Monitoring and evaluation are inter-related. There can be no evaluation without monitoring,
whereas there can be monitoring without evaluation. The key points pertaining to the
differences and inter-relationship between monitoring and evaluation are:
       The data required for evaluation does not fully overlap with the data required for
monitoring, because the questions the two seek to answer are different. Usually, many of the
evaluation questions focus on outputs and outcomes while almost all questions in monitoring
focus on inputs, process, and action. Monitoring must focus also on results that can be
measured over the short term as these are early warning signals that can lead to corrective
action, but not to changes in vision, policy, and strategy.
       Much of the data collected for monitoring can be used to explain the conclusions
reached in evaluation. However, there is invariably a need for additional, less frequently
collected data that must focus on the intended medium to long-term results, or outcomes, the
cost at which these are achieved and the unintended results.
       For monitoring, where the objective is to control operations, the data needs to be
collected and analysed on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. On the other hand, for the
evaluation of outcomes, policies and strategies to see whether the vision is being attained, the
data needs to be collected and analysed much less frequently, since it takes a long time to
produce and observe a change in outcomes. The methods and techniques for data collection
and analysis differ for monitoring and evaluation.

It is thus paramount that the monitoring and evaluation framework differentiates between: (i)
the information and data to be monitored for control of activities and for evaluating results;
(ii) the frequency at which it is to be collected, analysed, and used; (iii) the users of the
information ; and (iv) what information will be analysed by whom and used in which manner.




                                                 117
                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



Clear targets for both short-term objectives and long-term goals that provide the interface
between the overall strategy and policy need to be set. The objectives of the organization
should be clearly articulated and made known to all functionaries responsible for performing
activities and to those monitoring the performance.

Monitoring has a cost: both a financial cost and an opportunity cost. The financial cost refers
to the money spent on collecting, collating, storing and analysing the data, writing and
disseminating the reports; the opportunity cost refers to the time spent by all the people doing
this work, as well as all the recipients of the reports, who have to spend time reading the
reports, perhaps at the cost of doing more productive work. This is particularly true when
data is collected and little or nothing is done with it. Monitoring without follow-up, that is
taking corrective action is useless. The cost is determined, among other factors, by the scope
and quantity of data gathered, the frequency of its collection, the extent of analysis and its
distribution. The cost may become very high if too much data is collected, if the data is
collected too frequently, and if it is disseminated too widely, both horizontally and vertically.
Frequently collected operational data, aimed at controlling operations, is needed at the
operational levels of an organization and not at policy and strategy levels.

Capacity area: General Management Practices

(1)    The setting of objectives: At the individual worker or manager level, this is part of the
system of accountability for performance and is hence discussed in detail in the
accountability section. It differs from the setting of objectives at the organizational level,
which is part of the leadership discussion.

(2)      Operational planning: Operational plans are based on a clear definition of the
mission, specifying quantitative and qualitative targets, as well as timelines. These entail a
step by step analysis, description and timing of all key steps leading to the fulfilment of
targets.

(3)     Empowering: For the managers and workers to achieve these objectives, it is
important to develop people, (i.e., to train, mentor and coach them) and to give them the
opportunity and the ability to achieve certain objectives. Giving them the opportunity means
giving them the responsibility and authority to do certain things (responsibility is often given,
but not authority). Giving them the ability means giving them the necessary resources –
financial, physical and human – needed to achieve the objectives, and to develop them to
achieve personal mastery.

(4)     Coordination: This essentially involves establishing clearly who does what and who
is dependent on whom for what actions and then ensuring that each dependent and
interdependent action is taken. Coordination is discussed in detail in the Chapter 2, The
Nutrition Service Delivery System and Division of Labor within the System.

(5)     Supervision: The supervision of managers and workers combines two main elements,
namely oversight and support. Oversight refers to the activity of watching the performance of
subordinates when they carry out operations, for the purpose of control. Support refers to the
activity of providing subordinate staff with guidance, and coaching, mentoring and
motivating them. Most of the time, support is given as an integral part of oversight (see
section on supervision for a more detailed framework).



                                                 118
                                                     Institutional Arrangements for Nutrition in India: an Assessment of Capacity



(6)     Accountability: This refers to the practice of requiring officials to take responsibility
for their actions. Officials are primarily accountable for: (i) their conduct; and (ii) their
performance (see section on accountability for a more detailed framework).

(7)     Sound work processes and procedures: This is essential to achieve results with
maximum efficiency. Practice is the way of doing something, that is, what we do, when we
perform a given task and how we do it. Process is a set of actions and tasks directed towards a
predetermined aim and carried out in sequence, step by step. Procedure is a prescribed or
established process, also referred to as establishing SOPs (see section on work practices and
procedures for a more detailed framework).

The management practices in these seven categories are highly interdependent; while
analytically distinct, in practice they are interwoven. This means not only do they influence
each other but are often also practised together. To illustrate this point, empowerment
improves the capacity to deliver services not only directly, but also indirectly since it
motivates people to perform better. The setting of clear, measurable objectives improves the
capacity to deliver services not only by providing clear direction for action, but also by
making it possible to hold workers and managers accountable.

None of the management practices included in the seven categories can alone greatly enhance
or constrain capacity. It is the cumulative effect of many or all of them together that results in
significantly enhanced or constrained capacity. The setting of clear and measurable objectives
has little effect on capacity without empowerment, and empowerment has little effect without
motivation. Likewise, motivation has little effect without empowerment and monitoring has
little effect without accountability. Hence, management practices are a bundle of
interconnected, often inseparable, ways of managing. They are the “small forces that can
together result in dramatic change.”27

Annex 3: Nutrition conceptual framework, vision, mission, and strategies in some states

HARYANA              Haryana has a two-fold nutrition strategy, planned and implemented in January 2003:
                     (i): improving the nutritional status of moderately and severely malnourished children (0-6
                     years), by continuous monitoring of the weights of children, targeting severely
