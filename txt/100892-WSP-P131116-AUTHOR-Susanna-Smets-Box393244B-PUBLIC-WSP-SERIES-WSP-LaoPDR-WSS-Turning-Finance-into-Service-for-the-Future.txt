Water Supply and
Sanitation in
Lao PDR
Turning Finance into
Services for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies at national
and provincial level as well as development partners. A core team drawn from the Ministry of Health (Department of Hygiene
and Health Promotion, Department of Planning and Finance, National Center for Environmental Health and Water Supply)
and Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Department of Finance, Water
Supply Regulatory Office) have been key partners with the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in analyzing the sector. The
authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by Department of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Planning and
Investment, WHO, UNICEF, Plan International, JICA, UN-Habitat, SNV, AFD, Lao Red Cross, Care International in Lao PDR,
Health Poverty Action, Helvetas, Nam Theun 2, CAWST, Child Fund and World Bank.

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment in East Asia and Pacific is Susanna Smets. The following World
Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process and report:
Jeremy Colin, Sandra Giltner, Viengsamay Vongkhamsao, Bounthavong Sourisak, Viengsompasong Inthavong, Almud Weitz
and WSP support staff.

The following World Bank staff and sector colleagues peer reviewed the report: William Rex, Lead Water Resources Spe-
cialist, Ingo Wiederhofer, Senior Operations Officer, Thea Bongertman, WASH Sector Leader, SNV Lao PDR, and John Mc-
Gown, Sr. WASH Advisor Plan International, Lao PDR.

WSP’s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is working with governments and the local private sector to develop the knowledge needed
to scale up rural sanitation for the poor. The programmatic approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), be-
havior change communication, and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand and build up the supply of sanitation
products and services at scale. In addition, WSP works with local and national governments and the local private sector to
strengthen the enabling environment—including institutional, regulatory, financial, service-delivery, and monitoring capacities—
to achieve change that is sustainable. Starting in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania in 2006, Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is currently
being implemented in more than a dozen countries. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/scalingupsanitation.

This Working Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase project findings, assessments, and les-
sons learned in the Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage the
exchange of ideas about development issues. For more information please email worldbankwater@worldbank.org or visit

The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Group’s Water Global Practice, sup-
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-

   Sector-wide
   •	 Identify funding sources for implementation of the Water Supply Sector Investment Plan 2012-2020 (for the urban sub-
      sector) and the National Plan of Action for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene.
   •	 Strengthen sector monitoring and government-donor coordination through Joint Annual Sector Reviews (for urban and
      rural). These would focus on key indicators relating to sector goals; equity in the allocation of sector funding; the effective-
      ness of implementation processes; outcomes achieved including the quality and functionality of facilities and services.
   •	 Establish a formally recognized sub-Technical Working Group on WASH, to allow for high level coordination between
      government and development partners, under the Health TWG.
   •	 As part of sector investment plans, introduce consolidated monitoring of sub-sector funding from multiple sources, both
      government and external, including creating a dedicated budget line for WASH in the national budget.
   •	 Develop an overarching WASH policy for both urban and rural areas and include a budget line for WASH in national budget.




   Rural Water Supply
   •	 Develop National Centre for Environmental Health and Water Supply (Nam Saat) capacity to implement the National Ac-
      tion Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene by increasing staffing at district level and providing customized
      technical and capacity building support.
   •	 Develop and test strategies to improve the sustainability of existing rural water supply schemes (for example, by profes-
      sionalizing management and providing technical support to operators).
   •	 Address inequalities by prioritizing investments and service delivery to underserved poor and remote communities.




   Urban Water Supply
   •	 Create incentives and obligations for water utilities to improve services by increasing their operational and financial au-
      tonomy; strengthening regulation and monitoring (including the use of performance contracts); and allowing tariffs to
      reach commercially viable levels.
   •	 Create a more enabling environment for utilities to access private sector finance (for example, by providing government
      guarantees).
   •	 Invest in capacity building of utility staff including support to the formulation and implementation of business plans.




   Rural Sanitation and Hygiene
   •	 Develop a national rural sanitation and hygiene program based on tested operational approaches, with clear implementa-
      tion guidelines, a financing strategy, human resource and monitoring frameworks to scale up rural sanitation.
   •	 Urgently increase Nam Saat operational funding and district-level staffing to enable their active engagement in sanitation
      and hygiene promotion at scale.
   •	 Improve access to affordable and desirable latrines by encouraging private sector involvement in developing the sanita-
      tion market.
   •	 Develop and test incentives and delivery mechanisms to better reach poor and remote under-served communities.




   Urban Sanitation and Hygiene
   •	 Clarify institutional roles and responsibilities relating to the management of urban wastewater and on-site sanitation facili-
      ties.
   •	 Identify funding for a Wastewater Management Strategy and Investment plan to complement the Urban Water Supply
      Strategy, under the 2013-2020 Strategic Framework for the Water and Sanitation Sector.
   •	 Develop and test operational approaches for improved fecal sludge management (including collection, transport, treat-
      ment and disposal).
   •	 Build capacity for implementation of the wastewater management strategy.

b Public Expenditures include domestic (government sources) and external sources (development partners, NGOs and private sector); see table 3 below
c Household investment is calculated as a user share leveraged by government capital expenditure, which is likely to be small, especially for onsite sanitation. Actual future household
investment would largely depend on the ability to elicit household financing in facilities through community mobilization and demand generation, so-called “software” spending.

    a External Investment: While there is NGO investment in water supply, it was not possible to determine the investment amount comprehensively, since many small NGOs operate ‘off
    budget’. Most NGO expenditure in sanitation, especially in rural sanitation, is on non-capital spending (‘software’), and an estimated amount has been included for capital spending. There
    appear to be several projects whose financing source is private, however these amounts were difficult to determine and hence might be underestimated.
