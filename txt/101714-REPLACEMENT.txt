The case studies in this series are focused solely on what specific cities did well that subsequently contributed to high rates of
economic growth during a particular period. These case studies should not be mistaken for investment climate reports, as the con-
straints, problems and flaws of cities are not covered. Studies should also not be considered an exhaustive list of all of the factors
that contributed to growth in a city; because while some external or national level factors are highlighted, the studies were not in-
tended to document or list every contributing factor. The studies focus on the local economic development actors within a city and
address what these actors did well. Particular attention was paid to initiatives that were uncommon and/or carried out in a unique
manner that could be of interest or assistance to other cities.

    Santander has used its oil revenues to bolster education,
    public health, and reduce poverty, instead of building
    mega-monuments or flagship facilities, or losing the
    funds to corruption. Far from turning Santander into a
    petro-state, hydrocarbons have helped the development
    of innovative technologies, companies, and know-how
    directly benefiting economic growth and diversification,
    while also alleviating pressure on public finances. The
    typical pitfalls were avoided through a combination of
    increased transparency, an improving security situation
    in Colombia, public “watchdog” activities by the Chamber
    and other actors, and closer scrutiny and demands by the
    department’s citizenry at large.

Santander’s International Trade

Santander Department, of which Bucaramanga is the capital, only ranks as Colombia’s 11th largest exporter, despite having the
country’s 4th largest GDP. Santander’s annual export volume, particularly to neighboring Venezuela, has fluctuated quite a bit in
recent years. However, Santander’s share of Colombia’s total exports has held fairly constant.

Santander’s Exports to Venezuela

Trade with neighboring Venezuela merits separate examination, given its traditional importance to Bucaramanga’s small manu-
facturers as their primary export market. Due to deteriorating political relations between the two countries, Santander’s exports
to Venezuela plunged from about a third of a billion dollars in 2009, to almost nothing in 2010. Since then, there has been a slow
rebound in bilateral trade between the two neighbors, benefitting Santander’s economy (mostly meat producers).

Excerpt from Santander’s Regional Competitiveness Plan

Santander’s Regional Competitiveness Commission was the first one in the country to create a strategic plan for its region. In
addition to being a pioneering effort, the plan and its implementation are often cited around Colombia as an example of the
successful regionalization of the national economic competitiveness agenda – selecting those aspects of it that apply to a given
department. The 25-year Regional Competitiveness Plan for Santander was formulated in 2007, then updated in 2012.




To help make Santander the most competitive department in the country by 2032, three “strategic pillars” were identified to drive
its economic development: cluster development; formalization and entrepreneurial development; and internationalization. These
pillars were supported by four cross-cutting “strategic lines” enabling them: infrastructure; the development of science, technol-
ogy, and innovation; metropolitan integration and strengthening; and government transparency and efficiency. Below is a closer
look at these pillars and strategic lines, and how they were implemented as priorities identified in the strategic plan.




                                                                                                                     27

that other cities and countries within the region enjoy; like
abundant land and natural resources, cheap energy, transport
linkages, a flagship university or anchor investments. Above

In March 2001, Rwanda began to decentralize au-

government is broken down into 4 units: provinces, districts,
sectors and cells.

•	    Provinces: Rwanda is currently divided into 4 prov-
      inces plus the City of Kigali. While the City of Kigali is
      relatively smaller than the other provinces in terms of
      population, it is more drastically small in terms of land,
      accounting for only 730 km2 (compared to an average
      of 6,000 km2 among the other 4 provinces). Provinces
      are expected to help execute central government plans,
      as well as supervise and coordinate among the districts
      under their administration. The provinces are each gov-

Conclusion

The City of Kigali enjoyed a rapid increase in jobs and
GDP because of a combination of both national and
municipal level factors. At the outset, it is clear that Kigali
did well because of Rwanda’s national level improvements.
As the country’s capital it benefited immensely from national
policies that unlocked constraints to investment and private
sector growth. Rwanda is one of the world’s 10 fastest grow-
ing economies94 and Kigali, as the center of economic activity
in the country, is growing quickly as a result. However, as
explained above, Kigali’s growth cannot be attributed solely
to national level policies, as the city focused on supplement-
ing national level efforts with those of its own.

However, Kigali still has a long path ahead of it, with
numerous challenges that remain unaddressed. Kiga-
li’s success is remarkable because of the high rates of growth
despite a (relatively recent) turbulent history. However, the
country is still considered a low income country (with GDP
per capita rates of only $1,380 in 2012), and despite the ef-
forts highlighted above, there are several issues that remain.
For instance, many local private sector firms still struggle to
remain competitive and few, if any, have had international
success. Further, despite Kigali’s “liveable” traits, the city
lacks sufficient affordable housing for local residents. Thus,
Kigali has not yet become a middle income country, but the
strategies and policies that it has used have helped it to grow
at remarkable rates.




According to investors, what attracted them most to Kigali was:

•	   Good business environment, commitment to reforms

•	   Increasingly attractive market- few monopolies, clear land rights and investment opportunities

•	   Cleanliness and safety that set it apart within the region

•	   Lack of corruption (and overall good governance)

And why investors ultimately invested in Kigali was because:

•	   Responsive professionals in key offices (RDB, Kigali One Stop Shop)

•	   National and city plans signified a long-term commitment and clear opportunities to invest

Gaziantep is relatively unusual in Turkey in its effec-
tive use of a City Council structure. National legisla-
tion enacted in 2006 provides for the establishment of City
Councils as de-facto metropolitan parliaments; but collabo-
ration among Gaziantep stakeholders predates this national
legislation, and was established in the 1990s. During discus-
sions with the previous Chair of the City Council, we were
informed that Antalya and Bursa also have good examples of
City Councils.

What factors make the City Council different and
effective in Gaziantep?

•	   Broad and deep membership, combined with
     well-defined institutional structure. As shown
     above, the assembly has 225 members drawn from a
     wide variety of Gaziantep’s main stakeholder groups.
     Sub-committees are assigned to work on issues of partic-
     ular importance131, and then report back to the Executive

131	         These issues appear to be defined rather broadly; we were told
they include: infrastructure and transportation; disaster and crisis man-
agement; environment; education; culture & arts, industry & trade; popular
culture of Gaziantep; healthcare; tourism; the EU and foreign relations;
small shopkeepers and businesses; historical and cultural heritage; ethnic
councils of migrants; social life in Gaziantep; international visibility; and
local press and media.

160	         It should be noted that the rapid growth of this construction
machinery industry during 2007-2012 was largely dependent on the
construction demand boom domestically because of the national stimulus
plan post 2008 global financial crisis. This leads to huge infrastructure
investments in many cities across China which in turn creates a big problem
in municipal debt management. Since municipal debt management is not
a unique problem faced by Changsha only, and there are many reports that
try to address this problem, this case study focuses on the local economic
development actors and address what these actors did well that contribute
to the success of Changsha. Particular attention was paid to initiatives that
were uncommon and/or carried out in a unique manner that could be of
interest or assistance to other cities. This by no means indicates that other
cities should clone exactly the same industrial growth model.

its presence is acknowledged in order to distinguish Chang-

The construction machinery industry in Changsha would
benefit further from decisions made at the national level
in 2009, when the national stimulus catalyzed a domestic
construction demand boom. This jump in domestic demand
had a large impact on the industry, and top national firms
like Sany and Zoomlion (both located in Changsha) nearly
doubled their sales and number of employees as a result. This
period of industry growth (2009-2012) directly coincided

Conclusion

Changsha’s economic growth in the period of 2007-
2012 was not due to efforts by the municipal gov-
ernment alone, nor was it a result of the exceptional
success of one industry. The city’s success is due to a com-
bination of factors, including inherited advantages, national
and provincial level policies, and municipal government
initiatives. While only the most unique and constructive
factors are noted in this report190, these factors have positive-
ly impacted the city, contributing to the competitiveness of
firms and the growth of the economy.



The most significant growth was in the manufactur-
ing industry, which overtook the services sector in
terms of contribution to GDP since 2003 (see excerpt
below from the KPMG Investment Environment Report,
2013).191 In 2012, growth in the manufacturing industry had
increased from 2012 by about 278.5 billion CNY (about 46.5
billion USD). This was primarily led by key industries such as:
construction machinery, automobiles and parts, household
appliances, electronics, biological medicine and advanced ma-
terials. In terms of jobs, the construction machinery industry
alone accounted for over 100,000 jobs in Changsha192, and
with a multiplier of 5, indirectly created about 500,000 jobs
(over 20% of the city’s labor force).



In sum, while inherited and national level factors
provided the city with both an increasingly competi-
tive location (centrally located with improved exter-
nal connectivity) and an industry-specific knowledge
base; success was ultimately dependent on the city’s
efforts to leverage these factors in order to take
advantage of economic opportunities. National level
factors were insufficient to trigger growth independent of
municipal interventions. It was the municipal government
that leveraged advantages, providing support to firms across
industries and employing effective inter-agency coordination
mechanisms that improved the efficiency and responsive-
ness of government agencies. These measures helped the city
to develop globally competitive industries and successfully
attract new firms and talent – further diversifying, strength-
ening and ultimately, growing the economy.

6.	 Leveraging national level programs can increase the
    resources available to municipalities to implement new
    programs and initiatives. In the case of Changsha, the
    city successfully leveraged national level programs for
    talent attraction and strategically selected a nationally
    prioritized industry for its investment attraction efforts
    (e.g. automobiles). This not only saved the city money, as
    funding was available at the national level to support ini-
    tiatives (e.g. funds to compensate certified “talent” that
    relocated to the city) but reduced the need for the city to
    duplicate administrative efforts as well. Changsha even
    encouraged local firms to take advantage of national
    level programs, helping lead firms to attract thousands
    of new employees.

Of course, these interventions relied on several conditions
that were present in China, and while we cannot know if
these same interventions would be as effective in other envi-
ronments, we can identify a few of the scope conditions that
boosted the effectiveness of interventions in this case:

1.	 Availability of financial resources: For instance,
    attracting foreign talent can require compensation
    or resettlement allowances, and the city must have
    additional funds available for these purposes (without
    otherwise draining funds for key services or vulnerable
    groups).

2.	 Performance on cross-department initiatives:
    Interagency coordination efforts were undeniably
    supported by the fact that personnel had existing
    incentives to focus on cross-department outcomes (e.g.,
    with the city’s growth affecting all officials’ promotion
    prospects to a greater or lesser extent).

3.	 Reliable, Nationally Standardized Tools: Vocational
    degree programs had high barriers to entry, but those
    that were in operation were of high quality. How did the
    government successfully develop a barrier to distinguish
    high quality from low quality programs? The municipal
    government had appropriate certification standards to
    distinguish programs as well as significant authority
    to mandate curriculums. In terms of standards, the
    government relied on available tools- such as nationally
    standardized test scores for high school students (which
    were almost impossible to manipulate)- to measure the
    quality of existing institutions.

firms, and stakeholders at large. In addition to boosting the
numbers of visitors to the country, a key objective has been
to develop Morocco’s tourism brand beyond just Marrakech,
which had already become globally known for its cultural
treasures. The Vision documents sought to ensure the bal-
anced growth of tourism across Morocco’s regions, while also
emphasizing its economic and environmental sustainability.

The regional plan for Tanger-Tétouan took inventory
of the region’s tourism assets, and identified prior-
ity areas for development. Tangier-Tétouan is generally
greener than much of North Africa, and its pleasant climate
is reminiscent of coastal California’s, without extremes of
heat or cold. With literally millennia of recorded history and
the sites to document it, Tangier is a cultural gem. Local
authorities are working to further increase the area’s attrac-
tiveness to visitors both by emphasizing its natural beauty
and ecotourism potential, and by developing large-scale
tourist resorts and attractions. The current hotel capacity in
Tangier-Tétouan exceeds 13,000 beds, but plans are afoot
to more than triple this to 40,000 beds by 2020. Indeed, the
region’s existing hospitality infrastructure has seen dramat-
ic growth over the past few years, with many international
hotel chains moving in. It is planned that the city of Tangier
itself will be the locomotive driving the development of the
whole region’s tourism industry, building on its transport ad-
vantages as well as its lure as a cultural destination, centered
on its historic Medina. With about a million nights spent by
tourists in Tangier hotels each year, the city now ranks as the
fourth most-visited Moroccan city after Marrakech, Agadir,
and Casablanca.
