0   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

1.     There are 378 Local Government Units (LGUs) in the Palestinian Territories, of
which 135 are municipalities and 243 Village Councils (VCs). While municipalities
have access to funds under the Municipal Development Project (MDP) implemented by
the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF), no systematic transparent
funding mechanism exists for the smaller VCs.

2.    Following the recently closed World Bank financed Village and Neighborhood
Development Project (VNDP), the present Technical Assistance (TA) has the overall
objective of assisting the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) in developing a
program to strengthen village governance and their local infrastructure development.

3.      The present background note presents initial findings on the legal framework for
local service delivery and on VCs’ administrative structure, staff, service delivery,
financing and inter-governmental relations, including Joint Services Councils (JSCs). It
is based on a desk review; financial data from 166 villages and structured interviews
with 5 selected LGUs – two small and two larger VCs and a municipality D.

Village Councils in the Palestinian Local Government System

4.      After the Oslo Agreement in 1993, the number of LGUs increased from 139 to
well over 350 by 1997. The most recent figures for the number of LGUs are 135
municipalities and 243 villages, but the exact number of VCs may be slightly lower
according to MoLG. Generally, the main difference between municipalities and VCs is
the size of the population. Most municipalities have more than 5,000 inhabitants, while
around 70% of VCs have populations below 3,000.

5.      A large number of small villages makes it difficult to leverage economies of
scale in service delivery and presents a major challenge to the long-term sustainability
of local service delivery. In addition, the current governance and financing structure for
local service delivery remains unclear, , including in joint service provision
arrangements with other LGUs. At the same time, the Government’s approach to
consolidation of the large number of small LGUs has progressed with mixed results
only. In general, VCs are reluctant to give-up their current status.

6.     The 27 functions all LGUs are supposed to deliver are specified in the Local
Government Act (LGA, 1997) and further specified in 41 tasks according to MoLG’s
guidance. The LGA and by-laws also provide for LGUs’ establishment of JSCs to
                                            1
deliver service jointly and 71 JSCs exist today in the West Bank. Many of these are not
sustainable as they were created by specific one-off projects and externally funded
initiatives.

7.      According to a World Bank study (2010), 80% of all municipalities provide only
12 or less of the 27 functions and all except one municipality out of the 27
municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants perform 12 functions or less. Likely VCs
with far smaller population cover even fewer functions compared to municipalities with
less than 5,000 inhabitants.

8.     The study of four VCs shows that the two smallest LGUs carry out only 4
functions, while the largest carry out 8 and 10 functions as presented below:

   i)   All four VCs: Secondary Solid Waste Management services through JSCs

   ii) All four LGUs: Budgeting

   iii) Three LGUs: Water services partly or fully (the smallest do not provide this
        service)

   iv) Three VCs: Trade/ business licensing

   v)   Two VCs: Public parks, cemetery maintenance and social services

   vi) One VC: Electricity, street cleaning, construction permits, school maintenance,
       after school activities and planning

VC governance structure and administration

9.     The four interviewed VCs have between 9 to 11 council members with a quota
system with 2 female councilors. None of the village councils were elected in 2012 by
popular vote but based on recommendations by representatives of the major clans and
families in the villages (acclamations).

10.    The two smaller VCs do not have staff operating in full-time, while the larger
VCs have hired permanent staff. All four VCs have basic communication means and
their own buildings, constructed with donor-support. The staff number varies from two
to eight staff. All four VCs have an accountant and fee collector. The two larger also
have two technicians (engineer), social worker and some cleaners.

Village Finance

11.   The information on VCs finance is based on an analysis of 166 VCs’
own-source revenues and expenditures in 2010 and in 2011 and additional information

                                           2
from the four VCs and the municipality D. A full-fledged analysis of VCs’ financial
position is practically impossible due to the current accounting practices, and lack of
key data, e.g., actual amount of VCs debt to Israeli Water and Electricity companies.

12.    However, the available data shows that out of 166 VCs, 56 VCs had a deficit in
2010 and 49 in 2011 in the total own-source revenue account and the total balance is
presented below:

13.       The balance with a surplus presents however only relatively positive figures as
many mandatory services are not provided and LGUs are not paying their bills to Israeli
Water and Electricity companies, thus building up large arrears.

14.     VCs and municipalities have almost the same revenue assignments comprising
of local taxes, fees, and fines. VCs are however not entitled to property tax revenues.
Instead, VCs may collect and retain the low yielding ceiling tax and personal tax. Only
33 VCs out of the 166 VCs reported collection of their ceiling tax and personal tax in
2010 and 2011.

15.    None of the 4 interviewed VCs collected ceiling and personal taxes, but instead
they seek financial contributions from village residents to contribute to financing
specific investment projects, e.g., renovation of public buildings and local roads.

16.     The 4 VCs only had rudimentary expenditure control systems in place. All hold
bank accounts under their official name and have a working “Financial Committee” to
co-sign all bank transactions etc. All have information on the amount of arrears and
debt, but no direct invoices from the Israeli utility companies.

                                               3
Joint service provision and amalgamations

17.     All five VCs interviewed are members of at least one JSC. Solid waste
management is the most common function provided by the JSCs. The four of the five
LGUS are generally positive for more consolidated arrangements, including
amalgamation. But preliminary steps must be taking before amalgamating as LGUs
prefer to maintain their original identity. Furthermore smaller LGUs are concerned
about having less representation in the municipal council and larger LGUs are
concerned about smaller LGUs’ capacities.

18.     According to interviews and desk review it seems like the most active JSCs are
service oriented providing: solid waste management, water supply and waste water, but
building licensing, road /infrastructure maintenance and waste water treatment are also
important.

1      INTRODUCTION

1.1      Background

1.      There are 378 Local Government Units (LGUs) in the Palestinian Territories,
out of which 353 are located in the West Bank (110 municipalities and 243 villages),
and 25 are located in Gaza (all municipalities). At a 74% urbanization rate, LGUs face
increasing pressures to provide better services to their citizens. The World Bank and
other Development Partners (DPs) support local governments in the Palestinian
Territories to improve basic local infrastructure and services. For example, the
Municipal Development Program (MDP)1, managed by the Municipal Development and
Lending Fund (MDLF) 2 , provides investment funds to municipalities through a
transparent performance-based allocation formula: municipalities qualify for a higher
share of funds and capacity building in line with their administrative, service delivery,
and financial performance. In addition, the recently closed Village and Neighborhood
Development Project (VNDP) 3 supported by the Bank financed small-scale social
infrastructure and community services targeting marginalized and geographically
isolated villages and neighborhoods4.

2.     However, despite the support, local authorities continue facing significant
investment needs. While the 135 municipalities have access to funds provided by the
MDLF, no systematic funding mechanism exists to finance investments in small LGUs,
i.e., Village Councils (VCs). VCs cannot access funds under the ongoing MDP. This
leaves a funding gap for the 243 villages and marginalized communities. At the same
time, it would not be viable to continue approaching these small communities without
putting special emphasis on leveraging economies of scale. The majority of villages are
too small, with an average population of less than 3,000. This makes it difficult to
provide core local infrastructure services in an efficient and financially viable manner.
However, not much knowledge is available about the governance, technical and
financial capacity of VCs providing services.

    The MDP combines a first phase (MDP-I) with total financing of US$ 37.69 (ref: ICR) financed by the
Bank and other development partners (Fiscal year 2009/10 – 2013/14), and closed on 31 August, 2013
(ref: ICR), and the second phase (MDP-II), which is on-going with current financing of US$ 74.85 (ref
PAD).

                                                     5
3.      The Palestinian Authority (PA), through the Ministry of Local Government
(MoLG), has sought the World Bank’s support in designing a Program to address
capacity building and infrastructure investment needs of small LGUs not currently
benefitting under MDP. Although VNDP supported village and neighborhood level
infrastructure through a Community Driven Development (CDD) participatory process,
the project’s scope did not include addressing the core requirements for viable service
delivery and capacity building needs of Village Councils. As a response to the MoLG’s
request to tackle service delivery and financing in small communities, this Technical
Assistance (TA) activity has the overall objective of assisting the Ministry in developing
a program to support strengthening village level governance and local infrastructure
development.

4.     This TA has 3 specific objectives, as follows: (i) assisting the Ministry in
designing the principle parameters of a Village Development Program, including the
design of institutional arrangements and targeting criteria for disbursing an allocation of
US$5 million PA-own funds for village development as immediate continuation of
VNDP following its closure in October 2013; (ii) producing a background note on
villages in the West Bank to address the knowledge gap on VC’s governance, technical
and financial capacity to improve service delivery; and (iii) support designing the basic
concept of a Village Service Delivery Improvement Program. Findings from a review to
achieve the second objective under this TA are summarized in the present background
note.

1.2   Objective and methodology

5.      This background note summarizes findings of the TA to inform the MoLG, the
Bank and other Development Partners in preparation of a proposed Village Development
Program. In particular, the note reviews (i) villages administrative structure and service
delivery functions; (ii) financing of VCs, including self-financing; and (iii)
inter-governmental relations of villages, including with municipalities and Joint
Services Councils (JSCs). The note also provides a brief overview of the evolving legal
and institutional local government framework.

6.      This document presents a situational analysis of VCs based on (i) a desk review;
and (ii) structured interviews with 5 selected LGUs. The interviewed LGUs were
selected as case studies for further analysis and, for comparison with VCs, includes one
municipality classified as ‘Category D’ equivalent to the lowest tear of municipalities
(see section 2.1). Specifically, the following methodology was applied:



                                            6
        a. Desk Review: Review of available reports and literature on villages in the
           West Bank.

        b. In-depth surveys and structured Interviews: Interviews with representative
           from the 5 selected LGUs and JSCs. A copy of the questionnaires is
           available in Annex B.

        c. Review of published financial information: Review of available budget
           information for 166 VCs for the years 2010 and 2011.

        d. Consultative Meetings: Meetings were also held with representatives from
           the policy and planning departments at the MoLG and other PA agencies to
             obtain information on strategic short- and long-term initiatives aimed at
             increasing basic service delivery in villages.

7.       In light of the limited time and budget available, the background analysis
conducted by the consultant was restricted to in-depth reviews with 5 LGUs. Although
this does not reflect a representative sample, the selection was deemed appropriate to
compare core functions and administrative structure of typical LGUs of (i) different
size; (ii) capacity; and (iii) geographic location. 4 VCs of different population size were
compared to one ‘Category D’ municipality, as the next closest comparator in the
Palestinian LGU system5. The VCs were selected in consultation with the MoLG and
included two relatively small size and two relatively large size VCs.

MoLG operate with four categories of municipalities: A, with more than 15,000 inhabitants: B
municipalities with between 10,000 and 15,000 inhabitants; C with between 5,000 and 10,000
inhabitants and class D municipalities with between 1,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. This follows a
modification of the distinction after 1994, when PA categorized 14 governorate centers as municipality
A, 24 municipalities established before 1994 as B, municipality C were those established after 1994 with
a population of more than 15,000 and municipality D with a population between 5,000 and 15,000.

2      VILLAGE COUNCILS IN THE PALESTINIAN LOCAL
       GOVERNMENT SYSTEM

2.1      The evolving framework – a brief background

8.      Local governments in the West Bank and Gaza have a long history and predate
the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Some LGUs were created as early
as the second half of the 19th century. Over decades, these local authorities performed
under the complexities of different political and legal regimes. In historical Palestine,
there were 22 ‘local councils’ under the British Mandate (1920 – 1948). During the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, municipalities were the only
administrative institutions that were allowed to exist and function officially. After the
signing of Oslo Agreements in September 1993 and the following establishment of the
first Palestinian central government administration, the MoLG was set up in 1994.

9.     After its establishment, the concern of the MoLG was to increase the territorial
administration in the PA’s autonomous control, in areas A and B, and C 6 , with
particular focus on large population centers and communities adjacent to East
Jerusalem. This was done while keeping in mind a heavy-political agenda of
strengthening the Palestinian national presence within the PA autonomous zones, in
preparation for the statehood which was foreseen as part of the Oslo Accords. After
Oslo, local governments were particularly week and their legitimacy undermined as
many viewed them as a legacy of the occupation forces. Capitalizing on political will,
reinforcing a national Palestinian identity at the local level, and to overcome an
institutional and service delivery gap at the local level that would worsen if local
governments continue to lose face, the PA further accelerated the promotion of LGUs,
through decentralization measures, including the approval of the creation of new LGUs.
Giving a legal status to even the smallest community was viewed as a political gain for
the PA.

10.   By the mid-1990s, the number of LGUs increased from 139 (109 VCs and 30
municipalities) prior to the establishment of the PA, to well over 350 by 1997. The

6
    6 Area 'A' (18 percent of the West Bank): Full civil and security control by the Palestinian Authority.
Area 'B' (21 percent of the West Bank): Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security
control. Area 'C' (61 percent of the West Bank): Full Israeli civil and security control, except over
Palestinian civilians. These areas include all Israeli settlements (cities, towns, and villages), land in the
vicinity of these localities, most roadways that are connected to the settlements as well as strategic
areas described as "security zones."

                                                       8
majority of those new LGUs were (and still are) Village Councils (VCs) and Project
Committees (PCs). The political and geographical fragmentation of the Palestinian
Territories in connection with the implementation of the Oslo Agreements has given a
paramount importance to local government units in service delivery, especially in areas
where the relatively young central government was politically, geographically, and
fiscally constrained.

11.      In the time of this rapid increase of LGUs, MoLG as a central authority was still
in its early developmental stage. During this period, no clear criteria were determined as
the basis for establishing new LGUs. Reportedly, the primary distinction between
municipalities and VCs has been the size of the population7, i.e., LGUs of a population
more than 5,000 were defined as municipalities, while those with less than 5,000 people
would be regarded as VCs.

12.    However, the classification by population only provides limited guidance.
Today, some VCs have exceeded this population threshold but remain classified as
VCs. At the same time, there are a number of LGUs with a population of less than 5,000
people which were granted the status of ‘Municipality D’. Overall, however, VCs are
generally smaller than municipalities.

13.     Overall, the tendency to establishing a large number of LGUs was, at least
partially, influenced by political consideration to strengthen Palestinian identify in local
governments as part of future Palestinian Statehood. Between 1993 and 1999 the
number of LGUs further expanded to include up to 127 Project Committees (PCs). PCs
did not have any elected councils and provided only one or a few functions e.g.
implementation of specific projects. However, PCs were completely abolished through
a wave of MoLG driven consolidation efforts in 2010 and 2011. Communities under
these PCs were merged into geographically adjacent VCs and municipalities.

14.     According to the MoLG, by the end of 2012, 243 villages existed in the West
Bank. More recently, this figure is being reduced to 217 VCs across the West Bank as a
result of on-going amalgamation initiatives. However, no precise numbers exist as of
yet. The majority of VCs, around 70%, have populations of below 3,000 (see Table 2).

    After 1994 the PA categorized municipalities by their size of populations, whereas municipality A as
governorate center and B as being established before 1994, but C as being established after 1994 and
above the population of 15,000 D as being the population of between 5,000 and 15,000.

2.2      Key challenges for local service delivery

15.     As a result of the young and evolving framework, LGUs face significant
challenges in providing services in an effective and sustainable manner to all citizens in
the Palestinian Territories. The challenges faced by LGUs are further aggravated by the
peculiar political, social and geographic characteristics in the West Bank and Gaza. The
key challenges can be summarized as follows:

            a. The large number of LGUs makes it difficult to achieve economies of
               scale in service delivery. The majority of VCs (more than 70%) is very
               small with a population size of below 3,000. At same time, VCs have
               identical functional assignments as (generally larger) municipalities. Hence,
                 the administrative burdens of VCs in small communities make service
                 delivery expensive and cost-ineffective.

            b. No consistent local governance structure exists. The current institutional
               framework and governance structure for joint service provision blurs roles
               and responsibilities of LGUs, Joint Services Councils (JSCs), and public
               utilities 8 . Financing, management and supervision arrangements are
                 unclear, and weaken both vertical accountability between higher and lower
                 levels of government; and horizontal accountability between citizens, local
                 authorities, and service providers. JSCs have no direct or only weak
                 accountability links to the service users and end beneficiaries and tend to be
                 accountable only to their member LGUs. The lack of funding to match
                 functional assignments, cross-subsidies of local services, and accumulating
                 arrears exaggerate the fiscal stress of central and local authorities.

   Generally, minimum service level and performance standards remain
   undefined.

c. Lack of vision for viable and sustainable service delivery at the small
   LGUs level: Support to villages has focused mainly on small-scale capital
   expenditure funding, and improving community development and
   investment planning. However, less urgency was given on assuring
   minimum service levels and long-term financial sustainability. Often,
   operation and maintenance cost of new infrastructure has been neglected
   and result in declining service levels.

d. Quality and access to services remains an issue in small LGUs. The lack
   of adequate funding is causing significant decline in the quality of basic
   local services currently provided by small LGUs. Capital investment needs
   remain large. Core municipal infrastructure services such as sanitation,
   solid waste collection, and water supply remain incomplete in many of the
   small and geographically isolated communities. In addition, institutional
   capacity is very limited. Many VCs operate without permanent staff and
   don’t have the capacity to ensure minimum service standards. Often,
   administrative structures only exist on paper.

e. The current LGU consolidation approach progressed with mixed
   results only. Over the past several years, the MoLG acknowledged the
   need to better leverage economies of scale in local service provision.
   However, the attempt to reduce the overall number of administrative units,
   widely described as ‘amalgamation’, has demonstrated only mixed results
   to date. There has been general reluctance of VCs to give-up representative
   functions and, overall, little enthusiasm to share available investment funds
   among a larger constituencies. In addition, and with the lack of carefully
   planned public awareness efforts, many VCs viewed the prospect of
   consolidation as threatening to their own local identities, which in the first
   place were nurtured by the MoLG and its wave of politically influenced
   creation of additional LGUs. Out of the eight municipalities established
   during the last 4 years through the amalgamation processes, MoLG reports
   at least two as not very stable after the local elections in late 2012, and at
   least one at risk to disintegrate.

f. Shortage in availability of land for physical and spatial planning and
   local economic development. This is largely influenced by the inability of

                                  11
                 LGUs to expand spatially beyond Areas A and B that, together, represent
                 only 40% of the autonomous Palestinian Territories areas as defined by the
                 Oslo Agreements. The Government of Israel (GOI) has been applying a
                 system of strict requirements and conditions for licensing for service
                 delivery expansion and physical planning in Area C. Area C is
                 particularly fragmented with the presence of Israeli settlements, and ring
                 roads surrounding Palestinian villages that are reserved for vehicular travel
                 of Israelis. Of the 271 villages 149 are in Area C.

2.3      Policy Development and Reforms: Recent attempts of consolidation

16.        Throughout the first decade of 2000, the MoLG together with the international
community initiated a multitude of local governance reforms. Alongside these strategic
documents, MoLG has been focusing on controlling and consolidating an over-grown
number of LGUs, in order to render the municipal services more efficient, effective, and
closer to the local communities, and to enhance citizen participation and local
accountability.

17.   MoLG’s approach for the consolidation of LGUs consisted of the
implementation of a number of amalgamation initiatives9, using, at large, financial
incentives through donor-financing to gain LGUs buy-in. Prior to that, the MoLG has
developed its amalgamation policy and prepared a Manual for Amalgamation of
Municipalities which was adopted by the MoLG in 2009 and the first amalgamation
initiative was applied in 2010.

18.    While reducing the number of LGUs remains a policy goal of the MoLG, a few
developments have further altered realities on the ground: A number of VCs10 have
attracted targeted and fairly significant infrastructure investments financed through
donor support, aiming at improving local services delivery – those VCs could be
perceived as relatively better ‘equipped” to continue to function as LGUs compared to
most of their peers that haven’t received significant support. In addition, the de-facto
geographical marginalization of some village communities, especially in Area C, and
their heavy isolation as a result of movement restrictions by-pass roads and the

municipalities were formed by incorporating 43 VCs/PCs.

Denmark, Local Government Reform Development Program (LGDP) financed by BTC, etc.

Separation Barrier, have made it difficult, in some instances impossible, to include them
as part of a joint-service delivery scheme. In fact, in many JSC jurisdictions, a number
of VCs are members11 but virtually receive no service as a result of this isolation. In
addition to that, generally, recent LGU consolidation initiatives have produced mixed
only results. Many amalgamated LGUs are already facing problems in undertaking new/
additional functions, resulting in defective service delivery and additional rather than
fewer administrative and financial burdens. As such, without a carefully considered
incentive system and public awareness efforts to promote the benefits of consolidation,
even in the most limited sense, VCs will continue to exist as administrative bodies for a
while.

19.     The MoLG has been trying recently to approach village service delivery
differently. The MoLG has requested the Bank to provide assistance in designing a local
government support program to address capacity building and infrastructure
development needs of villages, in particular. The Village Development Program as
envisaged by the MoLG would give more emphasis on leveraging economies of scale in
service provision to provide core local infrastructure services in VCs in a financially
viable manner. In that sense, the MoLG is shifting its focus towards subjecting VCs to
provisional steps towards building administrative and financial capacities before
possible upgrading into municipalities or through a form of LGU consolidation. A
performance-based and incentivized grants allocation formula would be developed
similar to the manner currently applied with the Municipal Development Program.

3     THE LEGAL AND INSTITUIONAL FRAMEWORK OF VILLAGES

3.1    Legal framework

20.     The Local Government Law was passed in 1997 by the Legislative Council. It
defines the system and legislative framework for local governance in the West Bank and
Gaza. According to the law, any decision about boundaries and changes to the number
of local authorities shall be decided by the Council of Ministers. The law specifies
twenty-seven functions under municipal responsibility (see section 3.2.), which are
mainly within public utilities (water supply, solid wage management, and electricity),
urban planning and regulation. The law only refers to local authorities and does not
distinguish between functions for municipalities and villages which, in effect, are
supposed to fulfill the same functional responsibilities and collect the same kind of
revenues.

21.     Generally, the main difference between municipalities and VCs is the size of the
population, i.e., with a few exceptions, municipalities have more than 5,000 inhabitants.
Two more differences prescribed in the legal framework are notable, as follows: (i) VCs
collect different types of taxes and fees, e.g., property tax for municipality, ceiling tax
for VCs; and (ii) municipalities have the right to remunerate mayors and council
members as opposed to VCs.12 Particularly the second factor largely differentiates the
organizational and administrative structure of both VCs and municipalities.

22.     All LGUs can establish Joint Services Councils (JSCs) for joint service delivery.
The possibility of forming JSCs dates back to the Local Government Act (Art. 27 C),
which permits the Minister to establish JSCs upon the approval of the concerned local
authorities. The law permits JSCs to manage joint services, their own revenues, staff
and budgets. Further regulations on JSCs’ functioning and establishment are detailed in
the existing by-law on JSCs from 2006, which modified by-laws from 1998 and 2003.
JSCs are a key element of the PNA strategy to improve service delivery through
cooperation between LGUs, in particular smaller ones.

23.   After a Joint Councils Strategy 2010-2014 was published in April 2010, JSCs
have been established widely with the purpose of improving planning and service
delivery by enabling economy of scale and thus increasing the efficiency and
effectiveness of selected services, e.g., for water and waste management. JSCs have
often been started with support from donor-funded projects, including from the World

Bank, JICA, Danida and AfD to motivate LGUs to form JSCs. However, JSCs have
often shown limited sustainability once donor funding vanished.

24.     According to the Joint Service Councils Department at the MoLG, 71 JSCs
existed in the West Bank in 2013. Of these are 30 single service JSCs of which 23 deal
with solid waste management: 36 deal with planning and development and 5 were
established for future amalgamations. About 40% of the existing JSCs are not
sustainable as they depend on financing from specific donor-funded initiatives.

25.     Each JSC has its own bylaw (regulation, agreement), which is normally
developed under MoLG’s or a projects’ guidance and shall be approved by MoLG.
JSCs’ shall pass their budgets to MoLG for its approval and MoLG is carrying out some
monitoring of their performance.

26.

3.2   Functional assignments

27.     As indicated above, VCs have the same functional assignments as municipalities
and are expected to provide the same services according to the Palestinian Local
Authorities Law of 1997 (Law 97). The law assigns 27 different functions to LGUs in
general, as shown in the following table. This Law does not delineate any defining
distinctions between the mandatory functions of municipalities and VCs.

      Table 3. Local Government Functions (ref. Article 15, 1997 Local Government Law).

              Functions

              3. Water supply
              4. Electricity distribution
              5. Sewage (public toilets)
              6. Public markets
              7. Commerce & business licensing
              8. Public hygiene (street cleanings, waste collection)
              9. Public health & supervision (solid waste management)
              10. Public stores (supervision of commercial, entertainment entities)
              11. Public parks

                  27. Fire fighting
                  28. Others

28.     Since the 27 service functions required by the Law are rather general, MoLG has
further disaggregated those functions to a set of more specific tasks (see table 4). The
idea behind the “concept of desirable tasks” developed by MoLG was to give more
specific guidance to LGUs about their mandatory functions prescribed in Law 97. The
table below is a synthesis of several lists developed by MoLG for different categories of
municipalities, from ‘Category A’ to ‘D’. It was developed for Category D
municipalities and VCs which, according to MoLG, should carry out the same tasks
except for “Street naming and numbering”. The total number of tasks arrives at 41.

4      FINDINGS: WHAT SERVICES DO VCs PROVIDE IN PRACTICE?

29.     This chapter examines what functions and tasks VCs provide in practice. The
five LGUs selected for this review were interviewed with two different sets of
questions: one with the list of 27 functions based on Law 97; and the other with the list
of 41 tasks designed by MoLG.

30.   However, before delving into the discussion of VCs’ actual functions, it is
worthwhile revisiting the service delivery in municipalities in general. According to a
2010 World Bank Report13, 82 out of 13214 municipalities performed between 6 to 12
functions; and 23 municipalities performed 5 or less functions. Table 5 below extracts
main findings of the report.

31.     Overall, the findings suggest that about 80% of municipalities provide only 12
or less services. Furthermore, all except one municipality out of the 27 municipalities
with less than 5,000 inhabitants perform 12 functions or less15.

32.     Although no equivalent analysis exists for villages, it is assumed that VCs with
far smaller population cover even fewer functions compared to municipalities with less
than 5,000 inhabitants. The following analysis will be review this in more detail based
on the example of the five selected LGUs.

of before mentioned report)

   34.      The comparison suggests that smaller VCs deliver fewer functions compared to
   their larger peers: Out of the interviewed villages, small VCs conduct 4 functions, while
   large VCs conduct up to 10 functions. Close to all of the VCs seem to provide water and
   solid waste management services. However, beyond those, the range of services
   provided is rather diverse and incomplete:

              a. All LGUs provide Solid Waste Management services through JSC.




                                                   19
           b. Water services are provided (i) fully through a JSC by one VC; (ii) partly
              independently and partly through a JSC (processing) in one VC; (iii) fully
              independent by the municipality and the remaining VC; and (iv) not at all by
              the smallest VC.

           c. All LGUs carry out budgeting.

           d. Three VCs and the municipality manage trade/business licensing.

           e. Electricity, street cleaning and construction permits are only provided by
              one VC and the municipality.

           f. Public parks, cemetery maintenance, and social services are only
              provided by two VCs.

           g. School maintenance, after school activities, planning are done by one VC.

           h. Only the municipality carries out management of municipal assets and
              supervision of buildings demolition.

35.     All LGUs included under this review are members of one or more JSCs. The
most common function provided through a JSC is SWM. This particular type of
service-oriented JSC setup covers the whole governorate to sub-governorate level, and
operates only with a single function. The main task of JSCs for SWM is secondary
collection of solid waste and transfer to the final disposal sites16. This is a common
practice, including in the SWM JSCs in Jericho and the Jordan River Valley. Primary
collection from households and street cleaning is not commonly functioning in most of
the reviewed VCs.

4.2      VCs’ tasks performed in line with MoLG guidelines

36.    As seen above, small VCs conduct a fairly limited number of functions, whereas
larger VCs carry out more functions, closer to the service levels of ‘Category D’
municipalities. The following section provides a more detailed review of the 41 tasks
assigned to VCs by the MoLG guidelines.

     One large scale sanitary landfill is operational in the Jenin region (Zahrat A-Finjan) serving mostly the
northern West Bank communities and parts of the middle West Bank. Two other landfill sites in
Ramallah and Hebron-Bethlehem regions are under development. According to MoLG’s strategy on
SWM, all solid waste generated in the West Bank shall be consolidated to these three main sites.

37.   Comparing the functions per Law 97 and tasks per MoLG guidelines between
VCs and the municipality suggests a remarkable difference: while VC’s task coverage
does not differ much from the numbers of functions they provide, the municipality D
task coverage soars in comparison with the numbers of functions provided. VCs seem to
be implementing functions with far fewer implemented tasks compared to the
municipality, at least in the observed case of Deir Istia. A more detailed review of the
differences is provided in table 8 below, comparing task coverage of Qufor Dan (large
VC) and Deir Istia (municipality D).

38.   One of the main differences is the availability of utility services in the
municipality, such as water and electricity, which increases the tasks performed to at
least an additional 5 or 6 compared to the VC. Under the category “Planning/
construction”, particularly tasks related to civil engineering, both LGUs provide
construction permits. However, the municipality covers more sub-tasks while the VC
only conducts a minimum range of tasks.

39.     The same trend can be observed in the category of “Public health/ safety”,
particularly for SWM related tasks. The VC Qfar Dan only provides secondary waste
collection services through a JSC, but none of the tasks pertaining to waste disposal and
public hygiene. The municipality Deir Istia, in contrast, puts a lot of effort in “Public
health/ safety” with the number of tasks mounting up to 12 in this single category.

40.     Concerning the “Administration/ finance” category, both LGUs implement an
almost equal number of financial/ asset management related tasks. The interviews
revealed that LGUs with utility services have accumulated large debts, especially from
the electricity service, which will be examined later.

41.     The above analysis suggests that examining the 27 mandatory functions from the
Law 97 only is not enough to fully understand differences in local provision between
VCs and municipalities; and across VCs. The example of Qfar Dan and Deir Istia
reveals that VCs carry out far fewer of the 41 tasks assigned by MoLG, despite almost
similar number of functions.

42.     In sum, the analysis in this chapter suggests VCs core functions performed
regularly include budgeting, licensing, water service and solid waste management.
Larger VCs implement more functions than smaller ones, but still much less compared
to the municipality D. The service delivery gaps between large VCs and municipality D
can be found mainly in the ‘planning/ construction’ and ‘public health’ category.

   5      VILLAGE GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION

   5.1      VC governance structure

   43.    This chapter takes a further look at the 5 LGUs’ councils, their administration
   and their staff situation. It is based on information from the five LGUs provided by
   questionnaires and during interviews.

   44.     VCs have a basic assembly structure with regular basis of congregations and
   recording system. In the VCs and municipality D reviewed as part of this background
   paper, the number of council members varied from 9 to 11 according to the population
   size, and all of the VCs apply a quota system for female council representation, which is
   a requirement by the Local Council Elections Law (Law no. 10, 2005).17.

   45.        One main difference is the election of VCs. Village Council members are not
   elected by popular vote but based on recommendations by representatives of the major
   clans and families in the villages (acclamations). This finding corresponds to the results
   of the latest local elections in 2012/2013, where local governments were elected by
   acclamations in 218 out of 338 LGUs.18 The 218 LGUS with acclamation were most
   likely VCs.

   5.2      VC administrative structure

   46.        The MoLG has developed an organizational chart covering both municipalities
   and VCs (see attached in Annex B). Findings from this review indicate that the MoLG
   does not enforce the preparation and confirmation of organizational charts. For

        Local Election Law of 2005, article 17. According to this, the LGU of less than 1,000 does not
   necessarily set up obligatory quota of 2 female seats, in contrary to the case of Ein Synia.

         example, interviews with the 5 LGUs suggest that small VCs do not have a clear
         organizational chart. More importantly, those VCs do not have permanent staff assigned
         to all organizational functions. On the other hand, large VCs prepare organizational
         charts and update them on a regular basis, with departments spanning multiple and/ or
         permanent staff. The municipality D covered under this review, in particular, does not
         have an organizational chart. This municipality, in turn, has fixed operating departments
         with a number of staff adequate to perform its basic functions.

         47.    All five LGUs included in this review have full or part time accounting staff,
         which indicates that they are able to fulfill their budgeting and accounting functions. All
         LGUs also retain basic communication means, such as phones and fax.

         48.     Small VCs do not have staff operating in full-time, while the large VCs have
         resources to hire permanent staff. The municipality D and large VCs are similar in their
         human resource capacities apart from the fact that the municipality D has a full time
         Mayor. Another interesting finding is that most VCs, irrespective of the size, hire
         collectors who visit each household and collect service charges on a door to door basis.

      a. All four VCs have their own buildings and basic communication means.
         However, administrative building were generally constructed with
         donor-support and not financed by the VCs.

      b. Large VCs with certain years of operation seem to have rather well
         established administrative structure, coming close to the municipality D.

      c. All four VCs have an accountant, full-time or half-time, with at least a few
         years’ experience as CPA.

      d. Generally, full-time staff work in the office from 8am-2pm, while part-time
         work on a need basis only.

6      VILLAGE FINANCE

50.     This chapter presents VCs’ financial situation based on an analysis of 166 VCs’
own-source revenues and expenditures in 2010 and in 2011.19 It presents VCs’ revenue
sources and provides an overview of VCs’ financial position for operations and
enterprises, revenues and expenditures. The final section provides specific information
from the interviews conducted for this background paper to comprehend VC’s practice
in expenditure control, debt management, revenue collection, fixed asset management,
and accounting.

51.    Although only one third of VCs recorded a deficit in 2010 and 2011, overall,
VCs’ find themselves in a dire financial position. Main reasons include that VCs (i)
provide only a few core services, in particular water and solid waste management; (ii)
cross-subsidize their functions by non-payments and accumulating arrears from water
and electricity consumption owed to Israeli companies; and (iii) development budgets
are mainly financed from external sources.

52.     A full-fledged analysis of VCs’ financial position is practically impossible due
to the current accounting practices and lack of key data, e.g., actual amount of debt to
Israeli Water and Electricity companies.

53.    In principal, VCs have the same revenue sources as municipalities, with
exception of the property tax. VCs shall collect ceiling and personal tax, which in
practice, however, are hardly collected and only generate about 3% of VCs’ revenues.
Although VCs are assigned central government transfers, i.e., from transportation tax
revenues, funds are transferred irregularly and lack predictability for VCs. Actual
allocations vary heavily from year to year and put further strain to VCs’ limited
financial planning capacity.

6.1      VCs’ Budget Document Structure

54.    The MoLG made annual budget document submission mandatory for VCs in
2009; hence data on the VCs’ budgets is available from fiscal year (FY) 2010 onwards.
166 VCs’ executed budget documents were available for this study at the MoLG budget
department for the FY 2010 and 2011. The budgetary sheets are identical to the one



19
     This paper defines “own-source revenue” as the revenue sources assigned to Local Government Units
(municipalities and village councils) by Local Government Law in 1997.   The data source was the
executed budget documents available at the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) budget department.

                                                  27
municipalities are required to use, with minor modifications to reflect a slightly
different operating revenue assignments between VCs and municipalities.

55.     The VCs’ budget document is comprised of 4 accounts: operating, enterprise,
development, and accounts payable/ receivable. This background paper focuses its
analysis on the accounts which record VCs’ own-source revenues, expenditures,
operating and enterprise accounts. Operating account’s revenues are local taxes; user
fees, except for water and electricity; fines, and non-capital grants from the PA and
international donors. Operating expenditure is categorized in functions, although with
very limited details. Functions are not linked to specific operating revenue sources. The
enterprise account is comprised of water, electricity, and unspecified “others” user fees
and expenditures financed from the fee revenue.

56.        Development accounts’ revenue comprises grants for capital investments,
predominantly from international donors, and any surplus from operating and enterprise
accounts. Reporting in development accounts is limited, although several VCs have
been receiving international assistance funds.20 Accounts payable and receivable are
not thoroughly reported either.21

6.2      VCs’ Revenue Assignment: similar to municipalities, yet significantly less
         actual revenue per capita

57.        VCs and municipalities have the same revenue assignments, with a slight
difference in operating revenue assignments. The overall similar revenue assignments
are the result of a lack in differentiation between municipalities and VCs in the Local
Government Law of 1997. The Law does not distinguish between different LGUs.

58.    Unlike municipalities, however, VCs are not entitled to property tax revenues –
one of the most efficient and important revenue sources for local governments (see
Table 12).22 Instead, VCs may collect and retain ceiling tax and personal tax; and can

frequently, and the content of international assistance funds VCs have been receiving in subsequent
studies.
21
     Based on the interview with the MoLG budget department.       VCs do not fully grasp and/or report the
amount of accounts payable as well as accounts receivable, particularly in their non-water,
non-electricity arrears.   No breakdown of arrears per item (e.g. electricity) was available.
22
     Property tax can be applied only within the municipal boundaries. This is specified in the “Jordanian
law of 1954 concerning the Land and Building Tax”, which gives the only applicable legal background to
the tax.

                                                     28
charge fees for agricultural product and cattle inspection. Ceiling tax is levied on every
room of each household. Although it could hence be interpreted as a similar tax to
property tax, ceiling tax has the disadvantage that no statutory ceiling tax rate is set by
the MoLG. In addition, no valuation of village houses and rooms has been conducted
systematically to draw the currently implemented annual rate of 7 NIS per room
annually23. The lack of valuations of village houses and rooms, in turn, makes the
ceiling tax not buoyant to the local economy.

59.    However, in the current administrative setting, the ceiling tax has a potential
advantage relative to the property tax given the degree of control VCs can exercise in
administering ceiling tax revenues. VCs can collect and fully retain ceiling tax revenue,
while property tax has historically been collected by the MoF in West Bank and is
subjected to the MoF’s interception to offset municipalities’ electricity and water arrears
to Israeli suppliers. The unpredictability of the amount and timing of the property tax
transfer made municipalities’ financial management challenging.24

60.     Personal tax is levied annually on the villages’ individual male residents older
than 20 years. No statutory tax rate is set by the MoLG on this tax either, while the
actually implemented tax rate seems to be 20 NIS per male resident.25

61.     The financial implication of this difference remains to be seen due to the fact
that a statutory tax rate is not set for the ceiling and personal Tax; and very few VCs
collect both taxes. The VCs’ executed budget documents show that only 33 VCs out of
the 166 VCs reported their ceiling tax and personal tax in 2010 and 2011.




23
      The 7 NIS rate was observed during this study team’s visits to 4 sample VCs (Ein Synia, Wadi Rahaal,
Beit Imrin, Qfar Dan).
24
     The MoF started to publish the amount of interception per municipality since January 2013 at a
quarterly basis. Although this is a significant step, more clarity in the presented information would be
needed to make the publication usable for municipalities and their stakeholders.
25
     The implemented rate was drawn based on this study’s visits to 4 sample VCs above.

enterprise revenues), the VCs reported significantly less own-source revenue per capita
than municipalities. Municipalities’ per capita own-source revenue was more than twice

that of VCs’ in 2010 and 2011. 27 In 2011, the VCs’ per capita own-source revenue was
196 NIS, while municipalities’ per capita own-source revenue was 412 NIS. In 2010,
the VCs’ per capita own-source revenue was 215 NIS, while municipalities’ per capita
own-source revenue was 515 NIS.

6.3      VCs’ Own-Source Revenue Account: deficit or misleading surplus?

63.     Out of 166 VCs whose executed budget data was available in 2010, 56 VCs had
a deficit in the total own-source revenue account (operating account balance plus
enterprise account balance). The number of VCs with deficit shrank to 49 in 2011. The
indebted VCs allegedly delay their payments to suppliers and use any significant user
fee revenues such as electricity and water to cross-subsidize non-electricity and
non-water related payments.28

64.     However, the remaining VCs’ surplus does not necessarily reflect good fiscal
health, but could be the simple reflection of limited services provided. According to the
expenditure items which could be observed in the budget documents, 135 VCs provide
only up to 3 services (electricity, water, and solid waste) in 2010 and 119 VCs in

     95 municipalities’ budget documents, whose executed budget data was available at the MoLG, were
analyzed for this purpose.
28
     Based on the interview with the MOLG budget department.     A future study will be needed to
identify the way VCs without any significant user fee revenues (e.g. electricity and water) have been
financing their debts.

2011.29 In 2010, 31 VCs provided only solid waste services, compared to 47 VCs in
2011 (see table 13).

65.        VCs’ total own-source revenue account surplus should also be discounted given
the fact that VCs have been accumulating arrears to Israeli electricity and water
suppliers. Historically, VCs have not been fully paying their bills for electricity and
water purchases from Israeli suppliers.30 VCs’ arrears to Israeli suppliers trigger a Net
Lending process – where Israeli authorities deduct the Palestinian VCs’ electricity and
water arrears from the national transfer revenues (usually from customs) due to the
PNA; and the PNA in turn applies an interception against VCs’ transportation tax
revenue share. For municipalities’ Net Lending, the PA uses property tax and profession
permit fee revenues as sources for such interception. While the PA started to publish its
interception amount to municipalities’ property tax and profession permit fee revenues
since January 2013, no equivalent information of the interception exists for VCs’
transportation tax in public documents as of January 2014.

66.      Another critical factor which enabled the VCs’ surplus is the exclusion of capital
expenditures from both operating and enterprise accounts. The VC finance stakeholders
believe that the VCs’ capital expenditures are only possible by the grants from
international donors and the PA due to their scarce own-source revenues.31 As per
MoLG guidance, capital expenditures enabled by grants from external sources,
predominantly international donors, are to be reported in the development sheet of
budget documents, opposed to the operating or enterprise sheet. However, as VCs rarely
fill the development sheet of budget documents, additional qualitative research would
be required to understand VCs’ capital expenditure financing.

29
     Solid waste service’s exact revenue and expenditure is unknown, as it is categorized under “health
expenses” in operating account without any disaggregation.        The claim is based on an observation
during this study team’s visits to 4 VCs and an interview with the MoLG budget department.
30
     A future follow-up study needs to identify whether all of the VCs have been receiving bills from the
Israeli suppliers. The four VCs visited by this study testified that they had never received bills.

     Based on interviews with international donors, the MOLG budget department, and the 4 VCs visited.

6.4      Operating Account Deficits: major driver of the total own-source revenue
         account deficit

67.     The overall own-source account deficit (operating account balance and
enterprise account balance) was driven predominantly by the deficit in VCs’ operating
accounts. The number of VCs with operating account deficit was 129 in 2010 out of the
166 VCs with available data for this study, and 96 in 2011. In aggregate of the 166 VCs,
the operating account was in a significant deficit in 2010 (8,345,098 NIS) – at the level
of 36 % of 2010 operating expenditure and 56 % of 2010 operating revenue. Although
the annual operating deficit decreased drastically in 2011, at 3,344,169 NIS is still
remains significant. The 2011 annual operating account deficit was at the level of 14%
of 2011 annual operating expenditure and 16% of 2011 annual operating revenue.

68.        The significant operating deficit decline was predominantly the result of a 500%
increase in transportation tax revenues transferred to VCs from the Ministry of
Transportation (MoT) via MoLG in 2011. As a consequence, VCs’ operating revenue
per capita more than tripled in 2011, reaching the level of 113 NIS from 32 NIS in
2010.

69.   Meanwhile, VCs’ operating expenditure per capita increased by 6% from 50
NIS in 2010 to 53 NIS in 2011. To better understand the cause of this operating
expenditure increase and manage the expenditure growth, this background paper
recommends that VCs’ solid waste management related revenues and expenditures be
made explicit. They should be moved from the operating account to a separate
enterprise account in the budget documents with a service-by-service breakdown of
revenue and expenditure. Solid waste management’s relatively large revenue and
expenditure distort the overall operating account, as the following operating revenue
and expenditure sections will illustrate. Providing more details on the services financed
from the operating revenues in the operating sheet of the budget documents would also
be crucial to increase efficiency in the operating account.32




32
     In the same manner as municipalities, VCs’ operating expenditure is currently categorized into
following functions; General & Administration, Health (most likely solid waste is a hidden item in this
category), Education, Loans & Contribution, General Services. More explanations are available in
“Operating Expenditure” section.

6.5      Operating Revenue: slim tax revenue, dependency on user fees and
         unreliable tax revenue transfer from the PA

70.    VCs’ operating revenues are comprised of local taxes, fees, and fines (table 14).
Between 2010 and 2011, operating revenues grew by 39 %, predominantly due to a
sudden increase of transportation tax revenue.

71.     The VCs’ operating revenue data illustrate a fairly high dependency on user
charges, which is believed to be predominantly solid waste management fees. 34 Given
the magnitude of solid waste management related revenue and expenditure, the
inclusion of solid waste management fees into the operating account significantly distort
the VCs’ operating revenue potential and actual realization data.

72.     Once the solid waste management fees are properly re-categorized under
enterprise, the biggest operating revenue source becomes transportation tax, considering
the transferred tax amount remains at a level similar to 2011. Licensing and paperwork
fees include revenues from licensing of agriculture products, industries and crafts,

33
     Governmental aid and international donation (non-capital) is regularly recorded by VCs in the
operating revenue budget sheet, although no such revenue is assigned to VCs by Local Government Law
in 1997.
34
     Water and electricity user fees are recorded in the enterprise sheet of the budget documents. Major
and at times only user fees reported under “User charges” is solid waste management fee, according to
the MoLG budget department.

                                                      34
ratification of transactions/ paperwork, and building. The second biggest operating
revenue categories are revenues from VCs’ assets rental and donations from the local
community. Given VCs’ significantly lower per capita revenue compared to
municipalities, it is possible that VCs have been trying to sustain their limited services
by renting out assets provided by international donors in the past, as well as seeking
local communities’ own contributions. Further research is needed to identify community
contributions’ usage, viability, and sustainability, in addition to qualitative research to
better understand VCs’ capital investments.

73.    Usually, tax revenues are an important revenue source for local governments to
provide public services for which no user fees can be charged, such as local roads or
social services. However, VCs’ tax revenues in aggregate make up only 12.64 % of the
total operating revenue in 2010, despite a significant increase to 37.47 % in 2011 from
the upsurge in transportation tax revenues.35

74.    VCs are particularly dependent on transportation tax revenues. This dependency,
however, only adds to the vulnerability of VCs’ finances due to the lack of transparency
and predictability in the transfer mechanism. By law, transportation tax is collected by
the PA which retains 50 % of the total collected amount before transferring the
remaining 50% to the VCs. In reality, however, the PA intercepts a part of the collected
revenue to make VCs indirectly remit Net-Lending without disclosing the interception
and remaining arrears’ amount per VC.

75.     The transportation tax revenues’ allocation mechanism among VCs is equally
unclear. No information is available to understand based on which principles the 50%
share is being allocated across VCs. The MoLG has been updating its “transfer criteria”
annually, according to each year’s socio-economic situation. However, the criteria,
allocation amount per VC, and timing are not revealed to VCs in advance. No
consultation takes place with any other stakeholders beyond the MoLG.36 This practice
makes VCs’ financial management extremely challenging. In addition, it appears that
the MoF also transfers a certain amount to VCs directly under the name of
transportation tax, while allocation criteria and timing remain equally unknown. 37


35
     The reason of this sudden increase could not be attained by this study.
36
     The “Criteria” for FY2010 allocates 75% of the entire revenue to population sizes, 10% for the
purpose of encouraging amalgamation, another 10% for municipalities in financial crisis and 5% for
Jerusalem LGUs. The entire revenue in FY2010 is 133,216,717.04NIS. For 2012 and 2013, it seems like no
amount has been transferred to the LGUs due to PAs financial crises.
37
     Based on the interview with the MoLG budget department.

                                                     35
Those two channels of transportation tax transfers are not harmonized. In FY 2010, only
34 out of 166 VCs reported transportation tax receipts in their budget documents, In
2011, this number increased to 93.

76.    While VCs have two taxes (personal tax and ceiling tax ), which they can collect
and retain directly, only 33 out of the 166 VCs reported revenues from ceiling tax and
personal tax in 2010 and 2011.

6.6      Operating Expenditure: no significant services except for solid waste
         management

77.       VCs’ operating expenditure grew less than operating revenues, i.e., only 8%
from 2010 to 2011. To identify the major driver of this growth, however, the current
functional categorization of operating expenditures in the budget documents is not
helpful. Expenditures are categorized at an aggregated level, including “General and
Administrative Expenses” and “General Services”, with the exception of “Health and
Solid Waste Management” and “School Rehabilitation” expenditures. According to the
MoLG budget department, General and Administrative Expenses include salaries for
staffs working for unspecified services, stationaries, advertisement, and unknown
maintenance items. General Services include maintenance cost for VCs’ assets.

78.    ‘General and Administrative Expenses’ is the largest operating expenditure
category in both 2010 and 2011. Expenditure under this category accounted for up to 35
% and 38 % of respective year’s total operating expenditure; and grew by 13 % from
2010 to 2011. The largest expenditure in this category is estimated to be salaries.38
However, the specific break-down of services provided under this category cannot be
derived from the budget document. The second biggest expenditure category, solid
waste management, accounted for 27 % and 31 % of the respective year’s total
operating expenditure and increased by 19% in 2011. The third biggest expenditure
category was maintenance cost for VCs’ assets, equivalent to 27% of the total operating
expenditure in 2010 and 21% in 2011. The capital investments needed for such assets
are believed to have been financed predominantly from international donors.39

79.       A more accurate and comprehensive understanding of expenditure needs is
required to improve expenditure management and increase operating efficiency. As
stated earlier, in particular solid waste management expenditures should be made

categorization in the operating expenditure should become more detailed to provide a
clear picture of services financed from operating revenues.40

6.7      Enterprise Account Balance: deceiving surplus on water and electricity
         accounts

80.     VCs’ enterprise account is comprised of water, electricity, and “other
enterprises” categories. 139 out of 166 VCs reported water or electricity revenues and
expenditure in 2010, compared to 117 VCs in 2011. Only a handful of VCs reported any
data in “other enterprises” categories, i.e., 20 VCs in 2010 and 17 VCs in 2011 –
indicating a limited menu of enterprises VCs deliver in general.

81.    VCs’ water and electricity accounts recorded an aggregate surplus for 2010 and
2011 (table 16). However, the enterprise surplus was achieved only in the context of the

40
     In the same manner as municipalities, VCs’ operating expenditure is currently categorized into
following functions; General & Administration, Health (most likely solid waste is a hidden item in this
category), Education, Loans & Contribution, General Services. More explanations are available in
“Operating Expenditure” section.
41
     Although the category says “health and solid waste”, the MoLG believes that it is predominantly solid
waste expenses. Healthcare related expenses (rehabilitation of clinic, equipment and staff) are usually
provided by the Ministry of Health, not through LGUs.
42
     School rehabilitation is financed from education tax (7% of property tax). Education tax is not LGUs’
own-source revenue as it is collected, retained, and spent only for the purpose of school rehabilitation
by an education committee (comprised of Ministry of Education and LGU representatives).

                                                     37
VCs’ chronic underpayment of bills from Israeli electricity and water suppliers, as well
as the exclusion of water and electricity capital investment expenditures from the
enterprise account.43 VCs have been indirectly paying for their electricity and water
arrears through the transportation tax intercept imposed by the PA. However, adding
this payment amount to the enterprise expenditure is impossible due to the lack of
information regarding the outstanding amount of arrears and the interception per VC. If
those hidden expenditures are added to the enterprise expenditure data, the true balance
of the water and electricity accounts might as well be deficit.

82.     VCs’ enterprise accounts also illustrate the potential significance of water and
electricity user fee revenues as a share of total own-source revenues—particularly
electricity revenues. The aggregate revenue amount from water and electricity user fees
reached more than 5 times of the total operating revenues in 2010. Although the
aggregate revenues decreased in 2011, by 24 % for electricity and 6 % for water, the
total revenue from water and electricity was still 3 times higher than the total operating
revenue in the same year.44 The decline of electricity revenues coincided with a decline
in electricity expenditures and can be explained as a reflection of the electricity service
transfer from some VCs to electricity utilities.45

     According to the MoLG budget department, capital investments necessary for VCs’ water and
electricity operations were historically financed from external donors’ funds. Such expenditure was to
be recorded in the development sheet of the budget document, yet most of the VCs do not fully fill in
the sheet.
44   The total revenues from water and electricity are 86,438,790NIS in FY 2010, and 73,421,449NIS in FY
2011. These figures are far larger than the operating revenues for both FY, i.e.      15,309,343NIS for FY
2010 and 22,402,055NIS for FY 2011 (table 13 and 14).
45
     This assumption is based on interview with the World Bank’s electricity project in West Bank and
Gaza. The assumption could not be verified due to the unavailability of the list of VCs and municipalities
which transferred their water and electricity services to utilities.

6.8   VCs’ Financial Practice: findings from 4 VCs and 1 ‘Category D’
      municipality

83.    As explained earlier, 4 VCs and 1 category D municipality were interviewed to
obtain insights into VCs’ day to day financial management practices. All interviewed
VCs and the municipality only had rudimentary expenditure control systems in place.
All hold bank accounts under their official name and have a working “Financial
Committee” to co-sign all bank transactions, keep the records for bank deposits, and
make LGUs’ financial account information available to the public upon their visits.

84.    The VCs and the municipality D presented significant constraints to conduct
proper debt management. Although all were able to present the item and amount of
arrears and debt, their electricity arrear figures’ accuracy was compromised due to the
fact that none of them have ever received direct invoices from the Israeli Electricity
Company. Historically, their electricity arrears have been notified unilaterally by the
MoF. Interviewed VCs explained that they have been taking some long term measures
to pay back arrears in installments. Given the magnitude of arrears and limited available
revenues, VCs has also hoped the PA would support arrear reduction in an organized
repayment scheme. VCs use a cash based accounting system for other, non-water and
non-electricity arrears. Hence, they are not in a position to systematically track those
debts.

85.     In terms of revenue collection, none of the 4 VCs collected ceiling and personal
taxes. The reason was explained with the current financial distresses among village
residents. Although VCs do not collect those taxes, they still seek financial
contributions from village residents to contribute to financing specific investment
projects, e.g., renovation of public buildings and local roads. It should also be noted that
the category D municipality collects both ceiling tax and personal tax. However, the
municipality intends to cease ceiling tax collection once their fiscal cadaster is
completed and property tax collection starts in their jurisdiction by the MoF.46




46
     According to 1954 Jordanian Law on tax for lands and buildings, in order for the municipality to
collect the property tax, fixed land registries is needed within the municipal boundary and properties
must be valued.

  86.     Overall, the LGUs interviewed for this background paper have only limited
  assets with almost no engineering equipment. The two small VCs did not have any VC
  asset registry, while larger VCs and the category D municipality had a basic,
  hand-written one.

  87.     All of the interviewed LGUs have 1 accounting staff per LGU with a CPA
  certification. However, smaller VCs’ accounting staff worked part time staff (2 to 3
  days per week), while larger VCs and the category D municipality had full time
  accounting staff. All used a cash based accounting system, with the exception of water

7      INTER-GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS

7.1     Joint service provision

88.     The review for this background paper suggests that no VCs provide services
jointly with neighboring municipalities, apart from the fact that from time to time VC
citizens travel to the nearest municipality to receive selected central governmental
services not available in villages, e.g., health, education, and agriculture. During the
interviews VC officials indicated little to no interest in entering joint service provision
schemes. They also indicated that municipalities would be reluctant to cooperate with
smaller and less functional LGUs.

89.   At the same time, all VCs interviewed for this paper are members of at least one
JSC. SWM is the most common function provided by the JSC which collects and hauls
waste to the transfer station or disposal sites located outside the VCs’ boundaries. Other
joint functions provided by JSCs include water supply and planning &
development—quite common functions amongst JSCs in general. A desk review of
available documents50 conducted for this paper indicated the following functions are
also provided by a large number of JSCs:

          a. Building licensing

          b. Road/infrastructure maintenance

          c. Waste water treatment

7.2     Perception of amalgamation policy

90.     Apart from Qufor Dan, the interviewed VCs indicated a generally positive
attitude to more consolidated arrangements, including MoLG’s amalgamation policy.
However, all VCs stressed the importance of taking preliminary steps before
amalgamating or ‘merging’ to form larger LGUs, i.e., forming JSCs to build trust and
allow time to practice cooperation and actual joint service delivery.

91.       However, important concerns were raised during the interviews, including:

          a. LGUs want to maintain their original identity;

                 b. Smaller LGUs are concerned about having less representation in the
                    municipal council because of the smaller population;

                 c. Larger LGUs are concerned about smaller LGUs’ capacities and the
                    associated extra financial/ administrative burden.

   7.3       JSCs experience to date: are they functional and effective?

   92.           A desk review of available documents51 and interview findings reveal that most
   active JSCs are service oriented; and the most common functions provided are utility
   type of services, i.e., SWM, water supply and waste water. There are several successful
   cases of regional (governorate, or cross-governorates level) JSCs of SWM, or
   sub-regional JSCs of water services, all of which have a potential for privatization or
   transforming into utility companies, but hardly for merging into new municipal entities
   because the original context of such JSCs is simply to increase the scale economy and
   the efficiency of certain services.

   93.    There have been various attempts and investments to promote joint service
   delivery approaches to achieve economies of scale, regardless of their intention to
   contribute to amalgamation initiatives or not52. However, findings suggest that most

have not yet achieved the outcomes intended by MoLG’s amalgamation policy.
Nevertheless, important lessons learnt can be derived from the joint planning and
community facilitation/ mobilization initiatives. Some of these lessons are already being
re-examined by various donors and MoLG53.

94.    A common tool of these projects is the introduction of “Joint Projects”, which
are preconditions to access and co-manage funds by two or more VCs. During the
present review, the team visited a typical case of JSC in the north of the West Bank,
which was originally established within the scope of the VNDP’s project activities. This
case revealed that member VCs had no intention or interest in conducting “Joint
Projects”. Findings also suggested some duplication of “Individual Project”, which may
be the result of VCs limited capacity to develop project proposals for joint initiatives;
the fact that localities are too dispersed; or a lack of interest54.

95.     At the same time, stakeholders acknowledged the importance of community
mobilization, which reportedly contributed to enhancing community participation in
various village activities and played an important role in raising awareness of local
service delivery issues—in particular in the case of the Bank supported VNDP. Usually
at the project implementation level, the main role of a community mobilizer is to make
sure that relevant stakeholders participate in the planning and implementation process,
including for “Joint Projects” with VCs and/ or JSCs. However, findings suggest that
mobilizers’ impact on communities and VCs may offer lessons for the potential role in
village development, and hence, technical assistance to VCs.

8     ANNEX A: METHODOLOGY

1.     Given the scarcity of formal documentation and data limitations, the present
study depends primarily on information gained by questionnaires and interviews with 5
LGUs. For analyzing the financial aspect, the study depends on the data kindly shared
by MoLG’s budget department. The data includes the executed budget of FY 2010
submitted by 174 VCs, and FY 2011 by 180VCs.

2.      The 5 LGUs do not pretend to reflect a representative sample, thus the selection
of 5 LGUs was deemed appropriate to compare core functions and administrative
structure of typical LGUs of (i) different size; (ii) capacity; and (iii) geographic
location. 4 VCs of different population size were compared to one category D
municipality, as the next closest comparator in the Palestinian LGU system.

          4      Population below 999                                              1

                                      Total                                  5 LGUs



3.      The 5 LGUs were selected in consultation with the MoLG, and based on the
following criteria: (i) two relatively small size VCs, (ii) two relatively large size VCs,
and (iii) a municipality D from locations in different parts of the West Bank.

4.    The selection also avoided participation of newly elected village officials as they
might not be appropriate as subjects of interviews due to their presumably limited
knowledge about VCs operations. The following table shows the basic profile of
sampled LGUs.

5.      The two relatively small size VCs, Ein Synia, Wadi Rahhal, (Small VCs) were
established in 1996, whereas the establishment of two other relatively large size VCs,
Beit Imrin, Qufor Dan, (Large VCs ) and the municipality D (Deir Istia) dates back to
mid 60’s.

6.   All five LGUs were visited and interviews were carried out by a team of Bank
and MoLG staff following a standard questionnaire. Actual inscription of the
questionnaires was conducted based on face-to-face interviews with selected VCs’
officials, rather than mere exchange of electronic communication such as emails and
faxes.
