Executive
Summary
While Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary and
secondary education under the general education stream,
it is yet to improve gender outcomes in the technical and
vocational education and training (TVET) subsector. The
share of female enrolments in diploma programs remained
steady, averaging around 12 percent over the past five years
despite the repeated call of the government for increased
female participation in skills training. The paucity of relevant
studies has been hindering effective policy discussion
on the issue. To understand the factors that affect female
participation in TVET, this study undertook a systematic
review of existing literatures, supplemented by qualitative
information from Focus Gr oup Discussions (FGD) conducted
on students of diploma programs offered by polytechnics in
Bangladesh. The study discusses several factors affecting
female participation in TVET: (a) supply constraints – lack
of institutions nearby, non-conducive facility and faculty
environment, non-availability of female-friendly courses
and relatively high TVET costs for poor households, and (b)
demand-side constraints - the reputational issue as the TVET
sector is associated with the image of male-domination and
low-performers, weak demand for technical training among
potential female students due to lack of awareness, and
employers’ perception of appropriate female roles at work.

The study indicates that female participation in technical
diploma programs would benefit from activities across the
following areas: (i) creating a gender-friendly environment
in polytechnics and workplaces; (ii) developing more
service-orientated diploma programs; (iii) developing a
TVET awareness campaign for females; (iv) supporting a
career counselling and guidance system for females; (v)
improving access to higher education; (vi) providing greater
demand-stimulating incentives; (vii) generating research
and knowledge on TVET for females, and (viii) leveraging
partnerships to promote skills development for females.

    Introduction


                   1.1 BACKGROUND
                   1. Bangladesh economy grew steadily over the past decade with
                   concurrent progress in human development. The economy registered
                   an average GDP growth of 6.1 percent over the past decade, despite natural
                   calamities, political turmoil and regional and global downturns. This growth
                   has been contributed by economic shifts toward services and industry from
                   a largely crop-based agrarian economy, controls on population as well
                   as increased remittances from migrant workers. Public spending priority
                   and continued reforms to social sectors such as health and education
                   have resulted in a healthier and more educated workforce to meet the
                   labour needs of the growing industry and service sectors. Bangladesh has
                   experienced the fastest decline in child and infant mortality rates among
                   developing countries while it has already eliminated gender disparity in
                   primary and secondary education enrolments. These gains in developments
                   are reflected by Bangladesh’s recent progression from Lower Income
                   Country (LIC) to Lower Middle-Income Country (LMIC) status in 2015, based
                   on its US$1,080 GNI per capita (Atlas Method) in FY2014.

                   2. Policies to promote more active labour force participation of half
                   of the population – women – will likely have significant positive
                   implications for economic development. More women have been
                   joining the workforce due to a decline in the incidence of early marriage,
                   increase in women’s share in education, availability of microfinance, and
                   improved job opportunities for females across expanding industry and
                   service sectors and technological development. Female labor force
                   participation rates have been steadily on the rise, reaching 33.5 percent
                   in 2013 according to the Labor Force Survey. Particularly, the supply of
                   women workers at relatively low wages is considered to have supported the
                   phenomenal growth of export sectors such as Ready Made Garments (RMG)
                   and footwear during 1995-2005 (Hossain, Sen and Sawada, 2012). The
                   share of earners among women household members increased from almost
                   12 percent to 15 percent between 2005 and 2010 (BBS, 2014). It is likely that
                   further expanding female participation in income-generating activities would
                   contribute to the overall increase in household income and further poverty
                   reduction.

It aims at increasing the females’ ratio in the overall

in female labor participation, it still remains less than                       particularly females. Expanding female participation
half of male participation across all age groups in                             in TVET polytechnics would improve the chances of
Bangladesh (BBS, 2013). Hence, the female working                               post-secondary level education attainment by females
population in Bangladesh has not been fully utilized to                         and likely enhance their labour market participation and
its potential. If female participation can be raised to male                    quality of employment2. Tapping on this opportunity,

 Though evidence in Bangladesh is limited, a number of researches in developing country contexts point to the overall positive impact of TVET on
employment (including school to work transition) and modest positive impact on wages (see, for example, Card, D. et al. (2011); Chandrasiri, S. (2010);
Eichhorst, W. (2015); Hirshleifer, S. et al. (2014); Moenjak, T. & Worswick, C. (2003); Reis, M. (2012))

     Perspectives on Improving
     Female Participation in TVET


                 13. The critical need for improved female participation in TVET stems
                 from the economic, social and policy contexts in Bangladesh. While
                 economic growth and labor market developments demand more and higher
                 skilled female workers, social development requires their improved access
                 to skills training opportunities for facilitating better employment and equitable
                 incomes, accruing social benefits and improving women’s empowerment.
                 These deliberations are also reflected in the overall policy and plans of the
                 Government of Bangladesh.


                 2.1 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
                 PERSPECTIVES
                 14. The demand for more and higher skilled workers continues to
                 grow in industry and service sectors in Bangladesh. In 2010, the share
                 of workforce employed in industry and services (52 percent) outpaced
                 that in agriculture (48 percent) for the first time in the job market (Figure 1).
                 Between 2010 and 2013, the share of workers employed in non-agricultural
                 activities, particularly female workers in industries, continued to increase.
                 The increasing share of workers in higher paid non-agriculture work led the
                 economy to experience higher growth and set the contexts for the country’s
                 progression to middle-income status. Growth in industry and services is
                 expected to continue with around 15 million jobs projected to be created in
                 fast-growing economic sectors, including Ready-Made Garments (RMG),
                 export-oriented manufacturing, light engineering, ship-building, agri-
                 business, ICT and pharmaceuticals (World Bank, 2015b).

                 15. Workforce development through skills training is critical to
                 respond to the economic changes and achieve Bangladesh’s goal
                 of becoming a middle-income country over the next few years. In
                 order to reach the middle-income status, GDP growth must increase from
                 the current average of around 6.2 percent to 8 percent over the next five
                 years (GoB, 2015). To achieve this target, the economy must transition to the
                 next stage of efficiency-driven development, involving more sophisticated

               Project (STEP), in the TVET sector with the support of the World Bank and the Government of Canada.
               The main objective of the project is to strengthen selected public and private training institutions to
               improve training quality and employability of trainees, including those from disadvantaged socio-
               economic backgrounds. The project is being implemented in 93 institutions, including both public and
               private education providers.

               STEP has been supporting gender mainstreaming in the Bangladesh TVET system through focusing
               on improving female accessibility in training institutions as well as creating a more gender-friendly
               environment. The Project provides universal stipends to female students enrolled in supported public and
               private training institutions. It is also providing institutional development grants to institutions for improving
               the teaching-learning environment for quality skills training as well as running awareness programs
               targeting prospective TVET students, particularly females.

     Female Enrolment in TVET

                 23. The gender gap in TVET remains pronounced in many parts of
                 the world. Low female enrollment in TVET programs has been found to
                 be a challenge for governments in Africa (Kaaya & Waiganjo, 2015; Egun
                 & Tibi, 2010) and Asia (Agrawal, 2013; World Bank, 2009). The literature
                 reporting on factors relating to low female enrollment in TVET includes: (i)
                 cultural factors, which include the social and traditional norms that expect
                 females in traditional roles (Ndahi, 2002); (ii) attitudinal factors, which include
                 perceived differences between male and female capabilities arising from
                 a lack of female role models in TVET, and low societal perception of TVET
                 (Yakubu, 2006); (iii) situational factors, which include financial insolvency
                 of households, geographic barriers and lack of family support (Kaaya &
                 Waiganjo, 2015); and (iv) institutional factors, which include inadequate
                 gender-mainstreaming in programmes, lack of medical department and
                 childcare services, lack of female campus dormitories and non-flexible
                 entrance requirements for females (Ayonmike, 2010).

                 24. However, there are successful cases of improved female
                 participation in TVET. The TVET sector in the Philippines experienced
                 an overall boost in female enrollments (from around 800,000 in 2010 to
                 1,000,000 in 2013), with the female TVET graduates outnumbering males in
                 2013 (UNESCO, 2015; TESDA 2013). Gender concerns were incorporated
                 in national policy, plans and activities along with monitoring and evaluation
                 of gender outcomes in TVET. Institutions ensured increasing opportunities
                 for females to enter trades generally considered non-traditional for them
                 (such as automotive and welding trades) through increasing female
                 teachers, electing female students in classroom leadership roles, scholarship
                 programs, work placement as well as intensified recruitment programs for

    Note: A high increase in average pass rate is noted for the year 2015, arising due to changes in the examination system introduced by the Bangladesh
Technical Education Board (BTEB). In 2015, the examination was held under the government regulation-2010. Under the new regulation, student pass rates
improved primarily for the following three reasons: (i) the first three semesters were held by the polytechnics while the last five semesters were held centrally
by BTEB. Exams held at the institutions helped students to better prepare for the final examination held by BTEB; (ii) In 2015, students were assessed based
on their combined score of continuous and final assessments, while previously it was required for them to separately pass each assessment for progression;
(iii) previously students participated in the industrial attachment (internship) in the 7th semester but under the new regulation, industrial attachments is in the
8th semester. As a result, student are able to better complete their coursework and assessments and then go for practical learning.

                                                          35. This chapter attempts to analyse several supply and demand
                                                          side factors which hinder greater female participation in TVET. Some
                                                          of the factors are similar to those often identified in other countries, while
                                                          others may be specific to Bangladesh’s contexts.

                                                          36. Participation in diploma education may have been largely
                                                          limited to a ‘privileged’ section of the eligible female population.
                                                          This ‘privileged’ section is identified in terms of their location and economic
                                                          condition. Interviews with polytechnic management reveal that female
                                                          students are generally from middle-income families coming from
                                                          metropolitan and urban areas.12 A recent study finds that young people from
                                                          economically advantaged backgrounds are twice as likely to enroll in TVET
                                                          programs, and those living in urban areas are more likely to opt for TVET
                                                          due to their proximity to training schools (CAMPE 2013; cited in World Bank,
                                                          2013). This suggests that access to TVET for females is likely to be affected
                                                          by spatial factors as well as education costs.

                                                          to (i) the relatively lower numbers of polytechnic institutions as
                                                          compared to other post-secondary institutions, and (ii) the urban-
                                                          bias in the locations of polytechnics in Bangladesh. Expansion in

       In Bangladesh, students who complete Grade 10 and enroll in a post-secondary institution are considered to be relatively well-off as those from poorer
     groups generally dropout prior to secondary school completion. Students who choose to enroll in polytechnics have to undertake the high costs of technical
     diploma education, requiring either financial solvency of the family or external financial support.

       Box 2: Relevance and Appropriateness of Curricula – the skills for retail industry case

       The retail industry case is a good example to illustrate the need to upgrade diploma education
       in alignment with emerging markets, particularly for female students. The public polytechnics
       have limited capacity in revising curricula and re-structuring programs to meet future market demands
       for graduates. The technologies offered in the different public polytechnics are determined centrally by
       the DTE. Consequently, the process lacks collaboration with polytechnic managements and industry
       employers for adapting to the market demands for female Diploma graduates. This is likely to be

     Policy Options

                 65. The review of this study provides some key information for future
                 policy discussions towards promotion of female participation in TVET.
                 Several factors seem to influence female participation and retention in technical
                 education, including: (a) supply constraints – lack of institutions nearby, non-
                 conducive facility and faculty environment, non-availability of female- friendly
                 courses and relatively high TVET costs for poor households; (b) demand-side
                 constraints - the reputational issue as the TVET sector is associated with the
                 image of male-domination and low-performers, weak demand for technical
                 training among potential female students due to lack of awareness, and
                 employers’ perception of appropriate female roles at work.

                 66. Eight major areas for improvement have emerged through the review
                 as potentially beneficial policies and strategies for further boosting
                 female participation in post-secondary TVET: (i) creating a gender-friendly
                 environment in polytechnics and workplaces; (ii) developing more service-
                 orientated diploma programs; (iii) developing a TVET awareness campaign for
                 females; (iv) supporting a career counselling and guidance system for females;
                 (v) improving access to higher education; (vi) providing greater demand-
                 stimulating incentives; (vii) generating research and knowledge on TVET for
                 females, and (viii) leveraging partnerships to promote skills development for
                 females.


                 KEY POLICY OPTIONS
                 1. Creating a female-friendly environment in polytechnics and the
                 workplace: A lack of campus accommodation and safe transportation is a
                 major challenge to female participation and retention in polytechnics without
                 these facilities. The provision of campus dormitory and transport facilities for
                 females would encourage more females to enroll in polytechnics. To make the

                 and staff share to at least 40 percent of polytechnic staffing is critical and this
                 requires a review of the recruitment policy by the Government. Training in gender
                 awareness among staff and reviewing curriculum from gender perspective may
                 also be considered by the DTE. Ensuring women-friendly facilities (e.g. separate
                 washrooms and religious facilities, leisure rooms, etc.) and regulations against
                 gender discrimination in the industry environment would also encourage female
                 graduates to pursue technical jobs.

     7. Generating research and
     knowledge on TVET for
     females –There remains a general
     dearth of research on female skills
     training outcomes and their labor
     market demand. Some areas of
     research that would benefit gender
     mainstreaming in TVET include:
     (a) job market analysis of demand
     for female diploma graduates;
     (b) the current female diploma
     graduate employment patterns
     and performance; (c) a review
     of gender responsiveness of the
     polytechnic curriculum; (d) analysis
     of the workplace environment for
     female diploma graduates; and (e)
     female students’ satisfaction with
     the diploma education system
     in Bangladesh. The availability
     of analytical work in these areas
     would be useful in guiding
     the government, polytechnic
     administrators, skills practitioners
     and other stakeholders in improving
     diploma education for females.

     8. Leveraging partnerships to
     promote skills development for
     females: Meaningful partnerships
     may focus on the following
     areas: (a) liaising with women
     organizations and civil society
     organizations for social marketing of
     TVET in rural areas; (b) networking
     with the industry to encourage
     apprenticeships for female
     diploma graduates; (c) establishing
     monitoring and evaluation systems
     on gender-mainstreaming in TVET;
     and (d) streamlining data and
     information on female diploma
     students to better inform the gender
     policy in TVET.
