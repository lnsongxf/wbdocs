     1. Strategic Framework
     Advocacy for workforce development (WfD) is a priority on the political
     agenda, as expressed in a number of policies and sector strategies. Policies
     and strategy documents, however, have yet to be aligned under a unified
     strategic vision. The implementation of these strategies is challenged by a
     lack of coordination among different ministries, the limited resources available
     for WfD and, more generally, the country’s political situation.

     2. System Oversight
     Although institutional accreditation mechanisms are in place and valued by
     industry, competency-based testing is limited and a national qualifications
     framework is not yet in place. Government funding is insufficient for the
     monitoring and improvement of programs, and allocations to institutions are
     neither linked to performance nor supplemented by other sources.

     3. Service Delivery
     Despite improvements in access to training and the increased participation of
     private providers, the quality of training continues to be a challenge. The lack
     of financial autonomy, combined with limited financial resources allocated for
     WfD, has hindered a systematic review and evaluation of training programs.
     In addition, the lack of up-to-date data about training outcomes and labor
     market needs prevents institutions from reviewing and updating their
     programs.

Executive Summary
A decade of sustained economic growth from 2000 to 2010 enabled the Republic of Yemen to achieve substantial
improvements in social and economic indicators. The government’s commitment to education, expressed in the
development of level-specific strategies as well as sustained public investment, led to a remarkable expansion in access
to basic education and, consequently, higher demand at the secondary and tertiary levels. However, quality has
remained a challenge at all levels: Increased enrollment has not resulted in higher completion rates or improved student
performance, and students leave the education system ill-prepared for the labor market. After the events of 2011, and
reaching an unemployment rate of 29 percent in 2012—estimated at 60 percent for youth—workforce development
(WfD) has become a priority on Yemen’s political agenda.

The SABER-WfD benchmarking results, summarized below, reveal the various challenges faced by the WfD system in
Yemen. These include a strong supply-driven approach, weak links between education outcomes and labor market
needs, a small private sector, and a shortage of employment opportunities in the public sector. Addressing them will
require focused and sustained efforts and collaboration across multiple WfD stakeholders in the public and private
sectors, as well as civil society organizations and donors engaged in supporting WfD policies and programs. Capitalizing
on the increased attention given to WfD in the last two years, two priority actions could be pursued: (i) formulating a
unified strategic vision for WfD in Yemen; and (ii) identifying key economic sectors that are growing at the local level and
developing training and apprenticeship programs accordingly.

Analytical Framework
The tool is based on an analytical framework 3 that
identifies three functional dimensions of WfD policies
and institutions:

    (1) Strategic framework, which refers to the praxis of
        advocacy, partnership, and coordination in relation
        to the objective of aligning WfD in critical areas to
        priorities for national development;

    (2) System Oversight, which refers to the arrangements
        governing funding, quality assurance, and learning
        pathways that shape the incentives and information
        signals affecting the choices of individuals,
                                                                         Source: Tan et al. 2013

Implementing the Analysis
Information for the analysis is gathered using a
structured SABER-WfD Data Collection Instrument (DCI).
The instrument is designed to collect, to the extent
possible, facts rather than opinions about WfD policies
and institutions. For each Topic, the DCI poses a set of
multiple choice questions which are answered based on
documentary       evidence     and    interviews   with
knowledgeable informants. The answers allow each
Topic to be scored on a four-point scale against
standardized rubrics based on available knowledge on
global good practice (See Figure 2). 5 Topic scores are
averaged to produce Policy Goal scores, which are then
aggregated into Dimension scores. 6 The results are
finalized following validation by the relevant national
counterparts, including the informants themselves.

The rest of this report summarizes the key findings of
the SABER-WfD assessment and also presents the
detailed results for each of the three functional
dimensions. To put the results into context, the report
begins below with a brief profile of the country’s
socioeconomic makeup.

  See Annex 3 for the rubrics used to score the data. As in other countries,
the data are gathered by a national principal investigator and his or her team,
based on the sources indicated in Annex 4; and they are scored by the World
Bank’s SABER-WfD team. See Annex 5 for the detailed scores and Annex 6
for a list of those involved in data gathering, scoring and validation and in
report writing.

The SABER-WfD assessment results summarized below

of the WfD system in Yemen, as well as a basis for
discussing ideas on how best to strengthen it in the
coming years.

the Emerging level of development (1.9).
At the strategic level, the findings suggest that advocacy
for WfD is a priority on the political agenda, as
expressed in a number of policies and sector strategies
for WfD, including the 2014-2016 National Plan for
Youth Employment, developed during the country’s
transitional phase (2012-2014). Policies and strategy
documents, however, have yet to be aligned under a
unified strategic vision. The implementation of these          Note: See Figure 2 for an explanation of the scale on the horizontal axis.

Policy implications
The demographic and socioeconomic situation of the
country, combined with the analysis provided in this
report, clearly indicates the need to develop a unified
strategic vision of what Yemen wants to achieve
through the development of its workforce. As identified
by the SABER-WfD assessment, a national WfD plan
should prioritize measures to address skills constraints,
adopt a demand-driven approach to training provision,
and improve the quality and relevance of current
education and training programs. Coordination of
efforts from different WfD stakeholders is crucial to
translate the vision and related strategies into actions
that can effectively contribute to better preparation and
utilization of the country’s human resources.

A comprehensive review of current vocational
education and training programs is necessary in order to
bridge the vast gap between graduates’ skills and labor
market needs. With an increasing unemployment rate,
weak investment by the private sector, and rapidly
expanded poverty, there is an urgent need to design
and diversify training programs, especially those related
to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The
increased diversity in training providers and programs
must be accompanied by the establishment and
enforcement of quality standards and monitoring and
evaluation systems.

As Yemen seeks to embark on formulating a new
constitution, the opportunity to address the most
pressing challenges of the country’s WfD system seems
unique. It is true that political stability is a key pillar for
any country to achieve socioeconomic development,
but the willingness and enthusiasm of different political
powers engaged in a long process towards building a
new Yemen would pave the road for WfD key
stakeholders to bravely commence a concrete reform of
education and training programs.

major overlap in mandates is not common. The role of
non-government WfD stakeholders in policy dialogue is
not regulated. The mandate work and general role of
trade unions and civil society organizations are
determined by the law, but there are no provisions
directly associated with WfD. Participation of these
stakeholders takes place in workshops, conferences, or
meetings for consultative purposes.

Coordination among WfD stakeholders faces three main
challenges. First, there is no champion or strategic
vision for WfD around which stakeholders can
coordinate. Second, few mechanisms exist for
coordination between government and non-
government WfD stakeholders. Third, established
coordination mechanisms, such as the Supreme Council
for Education Planning (SCEP), advisory coordinating
boards, and inter-ministerial committees, have
delivered suboptimal results.

The SCEP is in charge of developing strategies for
different education paths and collecting annual
education statistics. Its role has been limited to advising
policy-makers, and has not been reflected in increased
ministerial coordination. Legally established advisory
coordinating boards under MTEVT are responsible for
coordination between different WfD stakeholders in a
way that fosters better policies and programming. For

Yemen scores at the Latent level for Policy Goal 9,
which reflects the limited availability of data on
education outcomes from training providers, as well as
general surveys or assessments related to skills
development or labor market needs.

All training providers, state and non-state, are required
to collect and report basic administrative data. Since
most of the data reported are descriptive (counting
personnel and resources), it is rarely used to inform
program performance or review training programs.
These data are collected and archived in all educational
and training institutions, and serve as input for the
annual reports of the Ministry of Education (MOE),
MTEVT, and the Central Statistical Organization. The
management of data is not centralized or standardized:

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
       produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
       institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically
       strengthen their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of
       education policies against evidence-based global standards, using new
       diagnostic tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports
       give all parties with a stake in educational results—from
       administrators, teachers, and parents to policymakers and business
       people—an accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the
       policies of their country's education system are oriented toward
       ensuring that all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Workforce
       Development.
