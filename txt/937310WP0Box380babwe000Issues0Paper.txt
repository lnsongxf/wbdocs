 Preface



                              Zimbabwe has embarked on a long-term process of rebuilding its economy following the
                              period of economic decline and the breakdown of social services during the 2000s.
                              Provision of clean water and the safe disposal of effluent are some of the urgent services
                              needing rehabilitation and expansion. Water is essential not only for the health and well-
                              being of Zimbabweans but also for the country's economic recovery. Manufacturing,
                              agriculture and energy as well as the relatively recent, rapidly growing sectors such as
                              mining and tourism all rely on clean, reliable water. Conversely, the Water Sector
                              depends on the recovery and growth of these water using sectors to provide the revenues
                              needed to meet the costs of water provision and management. A massive task lies ahead
                              to rebuild the Water Sector so that it can regain its pre-eminence amongst African
                              countries. Much of the country's water infrastructure needs to be rehabilitated and
expanded; staff will need to be trained and capacity expanded; and improved operating procedures need to be
implemented. This rebuilding is now underway. The 2013 National Water Policy (NWP) was prepared to guide recovery
of the Water Sector. However, one of the challenges that have yet to be factored into the recovery plans is the likely
effects of climate change on the country's water resources; and its implications on planning, design and management
decision making.

Given the highly variable climate in Zimbabwe, the government is well aware that climate change has the potential to
disrupt the economic recovery. Irrespective of the effectiveness of international efforts to curb greenhouse gases,
Zimbabwe will inevitably be affected by global warming and so must focus on adapting to these impacts before they
seriously affect the country and its economy. The government recognizes that, if its response is to be effective, it must
be coordinated across all sectors of the economy. For this reason the government is currently preparing a National
Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) to ensure that there is a government-wide approach to climate change
adaptation. This Issues Paper has been prepared as a recommendation of the NWP. It will contribute to the NCCRS by
examining opportunities for adaptation to climate change in the water resources sector, using both structural and non-
structural measures. The paper shows that climate change is likely to lead to a significant reduction in precipitation
and available surface and groundwater resources across most of Zimbabwe. Most significant impacts will be felt in the
Runde, Gwayi and Mzingwane catchments. Manyame and Mazowe catchments are likely to be affected the least.
While the magnitude of the reduction still needs to be determined through more detailed studies and modelling work,
the paper makes it clear that climate change, coupled with population growth, has significant implications for water
availability in Zimbabwe. The recommendation for a specific Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Water Sector
in Zimbabwe to complement and strengthen the NCCRS has considerable merit and needs to be supported. Such a
strategy would necessarily have to be based on a more detailed understanding of climate change and our opportunities
to adapt.

The technical assistance from the World Bank and other development partners in preparing this paper is highly
appreciated. This paper will contribute to the formulation of the NCCRS as well as provide valuable information for the
Water Sector Investment Analysis currently being prepared and the Water Sector in Zimbabwe in general.

My special thanks go to Dr. Rafik Hirji for providing leadership in delivering this high quality paper under a very tight
deadline.

This Issues Paper on Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and Management was prepared with
support from the Analytical Multi Donor Trust Fund (AMD TF) under the Flexible Technical Assistance for the Water
Sector in Zimbabwe managed by Michael Webster (Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist) of the World Bank office in
Harare.

The paper was prepared as a team effort between the former Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management
(now Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate), the World Bank and various partners and colleagues as a rapid
response to the request made by the former MWRDM in December 2012 under the overall leadership of Rafik Hirji of the
World Bank. Its principal authors are Richard Davis (Senior Water Resources consultant) and Rafik Hirji (Senior Water
Resources Specialist). The paper drew from three thematic inputs, builds on past Climate Change studies in Zimbabwe
and the Southern African region, and case studies developed from January 2013 and January 2014.

Thematic inputs on (a) climate change impacts on precipitation and runoff modelled for 2050 and 2080 and water
availability was prepared by Professor Amon Murwira, University of Zimbabwe, (b) climate change implications on water
resources decision making was prepared by Eng. Zebediah Murungweni, and (c) climate change impacts on groundwater
and recharge was prepared by Dr. Richard Owen, University of Zimbabwe.

Draft findings of the Issues Paper were presented to managers and staff of MWRDM, MENR, ZINWA, EMA, Catchment
Managers, Provincial Environmental Officers, and representatives from ITRG and GWP at a stakeholder workshop held at
Pandhari Lodge outside Harare on October 1, 2013. A revised version was presented to ZINWA management on January
30, 214, and the final draft paper was presented to Honourable Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, Honourable Deputy
Minister Eng. Simon Musanhu, Permanent Secretary Prince Mapuzviriho, Director Tinayeshe Mutazu, Director I. Kunene
and Director General M. Chasi and senior staff from the MEWC on June 2, 2014. The team would like to thank staff from
these institutions for providing valuable comments. The team acknowledges the guidance provided by former Minister
Dr. Samuel Sipepa Nkomo and Permanent Secretary Ringson J. Chitsiko of MWRDM in the preparation of the draft paper
and advice and logistical support provided by Mr. Vivarirai Choga, Mr. Tinayeshe Mutazu, Mr. Gilbert Mawere and Mr.
Zvikomborero Manyangadze of the MWRDM and Eng. Albert Muyambo and Mr. Samuel Sunguro of ZINWA for organizing
and chairing the various review meetings. Continued strong support from the current Minister for Environment, Water
and Climate Honourable Saviour Kasukuwere and Honorable Deputy Minister Eng. Simon Musanhu and Permanent
Secretary Prince Mapuzviriho is very much appreciated.

Lastly, the overall support and encouragement provided by World Bank colleagues and managers, including Nginya
Mungai Lenneiye, the former Zimbabwe Country Manager, Camille Lampart Nuamah, Zimbabwe Country Manager,
Robin Mearns (Program Leader), Michael Webster (Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist), Ngoni Mudege (Water and
Sanitation Specialist) and Omar Lyasse (Senior Agriculture Specialist) and administrative and logistical support provided
by Priscilla Mutikani and Chenai Mangezi (Harare, World Bank) in organizing the workshop and various review meetings
and in the execution of the AMD TF is gratefully acknowledged.

Executive Summary



Water and Water Management
Water is central to the Zimbabwean economy, people's livelihoods and their social well-being;
its availability and reliability is a function of highly variable climatic conditions. Irrigated
agriculture is the major water using sector while rainfed agriculture depends on reliable rainfall.
Agriculture not only has links to other economic sectors such as industry, but it is also
important at household level because it employs the majority of the population. Power
production which underpins most other production sectors depends to a large part on the flow
of the Zambezi River either for hydropower generation or for the cooling of thermal power
stations. Even mining, a growth sector, ultimately relies on water for both processing and
electricity production.

Clean water is essential for health. The devastating cholera outbreak of 2008-09 arose from
the consumption of contaminated water. Other diseases such as typhoid and gastro-enteric
infections are spread by water that is contaminated by untreated or partially treated sewage.
Water is also needed to maintain wetlands, floodplains and riparian areas which act as buffers
against pollution. These areas are now degraded across much of Zimbabwe, exacerbating the
population's exposure to pollution. This is most noticeable in alluvial mining where river banks,
river beds and floodplains are being destroyed contributing to the siltation of downstream
areas. Artisanal mining also adds highly toxic mercury to river systems and reservoirs and
contaminates fish consumed by urban and rural populations.

Groundwater provides water to more than 70% of Zimbabwe's population. It is the principal
source of water for both the communal and commercial sectors in rural areas and a major
source of water for irrigation, mining and tourism. Yet its planning, development and
management has received very little systematic attention since the mid-1980s because the
country concentrated on the provision of clean water from surface water resources. There is
almost no monitoring of groundwater levels (except near mining activities and in some urban
areas) and little investigation of groundwater resources. The Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ)
has recognized the importance of water to economic development and the living standards of
Zimbabweans. To buffer against the vagaries of climate variability, the GOZ has invested in
thousands of small and large dams and associated infrastructure for urban and rural water
supply and sanitation and irrigation. It introduced a new Water Act in 1998, along with the
ZINWA Act to establish a specialist water management agency, the Zimbabwe National Water
Authority (ZINWA), has recently endorsed a new National Water Policy (NWP), and is currently
preparing a Water Quality and Source Protection Strategy. It is also implementing
rehabilitation of Harare Water and Wastewater, advancing investment planning for Bulawayo
water supply, finalizing a Water Sector Investment Analysis (WSIA), and engaged in a number
of transboundary water initiatives.

Climate Change and Water
Although climate change poses a threat to water resources that is yet to be fully integrated into
water planning and management, Zimbabwe's NWP recognizes climate change and calls for
establishing specific provisions for understanding the extent of the threat and proposing
specific actions to manage potential impacts.
       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
 ix    Management in Zimbabwe
The government of Zimbabwe has long recognized the threat from climate change and joined
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and acceded
to the Kyoto Protocol in 2009. It is currently preparing a National Climate Change Response
Strategy (NCCRS) that is intended to mainstream climate change thinking into all key
economic sectors and to bring about an integrated response across all economic sectors.
Zimbabwe strategy will largely be based around adapting to the threats from climate change so
that detrimental economic and social impacts are minimized and opportunities are seized.
Given the implications of climate change for the hydrological cycle and the centrality of water
to the economy and to social well-being, water needs to be at the core of the NCCRS.

This Issues Paper, requested by the former Ministry of Water Resources Development and
Management as a recommendation of the NWP, will contribute to the NCCRS by examining
opportunities for adaptation to climate change in the water resources sector, using both
structural and non-structural measures. It uses models to provide preliminary estimates of the
possible impacts of climate change in 2050 and 2080 on these water resources. A number of
opportunities to adapt to these impacts are discussed. Many of these adaptation opportunities
constitute no-regrets actions, in that they are actions that are worth undertaking in their own
right, irrespective of the severity of impacts from climate change.

State of Water Resources
Mean annual precipitation (MAP) across the country varies from 337 mm/year in the south of
the country to 1110 mm/year in the Eastern Highlands. These averages conceal considerable
inter-annual variability in climate.

Zimbabwe's long-term average surface runoff is estimated to be 23.7x10 Ml yr, although this
figure is not precise because of the deterioration in stream flow gauging stations and the need
to estimate runoff in sub-catchments without gauging stations. Gwayi and Mzingwane
catchments have the lowest runoff while Save catchment has the highest (Table A). Zimbabwe
stores runoff in a large number of small and large dams with a total storage capacity of about 9
    6
x10 Ml, excluding Lake Kariba. ZINWA dams account for the bulk of water stored in dams
because the Authority has taken over permits of dams in the former commercial farming areas
in order to ensure that they are maintained.

Water quality is often poor because of pollution from both point and diffuse sources.
Pollutants include sediments from artisanal mining and agricultural activities, pathogens from
wastewater, nutrients from wastewater and some industrial discharges, and heavy metals from
industrial enterprises. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) is often high downstream from
industrial discharge points and STPs because of high loadings of organic matter. Mercury and
stream-bank destruction from artisanal and alluvial mining activities are particularly
worrisome. Uncontrolled water contamination removes water from safe consumption as surely
as water shortages do.

Groundwater recharge rates are not generally known although some estimates have been
made. Groundwater is generally of good quality, apart from shallow aquifers in urban areas and
salinity in the extreme south and southeast of the country. Groundwater forms an important
resource for the future.

Water Resources Governance
Zimbabwe has a sound framework for water governance. The 1998 Water Act vested ownership
of all water in the President rather than in private land owners, established regional Catchment
Councils and sub-catchment councils for undertaking catchment-level water planning, issuing
water use permits and monitoring their use, establishing the rights and responsibilities of water
users, and assigns responsibility for dam safety. The 1998 ZINWA Act established ZINWA as a
specialist agency charged with managing the nation's water resources, and the recent NWP
reinforces these decisions, emphasizes the importance of inter-Ministry coordination,
recognizes the need to incorporate climate change into water planning and emphasizes the
need for recovery of the water sector.

The difficulties lie in implementing this framework. There is little coordination and cooperation
between Ministries whose decisions have major implications for water resources planning and
management; there are potential conflicts of interest between some institutions; there are no
clear mechanisms for protecting water source areas; there are serious capacity constraints;
surface water monitoring networks are not fully maintained and there is almost no monitoring
of groundwater levels or quality; water prices are low and there is little willingness to pay with
the result that ZINWA and local authorities lack operating funds; and regulations are often not
enforced.

Zimbabwe developed extensive water storage capacity (Table A) prior to and after
independence, as a safeguard against the climate variability. By the early 1990s, Zimbabwe had
also developed a modern and well managed water supply and wastewater treatment systems
for major urban centres. There was good water supply coverage in rural areas. However, as a
result of the economic and financial crisis and international sanctions, regular dam safety

 xi     Management in Zimbabwe
inspections have not been carried out and water supply and wastewater treatment plants and
associated infrastructure are now seriously dilapidated. The government is working with
development partners to restore many of these systems. While most dams for irrigation remain
safe, some need urgent repairs to be operational again, and other irrigation infrastructure,
including that on farms, needs maintenance and, in some cases, replacement.

Effects of Climate Change
The methodology for estimating potential climate change impacts on Zimbabwe's water
resources was based on the CSIRO Mk3 global circulation model (GCM) recorded in a global
database of climate predictions. Its outputs were used to estimate the effects of climate change
on Zimbabwe's water resources for 2050 and 2080. The precipitation predictions from the
model were downscaled and aggregated to catchment level. These global precipitation data
were checked with data from the Meteorological Department of Zimbabwe, and were then
coupled to simple rainfall-runoff relationships established by ZINWA for each of Zimbabwe's
seven catchments, to provide estimates of runoff.

This simple methodology provides useful preliminary estimates of precipitation and runoff but
it also has a number of limitations. Only one GCM was used; the downscaling to catchment
scale is subject to considerable uncertainty; the rainfall-runoff relationships may not be reliable
under climate change; and other consequences of climate change (such as changes in land use
and increases in evaporation rates) were not considered in the simple modelling effort. The
method only provides annual average precipitation and runoff estimates and does not provide
insight into changes in inter-annual variability, changes in extreme events, or seasonal shifts in
precipitation patterns or changes in water use or demand, all of which are expected to change
as a result of global warming. Nevertheless, this simple method provides a useful first estimate
of the possible effects of climate change on Zimbabwe's water resources.

Results from the GCM show that, whether the world attempts to curb emissions of greenhouse
gases or adopts a business-as-usual approach, annual average precipitation will decrease in all
Zimbabwean catchments, except Mazowe and Manyame where it would remain similar to
current levels. The drier catchments of Runde and Mzingwane will be affected most, with
declines in mean annual precipitation of between 12% and 16% by 2050 depending on the
emissions scenario. Precipitation could stabilize or start to recover in the more affected
catchments-Gwayi, Mzingwane, Runde, Sanyati and Save - between 2050 and 2080 if emissions
are curbed, although it would continue to decline in almost all catchments if the business-as-
usual emissions scenario persists.

Runoff will be affected by global warming to an even greater extent than precipitation. River
flows in Manyame catchment may be little affected, but the river flows in Gwayi and Mzingwane
catchments could decline significantly if greenhouse gas emissions are not controlled (the
business-as-usual scenario). Given the simplicity of the method, there is considerable
uncertainty about the extent of the decreases in river flow, but the general prediction of a drier
climate with considerably less river flow across southern and western Zimbabwe, with much
smaller impacts in Manyame and parts of Mazowe catchments, is a reliable conclusion.

Groundwater recharge was estimated by assuming that it was primarily determined by MAP.
This may be a reasonable assumption for most parts of the country but not all. The expert

                                                                                           Management in Zimbabwe

opinion of an experienced hydrogeologist was used to estimate the proportion of precipitation
that contributed to recharge in each of Zimbabwe's seven catchments. Because of the direct
relationship between recharge and MAP, this simple method suggests that the changes
predicted in precipitation under climate change will also be seen in recharge. That is, recharge
in Manyame and Mazowe catchments will be little affected by climate change while the
Mzingwane and Runde catchments will possibly experience major declines in recharge in both
2050 and 2080. General principles suggest that dambos, shallow hard-rock aquifers and other
unconfined aquifers that receive direct recharge are likely to receive considerably less recharge
than at present.

The results from the present study were compared to the results from two other studies that
included the Mzingwane catchment. The decline in runoff in this catchment was much larger
in the present study (65-100%) than in the other studies (19-33% and 2-24%). These other
studies were able to predict intra-annual changes in precipitation. They found that, not only
would mean annual precipitation decline in southern Zimbabwe, but that there would be
increased variability in precipitation. One of the studies in the Mzingwane catchment found
that the main reduction in precipitation would occur in the dry months of early April to end
September.

The predicted effects of global warming are broadly consistent with observed changes in
climate over recent decades in Zimbabwe. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures have
risen over the last century; the Department of Meteorology states that annual rainfall has
become more variable; and there is anecdotal evidence that the wet season has progressively
started later. There has been a decline in stream flow over the last 20 years although it is not
clear that this decline is because of climate changes. Although some reports claim that mean
annual precipitation has declined, a thorough analysis shows that changes in precipitation
depend on the time period over which the changes are measured. Although consistent with
the expected effects of climate change, none of these changes can be attributed specifically to
the effects of climate change.

Implications of Climate Change
These results have major implications for Zimbabwe's water resources. Water supply to urban
and rural areas in the south and west of the country could be seriously affected. Given the
dependence of many Zimbabweans in rural areas on groundwater, this implies that climate
change could also have severe effects on rural populations. A Southern African Development
Community (SADC) study supported this conclusion. It found that the population at very high
risk from groundwater drought in Zimbabwe could rise from 32% to 86% by 2100 unless
measures were taken to adapt to the effects of climate change.

When the reduction in runoff and groundwater recharge is coupled with possible scenarios of
population growth, national per capita water availability decreases significantly. Even under
the best case greenhouse gas emissions scenario and a low population growth scenario,
national per capita water availability declines by 38% from 2.45 Ml per capita per year in year
2012to 1.52 Ml per capita per year by 2050. Under medium or high population growth
scenarios, national per capita water availability continues to decline to 2080 to the point where
Zimbabwe would move from the UNs “water stress” to the “absolute water scarcity” category.


       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
xiii   Management in Zimbabwe
There are also potential economic implications. Both rainfed and irrigated agriculture would
face reduced yields; electricity production from both thermal and hydropower stations would
be reduced if flows in the Zambezi River were reduced and consequently sectors dependent on
electricity, including manufacturing, commerce and mining, would be affected; and many
manufacturing enterprises would face water shortages.

There are implications for water resources investments and management. Existing dams built
for water supply and irrigation may become less reliable. Current plans to rehabilitate the
country's water resources infrastructure do not take account of climate change. Yet reduced
precipitation and increased evaporation in southern and western parts of Zimbabwe could have
significant implications when selecting dams for rehabilitation or when designing new dams.
Increasing investment in infrastructure, by itself, is not likely to be an efficient response to
reduced water availability. Instead a multi-pronged strategy including better governance and
improved management would help existing water resources go further in a more economical
manner.

The final implication of climate change is that there is likely to be increased reliance on
groundwater because, unlike surface water, it is shielded from evaporative losses and better
buffered against increased climate variability. Surface and groundwater are closely linked and
should be managed together. Yet, at present, groundwater in Zimbabwe receives very little
management attention.

More generally, water management and planning should take account of the likely effects of
climate change, to the point where anticipation of the potential effects of climate change
becomes a normal part of operational thinking. There are many opportunities for the water
sector to adapt to climate change.

Adaptation Opportunities
Adaptation in advance of climate change means that water can be captured and used more
efficiently in the face of declining availability, and managers and water users can respond more
flexibly in the face of increased variability. SADC suggests that adaptation can occur at three
levels water governance, infrastructure development, and water management. We have
extended this structure by broadening the third category to include water planning and
separating out information, communications and education. Many of the most effective
adaptation measures constitute no-regrets actions.
Water Governance
Possibly the most important governance action is to ensure genuine coordination between
water managers and water using sectors to promote efficiency in water supply and in water
demand. Various policy instruments (e.g. the NWP and the Environmental Management Act)
promote coordination, but the difficulty has been in putting these intentions into action.
Without coordination and determination to enforce legislative provisions, it will be impossible
to implement actions that protect water sources, prevent water pollution, plan for efficient
water use, or introduce water demand measures that will make better use of existing water. All
these actions span the responsibilities of a number of Ministries. Sectoral policies should be
examined to ensure that they address climate change.

Given the importance of transboundary waters, especially the Zambezi River and the Limpopo
River, to Zimbabwe's economy, Zimbabwe needs to provide strong support for transboundary
water institutions to take account of the effects of climate change on their water management.
Zimbabwe's hosting of ZAMCOM, the Zambezi Watercourse Commission, is consistent with
this approach.

Water pricing should be reviewed to develop a strategy to charge for water's true cost. This will
not only improve water use efficiency by encouraging water conservation and water recycling,
but will provide the funds for ZINWA and local authorities to carry out important rehabilitation
and climate related initiatives. Establishing the independent Water and Wastewater Services
Regulatory Unit would help set water prices at levels where costs can be met. Also an informal
water market could be investigated as a mechanism to promote more flexible and efficient use
of water.

Adaptation should also be encouraged amongst local communities and individual farmers.
This may entail shifting more responsibility and authority to local level to legitimize local
initiatives.

Conjunctive management of surface and groundwater and greater use of managed aquifer
recharge (with appropriate protections for groundwater quality) could be encouraged
through regulations and guidelines to increase the efficiency with which groundwater is used.
Water Resources Planning and Management
Water management techniques such as demand management, increased reuse of wastewater
and stormwater, conjunctive management, managed aquifer recharge and rainwater
harvesting could make greater use of existing resources and help adapt to a drier climate.
Operating procedures could also be improved, including increased rates of fee collection,
reductions in unaccounted-for water, and pricing water at its true cost.

Natural systems such as wetlands and riparian areas that provide a cost effective buffering
capacity against pollution and floods should be better protected and/or restored where they
are damaged.

Protection of water sources and improving management of water quality through a more
effective arrangement and cooperation between ZINWA and the Environmental Management
Agency (EMA) would not only improve human and environmental health but would expand
the available supply of useable water.

Building greater capacity and understanding in Catchment Councils would help encourage
local responses to the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, it will take some time for this
capacity to develop and it would be important for ZINWA to help Councils revise and update
River System Outline Plans that are responsive to the likely effects of climate change in
individual catchments.

Rules and procedures governing the allocation of water (issuing of water permits are based on
historical experience and) may need to be revised to take account of the effects of climate
change on rainfall and evaporation patterns.


      Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
 xv   Management in Zimbabwe
Water Resources Infrastructure
Plans to help Zimbabwe rehabilitate its water resources infrastructure, including water supply
for Bulawayo and Harare, should be assessed in light of the likely effects of climate change.
Design standards for dams, bridges, flood levees, etc could also be reassessed to take account of
the likely effects of climate change on precipitation variability and extreme events.

ZINWA is currently assessing the acceptable level of risk for agreement water. Increasing the
level of risk (for example, from 4% to 10% for urban water supply and 10% to 20% for irrigation
water supply) would help increase land under irrigation and promote production. The yields
from catchments should be recalculated to incorporate changes in precipitation patterns and
evaporation.

Although there is a general drying of the annual rainfall in southern Zimbabwe, there will also be
an increased probability of extreme events, such as storms. Flood control measures will need to
be designed to take account of more intense storms, employing both structural and non-
structural measures. This could include better protection and management of floodplains and
wetlands to absorb floodwaters and better operation of flood control dams.
Information, Education and Communications
A wide ranging communications strategy is important so that decision makers and those
potentially affected by climate change are aware of both the threats and the opportunities for
adapting. Senior decision makers inside and outside government need to be fully informed;
adaptation actions will only be pursued vigorously when there is a full appreciation of climate
change and the importance for the Zimbabwe's economy and social well-being of early
adaptation actions in the water sector. But the general public too needs to be forewarned of the
consequences of climate change so that they can engage in adaptation responses.

Some of the strategies that farmers and communities already use to adapt to climate variability
could be assessed and promulgated to help a wider cross-section of Zimbabwean communities
prepare for climate change.

Improving climate and surface and groundwater monitoring is critical to all of the major water
management decisions, including understanding climate change. The weather and surface
water monitoring network needs to be rehabilitated, and a groundwater monitoring network
needs to be established and expanded.

Assessment of groundwater is essential to properly plan, develop and manage this vital water
resource. Investigations into groundwater dependent ecosystems would help protect these
important systems for times when the climate is drier.

It would be valuable to build capacity in modelling climate change and its effects by forming a
Centre of Excellence drawing on expertise from across the government and academic areas.
Universities should incorporate climate change into engineering, planning and natural
resources courses so that the next generation of professionals is aware of and informed about
global warming and its implications for water resources management and other sectors.

Findings and Recommendations
This study has illustrated the need for better scientific information if Zimbabwe is to develop a
defensible strategy for climate change adaptation in the water sector. These include better data
on climate and surface and groundwater systems gathered through comprehensive
monitoring programs; better understanding of groundwater characteristics; predictive models
of surface and groundwater systems; accurate assessment of current and future uses of water
by the different sector; and a more comprehensive exercise to model the potential impact of
climate change on water resources than was possible here. These studies would support a
comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Water Sector to implement some
of the adaptation opportunities identified in this report. Such a strategy could constitute the
Water Sector's contribution to implementing the NCCRS and recommendations of the WSIA.

The formation of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate merging the mandates of the
three key areas environment, water and climate under the new cabinet provides an excellent
opportunity to re-align and work out effective coordination at the policy, regulatory and
institutional levels to systematically address climate change adaptation in the water and water
related sectors.

1. Water and the Economy



Water and the Economy
Starting in 2009, the Zimbabwean economy began to recover after almost a decade of decline
(World Bank 2012b). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 6% in 2009 and over 9% in 2010
and 2011, although it slowed to 4.7% in 2012 (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch
International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners, 2013a).
Agriculture grew by 34% in 2010. Mining grew by 35% between 2009 and 2011. However, this
economic resurgence is threatened by both financial factors (limited access to international
funding, liquidity shortages and economic uncertainty) and production factors such as power
shortfalls, unreliable supply of raw materials and broken or partially functioning infrastructure.

Historically, Zimbabwe's economy has been strongly linked to climate (rainfall in particular),
and so there has been a close link between water resources and the overall economy. Before and
for almost two decades after independence, Zimbabwe employed a water sector strategy that
relied on the development of dams, water supply and sewerage systems and irrigation systems
coupled with institutional and legal reforms to counter its highly variable climate and meet its
growing water needs for domestic supply and irrigation. This was an effective strategy until the
late 1990s but failed in the last decade because of the economic and political crisis.
Rehabilitating dams, restoring power supply and irrigation systems, rehabilitating water and
sewerage systems and reinstating the institutional and legal reforms as part of the country's
recovery, while essential, will no longer be sufficient, because human induced climate change
poses an additional burden and threat to long-term economic recovery that is not yet widely
recognized, appreciated and integrated in development planning.

Improving water security how well water resources are harnessed, utilized, conserved,
protected and managed for multi-sectoral uses-is a core development challenge for
Zimbabwe's economic recovery, growth and social development (Government of Zimbabwe,
2013). Water is central to the performance of key sectors of the Zimbabwean economy rural
and urban development, agriculture, energy, industry, mining, tourism, and the environment.
Figure 1 shows a close relationship between precipitation and GDP from the early 1980s until
the mid-1990s. However, this link was broken after 1996 when other factors, including new
settlement policies and increasing international isolation led to decline in GDP even when
precipitation remained high

The precipitation-GDP relationship occurs primarily because of the centrality of agriculture
and electricity production within the economy (Figure 2). Both are heavily dependent on
precipitation. Although agriculture itself currently constitutes only about 14% of GDP, it
remains central to economic performance because it provides employment for about 60-70%
of the population, contributes to export revenue, and has strong links to other sectors,
particularly manufacturing where it provides about 60% of the raw materials. Manufacturing
and commercial institutions generally have relatively low direct water demands, but they are
dependent on reliable power supply. Some 80% of Zimbabwe's electricity comes from the
Kariba dam with the remainder from thermal power generators that are largely reliant on

Reliable power supply is key for water supply and wastewater treatment and disposal,
irrigation, manufacturing, and for growing sectors such as mining and tourism. The current
national generating capacity of 1300 MW is about 700 MW short of unsuppressed demand
resulting in rolling blackouts that have had significant impacts throughout industrial, mining
and commercial production. If mining projects now under consideration come on-stream, an
additional 500 MW will be required by 2016 (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch
International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013a). While

          Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
   2      Management in Zimbabwe
electricity production has been hampered by lack of maintenance and lack of spare parts, it is
also dependent on maintenance of water levels in reservoirs for both hydropower production
and cooling of thermal power plants.

Mining has grown rapidly in recent years and is now one of the main export earners. Water is
required for both mineral extraction and processing. While direct water requirements can
generally be met by mining companies from surface and groundwater sources and from
recycling, reliable water provision for electricity production remains a potential threat to the
industry. Pollution from mining can also affect water quality and hence the quantity of useable
water.

Tourism, one of the emerging contributors to the economy, is also dependent on water
resources, both for maintaining the natural ecosystems (such as Victoria Falls) that many
tourists seek and for providing services such as safe food and water and reliable sanitation.

Water, Health and the Environment
Water is essential for social development while reliable, safe water supply and sanitation
underpins a healthy, productive society and workforce. Maintaining water resources in good
condition assists with meeting Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) such as ending poverty
and hunger, promoting access to education, and improving child and maternal health.
However, Zimbabwe's water quality has deteriorated significantly over the last decade. The
water quality problems arise from four factors:
 ?     increasing population with consequent increasing pollution loads,
 ?     expansion of mining, particularly artisanal mining and increasing pollution loads,
 ?     breakdown in water supply treatment and wastewater treatment, and reduced capacity
       to control contaminants in water supplies and receiving waters, and,
 ?     deterioration of the natural environment's ability to reduce contamination.

The consequences of pollution and deteriorating water quality are being felt across all
segments of the society, with greatest impact on the poor who have fewer alternative sources
for water.

Population has grown by about 24% since 1990 (from 10.47 million to 12.97 million in 2012)
without a concomitant increase in the capacity of facilities for collecting and safely disposing of
wastes. In addition, the breakdown of water supply and sanitation collection and treatment
systems has further endangered human health in urban and rural areas. Outbreaks of water-
related diseases such as cholera, typhoid and gastro-intestinal diseases that affect economic
production and human well-being are partly attributable to unreliable water supply and
sanitation services arising from lack of maintenance and unreliable power supply as well as
increasing pollution loads from increasing population.

In addition, many of the wetlands and riparian areas that provide a natural buffer against the
impacts of pollution are now in a seriously degraded state. These areas are now encroached on
and cultivated by local farmers because of their relatively fertile soils. These practices have
destroyed their ability to provide a buffer against floodwaters, remove contaminants from
overland flow and river waters, act as groundwater recharge zones, and provide habitat for
ecologically beneficial organisms. Thus, wetlands and naturally vegetated riparian zones along

                                                       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
                                                                                           Management in Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                      3
the Chinyika River below the Hatfield sewage treatment plant (STP) helped remove excess
nutrients before they reached Mazowe Dam and fuelled aquatic weeds and algal blooms (Bere
2007). Natural riparian areas can also help remove heavy metals, toxicants and sediments.
Magadza (2008) calls for a policy to protect wetlands from development and introduce
additional artificial wetlands, along with behavioural changes by residents to reduce runoff
borne nutrients and other contaminants.

In the worst cases, wetlands, floodplains and riparian areas have become sources of
contamination that affect human health rather than areas of amelioration. This is most
apparent where alluvial mining has destroyed river banks and beds and floodplains, promoted
sedimentation of downstream dams and siltation of water supply systems, and introduced
mercury into rivers. Artisanal mining has introduced mercury, a highly dangerous neurotoxin,
into the environment with significant impacts on human health. A United Nations (UN) project
between 2002 and 2007 estimated that about 25 tonnes of mercury were being used in gold
panning in Zimbabwe each year and found that children and miners in the panning areas had
high incidences of mercury intoxication (Steckling et al 2011) potentially affecting brain
development in children and mental functioning in adults.


Zimbabwe Response to Climate Variability and Climate Change
Zimbabwe has always faced a variable climate. Following independence, development of dams
became an important policy objective for improving access to and storing water and dealing
with climate variability. There are currently more than 8000 large and small dams in Zimbabwe
developed by the Government and the private sector to provide a reliable water supply. This
figure includes numerous small dams for conservation purposes as well as very large dams such
as the Kariba dam on the Zambezi River. About 245 dams are registered as large dams in terms
of the Water Act and the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD). Over 70% of these
dams were owned by syndicates of (commercial) farmers before the land reforms. Most of
these farmers are no longer on the land. Accordingly ZINWA has taken over the ownership of
these dams and their operation and maintenance to ensure their safety.

In the late 1990s, Zimbabwe introduced policy reforms including the establishment of ZINWA,
and basin responsibility for water allocation and management through Catchment and sub-
catchment councils. A National Water Resources Management Strategy was also prepared.
However, these initiatives to deal with climate variability and efficient use of water were
undermined by the economic collapse and Zimbabwe's international isolation. Now, as the
economy recovers, it is apparent that simply returning to the previous strategy for water use
under a variable climate will no longer be adequate. The growing understanding of the impacts
of climate change means that water management and planning and infrastructure design and
operations need to be adapted to the potential consequences of a reduced mean annual
precipitation (MAP) and increased variability.

The increase in greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and land clearing has led to a
warming of the global climate over the last 100 years. This is now evident from increases in
global average land and sea temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice cover, retreat of
glaciers and rising sea levels. At the time of the last International Panel on Climate Change



       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  4    Management in Zimbabwe
(IPCC) report (IPCC 2007a) eleven of the twelve years from 1995-2006 ranked amongst the
twelve warmest on record; arctic temperatures have warmed at almost twice the global rate and
arctic sea ice has melted earlier and more extensively in recent years; and global sea levels have
increased 3.1 mm per year from 1993 to 2003. Land temperatures have increased more rapidly
than have temperatures over the oceans, because of the buffering effect of the oceans.

Zimbabwe signed and ratified the UNFCCC in June 1992 and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol on
Climate Change in June 2009. However, implementation of these agreements has been
fragmented, with legislative and administrative responses contained in diverse sector policies,
strategies and plans. In 2012, the Government initiated the preparation of the National Climate
Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) as a response to the need for integrating climate change
responses across all sectors1. The Strategy, due for completion later in 2013, is intended to
mainstream action on climate change in all key economic sectors (agriculture, industry, energy,
mining, transport and tourism), including in water resources, and promote less carbon
intensive pathways in economic activities. Even if the world eventually limits green house gas
emissions through mitigation actions, there are sufficient greenhouse gases already in the
atmosphere to maintain global warming for two or three generations. Consequently, there
needs to be a strong emphasis on adaption measures to limit the impacts of climate change
locally.

Objectives of the Paper
This paper has been prepared at the request of the former Ministry of Water Resources
Development and Management (MWRDM), now part of the new Ministry of Environment,
Water and Climate (MEWC), to help highlight the potential impacts of climate change on the
hydrological cycle and to strengthen the water-related aspects of the NCCRS. It builds on the
recommendation of the 2013 NWP. Not only is economic development strongly dependent on
water resources, but nearly 70% of natural disasters in Zimbabwe are water related due to
climate variability (floods and droughts). Consequently, the MEWC believes that hydrological
implications and water needs to be at the heart of the climate change discourse in Zimbabwe.

The primary objective of the Paper is to develop a common and comprehensive understanding
of climate change impacts and risks on water resources, their implication on current and future
water resources planning, design and operations, and to identify the types and range of
adaptation options and opportunities available to address climate change risks and to build
resilience in Zimbabwe.

Apart from supporting and strengthening the NCCRS, this paper will contribute to water
resources management by widening the understanding amongst water resources professionals
about the predicted impacts of climate change. Climate change will affect a wide range of water
resources planning and management decisions and topics, including:
   ?   the design and operation of infrastructure, including the rehabilitation of dams and
       irrigation systems;
   ?   policy issues relating to the management of transboundary waters, especially sharing
       the waters of the Zambezi and Limpopo river systems;
   ?   water allocation and water use planning, and;

The audiences for this report are policy makers and senior decision makers, technical w a t e r
resources specialists and water users, including sectoral water agencies.


Methodology
The study is based on three principal methodological inputs. First, the likely impacts of climate
change on Zimbabwe's water resources in 2050 and 2080 were estimated using a downscaled
global circulation model. These dates were chosen to be compatible with the NCCRS study.
Second, lessons were drawn on local impacts of climate change from five diverse water sector
case studies - Bulawayo water supply, Harare water supply, Roswa Dam Operations, Limpopo
Basin Irrigation, and Kariba hydropower operations. Thirdly, a modified version of the SADC
climate change adaptation framework (SADC 2011) was used to suggest options that would
allow Zimbabwe to adapt to climate change.

The study is supported through three technical studies that provided specialist information:
 ?     Climate change impacts on precipitation and runoff a national study to model climate
       change impacts on precipitation and runoff across Zimbabwe in 2050 and 2080 and the
       implications for per capita water availability;
 ?     Climate change implications on water resources decision making a description of the
       hydrological assumptions used in current water resources decision making under the
       assumption of stationarity, and a discussion of the implications of climate change on
       future water resources decision making;
 ?     Climate change impacts on groundwater and recharge a review of the current
       groundwater situation in Zimbabwe and projected groundwater and recharge
       conditions under climate change.
       There are a number of initiatives either underway or recently completed that were also
       integrated into this study (Appendix A). These include:
 ?     Water, Climate and Development Programme (WACDEP) a Global Water Partnership
       (GWP) project supporting the African Ministers Council on Water initiative to integrate
       climate resilience into development planning, build climate resilience and support
       countries increase investments in water security (Global Water Partnership, 2011)
       (2011-2016)
 ?     The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) study to review the
       impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in Zimbabwe(Brown et al 2013)
       (completed);
 ?     An assessment by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) of the impact
       of climate change on irrigation potential in the Limpopo Basin, including Mzingwane
       catchment in Zimbabwe(completed);
 ?     An economic evaluation of water resources development and management options for
       the Zambezi River Basin that included a scenario that incorporated the effects of climate
       change on river flows and increased evaporation (completed);
 ?     The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Global Environment Facility
       (GEF) Coping with Drought and Climate Change project(the UNDP/GEF project) that
       as demonstrated a range of approaches for adaptation to climate change among rural
       communities in Chiredzi district as a model for national action (2007-2011);

Structure of the Paper
This report contains seven chapters. This, the first chapter, establishes the importance of water
resources to Zimbabwe's economy and the need to place water management at the centre of
the NCCRS. The second chapter describes the effects of climate variability and climate change
on water resources, while Chapter 3 summarizes the state of Zimbabwe's water resources, and
current and future demand for water. Chapter 4 presents the results from the modelling of
climate change impacts on surface waters and the potential impact on groundwater resources,
and the consequent implications for water resources planning, management and
infrastructure. The importance of recognizing the potential impact of climate change is
illustrated in Chapter 5 through six case studies. Chapter 6 presents ways in which Zimbabwe
can adapt to climate change through both national and local actions, while Chapter 7
summarizes the findings from this study together with specific studies and investigations to
help develop a robust climate change adaptation strategy for the water sector. Appendix A
provides details of previous and current studies that include climate change on water resources
in Zimbabwe or Southern Africa. Appendix B contains details of groundwater resources in
Zimbabwe.

2. Water and Climate



Natural climate variability and human induced climate change are sometimes confused. In this
chapter we will distinguish between these concepts and explain the implications of both
natural climate variability as well as human induced climate change for Zimbabwean water
resources.

Climate Variability
Climate variability describes the variability in climate parameters, such as precipitation, on
spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. The familiar sequence of
a rainy season starting in October followed by a dry season starting in March or even April is an
example of natural temporal climate variability in Zimbabwe. There is also spatial variability in
this climate pattern, with the western parts of Zimbabwe typically being the first to receive the
rains while the southern and south eastern parts occasionally experience the incursion of south
easterlies that brings in drizzle associated with Guti type of weather2.

The climate also varies considerably between years. For example, the rains fail between 1 and 3
years every 10 years (United Nations Development Programme and Global Environment
Facility, 2007). Zimbabwe also has a history of severe floods driven by cyclones (Table 1).
Droughts and floods have very high social as well as economic costs. Some 80% of
Zimbabweans are farmers or are engaged in agro-industry, and so the economic damage,
impacts on livelihoods and human suffering associated with extreme weather events can be
very high including water and food shortages, poor health outcomes, economic losses to
subsistence and commercial farmers, and destruction of infrastructure.

Some of the natural climate variability results from the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
whereby changes in sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific result in rainfall
anomalies in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. The correlation between El Nino events and
droughts in Zimbabwe is very high. The years in which there were warm sea surface
temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific (1982/83,1986/87, 1987/88, 1991/92,
1994/95, 1997/98, 2002/03, 2004/05, 2006/07 and 2009/10)were all years of drought in
Zimbabwe and other southern African countries. El Nino events can now be predicted 6 to 8

months ahead and, although there are a number of other factors that influence the severity of
the drought in Zimbabwe, this provides an important early warning of likely drought years.

However, the conventional belief has been that, while climate varies between seasons within
years and between years, the long-term mean and the variance of climate parameters remain
constant. That is, the average climate that we have experienced in the past and its variability
around that average will continue into the future. This assumption has been the basis for
designing hydraulic infrastructure including dams in Zimbabwe. This belief, called the
stationarity assumption, allows engineers to plan for infrastructure by assuming that future
hydrology repeats itself and will be the same as that experienced in the past (Davis 2011).

Climate variability has a number of water resource planning and management implications.
First, the more variable the climate, the larger irrigation and water supply storages need to be
to achieve a given level of security of supply (or risk that would be acceptable). Similarly, flood
control dams also need to be larger to cope with increasingly large floods. Secondly, there is
likely to be a greater need for irrigated agriculture to maintain food security when dry land
farming experiences frequent drought. Thirdly, a high degree of climate variability implies a
need for good climate and water resources monitoring, so that approaching droughts can be
anticipated and planned for.

Climate Change
Climate change describes the change in climate parameters from the warming of the earth's
atmosphere as a result of human activities such as increasing emissions of greenhouse gases
such as CO2, land use change and emissions of aerosols. This warming will likely change the
average climate, as well as the variability of the climate, experienced in a particular region or
location. That is, the stationary assumption no longer holds, and both the average climate and
its variability will change in the future as a consequence of global warming3. The change may
occur over periods ranging from decades to millennia. Average temperatures will rise as a result
of climate change and climate variability will also increase. Thus, engineers cannot assume that
infrastructure designed for past climates will be suitable (or reliable) for the future.

A recent World Bank investigation (World Bank 2013) into the consequences of global warming
of either 2°C (best case scenario) or 4°C (increasingly likely scenario) in three regions sub-
Saharan Africa (Box 1), South-east Asia and South Asia found that unprecedented heat
extremes would occur more frequently and cover larger areas, water availability would decline
by between 20-50% depending on the rate of global warming, crop yields could decrease, and
terrestrial ecosystems could be altered with temperature extremes well beyond the present
range. These impacts constitute significant risks to humans and the natural environment (Box
2).

 According to the UNFCCC (undated), “Climate Change refers to a change in climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters
the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.”

Box 1 Climate Change Impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa


  For sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank envisages major risks from global warming:
   ?     Even if global warming is limited to 2°C, there are large regional risks to food
         production, particularly if adaptation measures are inadequate;
   ?     Up to 30% reduction in annual precipitation with 4°C warming with groundwater
         recharge decreasing by 50-70%;
   ?     Increased aridity, especially in southern Africa, with shortened growing seasons and
         declines in crop yields;
   ?     Regime shifts in ecosystems, with the area of savanna grasslands being reduced
         with consequent reduction in forage for grazing animals;;
   ?     Increases in malnutrition, with even 1.2-1.9°C warming leading to a 50-90%
         increase in undernourishment.

The IPCC (2007a) predicts that semi-arid regions of southern Africa are at risk of a reduction in
precipitation and water resources during the dry season as a result of climate change. There
may also be a delay in the onset of the rainy season. A subsequent analysis of country-level
vulnerability to climate change, based on the five broad measures - resilience to stress on water
resources, population density, historical exposure to climate related hazards, governance, and
household vulnerability-found that countries of the eastern Zambezi Basin (Zimbabwe, Malawi,
Mozambique) were the most vulnerable in Southern Africa (Shah et al 2011).


Box 2 Risk, Vulnerability and Resilience

 In this report, we follow the IPCC definitions of the important concepts of risk, vulnerability
 and resilience.

 Risk is 'the combination of the probability of an event and its consequences'. Thus risk
 measures the extent of the expected loss from climate change. Note that hydrologists
 measure the reliability of water supply in terms of the risk that they will not be able to meet
 demand in a given year. Currently, ZINWA construct and operate their dams to provide a
 10% risk; i.e. 90% reliability of being able to supply water in a given year.

 Vulnerability measures the degree to which geophysical, biological and socio-economic
 systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts of climate change
 (International Panel on Climate Change 2007b).

 Resilience describes with the ability of a system, including management systems, to adapt
 to the impacts of climate change without excessive harm. It is determined by the degree to
 which the social system is capable of organizing itself to increase its capacity for learning
 from past disasters for better future protection and to improve risk reduction measures.

Implications of Climate Change
Climate change will affect runoff and stream flow as well as groundwater infiltration although
there are many factors involved and the relationships are complex and difficult to predict.
These factors include changes in evaporation, vegetation response to climate change and
associated changes in transpiration, and changes in land uses and patterns of water use. The
draft NCCRS states that by 2050 temperature rise alone will cause evaporation to increase by
between 5 and 15 percent. It is likely that in countries such as Zimbabwe, where precipitation is
predicted to decrease and evaporation is likely to increase under climate change, runoff into
rivers will decrease significantly although it is difficult to make accurate quantitative
predictions. Reduced river flows will reduce water in storages affecting irrigated agriculture,
water supply to urban and some rural communities, industries dependent on water including
mining, and the natural environment.

Droughts occur as the result of a number of meteorological and hydrological factors, including
the extent and timing of precipitation, evaporation (which itself is dependent on temperature,
cloudiness, wind speed, etc), and water use by vegetation. Just as with stream flow and
groundwater infiltration, these factors will be affected by climate change in complex ways,
making it very difficult to predict how climate change will influence droughts. Nevertheless,
from general principles, it is likely that droughts will set in more quickly, be more intense (i.e.
drier), and last longer because of climate change, although it is not clear if they will be more
frequent (Trenberth et al 2014).

Climate change will affect water demand by water-using sectors because of decreased
precipitation and increased evapotranspiration. This will place additional pressure on
irrigation and water supply systems. Modelling studies suggest that net farm revenues would
decrease by US$0.4 billion with a 2.5°C temperature increase without adaptation measures (De
Witt 2006). In addition, increased variability in precipitation increases the need for dam storage
and expansion of irrigation to reduce the dependence on rainfed agriculture.

The reduction in precipitation is also likely to lead to reduced recharge of groundwater
although associated changes in land use and vegetation and changes in river flow patterns
(where groundwater is connected to surface water) will also affect the extent of recharge
reduction. Declining aquifer levels will lead to increased pumping costs, reduced water
availability for cities and rural communities dependent on groundwater, and reductions in base
flows of rivers in dry seasons.

Climate change poses a threat to both human livelihoods and the functioning of ecosystems.
Initially the international community responded by establishing international agreements to
reduce the discharge of greenhouse gases through mechanisms such as the Kyoto Protocol.
However, mitigation measures such as adoption of more efficient uses of fossil fuels, promotion
of renewable sources of energy, and the cessation of forest clearing and expansion of other
carbon sinks have largely failed to halt the continuing rise in greenhouse gas concentrations
and the accompanying rise in global temperatures. Consequently, there is now more attention
being given to making climate-smart investment decisions (Alavian et al 2009) in order to
adapt to a warmer world (Box 3). In Southern Africa, adaptation needs to be the main priority
because African countries only contribute to a very small portion of global emissions of
greenhouse gases (Davis 2011).

Box 3 Climate Mitigation and Adaptation


  The IPCC defines mitigation as “human interventions to reduce the sources or enhance the
  sinks of greenhouse gases”. Adaptation is “the adjustment in natural or human systems in
  response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or
  exploits beneficial opportunities”. Mitigation has primarily global benefits whereas
  adaptation typically works at regional or local scale. Mitigation has long term benefits
  whereas adaptation measures can have immediate benefits including by reduction in
  vulnerability to climate variability. In other words, adaptation can show greater rates of
  return compared to mitigation measures. Consequently mitigation tends to occur through
  international agreements whereas adaptation can be initiated through the self-interest of
  the private sectors facilitated by public policies.

  Source: IPCC 2007c



Within the water sector, adaptation actions can include both structural and non-structural
measures. Examples include:
?     improving coordination between water management agencies and the water using
      sector;
?     investing in infrastructure such as dams to retain water and flood levees because of the
      predicted increase in frequency and intensity of dry and wet periods promoting
      recycling and reuse of water to reduce total demand for water;
?     protecting water quality to ensure that existing water sources can be used safely;
?     building institutional capacity to improve understanding and response to climate
      change;
?     strengthening monitoring and interpretation systems so that decision-makers have
      reliable information;
?     undertaking education programs to improve the uptake of water conservation
      measures by water users.

Sound adaptation is inextricably linked to sound development practices. It is virtually
impossible to separate the two. As these examples illustrate, many adaptation actions are
consistent with good water management practices under the Integrated Water Resources
Management paradigm that is embraced in Zimbabwe's NWP. These are called “no regrets”
adaptation actions because they are worth undertaking in their own right, irrespective of the
effects of climate change. More formally, no regrets actions are defined by the IPCC as those
“that have negative net costs because they generate benefits that are large enough to offset the
costs of implementing the actions”. Low regret actions are those that require relatively small
additional expenses to adapt to climate change.

Climate Change in Zimbabwe
These global results are broadly consistent with observed recent climate changes in Zimbabwe,
although it is not possible to attribute the changes specifically to global warming. Zimbabwe
has experienced more hot and fewer cold days since 1950 (Figure 3) with daily minimum and
maximum temperatures rising by approximately 2.6°C and 2°C respectively over the last
century (Brown et al 2012).



         Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  12     Management in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe is widely reported to have experienced a small decline in MAP (about 5%) since
1900, although this decline is much less than the variability in annual precipitation (up to 20%
of the mean). However, the reality of this claimed decline in precipitation appears to depend on
which meteorological stations are chosen and the length of record analysed. In a thorough
analysis of all reliable records, Mazvimavi (2010) found that there was no evidence of a decline
in annual rainfall or seasonal rainfall when records for the 1892 to 2000 period at 40 stations in
Zimbabwe were examined. He concluded that “Effects of global warming on rainfall that may
have occurred are not yet statistically identifiable within the available rainfall time series”.

There has also been an increasing variability in annual precipitation since 1910 with increasing
departures from MAP (Figure 3). Extreme weather events, namely tropical cyclones and
drought, are also believed to have increased in frequency and intensity although this has not
been verified statistically. According to the Meteorological Services Department, here has been
a shift in the mean rainfall start dates for the main rainfall season from 22 November in the
1960s to 27 November under the present climate regime, and many of the wet seasons are
punctuated by mid-season dry spells resulting in unreliable crop harvests.

These results accord with farmer perceptions. Gwimbi (2009) found that about 60 percent of
surveyed farmers in Gokwe District believed that there had been an increase in temperature and
a decline in precipitation. Almost 75 percent of the farmers reported a greater frequency of
water-deficit years, with a later on set and an earlier end to the rainy season. While these beliefs
are impressionistic rather than scientific, they indicate a perception that the climate is getting
drier and more variable and potentially a willingness to adopt adaptive strategies.

Flow records are also broadly consistent with these expectations. There has been a decrease in
mean annual runoff of 9-11% at six gauging stations where medium term records (1984-2007)
are available (World Bank 2012a) although the decrease cannot be attributed specifically to
decreased precipitation and the period of record is too short to attribute this to a long term
decline in river flow. Calibrated river flow models would be needed to be able to investigate the
role that reduced precipitation may have played in this decline.

3. Water Resources Availability and Use



Climate change will affect the quantity and reliability of Zimbabwe's renewable water
resources. In this chapter we discuss the quantity and quality of current surface and
groundwater resources, and current demands on those resources.


Water Resources
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates Zimbabwe's internal renewable water
resources to be 12.26 km3/year, of which 11.26 km3 are surface water resources and 6.00 km3
are groundwater resources. The overlap between surface water and groundwater resources is
estimated to be 5.00 km3.

There are seven river basins within Zimbabwe (Figure 4). Zimbabwe also shares the waters of
the Zambezi and Limpopo River basins as well as other smaller transboundary surface waters
with Mozambique and Botswana.




Figure 4 River basins of Zimbabwe

The hydrogeology of Zimbabwe is primarily based on lithology with the four main aquifers
being the Lomagundi dolomite aquifer, Nyamandhlovu forest sandstone aquifer, Kalahari
sands, and Save alluvial deposits. Apart from the alluvial aquifers associated with
transboundary rivers, Zimbabwe does not have transboundary groundwater resources
(although there may be shared groundwater in the Nata basin).
          Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  14      Management in Zimbabwe
Precipitation and evaporation
Zimbabwe has a highly variable climate both spatially and temporally. Zimbabwe's mean annual
precipitation (MAP) is 657 mm/annum with a distinct gradient from the drier south to the
wetter north of the country (Figure 5). The wet season usually extends from October to April
with December, January and February being the peak precipitation months. However, there is
considerable inter-annual variability in both precipitation (Figure 6) and runoff, ranging from
16 percent on the northern plateau to 48 percent in the Limpopo Valley.

Generally potential pan evaporation exceeds precipitation, with net pan evaporation ranging
from 1,400 mm in the high precipitation areas to 2,200 mm in the low lying areas.
Consequently, actual evapotranspiration is almost always less than potential
evapotranspiration.

Mean Annual Runoff
Zimbabwe's surface water resources were assessed in 1972, 1984 and 2007. The 2007 estimate
                                                6
of mean annual runoff (MAR) was 23.6x10 Ml, 18% greater than the 1984 estimate
          6
of19.9x10 Ml. This increase occurred over a period when there has been a decline in MAP. This
anomaly probably arises from a decline in the number and quality of gauging stations, a change
in methods for estimating MAR in ungauged areas, and an increase in land clearing leading to
increased runoff.

However, there is considerable uncertainty about the current state of Zimbabwe's surface water
resources because of the deterioration in flow and water quality monitoring. Of the 560
gauging stations built over the last 85 years only 330 are operational and of these 210 are either
inoperative or are not functioning well. The major problem is inadequate funding for
maintenance and rehabilitation. Many stations are silted up because of poor land and riparian
management and severe bank and floodplain damage from alluvial gold mining, while others
suffer from leaking walls and foundations of weirs and vandalism and theft of equipment.
Rating curves at most gauging stations have not been updated. Methods for storage and
analysis of gauging data are obsolete with the risk that data may be lost if computers fail. These
problems add to the difficulty of managing water resources under normal climate variability,
and if they are not addressed in a timely manner, would be compounded under climate change.

Table 2 summarises the potential water resources available on internal rivers, the storage that
must be built in order to achieve the yields for each catchment area, and the present committed
use for each catchment. At present only 25% of available yield (assuming a 10% risk of not
being able to meet the demand in a given year4) is utilized. Even allowing for environmental and
social water needs and the unsuitability of some regions for dam construction, this implies that
there is still a high potential to develop further water storage in Zimbabwe over the long term
where it is sensible and economic to do so.

The Zambezi River and the Limpopo River are Zimbabwe's two major transboundary water
courses, while the Save, Buzi and Pungwe rivers in eastern Zimbabwe flow into Mozambique
and Nata and Shashe rivers are shared with Botswana. The Zambezi is particularly important to
Zimbabwe because it is the source of the country's current and future electricity production.
Zimbabwe is party to a number of transboundary and bi-lateral water resources agreements.
Zimbabwe has ratified the Limpopo Watercourse Commission and the Zambezi Watercourse
Commission Agreements, and ratification of the revised SADC Protocol on Shared Water
courses is at an advanced stage. Zimbabwe has also established a Joint Water Commission with
Mozambique and similar joint Water Commission Agreements are expected to be signed with
the Republic of South Africa, Botswana and Zambia. Negotiations with the three countries have
already started.

Zimbabwe stores runoff in a large number of small and large dams including the giant Kariba
Dam whose total capacity of 180 km3 is shared with Zambia on a fifty percent (50%) basis. Most
of the permits of large dams are owned by the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA).
The country has invested heavily on the construction of over 8,000 dams with a total storage
                   6
capacity of 9 x 10 mega litres excluding Kariba Dam. Most of this water is used under the
permits of ZINWA.
Groundwater
Groundwater supports more than 70% of the Zimbabwe's population. Yet it has received very
little attention by water resources planners and managers since the mid-1980s because the
country concentrated on the provision of clean water from surface water resources.
Investigation and exploratory drilling virtually ceased at that time. However, drilling for
supplying drinking water has increased over the past decade as surface supplies have become
unreliable and problematic.

Groundwater occurs in both crystalline basement rocks (covering 65% of Zimbabwe) and in
sedimentary formations located in the north-west/north and the south-east of the country.
Crystalline aquifers generally have moderate recharge rates but low storage capacities. They are
often unconfined but may be perched and semi-unconfined locally. The sedimentary aquifers

                                                                                            Management in Zimbabwe

are only recharged in unconfined recharge areas, becoming confined when they dip beneath
impermeable formations. Although these sedimentary aquifers are considered to have the
highest groundwater development potential in Zimbabwe, they occur for the most part in areas
with the lowest population densities in the country.

Groundwater receives recharge principally from precipitation as both direct recharge and via
river-bed infiltration. The sustainable water yield from an aquifer is closely linked to its
recharge rate the more water an aquifer receives from recharge, the more water it can supply
for productive purposes. Discharge occurs via evapotranspiration, river base flow, inter-aquifer
transfers and pumping. In spite of the importance of understanding recharge rates, these rates
have not been quantified across Zimbabwe and recharge has only been estimated in semi-
quantitative and qualitative terms.

Sibanda et al (2009) propose an average recharge of 2.6 to 3.7% of MAP for the Karoo Forest
Sandstone. The range of recharge values for this area cited in the literature range from 0.4% of
precipitation to 11%, with a slightly higher percentage recharge rate expected on the adjacent
unconsolidated Kalahari sands. Barker et al. (1992) estimated groundwater recharge for the
Masvingo province at 2-5% of precipitation. The British Geological Survey (1989) estimated
groundwater recharge at between 8 and 16% of MAP.

More recently, groundwater recharge has been estimated using expert knowledge rather than
field measurements for each catchment based on the twin assumptions that recharge is an
increasing proportion of MAP (Table 3) and that precipitation dominates other factors (soil
type, geomorphology, etc) in determining recharge (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch
International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013a).

Water Quality
Water pollution from point and nonpoint sources is a serious, widespread and growing
problem across the country (World Bank 2012a). Rivers and reservoirs downstream of sewage
treatment plants have high pathogen counts, and high nutrient, biological oxygen demand
(BOD) and heavy metal concentrations. While cholera outbreaks are a highly visible
consequence of poor water quality, gastro-enteric illnesses are more common. Typhoid, spread
through contaminated food and water, is an ongoing problem. Heavy metals impact human
health and the environment fish from Lake Chivero that are contaminated with heavy metals
have recently been identified as potential source of cancer. Of the three barriers protecting

citizens of Harare from pathogens entering their drinking water wastewater treatment and
land disposal, natural absorption in well maintained and vegetated river and stream bank and
buffers around reservoirs, and water treatment plants only the last is now partially or fully
functioning.

Widespread discharges of industrial effluent are contributing nutrients, organic matter and
heavy metals to rivers. Nutrient enriched waters impose costs on water supply treatment and
increase operating and maintenance costs. Nutrient enrichment also leads to excessive growth
of aquatic weeds. High organic loads deplete the water of oxygen when they decay and can
lead to the release of metals and other toxic material from aquatic sediments.

Water pollution from diffuse sources in urban and agricultural areas is also increasing. These
sources are much harder to monitor and manage because they originate from many sources
that are spread over large areas. Alluvial mining activities in particular have become an
additional source of sediment and have caused riverine destruction in recent years. Riverine
sediments lead to siltation and loss of capacity in dams, eutrophication of reservoirs, additional
water treatment costs, degradation of drinking water for primary users, and environmental
impacts.

There is evidence that gold panning is also introducing mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, into
Zimbabwean rivers. A UN project between 2002 and 2007 estimated that about 25 tonnes of
mercury were being used in gold panning in Zimbabwe each year and found that children and
miners in the panning areas had high incidences of mercury intoxication (Steckling et al 2011).
Mercury contamination stunts brain development in children. No follow up study has been
conducted but the rising price of gold is increasing the demand for gold production and there is
a likelihood that the use of mercury is growing and the contamination is perhaps worsening.

Little attention has been paid to the protection of natural water sources springs, watersheds,
groundwater as well as developed sources dams and reservoirs. There is little information
available on degradation of groundwater recharge zones or on groundwater quality apart from
monitoring of very few specific sites of possible contamination. Nevertheless, it is likely that
aquifers are being polluted from land uses such as urban settlement, leaching from solid waste
disposal sites, underground tanks, intensive agriculture, mining and industry. There is growing
evidence of deteriorating water quality in most of the dams.

These water quality problems will intensify without government intervention. The recent NWP,
amongst other things, recommended the preparation of a strategy for protection of water
sources and management of water quality for Zimbabwe as an urgent priority. This strategy will
be in two phases. The first phase, which is currently underway, will be a rapid assessment of
selected pilot and will be used to identify pollution hotspots. The second phase will be anin-
depth assessment of all hotspots with recommendations for government action to reduce
water pollution and improve water quality.

Natural groundwater quality in Zimbabwe is mostly good for potable use. There are high
fluoride concentrations in the Karoo aquifers in the north and north-east and high salinity
levels in the Beit Bridge gneisses in the extreme south and south-east of the country.

Anthropogenic contamination is generally linked to major urban centers and mining. All
aquifers will tend to exhibit a reduction in water quality under conditions of reduced recharge.
Natural groundwater quality evolves by rockwater interactions towards more saline water, and
this process is ameliorated by recharge with fresh rainwater. When recharge is reduced, this
process of freshening is reduced and groundwater quality declines. The effect is greater at
depth where the freshening effect of new recharge is less.
Wastewater Reuse
Zimbabwe's major cities are situated on high ground at the top of catchments, and so water
authorities have been forced to develop water harnessing infrastructures at suitable sites down
the catchments at long distances and high pumping heads from the cities. Consequently,
                                                                                                5
treated wastewater forms a potentially important source of water for non-potable uses
because this water can be accessed close to the cities.Over the last 30 years, a number of urban
centres (Harare/Chitungwiza/Norton, Bulawayo, Gweru, Kwekwe, Kadoma) developed and
operated schemes to treat and reuse wastewater for crop and pasture irrigation, thereby
reducing the demand on primary water sources. However, these schemes have mostly fallen
into disrepair since the collapse of the water sector in 2008.

About 65% of potable water returns as wastewater. In volumetric terms, this means that
treated wastewater could provide about 350,000 Ml (approximate volume of Mazvikadei Dam)
of additional water if wastewater treatment plants operated at full capacity. Currently, these
plants are operating at 0-30% capacity resulting in raw or partially treated sewage being
discharged into reservoir or rivers.

Reusing treated wastewater has a number of advantages. Not only does it reduce the pressure
on surface and groundwater and pumping costs from downstream storage dams, but it would
reduce the pollution of lakes and rivers from discharges of raw sewage.At present sewage from
                                                                         6
Harare is being detected as far as Mushumbi Pools some 260 km away . Similarly pollution from
sewage discharges in Bulawayo is being detected beyond Sawmills, some 100km from
Bulawayo. Wastewater is also relatively insensitive to the effects of climate change.

Water Use and Demand
There has been a dramatic change in water demand following the introduction of the land
reforms and the subsequent financial crisis. Prior to these influences, surface water in
Zimbabwe was used mainly for irrigation (although irrigation water use is known to have
declined dramatically since 2008), followed by urban supply, primary water and environment,
mining and for cooling towers at thermal power stations (Figure 7 based on 2007 data, the last
year for which data are available). Rural areas have relied most heavily on groundwater; it is
only more recently that urban demand for groundwater has increased as reticulated water
supplies have become unreliable. The data collection procedures do not distinguish in detail
between broad sectoral groups and do not include water for primary uses or the environment.
Based on these data, total committed surface water7 was estimated at 3.57 x 106 Ml/yr, with
                                    6
agriculture accounting for 2.93 x 10 Ml/yr (80%).

environmental uses

The area under irrigation is estimated to have declined from 120,000 ha in 2000 to 51,000 ha in
2012 based on satellite imagery (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch International
Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013a), with the Runde and
Save catchments being the only ones where irrigation has not declined precipitously. The low
level of irrigation water use in 2010 and 2011 (following the land reforms) is shown in Figure 8.
In all catchments, except Runde, less than 30% of the potential water available was utilized in
2010 and a similar low level of utilization is projected in 2011. It is only in the south-eastern
lowveld where meaningful irrigation is taking place on about 40,000 ha. Although the
utilisation of water resources has drastically dropped, there is still high demand for water in
communal and lowveld areas where the government imports food staples. Economic
Consulting Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh
O'Donnel and Partners (2013a) considers low (2.7% p.a.) and high (5.4% p.a.) growth rate
rehabilitation of irrigated agriculture but these projections do not include estimates of the
increase in demand for water.

Groundwater has served the both the communal and commercial sector in rural areas as the
principal source of potable water and a major source of water for irrigation, mining and
tourism. Hand pumps in rural areas supply potable water for the vast majority of the rural
village population, along with hand pumps or motorized pumps for rural clinics, schools and
business centers. Concern has been raised that some shallow, fractured aquifers may be under
threat from rural water demand. However Ó Dochartaigh et al. (2011) working in a wide range
the semi-arid areas in Africa suggest that there is 'considerable resilience to short-term inter-
annual variation in precipitation and recharge, and rural groundwater resources are likely to
sustain diffuse, low volume abstraction.' The high yielding boreholes in the A1 and A2
settlement schemes require pump testing and pumps installed not only for drinking water but
for other productive uses.

A recent study of groundwater drought risk in southern Africa (Villholth et al 2013) concluded
that drought resilience is strongly linked to secure groundwater access and proper
development and management of this resource. Zimbabwe, along with Mauritius, South Africa
and Malawi, has one of the highest risk indices in the SADC region. Under the present climate
regime, Zimbabwe has about 5% of its area and 32% of its population in the very high
groundwater drought risk category.

Urban water supply is at present not meeting current demand, with urban populations
obtaining additional water from informal sources such as rainwater harvesting, boreholes and
unsafe surface water. Truck mounted water sellers have mushroomed, selling water to those
who do not have boreholes. All this has taken place without detailed collection of drilling and
abstraction data. There is very little groundwater level monitoring, but anecdotal evidence
from drilling and pump fitting companies suggest that, in Harare, the groundwater level has
declined by around 15m over the last 5 to 10 years.

Both water treatment capacity and urban water storage capacity are inadequate. Based on the
Urban Water Tariff Study and the 2012 Census, a recent study (Economic Consulting
Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and
Partners, 2013a) estimated that total (reticulated plus informal) urban water consumption
ranges from 93 litres/capita/day (lpcpd) in Chitungwiza to 358 lpcpd in Kwekwe. This equates
to just on 500 Mlpd for the 7 major urban centres of Harare, Bulawayo, Chitungwiza, Mutare,
Kwekwe, Masvingo and Chegutu. Water demand in Harare is estimated at around 1,200,000 m3
per day9 for the Greater Harare area, compared to current production of around 600,000 m3 per
day. Chagutah (2010) reports that raw water sources for the largest urban centres such as
Harare, Bulawayo and Chitungwiza are only sufficient for normal rainy seasons. Clear water
reservoir capacity is now too small with Harare, for example, having only half the clean water
storage capacity it requires.

The situation is possibly even worse in rural areas. Rural water demand is estimated to be 251
lpcpd in 2012 (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian
Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013a) with this demand predicted to increase by 72
lpcpd and 88 lpcpd in the low and high growth scenarios respectively. Chagutah (2010) states
that water coverage had declined in the rural areas from 75 percent in 1999 to 66% in 2007,
with use of safe sanitary facilities declining from 60 percent of rural households in 1999 to only
30 percent in 2006.

Water for mining is included in the consolidated urban/industry/mining category. However,
about 0.4 x 106 Ml/year of surface water was believed to be used for mining in 2007. With the
rapid expansion of mining and mineral processing in recent years, this quantity is likely to have
increased substantially. Most water for this sector is sourced privately from both surface and
groundwater resources and from recycling and is not readily captured in government records.
Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun,
Hugh O'Donnel and Partners (2013c) examined both low (4.8% p.a.) and high (8.1% p.a.)
growth scenarios for mining with mining rising to over 20% of GDP in 2033.

The manufacturing sector has a relatively low water demand and is not expected to grow
rapidly. In particular, the water intensive manufacturing industries are expected to grow more
slowly than the sector as a whole.

With 80 percent of the country's electricity supply coming from the Lake Kariba Dam,
commercial, mining domestic electricity supply is heavily reliant on water resources in the
Zambezi River basin. The planned run-of-river Batoka Dam upstream of the Kariba Dam will
have an additional capacity of 1600 MW. Previous droughts have led to major falls in reservoir
levels and aconcomitant reduction in energy generation (Hulme and Sheard 1999). Cooling
water for the existing Hwange power generators, together with additional cooling water for the
600 MW Hwange extension and the new 2,400 MW Sengwa station, is expected to be met by
water pumped from the Zambezi River. Thus, both hydropower and thermal power generation
rely totally on maintenance of flow in the Zambezi River. If the existing Hwange power
generators were restored to full operation, the demand for water would be about 12,000 Ml per
annum.

The amount of water committed to primary water use(basic domestic needs, provisions for
animals, making of bricks, and use of dip tanks) is not known. This water use is central to
maintenance of rural livelihoods and the achievement of MDGs.

Putting these sectoral demand scenarios together, Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch
International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners (2013a)
estimates that there will be a growth in total water demand of 2.8% p.a. under the low scenario
and 4.9% p.a. under the high scenario. These growth rates would mean that the 1998 level of
water demand would not be equaled until after 2032 in the low growth scenario and in 2026 in
the high growth scenario. None of these projections considered the effects of climate change
on water availability and water demand.

4. Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources:
   A Preliminary Assessment


In order to develop adaptation responses to climate change, it is important to understand the
extent, location and timing of the likely impacts on Zimbabwe's water resources. In this chapter
we first review previous studies of climate change on specific regions of Zimbabwe. We then
report the results of a national study to model climate change impacts across the whole
country and the implications of these impacts.

Zimbabwe Climate Change Studies
There have been two recent catchment-scale studies that have modelled the possible impacts
of climate change on precipitation and agriculture in specific Zimbabwean regions.

IFPRI undertook a regional study of the implications of climate change in 2030 on irrigated
food production within those parts of Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique
that lie within the Limpopo Basin in order to gauge the effects of climate change on irrigation
reliability (Zhu and Ringler 2010). The various scenarios that have been published by the IPCC
for future emission of greenhouse gases can be grouped into four families (IPCC 2000):
?       The A1 family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global
        population that peaks in mid-21stcentury and declines thereafter, with the rapid
        introduction of new and more efficient technologies;
?       The A2 scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world where fertility patterns
        converge very slowly, economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per
        capita economic growth and technological change are more fragmented and slow;
?       The B1 scenario family describes a convergent world where global population peaks in
        mid-century and declines thereafter, but with rapid changes in economic structures
        toward a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity, and
        the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies;
?       The B2 scenario family describes a world with continuously increasing global
        population at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and
        less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 andA1 families.
        The IPCC has developed a number of subsidiary emissions scenarios (A1a, A1b, etc)
        within these four families.

IFPRI used four emissions scenarios (A1FI, A2a, B1a, B2a) with the Had CM3 model. While the
study was primarily focussed on irrigation, it also provided estimates of MAP and seasonal
changes in precipitation, changes in evaporation, and changes in runoff under this emission
scenario. The study provided predictions for only the Mzingwane catchment within Zimbabwe.

Zhu and Ringler (2012) subsequently used the CNRM-CM3 and ECHam5 models with just the
A1b emissions scenario to estimate the changes in the same hydrological parameters to 2050
for the Limpopo Basin. These two models were chosen because they were known to provide
moderate and severe precipitation changes respectively. Again the study focussed on irrigation
potential under climate change and included only the Mzingwane catchment within
Zimbabwe. In a second study, the UNDP/GEF applied 10 downscaled climate models to the Save
catchment (United Nations Development Programme 2009) as part of a project to understand



       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  24   Management in Zimbabwe
adaptation actions for dry land agriculture and livestock farming in the Chiredzi district. They
concluded that, while total precipitation is not likely to change significantly, the precipitation
pattern may be modified by 2050 with “rainfall increases in most months followed by decreases
in the second part of the season”. Runoff in the Save catchment is expected to become more
variable. However, quantitative results are not available from this study. In addition, SADC have
undertaken a comprehensive regional study of climate change from two emissions scenarios
over the 2036-2065 period on precipitation, wind and temperature for southern Africa using
two approaches statistical downscaling of 10 GCMs and dynamic downscaling of six GCMs
(Davis 2011). While there were some notably different predictions between models and
downscaling methods for some climate parameters, there was general agreement that
minimum, mean and maximum temperatures are very likely to increase by between 0.3°C and
3.6°C and heatwaves would increase throughout the region. There would be a decrease in
precipitation during September-February in Zimbabwe. Changes in runoff and other water
resources parameters are discussed but were not modelled.

An older study (de Witt 2006), used three GCM models - GCM2, HadCM3 and PCM - to predict
changes in mean temperature and precipitation for 2050 and 2100 in southern Africa. They
predicted an increase of 2oC - 4oC in temperature and a decrease of 10% - 17% in precipitation
for Zimbabwe by 2100.They then used empirical relationships between agricultural production
and temperature and precipitation to estimate that impact of these climate changes on
agricultural production.

Methodology of National Study
These previous studies have focused on the possible impacts of climate change on either the
southern Africa region or a specific part of Zimbabwe, generally with a focus on food
production. There has not been a national study that investigated the potential impacts on
Zimbabwe's water resources and the opportunities for adapting to these impacts. As part of the
current work (which draws from and extends the preliminary work done for the NCCRS), the
potential impacts of climate change to 2050 and 2080 on precipitation and runoff in
Zimbabwe's seven catchments were modelled using the CSIRO Mk3 global circulation model
(Gordon et al, 2002). Two emission scenarios were modelled:
   ?  A2a describes a heterogeneous world of independent nations with regionally oriented
      economies. The main driving forces are a high rate of population growth, increased
      energy use, land-use changes and slow technological change (business as usual
      scenario);
   ?  B2a describes a regionally oriented world with local rather than global solutions to
      economic and environmental sustainability. Population is still growing but less rapidly
      than in A2a and there are more diverse technological changes and slower land-use
      changes (ecologically aware scenario).

The CSIRO Mk3 model was chosen because its downscaled data are readily available (Hijmans
et al, 2005), it gives similar temperature and precipitation predictions to other models such as
the widely used Hadley Centre models, and it has been developed for Southern Hemisphere
climatic conditions.

Empirical relationships developed by ZINWA between precipitation and runoff (ZINWA 2009)
for each catchment were used to translate MAP into annual average runoff (MAR) (Box 4).
These relationships were developed from long term rainfall data and flow records from

There are a number of limitations in this modelling method that need to be kept in mind when
interpreting the results. First, only one climate change model was used in the study. Use of
additional climate change models would have provided a wider range of temperature and
precipitation predictions. Nevertheless, the CSIRO Mk3 model results are broadly consistent
with the predictions of decreased water resources in southern Africa obtained from the
integrated results from 14 climate models (IPCC 2007a). Secondly, the downscaling of global
circulation models predictions to regional scale was undertaken using curve fitting methods
that are known to be less accurate in regions where there are few weather stations (Hijmans et
al 2005). Thirdly, the precipitation-runoff relationships were developed based on historical
precipitation and flow data and may be less applicable when precipitation changes outside of
the observed patterns. Lastly, mean annual runoff is influenced by a number of parameters
apart from precipitation, including evaporation, vegetation, and land use patterns all of which
will change with global warming. These are not included in the runoff estimation. Nevertheless,
with these cautions in mind, the method provides a reasonable preliminary estimate of the
potential impacts of climate change on Zimbabwe's water surface resources.

Changes in Precipitation
Climate data, including current precipitation, are available from two sources the Zimbabwe
Meteorological Department and the World Climate database10. The former is obtained from
             11
observations , while the latter is calculated through global circulation models. The World
Climate data set also provided the temperature and precipitation predictions for 2050 and
2080. These were from the CSIROMK3 GCM model downs called to 4.5 km resolution. These
precipitation predictions were then aggregated up to catchment scale (Table 4) to give the
estimated MAP under the two scenarios for 2050 and 2080. The observed and the modelled
current precipitation data differ significantly, with the world climate precipitation being higher
than the observed precipitation in six of the seven catchments 100 mm higher in three of the
catchments. We will use the World Climate current precipitation data in order to have a
consistent baseline for comparing with predicted precipitation data for 2050 and 2080. These

     Percentage decreases in MAP are shown in brackets. A negative percentage indicates an increase in rainfall.

Table 4 shows that by 2050 and 2080, under both emission scenarios, MAP is predicted to
decrease in all catchments, except for Manyame where it could increase slightly under the
ecologically aware scenario. The most affected catchments are in the south of Zimbabwe
Mzingwane and Runde catchments where MAP could decline by 12-16% by 2050 and by 12-
25% by 2080. MAP is likely to remain relatively constant in the northwest of the country
(Manyame and Mazowe catchments) (Figure 9). MAP could stabilize or start to recover in the
more affected catchments - Gwayi, Mzingwane, Runde, Sanyati and Save - between 2050 and
2080 under the ecologically aware emissions scenario, although it would continue to decline in
almost all catchments if the “business as usual” emissions scenario is maintained.

These decreases in precipitation are significant a 15% decrease in Mzingwane catchment by
2050 under the business as usual case, or a 12% decrease even if the world adopts ecologically
aware growth patterns. The uncertainties in the choice of development scenario, the features
of the particular GCM model employed, and the uncertainties in the downscaling method,
mean that the predicted MAPs in Table 4 have large uncertainty bands. Even so, the pattern of a

decline in MAP across western and southern Zimbabwe to 2050 with continuing precipitation
declines to 2080 if emissions of greenhouse gases are not curbed should be regarded as a
reliable conclusion. This modelling does not show the additional changes that may occur in
inter-annual precipitation variability (i.e. climate variation) or in intra-annual variability (e.g.
shifts in seasonality of precipitation).

Changes in Water Resources
Runoff
Potential changes in MAR in the seven catchments are shown in Table 5 and Figure 10. The
World Climate MAP data were used to calculate the current MAR in order to have a consistent
basis for comparison with predicted runoff in 2050 and 2080.

  Percentage decreases in MAR are shown in brackets. A negative percentage means runoff is predicted to increase.

As has been found in other countries (e.g. CSIRO 2008), there is a proportionately greater
decline in runoff than in precipitation. For example, a 3-7% decline in precipitation in Sanyati
catchment by 2050 will result in a 10-23% decline in runoff. This multiplier effect on runoff
means that even small declines in MAP can have significant impacts on water availability. Thus,
Manyame catchment which is predicted to face only small decline in precipitation by 2080 if
global greenhouse gas emissions continue in a business as usual way, could still face a 10%
decline in MAR.

The table shows a particularly sharp decline in runoff in Gwayi, Mzingwane and Runde
catchments under both scenarios, to the point where the calculated MAR drops to zero in
Gwayi and Mzingwane catchments under the “business as usual” scenario in both 2050 and
                                                                12
2080. While there is some precedence for this dramatic result , the apparent drying up of these
two catchments at the predicted levels of MAP may be an artefact of the method used. First,
using annual precipitation and runoff rather than monthly or daily measures conceals
considerable intra-annual variation between both precipitation and runoff. Secondly, the MAR
measurements are derived from manual rather than automated gauging stations and so may
miss flows that occur between flow readings. Thirdly, there are fewer years where low MAP and
MAR have been recorded compared to years of average MAP and MAR and so the relationships
are more heavily influenced by the years of moderate MAP. Consequently, the equations used
to predict MAR are unreliable at the low precipitation levels predicted in the global database,
and so the values in Table 5 should be regarded as indicative rather than as definite predictions.
Nevertheless, the general result holds true - there is likely to be a large decline in MAR across
western and southern Zimbabwe to 2050 with continuing declines to 2080 if emissions of
greenhouse gases are not reduced.
Groundwater Recharge
Groundwater recharge was estimated for the seven catchments using the simple approach
described in Table 3. These recharge proportions were applied to the precipitation and area for
each sub-catchment within each of the seven Zimbabwean catchments and then aggregated to
catchment scale. Table 6 shows the groundwater recharge as a result of MAP under the two
climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2080. These are only preliminary estimates and do not
take account of the many other effects of climate change that will influence recharge such as
changes in evaporation, vegetation cover and land use.

Because of the simple method used, the change in recharge will be directly proportional to the
change in precipitation under the two climate change scenarios. Consequently, groundwater
recharge is least affected by climate change in the north of Zimbabwe and most affected in the
dry southern catchments of Mzingwane and Runde.

   Gwayi catchment contains significant areas with Kalahari sands where the equations are known to be unreliable (ZINWA 2009) because precipitation
preferentially recharges the extensive aquifers of this region. Zero runoff has been recorded in drought years in some streams in Gwayi catchment.
Mzingwane catchment has the lowest MAP of the seven catchments and zero runoff has been observed at some gauging stations during droughts in
the 1970s and 1990s.

          Percentage decreases in recharge are shown in brackets. A negative percentage means that recharge
          is predicted to increase.

Some general statements can be made about the types of aquifers (Figure 11) that are more
susceptible to detrimental impacts from climate change:
?     Shallow perched dambo13 aquifers developed over the granite and gneiss in the eastern and
      northeastern parts of Zimbabwe. Whitlow (1983) estimates that there are 1.2million ha of
      dambo wetlands in Zimbabwe. They are susceptible to increased evapotranspiration,
      reduced recharge and increased baseflow discharge. Dambos are widely used for garden
      irrigation and the dambo areas tend to coincide with higher population densities, and are
      possibly a fundamental cause of such a demographic pattern;
?     Granite and gneiss aquifers on the post-African erosion surface and Shamvianaquifers.
      Groundwater is stored in the thin, upper weathered layers and the fractures and is
      therefore susceptible to high evapotranspiration rates, baseflow discharge and reduced
      recharge. These aquifers provide water for rural communities and, under both climate
      change scenarios, water supply wells in these units are under increasing threat of drying
      out;
?     All unconfined aquifers that receive direct recharge. However those aquifer systems that
      have greater thickness, that are deep enough, and that have higher volumes of stored
      groundwater will be less susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Some of these host
      some of the most important agricultural soils and also most of the gold mines in
      Zimbabwe;
?     Aquifers that occur in highly dissected terrain are more likely to drain into streams as
      baseflow. Decline in these aquifers would constitute a threat to groundwater resource
      sustainability.
It is clear that the crystalline rock areas in the west of the country are likely to be severely
affected by climate change and only hand pump supplies in these areas may be considered
sustainable and 'safe'.

    Dambo wetlands are groundwater discharge zones that lie above river level and discharge groundwater to the surface, forming local wetlands that
 are widely used for water supply and garden irrigation.

  30       Management in Zimbabwe
Aquifers that are less susceptible to the impacts of climate change are:
?   Sedimentary aquifers with that may occur at significant depths below the surface. Such
    aquifers tend to have large volumes in storage, and often extend well below baseflow
    discharge and evaporation levels. These are the sedimentary aquifers in the north west o f
    Zimbabwe (Gwayi catchment) and in the south (Mzingwane catchment);
?   Confined aquifers that occur at depth and are not susceptible to evapotranspiration or
    baseflow loss. Recharge is indirect and as such reduced recharge is only an indirect threat.
    Such aquifers tend to have large volumes in storage and can act as important buffers in
    times of drought and general water scarcity. The Karoo sedimentary units are the most
    frequently occurring confined aquifer units in Zimbabwe (Upper Karoo Escarpment units
    in Figure 11);
?   Primary unconfined sedimentary aquifers that have favorable recharge characteristics
    and/or extensive storage potential. These are the Kalahari sands and recent alluvial
    aquifers in active river channels (Kalahari and Recent-Older Alluvium units in Figure 11).

Villholth et al (2013) have modelled the population at risk of groundwater drought in
Zimbabwe under the A1B emissions scenario to 210014. They estimate that the percentage of
population at very high risk of groundwater drought could rise from 32% to 86% without
measures to adapt to the effects of climate change (Figure 12).

Comparison with Other Studies
None of the previous studies for which quantitative predictions are available covered the same
area or time period as the current study. Nevertheless, it is possible to compare three studies in
the Mzingwane catchment, although one is for 2030 and two are for 2050 (Table 7). The
current study shows a much larger decline in runoff in Mzingwane catchment than do the other
two studies. The probable reasons for this are explained above. While the values for
precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff differ between the studies, there is general
consensus that there will be a decline in MAP and an even larger decline in MAR in this
catchment by 2050.

These results are also consistent with the precipitation predictions from the downscaled SADC
modelling for southern Africa. However, the modelling in the current study for Save catchment
(8-14 % decrease in precipitation by 2050) differs from the qualitative results from the
UNDP/GEF modelling which proposed a relatively constant MAP although with increased
variability.

Zhu and Ringler (2012) found that the main reduction in precipitation occurs in spring and
early summer (October through December) in the Mzingwane catchment. The SADC study
also concluded that precipitation would decrease during September-December.

Implications on Water Resources Planning, Management and Investment
Even without population growth, increased temperatures and potential evapotranspiration
and reduced precipitation in the south and west of Zimbabwe, indicate that there will be less
water available and increased water stress. When coupled with possible scenarios of population
        15
increase (Table 8 and Figure 13) the per capita water availability decreases significantly by
2050.

Using aggregate runoff as the measure of water availability, Table 8 shows that even under the
best case emissions and the low population growth scenarios, per capita water availability
declines by 38% from 2.45 Ml per capita per year in 2013 to 1.52 Ml per capita per year by 2050;
under the business as usual scenario water availability declines by 48% even with low
population growth. However, per capita water availability then starts to increase again by 2080
under the low population growth scenario for both the Ecologically Aware and the Business as
Usual scenarios because the low fertility assumption underlying the low population growth
leads to a population decline that is faster than the decline in runoff because of climate change.
The UN currently rates Zimbabwe as water stressed (1.0-1.7 Ml per capita per year). Under the
medium or high population growth scenarios, per capita water availability continues to decline
to the point where Zimbabwe would be categorized in the “absolute water scarcity” category.

Note that these are nation-wide indicators and do not account for the spatial variation in both
population growth and water availability if the decline in runoff occurs in the less populated
regions of Zimbabwe then water availability may not decline as much as indicated here.
Increased climate variability, manifest as more intense droughts and floods, and delayed starts

  Under the medium and low population scenarios, Zimbabwe's population falls and the per capita water availability increases between 2050 and 2080 for
the business as usual emissions scenario. The reason for this decline in population under these two scenarios is not known.

           Per Capital Water Availability
             (ML per capital per year)

2050 and 2080 under three population growth scenarios

One obvious implication of these findings is that water resources infrastructure dams,
irrigation systems will need to be rehabilitated and expanded to meet the increasing
population demand. Investments in new dams for irrigation could be delayed in the short to
medium term, with the exception of priority areas, until many of the existing irrigation dams
are first put into use; this would improve productivity in the agriculture sector and generate
revenue for ZINWA.

However, increasing investment in infrastructure alone is not likely to be sufficiently flexible
response to increasing demand in the face of climate change because the increase in runoff
variability that results from climate change means that dams will have to be bigger to provide
the same level of security (McMahon and Mein 1978). Instead, a multi-pronged strategy will be
needed that includes water resources infrastructure along with improved water resources
governance and water resources planning and management, to make most efficient use of
existing water resources. In particular, water resources management will need to be better
coordinated with the planning and management of water using sectors agriculture, water
supply and sanitation, mining, industrial and commercial users, and tourism.

  34     Management in Zimbabwe
The findings also have implications for water demand. Water conservation measures for both
rural and urban water users may be more cost effective than increasing water supply measure,
particularly in those parts of the country that will experience diminished MAP. The pattern of
agricultural water demand may also be affected. The delayed onset of the rainy season in the
south of Zimbabwe and increased variability may shift cropping towards areas of more reliable
precipitation and require the introduction of more drought resistant varieties.

Climate change is likely to significantly accentuate the importance of groundwater resources.
Even in areas where there is no decline in precipitation, the higher temperatures will mean
higher evaporation losses and less surface water for distribution and use. If there is also a
decrease in precipitation, then the stresses on the water system will be even greater, and the
groundwater resource will become a vital water source. Groundwater cannot replace surface
water in the economy, but conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, based on realistic
assessments of water availability from both of sources, and deliberate operational policies to
use both resources jointly could help make better use of existing water resources. The
increasing importance of groundwater is likely to promote more management attention to this
vital but neglected resource. Investment is urgently needed in ground water monitoring and
investigations, and improved groundwater professional capacity in ZINWA, water supply
authorities and Catchment Councils.

One final result of this analysis is that sector policies that are considerably removed from water
resources could have a profound effect on longer-term water availability. As shown above,
policies that reduce fertility and consequently reduce population growth rates could counter
the decline in water resources from climate change. Land use decisions can also have a
profound impact on groundwater recharge and quality. These examples illustrate the
importance of taking a government-wide approach to adaptation not all adaptation measures
are concerned with water resources. The newly formed Ministry of Environment, Water and
Climate brings together some of the important sectors under one ministry contributing
towards a government-wide approach. The key now will be to also work closely with
agriculture, energy, industry, mining and other key sectors and keeping water as a central link
in the climate change adaptation discourse.

5. Case Studies of Climate Change Vulnerability
   and Adaptation Opportunities


Most studies of climate change adaptation in Zimbabwe have focussed on adaptation within
the agricultural sector, particularly by subsistence farming communities who are likely to be
severely affected in the south of Zimbabwe (JMAT Development Consultants 2008; Ungani
2009; Mano and Nhemachena, 2007; Chigwada, 2005). However, adaptation within the water
resources sector must necessarily go beyond local community actions. It includes adjustment
and change in behaviours and procedures at all scales from transboundary, to national, to
regional and local levels. Adaptation is about both prevention and response and is concerned
with both built and natural systems (SADC 2011).

SADC (2011) have proposed a 3-tier framework for reducing vulnerability and improving
resilience to climate change, and therefore, adaptation options and opportunities. These tiers
water governance, infrastructure development, and water management recognize that climate
change adaptation occurs at multiple levels of intervention. To explore adaptation options and
opportunities, we have extended the water management category to include water planning
and distinguished Information, Education and Communications as a separate category
because of the importance of involving all water users in adaptation activities.

In this chapter, we review five water resources case studies, representing diverse water
resources situations across Zimbabwe, using this extended framework.
?   The first two Harare and Bulawayo water supply illustrate issues and adaptation
    opportunities for large urban centres. Both currently face severe water shortages
    because of increasing demand, lack of supply expansion, dysfunctional water treatment
    plants and leaking distribution systems. Harare also has water quality problems because
    the city lies within its own water supply catchment.
?   The third case study, Roswa Dam, represents a small multi-use system where the existing
    water source is not fully utilized. However, climate change along with increasing
    demand from nearby growth centres will likely lead to a shortfall in water availability for
    irrigation. There are many opportunities for adapting to climate change by improving
    management and community participation.
?   The fourth case study examines irrigation in the Limpopo River Basin, a transboundary
    water resource. Existing water resources are already heavily allocated at the top of the
    catchments. The basin is predicted to face significant decreases in water availability as a
    result of climate change. While there are still some opportunities for developing new
    water sources, the major adaptation opportunities lie in improved management.
?   The final case study, Kariba Hydropower on the Zambezi River Basin, representing
    another transboundary water resource. Although hydropower is the major water use,
    other uses have arisen since the dam was constructed. Lake Kariba faces both reduced
    inflows and increased flood risk as a result of climate change. Additional infrastructure
    investments as well as operational improvements provide adaptation opportunities.

Case Study 1: Harare Water Supply
Background
Harare was established in the late 19th Century as a fort on the watershed that separates the
Mazowe Catchment from the Manyame Catchment. The city is located in a region with
relatively good rainfall (MAP of 800 mm). The city shares the water supply system with the
       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  36   Management in Zimbabwe
satellite towns and settlements of Chitungwiza, Norton, Ruwa and Epworth. Total population
served is about 2.2 million. The surface raw water supply sources for Harare consist of four
dams on the Manyame River (Table 9). The 4% yield from the dams is 437 Mlpd while the
combined water treatment capacity is 710 Mlpd. The balance can be met from reclaimed water
and treated effluent.

Groundwater use in Harare has risen sharply as a result of poor service delivery by Harare
Municipality. Old, low-yield boreholes are now used extensively and many new boreholes have
been drilled in the city area. All northern and north-eastern suburbs rely on ground water and
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have drilled and equipped boreholes in high
density residential areas and clinics to ensure safe drinking water. Groundwater development is
however largely unplanned, unregulated and unmanaged. Chapter 3 describes the lack of
comprehensive assessment of aquifers to inform drilling and the absence of monitoring to
determine the vulnerabilities of groundwater, especially in light of the breakdown of sanitation
and sewerage systems and growing contamination.

International donors have assisted the government rehabilitate water treatment plants on an
emergency basis following the 2008/09 outbreak of cholera, and planning is now underway for
a more systematic improvement in water treatment for Zimbabwe's major urban areas. The
rehabilitation of Harare water works has commenced recently with the support of the Chinese
government.

Harare has six wastewater treatment plants, with a potential annual treated capacity of
240,000 Ml, far below the desired annual capacity of 400,000 Ml. Currently, wastewater
collection systems require extensive repair and many of these treatment plants are only
partially operational. Consequently, untreated and partially treated effluent is being discharged
into raw water supply dams. Previously, much of this treated wastewater was used for irrigation
and so relieved pressure on fresh water supplies. Treated wastewater can potentially replace
150,000 Ml per year of raw water while the rest is used for irrigation.

                                                                                                   Management in Zimbabwe

Issues
The area around Harare is undergoing rapid expansion with new formal settlements being
developed on the understanding that they will be connected to the existing city's distribution
network. Consequently, unconstrained demand will rise sharply over coming decades placing
even more stress on a water supply system that cannot cope with existing demand.

There are high losses in the current water supply system with about 60% of treated water being
lost due to broken pipes and illegal connections. In addition, there is little effort to manage
water demand, even though experience during the 1981/2-83/4 drought showed that
household demand could be reduced markedly from the current high levels (600 l/day in high
density areas, 900 l/day in medium density areas, and 1500l day in low density areas) to 400 l
/day without causing consumer complaints. Reducing losses and controlling demand would
delay the need for investment in new water supply infrastructure.

Water management authorities lack funds. The recent announcement by the government that
all local authorities should cancel outstanding debts on water rates will severely limit Harare
City Council's and ZINWA's ability to manage water supply. Similarly, the imposition of very low
tariff rates on raw water to consumers affects ZINWA's operational capacity.

Additional sources of water are under consideration. The proposed Musami, Kunzvi, Nyagui
and Nyatana Dams would provide new sources from the adjacent Mazowe catchment, while the
Kudu Dam on the Sanyati River can provide a link with the proposed Kariba Dam pipeline.
Wastewater discharges form a potential source of contamination for Harare's raw water
supplies as well as contributing nutrients that fuel extensive growths of water weeds on dams
such as Lake Chivero. However, these discharges could be turned into an asset rather than a
liability by treating them to a level where they could be used for non-potable purposes. There
are potential new sources of surface water available in the adjacent Sanyati and Mazowe
catchments.

Climate change is likely to result in warmer temperatures that could increase water demand for
both urban water use as well as irrigation, although modelling conducted in this report shows
that the Harare region is not likely to experience major reductions in MAP or MAR. However,
there could be increased variability with more intense droughts and floods. While dams such as
Chivero dam have spillways capable of passing large floods, rafts of water hyacinth can cause
obstructions leading to potentially severe damage to infrastructure.

Neither groundwater drilling nor groundwater use are regulated. In addition, groundwater
information is limited. For example, the sustainable yield of groundwater resources is not
known and areas where groundwater is vulnerable to contamination have not been established.
Adaptation Options
Water Resources Governance. The establishment of the proposed independent Water and
Wastewater Services Regulatory Unit would remove political considerations from water pricing
decisions and help ensure that prices were based on considerations of production costs and
efficiency measures. It would also help ensure that customers receive adequate levels of service.




         Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  38     Management in Zimbabwe
Water Resources Planning and Management. A thorough analysis of the implications of
climate change for Harare water supply and water demand would contribute to improved
water planning for the city. If the results of the preliminary study reported here are confirmed,
then the focus should be on planning for a more variable climate rather than a drier one. Given
Harare's national importance, it is important that the government of Zimbabwe continues
working cooperatively with the City of Harare Council and Manyame Catchment Council in
both water planning and management.

There are a number of opportunities whereby current water management practices can adapt
to a more variable future water supply. It would be sensible to explore conjunctive management
of groundwater and surface water sources under an increasingly variable climate. Given the
likely increased reliance on groundwater, it would be sensible to improve records of
groundwater drilling, groundwater levels and groundwater use keeping in mind the capacity of
authorities to collect and analyse water use records. This is particularly important in Harare
where groundwater abstractions are, at present, almost uncontrolled.

Demand management practices could be introduced along with water conservation measures.
Demand can be reduced through techniques such as public education and, to some extent,
increasing water prices. Water conservation measures would clearly include leakage reduction
and increased reuse of treated wastewater, together with other measures such as pressure
reduction and water conserving techniques at household level. Modelling suggests that water
use can be reduced from an expected 1600 Mlpd in 2018 to 950 Mlpd by undertaking a suit of
such practices and measures.

Instituting effective pollution control through rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants
and controls over diffuse and point source discharges would help protect downstream water
storages from contamination as well as provide water for irrigation, some of which would offset
potable water use. It is also important to work with environmental authorities to protect the
resilience of natural systems to increased climate variability. If maintained, these wetlands and
riparian areas form one of the lines of defence to protect Harare's water supply system.

Improved revenue collection is essential for a sustainable water supply network. Harare water
managers could improve their accounting and collection management by learning from their
twinning arrangements with eThekwini Water managers in South Africa who achieve 95%
collection efficiency. However, consumer willingness to pay is closely linked to reliability of
water supply and so increased revenue collection can only occur as part of improvements in
water supply.

Water Resources Infrastructure. There are important public health reasons for the current
emphasis on improving reliability and quality of water supply. However, rehabilitation of
wastewater treatment collection and treatment also needs to be strategically planned because
it not only contributes to public health and environmental outcomes but also provides an
additional source of water.

Development of groundwater may be sensible given that it is buffered against the increasing
climate variability likely to be experienced in the Harare region.

                                                                                          Management in Zimbabwe

New sources of surface water under consideration include the Kunzvi, Musami,
Nyagui/Mazowe and Nyatana dams in Mazowe catchment and the Kudu dam in Sanyati
catchment. However, it would be sensible to subject any decision to proceed with any of these
new sources to cost effectiveness comparisons with demand management, water conservation
and groundwater development alternatives under the changes expected under global
warming. This analysis would need to rely on a detailed and credible climate change analysis
for the Harare region.

Information, Public Education and Communications. Harare water users will play an important
role in adapting to climate change. Water users are central to demand management; they are
central to improving revenue collection for funding water management; and they are central to
encouraging city and central government to take action while there is time to adapt to climate
change. Public education programs will be needed to build understanding amongst water users
about climate change implications for Harare's water supply.

There is a strong case for improving monitoring of groundwater use, groundwater levels and
groundwater quality because of its likely current over-exploitation at a time when it could play
an increasingly important role in the city's water supply. This may require changes in current
regulations and sharing of information between city and central government agencies. Many
water managers left during the national economic crisis and there is now a dearth of
professional expertise at Harare City Council. Additional water managers need to be hired.
Both water managers and City Councillors lack a detailed understanding of climate change and
would benefit from specialized education programs.

For the reasons outlined above, a detailed and thorough modelling analysis of climate change
and its potential impacts on water demand and supply for the Harare region is an essential
foundation for strategic planning of the City's water supply.

Case Study 2: Bulawayo water supply
Background
The City of Bulawayo with a 2012 population of 655,700 people has been experiencing severe
water shortages for nearly 40 years; supply has far exceeded demand and development of water
supply infrastructure has lagged significantly. The city is situated on the watershed between
the Mzingwane and Gwayi catchments. The city currently draws its water resources from the
Mzingwane catchment together with groundwater from the Nyamadhlovu aquifer and it
discharges effluent waste water into the Gwayi Catchment. Consequently, the dams have not
been polluted from the discharge of partially treated and untreated effluent apart from the
Khami dam on the Gwayi River.

The raw water supply for the city of Bulawayo is drawn from six dams, four of which are owned
by Bulawayo City Council (BCC) and two by MEWC through ZINWA. When built, the dams
initially enjoyed a monopoly on the available water resources, and so their yields at 4% risk (i.e.
96% reliability levels) were quite high at 172.5 Mlpd. However, under the 1998 Water Act
ownership of water was transferred to the President and all water users were required to obtain
permits. Because the city's permits now carry the same weight as newer dams and flow permits,
the dam yields are now much less at 87 Mlpd (about 50% of previous yields). In addition, the


        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  40    Management in Zimbabwe
rainfall in Mzingwane catchment has declined by 15% over the last century although this
decline (plus future declines from climate change) has yet to be factored into yield
calculations.

The surface water resources were supplemented with groundwater from the Nyamadhlovu
aquifer in 1993 after the severe 1991/2 drought. The present estimated yield from this source
is 9 Mlpd. In addition, the City of Bulawayo was a pioneer within Zimbabwe when it commenced
recycling treated wastewater in the early 1960s. The six wastewater treatment plants have a
combined capacity of 65.5 Mlpd with most treated wastewater being used for non-contact
uses such as irrigation and stock watering. However, wastewater from the Thorngrove STP (10
Mlpd) was treated to tertiary standard and supplied for industrial and commercial use and
irrigation of public parks, thus saving potable water.
Issues
Bulawayo's water supply and wastewater treatment systems have become dilapidated since
the financial crisis and require rehabilitation to return to their full design capacities. At present
the city's water treatment plants are operating at about 57% capacity. The Nyamadhlovu
borefield also requires rehabilitation of some wells to be fully operational. In addition, up to
45% of water is lost in the city's water distribution systems from leakage and illegal
             17
connections .

The city also requires additional water sources to respond to population growth with the last
dam Mutshabezi dam being commissioned in 1994. However, there is some confusion about
Bulawayo's population figures with the population from the 2012 census (655,000) being
substantially less than that assumed prior to the census and so it is difficult to estimate future
urban water demand reliably. The Water Sector Investment Analysis study accepted the
Census figures and assumed an annual population growth of between 2.4% and 3% (Economic
Consulting Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh
O'Donnel and Partners 2013a).

The wastewater treatment plants are also in need of rehabilitation. A number of bilateral and
multi-lateral donors (SIDA, DFID, UNICEF, AusAID, IMF) are working with GoZ to rehabilitate
both surface water supply and wastewater treatment facilities. It is not clear whether these
improvements will also result in the re-establishment of wastewater recycling from the
wastewater treatment plants. UNICEF has assisted with the rehabilitation of the Nyamadhlovu
wellfield (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian
Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013b). Nevertheless, further actions and
investments will be needed to meet future urban water and wastewater requirements.

The modelling in Chapter 4 shows that the area where Bulawayo is located between
Mzingwane and Gwayi catchments will be the area most affected by climate change in
Zimbabwe. MAP levels in Mzingwane and Gwayi catchment could decrease by 12-15% and 5-
10% respectively by 2050, and MAR could decline by 65-100% and 50-100% respectively.
Recharge to groundwater may also decrease although the amount is not known. These
potential effects have not been factored into the future urban water supply calculations in the
Water Sector Investment Analysis study.

Appointing an independent Water and Wastewater Services Regulatory Unit would help
remove water pricing from political influence and provide better certainty to both water
consumers and urban water management authorities such as BCC.

Water Resources Planning and Management. Reducing the reliability from 96% to 90% for
Bulawayo's water supply dams would provide an additional 40 Ml/day; even if only Insiza dam
(the most reliable supply dam) was operated at 90% reliability, it would provide an additional
15.2 Ml/day.

Distribution losses could be reduced from the current high level of about 45% to 15% over 15
years through pipe lining, pipe replacement and detection of illegal connections, giving a
saving of 45 Ml/day. This is likely to be a cost effective action over the short term compared to
developing new water sources.

Once the Nyamadhlovu wellfieldis rehabilitated, there may be opportunities to continue using
it and other new groundwater sources conjunctively with surface water sources.

Increasing water prices would help reduce demand, encourage adaptive behaviours and
provide revenue to BCC and ZINWA. However, the recent announcement that local authorities
should cancel all outstanding debts on water and rates runs counter to the message that water
is a precious resource and needs to be used efficiently. This measure may not assist the poor,
since the bulk of the money owed to BCC is by Government Institutions, industry and the
wealthy.

Improving revenue collection would also help provide operating funds for BCC. BCC could
apply lessons learnt from its twin organization eThekwini Water in South Africa which collects
95% of its water rates. BCC's recent decision to ring-fence its water revenue, based on a directive
from Ministry of Local Government, will improve its financial resources.
Water Resources Infrastructure. Current projects to rehabilitate both water supply and
wastewater treatment infrastructure will make substantial contributions to helping BCC adapt
to the expected decline in precipitation and increase in evapo-transpiration under climate
change. Nevertheless, even if some of the water savings discussed above are achieved in the
near term, there will be a need to develop additional water supply infrastructure. When
completed, the Gwayi Shangani project will provide an additional 270 Mlpd of raw water. The
project consists of three phases the Gwayi-Shangani Dam, the pipeline from the dam to
Bulawayo, and the pipeline from the Zambezi River to the dam. However, the project cost is very
high (US$1,500 million) and raising funds has been difficult. Recently the GoZ has announced
that the Government of China will provide funds to complete the project.


The Epping Forest groundwater source may provide an additional 15 Mlpd of raw water in the
short-medium term.

Information, Public Education and Communications. There are a number of areas where better
information would help BCC adapt to the effects of climate change. Thus, the yields of dams
could be reassessed to include the likely effects of climate change, to give BCC a clearer idea of
surface water supplies. There is also a need to better understand the customer base and the best
methods for reducing water demand.
        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  42    Management in Zimbabwe
Because of the history of water shortages, the citizens of Bulawayo already exhibit a culture of
water conservation. The government and BCC can reinforce the importance of this
conservative approach to water use through education programs and other support actions.
This includes publicity campaigns and education of school children and adults in the
importance of water conservation given Bulawayo's vulnerability to the effects of climate
change.

Case Study 3: Roswa Dam Operations
Background
The Roswa dam is located on the Roswa River adjacent to Nyika growth point, in Bikita District
about 100 km east of Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe. It is a multi-purpose dam built to supply
water to Nyika and Bikita Service Centres and to irrigate a small holder irrigation scheme south of
Nyika. Ten percent of MAR is also released to meet environmental and other downstream needs.
Under normal circumstances, the urban water supply needs have precedence over irrigation water
needs.

The catchment of 62 km2 has a relatively high MAP of about 700 mm/yr. Mean annual
evaporation is 2000 mm/yr. The rainy season runs from November to April. There are often
severe mid-season dry spells and so the region is marginal for crop production, unless it is
under irrigation.

The irrigation scheme, which was developed in 1994, is the major consumer of water from the
dam. It has a potential irrigated area of 138 ha of which 80 ha is in the process of being fully
developed and 50ha is under a functional irrigation system. The irrigation farmers grow maize,
wheat, beans, tomatoes and other vegetables on 1.5 hectare, 1 hectare or 0.5 hectare plots.

The Roswa irrigation scheme is a resettlement government financed small-holder irrigation
scheme and so receives technical and extension services from Agritex. Capital developments
are financed by Government through appropriation from parliament and donors. However,
the smallholder farmers are nowadays required to pay the full operation and maintenance
costs to service providers including electricity supply.

The dam has a capacity of 2,850 Ml with a design yield is 1,050 Ml at 4% risk, rising to 1,450 Ml
at 10% risk. Irrigation water use is estimated at 240 Ml/annum (Ncube 2010). Because of the
high MAR, the dam can refill every year even if it was completely drawn down the previous year.
At present, there is sufficient water to satisfy primary water releases and the water supply
demand from the growth centres for many years along with the allocation of 12Ml/ha/annum
for irrigation.

An ecotourism operation has also been established based on the wetland formed by the dam
(Mawere and Mubaya 2012).

Issues
Although Roswa dam is structurally sound, the reservoir is probably silting up because of
extensive erosion in the catchment. There are also significant operational issues associated
with the irrigation scheme (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2000). Electricity supply for
pumps is unreliable. Because of poor maintenance some hydrants leak and drag hoses are now
being used to deliver water to irrigation furrows. This is labour-intensive and less efficient.
                                                       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
                                                                                           Management in Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                      43
There are problems with crop selection whereby some farmers grow low value crops such as
maize. The high inputs costs of fertilizers and other chemicals together with low commodity
prices tend to influence the size of land that can be put under irrigation at any one given time.
Irrigation practices are not coordinated which makes it difficult to schedule irrigation water
releases efficiently.

There are also management problems. Originally, farmers felt that the government was
imposing the project on them. In the process of convincing the farmers to accept the project,
the government made some unrealistic promises, which it failed to fulfil and so farmers felt let
down. In addition, different communities sharing the scheme find it difficult to work together
effectively (Food and Agriculture Organization 2000).

There has been a declining trend in rainfall with an increasing trend in temperature over the
last 60 years, although these trends are not statistically significant (Ncube 2010).

Although the dam is currently under-utilised, there could be irrigation water shortages in the
future as a result of reduced MAR from climate change and increased demand from the growth
centres. The analysis undertaken for this report showed that rainfall is likely to decrease by 76mm
to 131mm in Save Catchment by 2050. This in turn will result in decreases of MAR in the Roswa
River and inflows to the Roswa Dam. Ncube (2010) shows that, even if MAR declines by 50%, there
will still be sufficient water available to meet the current level of demand. However, if there is
increased demand for water from the growth centres, an expanded area under irrigation and
downstream users along with a 50% reduction in MAR because of climate change, then allocation
reliability is affected and full allocations are not realised 32% of the time. Under current allocation
priorities, irrigation water allocations would be reduced under these circumstances while
primary uses would be protected.
Adaptation Options
Water Resources Governance. In the long term, the Roswa irrigation scheme could become more
efficient if the distrust between farmers and government was reduced by increasing the level of
responsibility of farmers. They would then be more likely to manage the scheme more
effectively, reduce costs, and innovate in the face of climate change and increased demand for
water from other user groups.

Water Resources Planning and Management. There are opportunities to be more efficient with
current water use, especially for irrigation water use by employing technologies such as drip
irrigation and managing water scheduling more efficiently. Scheduling could be based on
actual water deficit to help improve efficiencies. Modifying crop selection towards more water
efficient and higher value horticultural crops would not only make better use of existing water
but would contribute to improved profitability for the farmers. Increased water prices would
help shift cropping practices towards higher value crops as well as provide ZINWA with
increased operating funds. Domestic water use efficiency could also be improved through
both technical (e.g. reducing leakage) and non-technical (e.g. public awareness campaigns
and increased water prices) means.

The life of the dam could be extended by instituting erosion control measures (such as better
farmer education and protection of vulnerable areas) in the catchment above the dam.


        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
 44     Management in Zimbabwe
Water Resources Infrastructure. Increasing the size of the night storage dam would help alleviate
the problems from the unreliable power supply. More water could be held for supplying to the
irrigation area under gravity when the electricity supply fails.

Although Roswa dam's storage capacity is not an issue at present, there is potential to increase
storage in the long run if an increase in demand begins to outstrip a reduced supply of water.
There is a potential storage capacity in the catchment (at twice MAR) of 9,600 Ml under current
rainfall. While the potential storage capacity will fall as rainfall reduces under climate change, it
may still be possible to construct a new dam or raise the capacity of the existing dam to store
additional water, particularly if there is an increase in the intensity of storm events.

Information, Public Education and Communications. Clearly, many of the above adaptation actions
would require a good understanding by farmers especially, but also by government agency staff
and local leaders, of the potential for improving operating methods to adapt to the likely
impacts of climate change. Given the relative vulnerability of irrigators compared to other
water using groups, many of the adaptation actions fall on the irrigation sector. Officials in the
Department of Irrigation, ZINWA, and Agritex would require additional training in order to
enhance their capabilities in integrated water resources management (IWRM) and scheme
design and their understanding of climate change.

If farmers are to take greater responsibility for scheme management, they will need training in
irrigation operations and management skills.

Officials in the growth centres would also need training to gain a better understanding of the
potential for more efficient urban water use. It is important that the public understands and
supports the need for change and so education campaigns could be designed to make them
aware of the adaptation actions that will be needed in anticipation of climate change.

Case Study 4: Limpopo Basin: Irrigation
Background
The Limpopo River Basin is shared by four countries - Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. The basin has a total area of about 408,000 km² of which nearly half lies in South
Africa. About 15% lies in Zimbabwe, largely in the Mzingwane catchment.

The basin's climate varies spatially and temporally. Precipitation ranges from 250 mm in the
western part of the basin to 1,050 mm in the eastern escarpment areas. Evaporation varies
from 1,500 mm to 2,600 mm per annum across the basin. The Mzingwane catchment receives
475 mm MAP and has a mean annual potential evaporation of 2,065 mm. About 95 percent of
precipitation occurs between October and April with significantly variation between years
(Zhu and Ringler 2012).

Given the low and highly variable rainfall and high evaporation rates, it is difficult to grow crops
reliably within the basin and so there has been considerable investment in irrigation dams
within the basin. There is a high level of water resources development within the basin. Total
annual water demand is 4,700 Mm , which is 65% of the 7,200 Mm MAR. Irrigation is the largest
                                    3                                        3




water use across the basin, although urban, industrial and mining (UIM) water use (690 Mm                                   3




p.a.) constitutes the largest user within the Zimbabwe portion of the basin followed by

                                                                                            Management in Zimbabwe

agriculture (640 Mm p.a.) (Direcçao Nacional de Águas 2010). Water demand in Zimbabwe is
                                3




concentrated in the upper part of the catchment in the Upper Mzingwane River and the
Mwenezi River sub-catchments. Bulawayo obtains its water from the Upper Mzingwane River
catchment and therefore influences development of water resources in that sub-catchment.

Although Basin waters are already heavily committed, there is opportunity for some further
infrastructure development (Direcçao Nacional de Águas 2010). The irrigation potential of
soils of the Limpopo basin within Zimbabwe is estimated at 10,900 ha. Of this area,
approximately 36 % is currently under irrigation. The area under smallholder irrigation is 1,550
ha with water sourced mostly from dams and sand abstraction. There has been widespread
introduction of low cost drip irrigation kits in the communal lands (Love et al 2005). However,
water scarcity rather than suitable soils is the limiting factor for economic development in the
basin (Zhu and Ringler 2012).

All riparian countries have signed the SADC Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses whose
principles are the key for joint management of transboundary waters. All countries also have
the laws and regulations and institutions required for a cooperative management of shared
waters. In 2003 the riparian countries agreed to establish the Limpopo Watercourse
Commission (LIMCOM) to encourage cooperative management of the basin.
Issues
Climate change will affect the basin severely, although the extent is unclear. The Zimbabwe
portion of the basin may potentially receiving 12-15% less MAP and 65-100% less MAR by
2050 according to this report, while Zhu and Ringler (2012) suggest 6-23% decline in MAP and
2-24% decline in MAR.

The climate of the Limpopo basin is highly variable. The Limpopo River experienced major
floods in 1967, 1972, 1975, 1997 and 2000. There were severe droughts in 1980, 1981, 1983,
1984, 1987, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2002 and 2003. Extreme events, such as these, are
predicted to increase in intensity under climate change. Given the existing high degree of
development of the basin's water resources, these changes pose a considerable threat to both
urban and industrial water uses and irrigated food production in southern Zimbabwe.

Management of the basin's water resources will also come under stress as the effects of climate
change become more apparent. Upstream countries will be under pressure to abstract more
water in the face of decreasing MAP and all countries will experience more intense droughts
and floods.

Increased infrastructure development will reduce downstream flows and threaten delicate
aquatic ecosystems along the river particularly in the estuary.

Climate monitoring (i.e. rainfall, temperature and potential evaporation) and flow gauging
stations in the Zimbabwe portion of the basin are inadequate for understanding the effects of
climate change. There are about 70 rainfall stations and 85 gauging stations although none of
the latter are real-time gauging stations and many require maintenance. There has been
improved sharing of meteorological information between basin countries following severe
floods in the basin. Nevertheless, there is a need to extend this cooperation to sharing of flow
data and flood forecasting (World Meteorological Organization 2012).
         Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  46     Management in Zimbabwe
Adaptation Options

Water Resources Governance. Although the Limpopo has a good governance regime in principle,
through the legislation and institutions of the four riparian countries and the formation of
LIMCOM, there are serious weaknesses in practice. Cooperative management of the basin's
water resources will be essential for meeting the challenges posed by climate change, but there
will be pressures for each country to act independently. Zimbabwe along with other riparian
countries will need to actively support LIMCOM in their role to bring about coordinated
management of the basin waters.

Within Zimbabwe there is potential to improve the capacity of water and water-related
agencies and to strengthen the role of the Mzingwane catchment councils and sub-catchment
councils in water allocation decisions when water becomes scarcer.
Water Resources Planning and Management. Perhaps the single most important adaptation
action would be to improve the capacity of management agencies within the basin, including
those in Mzingwane catchment, so that they can understand the implications of climate
change and identify adaptation actions.

Irrigation water managers would need to access improved information on water resources as
climate becomes more variable and be able to anticipate changes in flows. Farmer, too will
require information to make appropriate cropping decisions.

There may be opportunities to use water more conservatively through improved planning and
better operating irrigation procedures. Thus, there may be opportunities to undertake
conjunctive use of surface and groundwater to reduce water losses through engineering
improvements and to reuse discharge waters. There may also be opportunities to modify
operating procedures and farming decisions (such as choice of crop types and planting times)
to adapt to the changing environment.
Water Resources Infrastructure. There are opportunities for irrigation to expand in the Zimbabwe
portion of the basin, with 73% of the MAR undeveloped. Zhu and Ringler (2012) assumed an
annual growth in irrigated area of 1.6% in their modelling, although in the long term climate
change will restrict irrigation expansion. However, given the importance of downstream
ecosystems, any further infrastructure will need to be planned so that environmental flows are
provided to protect these ecosystems.
There may also be opportunities for development of groundwater resources. Apart from South
Africa, ground water is not extensively used for agriculture in the LRB. Zimbabwe, South Africa
and Botswana use water stored in river beds for both irrigation and domestic water supply.
More work is needed in groundwater exploration in order to quantify this resource and its
recharge.
There are also opportunities for improvements in irrigation efficiency to help make better use
of existing water resources. The adoption of drip irrigation shows the adaptability of irrigators
when training and support are made available.
Information, Public Education and Communications. Given the breadth of the predicted declines in
MAR and hence water availability in the Zimbabwe portion of the Limpopo basin, it would be
valuable to undertake detailed investigation of the effects of climate change on both MAR and
inter-annual and intra-annual variability in runoff.

                                                                                          Management in Zimbabwe

There have been a number of initiatives to improve climate and flow monitoring in the Limpopo
Basin over the last decade. These have met with very limited long-term success because of
inadequate project design, technical issues and lack of maintenance (World Meteorological
Organization 2012). There is a need for improved climate monitoring and river gauging in the
Zimbabwe portion of the basin together with improved data exchange and information sharing
between the basin countries for flow forecasting. In particular there is a need for an integrated
flood and drought forecasting system for the basin; freely accessible historic and future climate
change data; and impact and variability assessments from a single authoritative national or
regional source to guide local adaptation programming.

Farmers, including irrigators, already understand that they have to live with a highly variable
climate and believe that the basin is getting warmer and drier with an increase in the frequency
of droughts and the timing of rains. Maponya and Mpandeli (2013) propose adaptation
strategies in the South African portion of the basin including soil management, water
management, and financial management. However, farmers throughout the basin need a
better understanding of climate change and its local implications and better government
support if they are to integrate scientific based knowledge with the indigenous knowledge that
they have traditionally relied on.

Case Study 5: Kariba Hydropower Operations
Background
Lake Kariba was created by the construction in 1958 of a 128 m high double curvature arch dam
on the Zambezi River. The dam's catchment upstream of Lake Kariba covers 815,000 km2 and
includes five riparian states - Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Kariba reservoir was designed for hydropower generation currently providing 750 MW of
generating capacity for Zimbabwe and 720 MW for Zambia. Its vital role for Zimbabwe was
discussed in Chapter 3. The Zambian side is being expanded by an additional 360 MW while
preparations are underway to expand the South Bank generating capacity by 300 MW for
Zimbabwe. The hydropower generation and transmission system has been designed to operate
as one system between Zambia and Zimbabwe, with linked control centres in Harare, operated
by the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), and Lusaka, operated by Zambia
Electricity Supply Company (ZESCO) Ltd. The planned run-of-river Batoka Dam to be
constructed upstream of Kariba (1600 MW) will be operating conjunctively with Kariba dam.

However, the Kariba reservoir now provides multi-purpose benefits including fishing, tourism,
transportation, irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply uses as well as the generation
of power. The Zambezi River also supplies cooling water for Hwange thermal power station
(600 MW) and for the planned Gokwe North thermal scheme with a capacity of 1400 MW.
These water uses on the Zambezi River are managed by various institutions in the two
countries, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Although the Zambezi River Authority Act of 1987 requires the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA)
to manage and operate Kariba Dam and Lake Kariba, ZRA has no prosecuting responsibilities.
Such responsibilities are diffuse and are provided in other legal provisions administered by 14
other organisations in Zambia and Zimbabwe. In short, there is no single institution with the
mandate to manage, protect and operate Lake Kariba.

       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  48   Management in Zimbabwe
Management of the Zambezi basin as a whole (which also encompasses Angola, Botswana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zambia and Zimbabwe)is coordinated by the Zambezi
Basin Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM) which was established in June 2011 after six of the
eight riparian countries ratified the ZAMCOM Agreement. ZAMCOM is still an interim
commission. Amongst other things, ZAMCOM helps riparian countries collect and share data;
harmonize the management and development of the water resources of the basin; avoid
disputes over the management and development of the waters of the Zambezi basin; and
improve public awareness of the use of the waters of the basin.
Issues
The impact of climate change on investment in hydropower and irrigation in the Zambezi River
Valley can be very significant because of the region's highly variable hydrology (World Bank
2010a). Preliminary indications show that some parts of the Basin would be affected more than
others with potential reduction of up to 30 percent in hydropower generation. Even though
these preliminary results should be viewed with caution they illustrate the need for a more
detailed understanding of climate change impacts on water resources and energy in
Zimbabwe.

The key issue is the variability of the Zambezi river flows and changes in the Kariba lake levels,
which would not only impact consumptive and non-consumptive uses of water (such as
irrigation and hydropower generation) but also the productivity of the lake and lake fisheries.
The Zambezi multi-sector investment analysis study assumed that climate change could bring
about reductions in flows within catchments of the Zambezi basin of between 13% (Zambezi
delta) and 34% (Kafue sub-basin) by 2030 (World Bank, 2010a). Evaporative water loss from
large reservoirs such as Lake Kariba will also increase as temperatures increase under climate
change and further decreases water availability for downstream use (Beilfuss 2012).

Major floods have occurred in the Zambezi basin in the past 20 years resulting in significant
damage and loss of life. While there has been no specific modelling of the likely impacts of
climate change on these extreme events in the Zambezi basin, it is a general conclusion that
extreme events will become more intense (i.e. floods will become larger and droughts will be
drier) as a result of climate change (IPCC 2007a).

Some authorities claim that the impacts of climate change are already apparent in Lake Kariba.
The MAR appears to have reduced since construction of Kariba dam, leading to reduced flow at
the dam although there is not yet a consensus that this reduction is the result of climate
change. Lake Kariba's lowest water level was recorded in 1989/90 when the level was only
0.75m above the minimum supply level (or the permissible power generating level). Magadza
(2010) reports that the lake has undergone changes in its thermal properties which affect its
physical properties such as a shallower and warmer surface layer, and a higher heat content.
This has affected its ecology, most notably a change in algal species and in some invertebrate
species. These changes have in turn, led to a major reduction in food for the economically
important Limnothrissamiodon fish (Magadza 2011) and a decline in the fishery from 37,000
tonnes around 1990 to 20,000 tonnes in 2000. This also impacts the local diet as lake fish forms
an important source of protein. Magadza attributes these changes to climate change.

                                                                                          Management in Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                     49
In addition to reduced flows, the Zambezi River has become more polluted, with Zimbabwe
being a major source of this pollution from cities and towns, mining and agriculture. Pollutants
include agro-chemicals, sediment and nutrients. The increase in nutrient loads has been a
major cause of invasive water weeds on Lake Kariba (primarily water hyacinth (Eichornia
Crassipes) and Kariba weed (Salvinia Molesta)) that cause operational problems for hydro-
power generation and for tourism and recreation on the lake.

The present fragmented administrative and regulatory arrangements make management of
the lake and the Zambezi River cumbersome and ineffective. These arrangements are
inadequate at a time when management of the lake and the river needs to be flexible, forward
looking and decisive. Water users are disconnected from the lake and river managers.
Magadza (2010) says that “there is a real danger of mistaking a bureaucratic process with little
connection with stakeholder priorities and concepts for an effective management regime”. At
present, miners, farmers and other land users in the lake's catchment are unaware of many
management plans such as the 'Combination Master Plans for Shoreline Development' and
several Zambezi Action Plan documents (Magadza 2010).
Adaptation Opportunities
Water Resources Governance. The fragmentation of responsibilities between multiple agencies
within the eight countries comprising the Zambezi River Basin is possibly the greatest
impediment to adaptability in the face of climate change. The formalization of the ZAMCOM
would be an important step towards improving the situation. While its responsibilities are
limited, they include strategic planning, information gathering and early warning, and
monitoring water abstraction all of which provide capability for adapting to climate change.

Water Resources Planning and Management. Climate change will bring increased uncertainties to
the management of the Zambezi River with reduced flows and increased risks of severe
droughts and floods. Management of all water uses, and hydropower operations in particular,
will need to be better informed and more adaptable to adjust to these changes. For example,
World Bank (2010a) shows that coordinated basin-wide operation of existing hydropower
facilities could lead to an increase in hydropower production of about 1600 Gwh/year, as well
as help build a more flexible management system.

Beilfuss (2012) sees the development of strong institutional capacity as the single most
important factor in the successful adaptation of existing hydropower systems in the Zambezi
Basin to cope with climate change. Significant technical, financial, and social capacity is
required at different scales, from strong and well-governed national water ministries and river
basin operators, through regional departments and basin councils, to local river basin offices
and water user associations. Improved capacity should also include the capacity to manage the
vital fisheries and environmental resources offered by critical ecosystems in Lake Kariba.

Water users other than hydropower operators, particularly those downstream of hydropower
operations, will require improved certainty of access to flows if they are to continue operations
under climate change. Consequently, environmental flow provisions will be critical if tourism
operators, recreation facilities and local communities downstream of dams are to adapt to a
changing climate.



        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  50    Management in Zimbabwe
Water Resources Infrastructure. The proposed Batoka run-of-river hydropower dam will reduce
Zimbabwe's and Zambia's reliance on Kariba Dam for power production. However, fundamental
design criteria such as MAR and maximum probable floods for all dams, existing and proposed,
should be reviewed in light of the changes that will occur under climate change. Risk
assessments should also be reviewed for dams and other infrastructure such as cooling water
provision for thermal power stations, using multiple climate scenarios given the heightened
potential for both catastrophic failure of structures and lack of water under new climate
realities. New infrastructure proposals should also be analysed for their financial risks, as a
result of precipitation and evaporation changes within the Zambezi basin.

The major Zambezi river dams such as Kariba and Caborra Basa and new dams such as Batoka
should be operated conjunctively as recommended by the World Bank (2010a) to optimize the
benefits from the uses of water and for effective flood management. Flood management can
also be improved through non-structural interventions such as improved precipitation
monitoring and flow modelling, and retention of floodplains for reducing flood peaks.

It would be sensible to also examine options for reducing Zimbabwe's reliance on the Zambezi
River for power generation by increasing investment in solar and wind energy.

Information, Public Education and Communications. It will be important to improve the
information basis for decisions in the Zambezi Basin and to strengthen the regional capacity for
river basin planning, modelling and operations. There is a need for better weather forecasting
so that any increase in flood heights can be anticipated and managed, including for
communities downstream of dams. Management tools such as flood forecasting systems,
routing models, conjunctive management systems, and monitoring and adaptive management
protocols could be assessed to assist managers of all water uses, especially hydropower and
thermal power operations.

Overall there is a need for better understanding of the likely effects of climate change on the
water resources of the Basin. The multi-sector investment opportunity analysis study of the
Zambezi River basin modelled the effects of a single climate change scenario on catchment
yield, open water evaporation from large reservoirs and crop water demand but did not explore
a wider range of climate change scenarios and their implications largely because of lack of
information (World Bank 2010a).

Planners and managers need to engage extensively with water dependent and water related
communities within the Basin, such as fisher folk, irrigators, tourism operators, miners, and
urban water authorities so that all groups have a thorough understanding of the potential
impacts of climate change and their adaptation options.

6. Adaptation Opportunities


This chapter summarizes the opportunities for undertaking the climate change adaptation
activities that have been discussed in the preceding two chapters. These activities are
organized under the modified SADC headings used in Chapter 5 water resources governance;
water resources planning and management; water resources infrastructure; and information,
public education and communications.

Water Resources Governance
Under the 1998 Water Act, MEWC takes the lead in the water sector. ZINWA is the main
operating arm of government guided by the Department of Water Resources (DWR) within
MEWC for regulation. MEWC is assisted by stakeholder institutions in the form of Catchment
Councils and Sub-Catchment Councils. The Catchment Councils have responsibility for water
allocation planning through River System Outline Plans (RSOPs) and the issuing of water use
permits while sub-catchment councils have responsibility for enforcement of permits. EMA is
responsible for water for the environment and for controlling pollution in surface and
groundwater systems.

There are a number of structural shortcomings with these administrative arrangements that
will inhibit climate change adaptation. First, there is a lack of coordination across Ministries.
Instead Ministries and even their subsidiary components usually act independently even on
cross-cutting issues such as water quality and land-water interactions. Secondly, RSOPs do not
take account of the effects of climate change on water allocations as well as being out of date.
There are also some potential conflicts of interest between Catchment Councils and ZINWA
over administration of permit water and agreement water. Thirdly, there is no clear mechanism
for protecting water source areas for both surface and groundwater systems (runoff to streams,
and recharge zones for aquifers). Under the Environmental Management Act (2006) EMA has
been given prime responsibility for protecting these areas, but this requires close cooperation
with other resource management agencies such as ZINWA, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Mechanization and Irrigation Development (MAMID) and the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare (MHCW). The current National Action Committee for Water and Sanitation (NAC) has
not been an effective mechanism for bringing about cross-sectoral cooperation.

The NWP provides an excellent basis for promoting climate change adaptation into water
resources governance. The policy recognizes that climate change increases the risk from floods
and droughts, reduces water availability for agriculture, and will affect the design and operation
of dams. It advocates that climate change be taken into account in all water resources design,
planning and management activities, that the NAC coordinates collaborative action with other
stakeholders (a no-regrets action), and that further research be undertaken into the effects of
climate change. Cross-sectoral coordination is important because adaptation requires action
by both the water resources and the water using sectors the first to promote efficiency in water
supply and the other to promote efficiency in water demand. The NAC needs to be reviewed
and restricted to make it more effective.

Complementary sectoral policies need to enable rather than inhibit adaptation actions. For


        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  52    Management in Zimbabwe
example, if there is an increase in small scale irrigation as a response to food security under
changing agricultural conditions, then the water sector will need to be part of that initiative in
order to provide reliable water. Similarly, the policies of other sectors, such as forestry, may have
an impact on water resources and so should be coordinated with the NWP through the NCCRS.

The Environmental Management Act also provides, at least on paper, a strong base for climate
change adaptation because it provides the legislative authority to protect natural systems
wetlands, riparian areas, floodplains, etc from degradation and to build resilience against
climate change. However, the provisions in this Act and in the Water Act are not always
enforced. For example, Zimbabwe is projected to be even more susceptible to floods than it is
at present due to climate change. However, the provisions under both the Water Act (1998) and
the Environmental Management Act (2000), to prevent the cultivation of wetlands and stream
banks and the destruction of these areas from artisanal mining are not enforced.

Local adaptation to climate change should be encouraged as well as national adaptation
actions. Chagutah (2010) states that “local participation and accounting for household coping
strategies remain real challenges in the development of adaptation policies, because there is a
tendency for interventions to focus at the sectoral level. There is a danger that nationally
prescribed adaptation solutions, without participation from those intended to adopt the
practices, will actually limit, rather than create, spaces for local adaptation”. The studies into
agricultural climate change adaptation have demonstrated that local communities and
individual farmers are already highly adaptable to a variable climate and potentially capable of
adapting to climate change, particularly if obstacles are removed and assistance is provided.
However, local communities have little legal responsibility for water management and local
methods for coping with water stresses are not taken into account by government agencies.
Moving away from a centralized to a decentralized approach to water management and
treating local communities as partners will take considerable courage on the part of
government and would require a major increase in the skills and funds available to Catchment
Councils.

Despite the intention of setting a price for water that initially reflects operating and
maintenance costs during the economic recovery period and subsequently reflects the full cost
of water provision, water is still subsidized. This not only exacerbates ZINWA's shortage of
operating and maintenance funds but also prevents consumers from appreciating the true
value of water. Actions that help adapt to a drier and more variable climate, such as water reuse
and conservation, are not encouraged when water prices are held artificially low. An
independent Water and Wastewater Services Regulatory Unit would be effective way to remove
the issue of water pricing from the political arena and place prices on a rational footing.

Transboundary water agreements need to be able to adapt to future climates where water in
major river systems such as the Limpopo and the Zambezi becomes scarcer. Whilst both river
basins are managed through transboundary institutions ZAMCOM and LIMCOM neither has
the capacity to investigate and adapt to changing climate conditions without robust support
from their member governments. It would be in Zimbabwe's interest to advocate strengthening
these transboundary institutions and reducing the complexity of water resources management
in the Zambezi Basin so that there is a more coordinated and flexible response to changes in

                                                                                                                       53
Chagutah (2010) claims that the water rights system in Zimbabwe may not be sufficiently
robust in both its design and implementation in the face of climate change. There are no strong
legal provisions to handle conflicts over water, and the dual system for allocating water lacks
flexibility and simplicity. On the other hand Levina (2006) believes that the system of time-
limited water abstraction permits “increase flexibility and allow abstraction to be stopped
when water levels become too low” although he agrees that the implementation of water
abstraction permits is still very weak.

Introducing a market mechanism for water trading would also increase flexibility and
efficiency of use (Levina 2006). While a formal water market would be impractical for
Zimbabwe at present, informal, local markets could be authorized under legislation without
requiring excessive overheads to establish. Such markets could be established in local areas
where neighbouring water users buy and sell water rights without oversight from an external
regulatory authority (Easter et al, 1999).

While the NWP recognizes the importance of managing both surface and groundwater, it does
not emphasize conjunctive management or managed aquifer recharge. Yet both management
techniques offer opportunities for making better use of existing water resources and coping
better with increased climate variability.

   Possible adaptation actions:
   ?  Coordination between land and water management agencies should be improved to
      protect water sources. The role of the NAC should be reviewed.
   ?  Need to review existing national and water-related sectoral policies to ensure they
      adequately address climate-related challenges.
   ?  Enforcing legislation to protect wetlands, floodplains riparian zones and other
      ecologically important aquatic areas.
   ?  Increase local involvement in water management through user groups and
      strengthening catchment and sub-catchment councils.
   ?  Investigate politically acceptable methods for increasing water prices to reflect the true
      cost of water provision raising water prices, including appointment of an independent
      Water and Wastewater Services Regulatory Unit.
   ?  Reduce the complexity of management institutions in the Zambezi Basin and provide
      increased support to transboundary water management institutions in the Zambezi
      and Limpopo Basins to help provide more coordinated and flexible responses as the
      climate changes.
   ?  Examine methods for strengthening and simplifying the water permit system
   ?  Examine possibility of introducing an informal market for trading water permits to
      improve water efficiency.
   ?  Investigate whether there are regulatory or other methods for promoting conjunctive
      use of surface water and groundwater and for making greater use of managed aquifer
      recharge in appropriate areas.

Water Resources Planning and Management
Improved water management will help conserve existing water resources as well as cope with
increased variability resulting from climate change. There are a range of water management
techniques that could be adopted or extended in areas of likely water stress, including demand
management, managed aquifer recharge, greater re-use of wastewater and stormwater,
conjunctive management, greater use of drip irrigation in small scale irrigation such as the

       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
 54    Management in Zimbabwe
Roswa Irrigation Scheme, and rainwater harvesting. Clifton et al (2010) summarizes adaptation
options for groundwater management.

There are also improvements available to operating procedures, including improved collection
of water fees (coupled with use of the fees for maintenance), reducing water leakages, more
efficient water scheduling in irrigation districts, and removing unauthorized connections in
urban areas such as Harare and Bulawayo, and pricing water at its true cost so that ZINWA
receives adequate operating funds. Water pricing is based on a national uniform blend that is
set low relative to other countries, in order to stimulate water use and help revive irrigated
agriculture. However, this policy exacerbates ZINWA's shortfall in operating funds and could be
reviewed, along with the establishment of a Water and Wastewater Services Regulatory Unit to
remove pricing from the political arena.

Under the 1998 Water Act water allocation planning is undertaken by Catchment Councils.
This is important for climate change adaptation, because it allows locally responsive responses
to effects of climate change. However, with the exception of Manyame catchment, the Councils
lack the capacity to develop these plans and have relied on ZINWA to produce RSOPs. It will be
even more demanding to write RSOPs that incorporate the likely effects of climate change on
both water supply and water demand.

Water permits are issued on the basis of historical records of MAR and do not take account of
changes in precipitation and runoff because of climate change.

It is important that the resilience of natural systems to climate variability be protected through
management activities. Improved water quality protection through better enforcement of
existing provisions and closer cooperation with EMA would not only improve human and
environmental health but would expand the available supply of useable water in cities such as
Harare where natural ecosystems filter pollutants from wastewater before it enters water
supply treatment plants. In another example, both the Water Act (1998) and the
Environmental Management Act (2000) forbid the cultivation of wetlands and stream banks
and also their degradation through artisanal mining, yet subsistence farmers and miners
continue to work in these restricted areas. As a consequence, the natural buffering capacity of
these important ecosystems has been lost. In other cases, such as at Kariba dam, sufficient
environmental flows need to be allocated under changing river flows to ensure the integrity of
the downstream ecosystems (particularly the Zambezi delta) on which many communities rely.

Ensuring environmental flows in RSOPs, as well as in transboundary water systems such as the
Limpopo and Zambezi Rivers, will provide better protection for natural ecosystems that
provide important ecosystem services for many communities.

    Possible adaptation actions:
    ? Examine opportunities for increased use of techniques such demand management,
      managed aquifer recharge, greater re-use of wastewater and stormwater, conjunctive
      management and rainwater harvesting.
    ? Examine opportunities for better operating procedures such as increased collection of
      water fees, better enforcement of water use permits, reducing leakage and introducing
      full cost recovery.

Water Resources Infrastructure
Urban water supply and wastewater infrastructure is seriously deteriorated. The level of service
coverage has declined with 2008 figures showing about 46% access to improved drinking
water and 30% to improved sanitation. Wastewater collection systems are often blocked or
broken and treatment plants have largely ceased to function apart from primary treatment,
leading to the discharge of only partially treated sewage into rivers. There was also a loss of
skilled staff during the financial crisis further exacerbating the maintenance problem.

There is a need to move from emergency assistance for urban water supply and wastewater
treatment towards a more systematic approach. Technical investigations are now underway for
a strategic upgrade plan for water supply and sanitation facilities across Zimbabwe.

Dams for supplying irrigation water are under-utilized because of the decline in irrigated
agriculture. The 2012 dam safety report found that, while the dam structures themselves were
generally in a good state, maintenance had been neglected. Small dams, particularly those for
which ZINWA is responsible for maintenance following the land reform program, are likely to be
in a worse state. Much of the irrigation infrastructure, both on state farms and small holder
irrigation infrastructure needs maintenance (Economic Consulting Associates, Dorsch
International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and Partners 2013b) and a
strategy is being developed for rehabilitating this infrastructure.

There is little information available on the status of rural water supply schemes apart from 12
schemes assessed by the Water Sector Investment Analysis project (Economic Consulting
Associates, Dorsch International Consultants, and Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnel and
Partners 2013b). These schemes were generally rated as being in Fair or Good condition, with
abstraction equipment being in poor condition but treatment works and pipelines generally
operating satisfactorily. Three rural wastewater disposal systems were assessed and all were
rated as poor.

Thus it is now timely to move away from the assumption of climate stationarity and
incorporate the medium-long term effects of climate change into water resources
infrastructure planning and operations. Climate change not only means that new
infrastructure needs to be sized to suit a drier climate in some areas but that it also needs to be
designed for a more variable climate. Risk assessments could be revised for both existing and
planned infrastructure, such as the Batoka dam on the Zambezi River, to take account of
climate change. Future investments in energy provision could include examination of water
independent options, such as solar and wind energy, to avoid the reduced water availability
arising from climate change. In the longer term, climate change effects will need to be reflected
in design standards for dams, bridges, flood levees, etc.

         Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  56     Management in Zimbabwe
The current practice in the MEWC is to offer water at a constant yield with 90% reliability for
agricultural use and 96% reliability for UIM. Prior to ZINWA acquiring responsibility for private
dams, farmers would adopt a higher risk of failure in order to expand their land under irrigation.
ZINWA is currently considering a strategy of reducing the reliability to 90% and 80% for UIM
and agriculture respectively where it is feasible. Thus, Bulawayo could receive an additional
40Ml/day if the reliability factor was reduced to 90%. The yields of each catchment should be
recalculated since they are dependent on precipitation and temperature, both of which will
change under climate change.

Flood control measures will also need to be designed to take account of more intense storms
and floods. These measures could include a mixture of structural and non-structural measures
(such as land use controls and land management, and restoration of wetlands) as well as better
medium term weather forecasting. Large dams, such as the Kariba dam, would need to be
informed by early warning systems and operated so as to allow for increased floods. Cascades
of dams, such as those on the Zambezi River, should be operated conjunctively to maximize
their flood protection potential.

Possible adaptation actions
     ?   Incorporate climate change outcomes into water resources infrastructure design and
         planning for irrigation, water supply and flood control purposes
     ?   Investigate the incorporation of climate change outcomes in design standards for
         infrastructure
     ?   Examine the benefits and costs of increasing the risk factor for agricultural and urban
         water provision to accept the increased variability under climate change
     ?   Expected yields should be recalculated for each catchment taking account of the
         temperature and precipitation changes expected under climate change.
     ?   Risk assessments could be undertaken for all major infrastructure, existing and
         planned, to account for the effects of climate change
     ?   Water-independent energy options, such as wind and solar farms, could be included in
         future energy planning.

Information, Public Education and Communications
A comprehensive information and education program is needed to build greater
understanding of climate change and the need for adaptation. The level of understanding of
climate change amongst politicians and senior decision-makers inside and outside
government is still limited. Most of them are not conversant with the subject, which makes it
difficult for them to understand authorize and encourage adaptation actions. There is little
understanding of fundamentals, for example that implementing IWRM principles constitutes a
no regrets action that goes a long way towards building adaptability to climate change.

More generally, there is a need to provide information and training on climate change and its
potential impacts to water resources managers and users, so that they can make informed
decisions about adaptation activities. There is already a strong awareness amongst farmers of
climate variability along with a belief that variability has been increasing, as is illustrated in
surveys conducted in some Limpopo irrigation areas. This provides a platform for introducing
the concepts of climate change and the need to take action now to adapt to a drier and more
variable climate. Few of the strategies employed by farmers to coping with drought have been
recorded to promote their wider adoption as adaptation strategies.

                                                                                          Management in Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                     57
There are also serious capacity constraints in central government agencies, Catchment
Councils and local government water departments as a result of the economic crisis.
Transboundary institutions, such as LIMCOM and ZAMCOM, also need training in climate
change and its potential implications for managing transboundary water resources. In
particular professionally trained staff are in short supply.

Surface water flow monitoring networks within Zimbabwe are dilapidated. Gauging stations
have suffered from lack of maintenance resulting in siltation, leaking foundations and walls,
and damaged or missing equipment. In addition the data base holding the flow records is old
and difficult to interrogate. There is very little groundwater level or water quality monitoring,
apart from some site specific monitoring near mining sites and in some urban areas. Although
it is known that drilling of boreholes accelerated when urban water supplies became unsafe or
unreliable, there is no central registry of boreholes. Weather forecasting and gauging stations
could also be improved in transboundary waters such as the Zambezi river so that managers of
critical infrastructure such as the Kariba dam have advanced warning about weather extremes.

Responsibility for both surface and groundwater monitoring is divided between the catchment
authorities and ZINWA for water resources and the EMA for water quality. Much of the water
quality information is difficult to obtain because it is regarded as commercially sensitive.

An early warning drought alert system has been developed by the Zimbabwe Meteorological
Services to provide a pre-season assessment and another midway through the rainy season.
However, these systems are only useful if farmers and irrigators are educated in using them.

While there have been a number of research studies into climate change impacts on
agricultural activities within Zimbabwe, there is little active research into water resources
impacts. In particular, there has been neither a thorough analysis of the extent and severity of
changes to climate parameters (such as precipitation, evaporation and temperature) across
Zimbabwe as a result of climate change, nor the consequent effects on water resources. There
is a need for basic climate change predictions that are accepted across government and that
can act as the basis for medium-long term planning. The preliminary study undertaken here
was very restricted and can only be regarded as indicative of the extent of impacts on water
resources. This information is fundamental to making good decisions about adapting to
climate change.

A Centre of Excellence could be established where the country's expertise could be harnessed
to develop these predictions and to undertake priority research into critical topics such as
effects of climate change on the long-term viability of groundwater systems, particularly the
groundwater dependent ecosystems that people in rural areas often rely for food, provision of
fibre and natural medicines, and areas for cropping and cattle grazing. Management of
transboundary basins, such as the Zambezi Basin, could also be improved if a study was
undertaken of the potential impacts of a range of possible climate change scenarios.

   Possible adaptation actions:
   ?  Develop a comprehensive information and education program for decision makers,
      water users and resource managers.
   ?  Document farmer coping mechanisms for climate variability and investigate
      opportunities for scaling up best adaptation practices by communities.

7. Findings and Recommendations



Findings
Previous studies by the IFPRI, IIED, UNDP/GEF and SADC together with a current project
conducted by GWP are all contributing towards a better understanding of the potential
impacts of climate change on Zimbabwe. The present study adds to this growing body of
knowledge by focussing specifically on the potential impacts of climate change on Zimbabwe's
water resources. The study has found that:

   1. The potential threats from climate change are not yet well widely appreciated and are
        still not properly integrated into water planning and management.
   2.   Preliminary climate change modelling using simple methods suggests that MAP will
        decline in southern Zimbabwean catchments by up to 16% by 2050 whether or not the
        world succeeds in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The northern catchments
        (Manyame and Mazowe) will remain relatively unaffected. Temperatures and hence
        evapotranspiration will increase everywhere and the climate will become more variable
        than it is at present.
   3.   MAR will be even more affected by climate change than will MAP. The extent of the
        decline in runoff is difficult to quantify without calibrated flow models. However,
        preliminary estimates from this study suggest that flows in Manyame and Mazowe
        catchments are likely to be little affected by climate change, while flows in drier
        southern catchments such as Mzingwane and Gwayi could be reduced significantly.
   4.   Groundwater will also be affected. While there is insufficient understanding to calculate
        the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge, expert understanding suggests
        that the greatest impacts will be felt in the drier catchments, especially Runde and
        Mzingwane. Thus the southern parts of Zimbabwe will experience declines in both
        surface and groundwater availability as climate change takes hold.
   5.   Dambos, aquifers in gneiss and granite rocks, unconfined aquifers that receive direct
        recharge from rainfall, and aquifers in highly dissected terrain are all likely to receive less
        recharge and become less reliable sources of water for rural water supply and irrigation.
   6.   On the other hand, deeper sedimentary aquifers and primary unconfined aquifers such
        as the Kalahari sands and recent alluvial aquifers are less likely to be affected by climate
        change and may become valuable sources of water as MAP declines across southern
        parts of Zimbabwe.
   7.   These results, if they are confirmed by more detailed analysis, have major implications
        for Zimbabwe. Existing sources of water for urban and rural areas in southern Zimbabwe
        will become more unreliable; irrigated and dry land agriculture and food security will be
        jeopardized; electricity production from both hydropower and thermal stations could
        be affected; and activities such as mining, irrigation, water supply and sewage
        treatment that are dependent on reliable electricity will be affected.
   8.   Overall, this reduction in water availability coupled with national population growth,
        means that per capita availability could decline by 38% by 2050 even with attempts to
        curb greenhouse gas emissions. By 2080, Zimbabwe could fall into the United Nations
        “absolute water scarcity” category if medium or high population growth occurs.
   9.   Zimbabwe has a good framework for water resources management that suffers from
        poor implementation. However, this weak implementation offers many opportunities
        for adaptation actions.



        Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
 60     Management in Zimbabwe
   10. These opportunities to adapt to climate change range from strengthening the
       governance framework, to improving water planning and management, to continuing
       to invest in infrastructure, to educating and training, to supporting greater involvement
       by water users and the community in decision making. They occur at all levels, from
       transboundary water management, to strengthening the national water governance
       framework, to improving regional water planning and its implementation, to
       supporting local efforts to adapt to climate change. Most of these are “no regrets”
       activities in that they strengthen IWRM irrespective of the extent of climate change
       impacts.

Recommendations
This study has also highlighted some technical issues that should be addressed to help improve
government's ability to understand and adapt to climate change impacts on the water sector.
These include:
   1. Improved monitoring of climate, rivers flows and groundwater levels to provide the
       factual basis for understanding the growing impact of climate change on Zimbabwe's
       water resources.
   2. Undertaking scientific studies into groundwater characteristics (recharge rates,
       transmissivities, water dependent ecosystems, etc) and developing models of surface
       water and groundwater flows that would help predict climate change impacts on water
       resources and explore adaptation options.
   3. Undertaking a more thorough analysis than was possible in this study of climate change
       impacts on water resources, including:
          a. Use of multiple GCMs to simulate possible climate futures
           b. Exploring a wider range of emission scenarios
           c. Utilizing a monthly time step in the models so that seasonal changes can be
              assessed
           d. Including the effects of temperature changes on evaporation
           e. Coupling climate outcomes to river flow models
           f. Partitioning precipitation into runoff and groundwater recharge, and
           g. Exploring impacts on water demand as well as water supply
           4. Reaching agreement on the climate and hydrological data to be used in climate
              change studies so that the dependence of the predictions on the choice of
              precipitation data, encountered in this study, can be avoided.

A wide range of adaptation opportunities have been proposed in Chapter 6. These
opportunities could be embedded in a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Water
Sector to assist their adoption and implementation. Such a Strategy could constitute the
Water Sector's contribution to implementing the NCCRS and recommendations of the WSIA.

The formation of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate merging the mandates of
the three key areas environment, water and climate under the new cabinet provides an
excellent opportunity to re-align and work out effective coordination at the policy, regulatory
and institutional levels to systematically address climate change adaptation in the water and
water related sectors.

Appendix A Climate Change Initiatives



Water, Climate and Development Programme (WACDEP)
In late 2010, the African Ministers Council on Water asked the Global Water Partnership (GWP)
to implement the Water, Climate and Development Programme (WACDEP). The program will
be implemented from 2011 to 2016 to integrate climate resilience into development planning,
build climate resilience and support countries adapt to a new climate regime through
increased investments in water security. The program is being initially implemented in eight
countries including Zimbabwe, as well as in four river basins including the Limpopo Basin.

WACDEP will support other initiatives that are improving climate resilience within Zimbabwe,
including the development of the NCCRS, the implementation of the new National Water
Policy, the rehabilitation and development of water supply systems through the multi-donor
Trust Fund, and the revision of the River System Outline Plans.

WACDEP will be operationalized through in Zimbabwe through four components:
    ?  Investments in regional and national development
    ?  Innovative Green Solutions
    ?  Knowledge and capacity development
    ?  Partnership and Sustainability
WACDEP will work at multiple levels. It investment options at local level, help integrate water
security in local government strategies and plans, help develop Water Security and Climate
Resilience Investment Options for two water-related sectors (Agriculture and Energy), and will
also contribute to transboundary basin level work of relevance to Zimbabwe (Limpopo,
Zambezi, and Pungue River Basins).

International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)
The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) has undertaken a review
of the impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in Zimbabwe. They found that
while local farmers have developed strategies for coping with risks arising from climate
variability, these coping mechanisms are unlikely to be capable of responding to the changes
that will arise because of global warming.

The study provided recommendations for adaptation projects as well as recommendations for
policy and governance. The former included improved community participation, better use of
climate information, and conducting vulnerability assessments across sectors in rural and
urban areas; the latter included exploration of the benefits of LDC status for developing a
climate change framework, accessing new adaptation funds, improving multi-level risk
governance that links communities, civil society, private sector and government, better
inclusion of marginalized groups in decision making, and climate awareness campaigns aimed
at government, civil society and the general public (IIED 2012).




       Climate Change and Water Resources Planning, Development and
  68   Management in Zimbabwe
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
IFPRI has published a report on the implications of climate change on water resources in the
Limpopo Basin (Zhu and Ringler 2010) using a single climate model for four emission scenarios.
There was a significant decrease in precipitation and water availability under all four scenarios
resulting in increased stress on irrigation and adding further constraints on the capacity of the
basin to support increased irrigation development. Even small changes in precipitation
patterns will need to be incorporated into water resource and agricultural planning.

Improvements in water infrastructure and management could potentially mitigate these
stresses. The report points out that it is important to gain a more thorough understanding of
the effects of climate change on irrigation because expansion of irrigated agriculture has been
identified as one of the development strategies in basins such as the Limpopo.

IFPRI has also undertaken an analysis of the effects of climate change on maize and sorghum
production in Zimbabwe as part of the Southern African Agriculture and Climate Change
project using four climate change models and a number of country-level GDP scenarios.
Modelling results suggest that maize yields within Zimbabwe will more than double between
2010 and 2050 under all scenarios and climate models. Millet and sorghum yields were also
predicted to rise dramatically during this period, although increased domestic consumption of
these crops could result in a fall of exports.

Zambezi River Multi-sector Investment Opportunity Analysis (MSIOA)
The World Bank funded the Zambezi River Multi-Sector Investment Opportunity Analysis
(MSIOA) to illustrate the benefits of cooperation among the riparian countries in the Zambezi
river basin. The study undertook a multi-sectoral economic evaluation of water resources
development, management options and scenarios from both national and basin-wide
perspectives. The scenarios ranged from coordinated operation of existing hydropower
facilities, development of new hydropower facilities as envisaged by the Southern African Power
Pool, development of the irrigation potential of the region, and flood management
infrastructure.

The study found that there were many opportunities for development in the basin, with the
greatest opportunities arising from cooperative development amongst the Zambezi riparian
nations. Thus, cooperative development of the basin's hydropower potential would provide
23% more energy generation than would uncoordinated development. The effects of climate
change were included through a rudimentary incremental variation of key driving factors
including reduced runoff, increased irrigation deficits and increased evapotranspiration. The
analysis indicated a reduction of 32 percent infirm energy generation compared with the no
climate change. The authors emphasize that these results rely on major assumptions and
should be taken as indicative only.

Southern African Development Community (SADC)
The Southern Africa Development Corporation has produced a handbook on climate change in
order to provide current information on the impact and risk of climate change and the potential
for adaptation. The handbook does not predict outcomes from climate change at country or
even river basin level; nor does it offer particular solutions to the effects of climate change.
Rather it provides a factual basis upon which decision-makers can rely when making decisions.

UNDP
The UNDP has implemented the Coping with Drought and Climate Change program in
Zimbabwe since 2007. Its aim is to demonstrate and promote a range of gender segregated
approaches for adaptation to climate change among rural communities currently engaged in
agriculture in vulnerable areas of Chiredzi district as a national model. The programme is
partially funded through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) small grants programme which
has been operational in Zimbabwe since 1993. The program has helped develop downscaled
climate change scenarios for the Runde and Save catchments, undertaken a sensitivity
assessment of surface water supplies in Save and Runde catchments to climate change impacts,
and undertaken risk and vulnerability assessment for Chiredzi District within Save catchment.

Appendix B Zimbabwe Groundwater Resources and
Development Potential


This summary follows the method in Ministry of Energy and Water Resources Development
(1985) where geological rock type is used as the primary means of characterizing the various
aquifer systems. Rainfall, topography and relief and land use/land cover are used to provide a
secondary level of characterization of the hydro-geological units.

Approximately 65% of Zimbabwe is covered by crystalline basement rocks such as gneiss,
granite, meta-volcanics and meta-sediments. These lithologies give rise to fractured aquifers
with low porosity and permeability. Aquifers develop where there is increased fracture density,
favorable topography, soil use and land cover that favors recharge and higher rainfall. These
aquifers are typically unconfined (i.e. not covered by an impermeable soil or rock layer)
although some may be perched and semi-unconfined locally.

The remaining 35% of the country consists of extensive sedimentary formations, mostly
located in the north-west/north and the south-east of the country. These sedimentary
formations have high porosity and permeability and form extensive aquifer systems. Such
aquifer systems are unconfined in their recharge areas, becoming confined when they dip
beneath impermeable formations. Although these sedimentary aquifers are considered to
have the highest groundwater development potential in Zimbabwe, they occur for the most
part in areas with the lowest population densities in the country.

Preliminary calculations suggest that there is considerable potential for further developing
Zimbabwe's groundwater resources18. On the assumption that the average annual recharge is a
proxy for the long term sustainable yield, the calculations in Table 6 show that up to 12,900 Gl /
yr could be available. Table B1 shows the characteristics of groundwater in each catchment and
its potential for development. Generally, those rated as having high groundwater development
potential are suitable for commercial irrigation development and for urban water supplies;
those with moderate potential are suitable for small-scale irrigation and small piped water
supplies for villages and growth points; while those with low potential can support rural water
supply development.

The estimates in Table 6 over-estimate the true sustainable yield because they fail to recognize
the need to retain groundwater to be used as a buffer in times of drought. In the case of
sedimentary aquifers (Karoo sandstone and the Kalahari) and deeply weathered areas, this
storage may be vast, amounting to decades of demand. The assumption also does not
recognize the need to maintain discharge to baseflows in rivers and groundwater dependent
ecosystems (GDEs) which comes off the top of the groundwater column. A more nuanced
definition of sustainable yield is needed to provide drought reserves and protect groundwater
discharge to the environment.

In addition, not all groundwater can be recovered profitably. Some may be of poor quality,
some may be too deep to be economically worth recovering, and some may be too far from
potential places of use to be worth pumping. In an irrigation project in the Save valley, for

example, the water from 1 in 4 boreholes was found to be too saline to be used for irrigating
crops. Adding treatment costs to pumping of groundwater would likely make it prohibitively
expensive even for domestic uses, let alone for irrigation. Groundwater cannot be a solution to
climate change by itself, but it may provide a potentially important source of water when
surface water becomes scarcer and less reliable under climate change. However, the
government will need to make a commitment to increased groundwater investigations if there
is to be an understanding of the actual extent of the resource and its potential for economic
development.
