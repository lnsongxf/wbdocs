Executive Summary
Description of the Program

1.       The proposed Results-Based National Urban Development Program in the Northern
Mountains Region (RBNUDP-NM or the “Program”) will assist the Government of Vietnam (GoV)
in developing the implementation framework for its national urban program. It will do this by piloting
a performance-based transfer system that will provide participating cities with a combination of much
needed resources along with a clarification of implementation responsibilities, a results-based
orientation, improved planning and a strengthening of oversight and accountability through audits and
verification activities. The Program Development Objective is to strengthen the capacity of
participating Northern Mountains cities to plan, implement and sustain urban infrastructure. The
World Bank’s Program-for-Results (PforR) lending instrument is to be used for this operation. The
Program targets seven cities (Dien Bien Phu, Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Thai Nguyen, Hoa Binh, Tuyen
Quang and Yen Bai) with a total budget of US$300 million (US$250 million IDA; US$50 million
counterpart).

Strategic Relevance

2.      Vietnam is urbanizing rapidly and the Government of Vietnam (GoV) has recognized that it
has only one chance to “get urbanization right.” Over 30 percent of the population lives in cities and
urban population is growing by 3.4 percent annually. Urbanization has great potential to foster
inclusive growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. Poorly managed urbanization
can result in economic bottlenecks, increased inequality and environmental damage. The GoV thus
faces physical, financial and institutional challenges in successfully managing the urban transition.

3.       Decentralization in Vietnam is a gradual and uneven process. The city administrations (CPC)
have a key emerging role but responsibilities remain fragmented between different levels and agencies
of government. Cities have limited own-source revenues and depend on the national and provincial
levels for financing as well as for oversight of many important decisions.

4.      The National Urban Development Program (NUDP) promotes efficient, sustainable and
equitable urban development. NUDP will be implemented through regional sub-programs of which
RBNUDP-NM (the Program) is the first. The Program will therefore develop and pilot the
implementation framework of the NUDP in seven Northern Mountains cities.

5.      The Northern Mountains region is historically important but is one of the poorer regions of
Vietnam with growth indicators lagging behind the country as a whole. Since 1999, the Northern
Mountains region has had the lowest income per capita in the country.1 The cities have a key role in
regional development as economic and administrative hubs and as engines of growth. Strengthening
the development of these urban centers is a high priority for the GoV, but there is a widening gap
between these cities need for urban infrastructure investments and their resources. For this reason
GoV requested financing support from the World Bank, initially in 2011.

6.       Improved urban infrastructure and strengthened city capacity to plan, manage and maintain
infrastructure investments are expected to stimulate private investments leading to inclusive economic
growth. This will enhance the economic opportunities available to low income residents of the cities
and the surrounding rural areas. Improved infrastructure will directly improve public health and the
quality of life of poor and low income urban residents.

Institutional Context

region (17/09/2013).

                                                  1
7.       Intergovernmental functional and fiscal assignments in Vietnam result in a residual
duplication of powers and functions between tiers that can delay or complicate investment
coordination and reduce accountability for investment selection and timely results. City budgets are
subordinate to the budget of the province, which are in turn subordinate to the national budget. This
can result in a lengthy budget planning process in which resource availability is only confirmed late in
the preceding year. The functions of revenue administration and public expenditure management are
often tightly intertwined. Cities have limited powers to set tax rates and tax revenues are remitted
upwards and then partially refunded on a shared basis. Grant revenues are primarily based on the
assessed gap between own source revenues and authorized expenditures, subject to resource
availability, and supplemented by tightly earmarked transfers. This framework is unpredictable and
results in spending gaps and delays. Cities can raise non-tax revenues, in particular from the sale of
land leases, but this raises governance concerns. Inter-governmental fiscal analysis is complicated by
limited information disclosure and weak accounting and reporting formats.

8.       These challenges are not unique to Vietnam, and they are subject to complex, long-term and
non-linear public sector reform processes. The design of the Program contributes to the eventual
resolution of these issues through clearly assigning implementation responsibilities, particularly to
PMUs reporting to CPCs, clarifying planning, financing, reporting and oversight arrangements
(including timelines), requiring mandatory public disclosure and strengthening complaints handling
mechanisms through DLI’s and the Program Action Plan. Targeted capacity building and technical
assistance activities support these requirements. These measures will strengthen the framework for
public expenditure management in participating cities.

9.       The seven Program cities reported total revenues amounted to US$154.8 million in 2012 (or
US$189 per capita), which have grown by an average of 23 percent per year since 2010. Core2 own
source revenues of the participating cities account for 54.5 percent of total revenues and amounted to
US$ 103.48 per capita in 2012. Tax revenues, drawn from a combination of VAT, income and
property taxes account for the largest share of all revenues (28 percent or US$ 53.10 per capita) and
have grown at over 28 percent per year. Rapid revenue growth has also been reported in land-based
revenues (rentals and leasing), which has grown at an average of over 21 percent per year and now
accounts for 20 percent of all revenues. Transfers from provinces provided similar nominal revenues
to tax revenues (US$57 per capita in 2012), and have grown at a similar average rate since 2010 (29
percent per year). The growing significance of own-source revenues, and of land-based revenues in
particular, is strongly influenced by activity in Tuyen Quang and Thai Nguyen (two of the larger
participating cities). The latter, in particular, has seen a significant decline in transfers while needing
to respond to rapid population growth.

10.     The seven participating cities reported total expenditures of US$154.8 million in 2012 (or
US$189 per capita). Total spending has grown at an average of 25.2 percent since 2010, though
annual growth slowed to 19.5 percent in 2012. Recurrent costs and outward transfers to other tiers of
government absorb 76 percent of total spending and have grown most strongly since 2010. Personnel
expenditures (in four cities for which data is available) accounted for an average of 52.1 percent of
recurrent spending since 2010. Specific data on operations and maintenance expenditures is not
reported. Specifically, no dedicated financial or operational arrangements are in place to support
effective asset management (planned asset maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement), although this
is considered a budget priority. Immediate spending needs on salaries and day-today operations has
thus increasingly squeezed out non-capital asset management expenditures (i.e., planned maintenance)
and capital investments (including rehabilitation and replacement) since 2010. Some evidence of
inadequate maintenance, for example of urban roads, was observed during field visits. Capital
investments have declined to 24 percent of total expenditures, despite an average growth rate of 14.8
percent. Capital spending growth has also been volatile, with a decline of 0.3 percent between 2011
and 2012. Total capital spending amounted to US$38 million in 2012 (or US$46 per capita).

2   This category excludes rollovers for which disaggregated information on original source is not available.

                                                                    2
11.      The consolidated fiscal position of these cities presents both challenges and opportunities.
Current levels of capital expenditures are insufficient to support current levels of urban growth, and
operational expenditures appear to give limited priority to effective asset management practices. Few
cities have in place adequate plans or financing for effective asset management to ensure the
sustainability of investments. This has led to accumulated shortfalls in the provision of infrastructure
that in turn may create constraints to local economic performance and is felt most directly by poor
households. This situation is unlikely to be alleviated by either a reduction in recurrent expenditure
pressures or increases in existing government transfers. Larger cities, which are experiencing more
rapid population growth, typically receive lower levels of transfers per capita and thus already
experience these challenges most directly. Most cities have begun to take measures to address this
through securing increases in core own-source revenues to finance expanded maintenance and capital
expenditures. Specific strategies have been improved revenue administration on local taxes and fees,
and the utilization of land-based financing mechanisms, through land incorporation, servicing and
leasing arrangements that have the capacity to both provide an immediate source of capital finance
and grow the local tax base. However, the acquisition of land for these purposes raises governance
concerns.

Expenditure Framework

National urban program

12.      Government has been responding to rapid urban growth with both institutional reforms and
financing. Since 1986, a program of decentralization has gradually devolved authority for urban
governance and service delivery to City People's Committees. This has been accompanied by fiscal
transfers to cities, which have been routed via the provinces, typically via discrete project-based
grants and a growth in local level spending in response to demand.3 This approach has resulted in
significant progress in access to basic urban infrastructure services. An estimated 75 percent of urban
households have access to water services (from 35 percent in 1997), 67 percent have access to toilets
(from 17 percent), and 8 larger cities now have waste water treatment plants (from a baseline of zero).
At a national level, 96 percent of households have access to electricity services, and over 90,000 km
of roads have been paved in the last decade.4

13.      However, massive challenges remain as urban populations continue to expand and their
spending power increases. The residual shortfall in access to services needs to be addressed, while
networks require expansion to accommodate growth in households and their demands. The number of
vehicles on urban roads has more than doubled in the last decade, while still only 8 percent of waste
water is currently treated. It is estimated that an additional 50 million m2 of housing stock will be
required each year to 2020. The above gaps will drive demand for associated bulk, connector and
internal infrastructure services.

14.    Government has established ambitious national targets for addressing these urban investment
needs by 2020 (see Decision No. 1659/QĐ-TTg), including expanding access to:
        Water supply to 90 percent of households, providing 120 liters / person / day and
           reducing non-revenue water to between 10 percent and 25 percent, depending on the class
           of town;
        Sewerage and drainage systems to over 80 percent of urban catchment areas, with at least
           secondary treatment of 60 percent of waste water (rising to 100 percent and 70 percent
           respectively by 2025);

3Disaggregated financial data on urban investment is not available by sector, national transfers are not fully disclosed by target area,
and provincial and city level reporting is not aggregated nationally nor does it fully account for sources of revenues. Budgeting
practices and functional overlaps also significantly complicate financial analysis.

4   World Bank, 2013(a), Assessment of Financing Framework for Municipal Infrastructure.

                                                                  3
             Solid waste collection and disposal services to 90 percent of households and firms (with
              100 percent coverage for hazardous waste);
             Street lighting to over 85 percent of urban roads outside of the largest urban centers (and
              100 percent within them);
             Housing to 75 percent of the urban population, with an average floor area per person of
              29m2;
             Road space to between 20 percent and 30 percent of urban land (depending of class of
              town), and expanding access to public transport services; and
             Urban green spaces per person to between 4m2 and 15m2, depending on the class of town.

15.      These targets will require large but as yet poorly quantified amounts of investment. Initial
estimates suggest that US$1.5 billion is required annually for water supply, wastewater and low-
income housing investments. Other estimates suggest that at least US$1 billion is required annually
just for wastewater investments.5 Disaggregated estimates for energy and transport investment needs
are not available.

16.      It is not currently possible to quantify the total amount of investment in urban infrastructure at
present. Investments are financed from a mixture of general purpose and specific national transfers
and locally collected revenues at provincial and local level. These are increasingly complemented by
sub-national borrowing and land sales / leases. The Infrastructure Finance Review notes that despite
these uncertainties, there is a significant shortfall between investment needs and available resources
(estimated at between 50 percent and 60 percent for the whole infrastructure sector nationally), and
significant policy, regulatory and local capacity weaknesses that will need to be addressed. Capacity-
building programs, for example, have typically provided only generic training on technical topics,
rather than focused on improving results through strengthening the public expenditure management
cycle.

The National Urban Development Program (NUDP)

17.      Government adopted the National Urban Development Program (NUDP) (Decision No.
1659/QĐ-TTg of the Prime Minister) in 2012 to address this lack of coherence in the management of
urbanization, and to provide a programmatic focus to efforts to achieve the 2020 targets. The
objective of the NUDP is to promote an efficient, sustainable and equitable process of urban
development by improving levels of access to basic urban services (water supply, sewerage and
drainage, solid waste management, public lighting, roads and public transport, environmental services
and public space), expanding the provision of serviced land for high-density housing and economic
activities, and through integrated urban upgrading of low-income urban areas. The NUDP recognizes
the importance of developing effective planning, financing, implementation and monitoring systems,
particularly at the local level, to ensure the efficient execution and sustainability of required
investments in urban infrastructure. It specifically notes the importance of strengthening urban
management through improving mechanisms for investment planning and works management,
increasing public awareness of local government roles and responsibilities, building the capacity of
local officials and encouraging new mechanisms to finance infrastructure.

18.     Importantly, the NUDP is the "umbrella" program of government that aims to coordinate and
focus the current efforts by all levels of government in addressing the urbanization challenge. The
Prime Minister thus assigned responsibility for program coordination and implementation to the
Ministry of Construction (MOC), and established a multi-departmental Steering Committee (headed
by the Minister of Construction) to supervise the execution of the program. It thus complements

existing government programs (such as the Urban Upgrading program) rather than replaces them.6
The NUDP therefore has no direct financing from government, as its operating costs are met within
the existing baselines of implementing agencies and investment costs are already allocated elsewhere.

19.      Progress with the implementation of the NUDP has been slow in the first year of its
implementation. This has been due to the limited attention paid to the design of detailed
implementation modalities. MOC has recognized this, and initiated a stocktaking exercise in May
2013 across all provinces on NUDP implementation. A concluding workshop in December 2013
found that, overall, provinces across the country have started to align their implementation of urban
development activities with the NUDP’s core principles and that a revision to implementation
modalities and timelines is necessary, specifically to align financing mechanisms, capacity support
and national oversight systems with NUDP objectives and to account for variations in progress
between classes of cities. Government is now proposing to implement the NUDP incrementally
through a series of regional sub-programs that will provide a comprehensive package of performance-
based fiscal support, capacity support and enhanced oversight. The RBNUDP-NM (“the Program”)
would be the first regional implementation of the NUDP. In addition, the MOC is now preparing to
issue a circular to further clarify and guide the process of development, appraisal and approval for
urban development programs, including the strategic planning and prioritization of urban investments
in the context of overall city development priorities and broader city master plans.

The Results-Based National Urban Development Program in the Northern Mountains Region
(RBNUDP-NM)

20.      The RBNUDP-NM has been prepared in response to this evaluation. The Program will assist
government to introduce a regionally-focused, results-based support framework directly within the
NUDP, through a performance-based transfer, capacity support and improved national oversight
systems. The Program operates at two levels: (a) in selected cities within the target region, through
performance transfers and capacity support activities; and (b) at the national level in strengthening
systems of program management for the NUDP, policy development and oversight. These activities
will influence both the continuing implementation of the NUDP, and also the framework for all
government expenditures on urban development (including, as a first step, assisting government to
quantify existing financing arrangements and investment needs).

21.      Program expenditures are estimated to total US$300 million. US$280 million will constitute
the performance-based transfer system and finance infrastructure investments specified in the
investment menu. This includes US$50 million in counterpart contributions from the participating
cities. US$20 million will support MOC activities, including the provision of capacity support
(training and technical assistance) to participating cities, the development of national policy and
implementation frameworks, and the strengthening of oversight systems (see Table 1). Note that city
level expenditures include direct recurrent costs associated with the implementation of sub-projects
under the Program.

 The absence of financial data in existing government programs makes it impossible to evaluate the size of
actual expenditures that are within the framework of the NUDP (i.e., transfers supporting urban development).

 * Expenditures by cities include recurrent expenditures associated with sub-project management. Vietnamese public
 sector accounting practices require these costs to be included in sub-project cost estimates and budget provisions.


Program expenditures in the context of participating CPCs

22.     As a level of government, CPCs have a range of functions that are not directly related to
urban development. The total expenditures of CPCs amounted to US$154.8 million in 2012 (or
US$189 per capita), and have grown by an average of 25 percent per year since 2010. Expenditures
on urban infrastructure investments (capital investments including direct project management costs)
accounted for 24 percent of this expenditure (US$38 million, US$46 per capita) and have grown at an
average of only 15 percent since 2010. Personnel expenditures (in four cities for which data is
available) accounted for an average of 52.1 percent of recurrent spending since 2010. City
expenditures are financed through a mixture of local taxes and fees (34 percent) which are subject to
revenue-sharing arrangements with provincial governments, transfers from provinces (30 percent),
land sales and leases (21 percent) and accumulated savings (15 percent).

23.     These existing CPC expenditures are expected to continue. On average, the Program will add
an additional US$5.5 million to the annual expenditures of each city, or US$ 47 per capita. This
constitutes about 24.8 percent of total CPC expenditures in 2012, and 101 percent of their capital
spending baseline. However, this is anticipated to decline sharply due to ongoing growth in existing
revenues and expenditures outside of the Program. If the current rate of growth and expenditure
composition is sustained over the Program period (to 2020), CPC expenditures are projected to
increase more than seven fold by Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, with capital expenditures more than
doubling. They will then far outstrip annual Program expenditures. This provides a critical window
for the Program to enhance the effectiveness of these future CPC expenditures, in line with NUDP
objectives.

Program Institutional Arrangements

24.      The Program will be implemented using the institutions and procedures applicable to
infrastructure investments funded through the annual budget of the CPC. In this system, the provincial
level (PPC and its departments) has a number of important oversight and quality assurance functions.
At the national level, MOC will be responsible for policy, support, oversight and capacity
development while the Ministry of Finance will transfer funds through the State Treasury (in a
segregated account) to the CPC. State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) will undertake verification audits of
the DLIs, using external service providers.

25.      The MOC, through the Urban Development Agency (UDA), will coordinate the performance-
based transfer Program, including the provision of capacity support to and oversight of participating
cities, and the ongoing development of national policies and programs for urban development. The
MOC has a clear mandate to perform these functions. Among other responsibilities, Decree No.
62/2013/NĐ-CP designates MOC as the central agency responsible for setting policies, standards and
guidance on urban planning, and for guiding and inspecting the implementation of construction

                                                          6
activities (including those of sub-national governments). The MOC performs these functions through
its UDA, which has considerable experience in issuing guidelines for cities and supporting them with
infrastructure projects.

26.      The performance-based transfer instrument and assessment mechanisms of the Program will
be a new function for the MOC. One of the goals of the first phase of the NUDP is to prepare the
MOC to replicate the results-based approach nationwide in the future. This will require the MOC to
institutionalize its capacity to manage the performance-based transfer mechanism, design and deliver
capacity support that assists the city administrations to improve the cost-effectiveness of planning and
implementation of infrastructure investments, to continuously monitor progress and outcomes, and
review and adapt relevant policy and regulatory frameworks as circumstances change. The effective
performance of these functions will benefit from using clearly defined, measurable, and achievable
results as a reference framework. Key skills areas that will be required include medium-term
investment planning as well as ex-ante appraisal and ex-post evaluation of investments. The capacity
development provided by MOC to the cities on these topics and others will be primarily through
specialized consultants. It is anticipated that the MOC will also require support to analyze and
integrate lessons learned in the first phase of the NUDP into the national roll-out, and to effectively
report on Program implementation. The Program design supports the programmatic strengthening of
MOC through sub-indicators in DLI 4 and required PAP actions. Activities necessary to strengthen
the capacities of MOC in these functions will be included in the annual capacity plan. This integrated
approach is assessed as adequate to ensure effective Program implementation.

27.     The cities have identified sub-projects from their master plans and five-year plans, to be
implemented under the Program. The cities will review and update their implementation plans
annually and will consolidate the activities for the coming year into the annual budget plan of the CPC.
An annual verification of performance relative to the Program DLIs will take place early in the
subsequent year and disbursements are likely to be released around mid-year. Actual transfers made
will reconcile allocated disbursements against advances for each disbursement period. CPCs will thus
need to anticipate the achievement against the DLIs (and so the amount of the annual disbursement) in
their annual budgeting process and adjustment process.

28.      The CPC will assign sub-project preparation, procurement and contract administration tasks
to the PMU. The CPC’s will be responsible for local planning, sub-project selection and execution,
and reporting. The Assessment identified areas for long-term capacity strengthening for CPCs in city
planning, contract administration, asset management, revenue management and monitoring and
evaluation systems. The majority of sub-project implementation functions will be delegated to the
PMU within CPCs. Budget planning and financial management tasks will be undertaken by the
Finance and Planning Unit. The PMUs are well established and in most cases have stable and
experienced leadership and a good understanding of the regulatory framework for preparation,
procurement and implementation of urban infrastructure investments. The larger investments handled
by the PMU in the past are of similar size and complexity to the larger Program sub-projects.
However, the Program investments will represent a considerable increase in workload and efficient
implementation will be crucial to ensuring cash flow under the performance-based transfer system.
The PMUs will need to strengthen their overall capacity as well as strengthen procedures in key areas
including quality assurance of technical designs, environmental and social impact assessment and
mitigation, procurement packaging and competitiveness, and efficient and effective contract
administration. DLI 1.1 incentivizes compliance with the annual planning cycle, while DLI 1.2 will
incentivize adequate staffing of the PMUs. DLI 2 establishes clear criteria for sub-project selection
and compliance with key elements of investment management (including parameters for sub-project
selection, screening, procurement and financial management) that are linked to the Program Action
Plan and supported by technical process improvements in the POM. Capacity support activities will
strengthen the capabilities of the CPCs and PMUs to comply with these requirements through a
results-focused annual capacity plan. This integrated system of incentives and support to CPCs and
their PMUs is assessed to provide a credible framework for ensuring effective and compliant
expenditures in the Program.

                                                   7
29.      The MOF will clarify the fund transfer arrangements through a guidance note that will be
finalized prior to negotiations. The MOF will transfer funds to CPCs, following advice from MOC,
through the State Treasury into a dedicated line item of the CPC account. MOF and State Treasuries
have established capacity and systems to manage these transfers. Provinces have a number of
important oversight and approval functions that are exercised through relevant departments. These
roles are generally performed adequately and will continue in the Program. The SAV will undertake
verification audits of the DLIs, alongside the annual Program audit. The effective performance of this
function is subject to timely reporting by CPCs and MOC, as well as adequate capacity in SAV to
undertake non-financial results verification. The Program design addresses these issues through
establishing clear reporting timelines associated with disbursements, and enabling SAV to utilize the
external service providers to incrementally strengthen its verification capabilities.

30.     The performance-based transfers, along with contributions from the participating cities, will
fund the construction of local infrastructure, social and environmental related studies, compensation
costs, and operation costs associated with management of the infrastructure investments. At the
national level, expenditures will include Program administration, capacity development activities
implemented by MOC (primarily through specialized consultants), and verification audits undertaken
by the SAV.

31.      Cities will receive allocations of performance-based transfer funds according to population
size, totaling US$230 million while the proposed sub-project investments total about US$280 million.
Therefore, the cities will need to mobilize finance from other sources, including own-source revenues
and transfers from national and provincial governments to fill the gap. It is important to note that the
transfer allocations under the Program will be in addition to the existing national fund transfers and
will not replace the transfers.

32.      The Program design emphasizes the importance of strengthening the sustainability of
investments, both through incrementally improved asset management regimes and securing additional
local resources for maintenance and capital expenditure programs. DLI 3.1 requires CPCs to
undertake Asset Condition Assessments and develop basic Asset Management Plans before 2017.
Cities are subsequently required to ensure that sub-project investments in the Program are in full
service two years after completion. DLI 3.2 requires each city to achieve a 12 percent annual increase
in own source revenues (defined as taxes and fees, but excluding land and rental incomes due to
governance concerns). Capacity support will be provided to cities to meet these requirements.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of investments is a complex, multi-faceted challenge for all
local governments. The sustainability measures in the Program are thus assessed as adequate to
enhance the sustainability of expenditures within and beyond the Program implementation period.
Measurement constraints prevent the use of financial indicators of operations and maintenance
expenditures, nor will these necessarily provide a more suitable proxy for efficient asset management
practices.

33.     Cities will receive fixed annual disbursements of performance-based transfers, subject to
achievement of the DLIs, with the first disbursements occurring in mid-2016. The size of the annual
disbursements has been estimated based on expenditures projected from the Cities’ sub-project lists
and implementation plans. Cities will be entitled to receive advances of up to 25 percent of the
undisbursed portion of their total allocation, with the first advance occurring in early 2015.

34.     Initial estimates of sub-project costs have been based on a unit cost norm system of MOC.
Examination of these initial cost estimates reveals some discrepancies and possible over-estimation in
some cases. Final cost estimates will be calculated using input-based cost norms which will be
rigorously checked and this is expected to prove adequate for cost control purposes. Works contracts
will be let by competitive tendering but current practices do not result in a high level of price
competition; the Program will include actions to strengthen competition through improved bid
evaluation procedures. MOC cost norms for consultant fees for preparation and construction

                                                   8
supervision appear to be below market rates and this could be counter-productive for efficiency and
technical quality.

35.      Cash-flow projections based on the projected expenditures relative to annual advances and
disbursements of the performance-based transfers was conducted to identify of potential liquidity
shortfalls overall and at the city level. The projected disbursement schedule was adjusted for each city
to minimize liquidity constraints. This projection does indicate that cities will still need to mobilize
significant amounts of counterpart financing. Because the transfer disbursements lag behind
expenditures, the maximum cumulative financing gap (i.e., cumulative expenditures minus
cumulative advances and disbursements) is likely to occur in 2019. The residual shortfalls does,
however, pose a significant risk to Program implementation and can be further reduced or eliminated
by adjustments to implementation plans, effective cash-flow management at the city level and
bridging finance where appropriate. In particular, cities will need to closely manage and monitor
compliance with the requirements of the Program that may influence disbursements, ensure effective
project management arrangements remain in place throughout Program implementation, access
capacity support as needed and prepare careful cash flow forecasts. Where necessary, cities should
also identify counterpart funds sufficient to meet their final needs and if necessary, short-term loan
financing.

Technical Soundness of Investments

36.      Sub-projects eligible for transfer funds are selected from the master plans and screened using
a set of pass/fail conditions and prioritization criteria. Compliance with these conditions and criteria
will be confirmed at the feasibility study phase and will form part of the DLI verification process.
This system is considered adequate to ensure that the sub-projects represent high priority investments
for the CPC and the city residents.

37.     The largest and most technically complex sub-projects are bridges. The bridges will use
simply supported span constructions with standard specifications and design details. Proper
geotechnical investigations will be important to ensure appropriate design of foundations and to avoid
construction delays that can occur if unforeseen conditions are encountered. As with all hydraulic
works, bridges must be carefully designed taking into account maximum flood conditions and
considering the impacts of climate change. Hydraulic design should avoid or mitigate scour and
erosion caused by changes to river flow at the bridge location.

38.     The assessment concludes that the proposed sub-projects are technically appropriate and are
within the capacity of the CPC to implement, with the assistance of expert consultants for feasibility
study, design and construction supervision. Key measures to ensure technical quality will include
stronger procedures to recruit the best qualified available consultants, thorough checking of designs
and cost estimates and strengthened contract administration and technical supervision procedures. The
PAP requires increased use of competitive selection procedures for consultants. The Program
Operational Manual (POM) prescribes best practice contract administration procedures and MOC
should provide training to the PMU in these procedures.

Results Framework, Monitoring and Evaluation
39.     The draft Program Results Framework identifies four PDO level indicators: asset
management plans adopted and infrastructure in full service two years after completion; total number
of beneficiaries (disaggregated by gender); number of cities that have fully implemented Enhanced
Annual City Plans on schedule and with acceptable quality and adoption of an Implementation
Strategy for the National Urban Development Program. Intermediate indicators have been identified
for four Results Areas: (a) Institutional Strengthening at City Level; (b) Delivery of Infrastructure
Services in Participating Cities; (c) Sustainable Infrastructure Investments; and (d) National Policy,
Support and Oversight. The implementation period is anticipated to be six years from 2015 to 2020.
DLIs have been identified for each Results Area.

                                                   9
40.      DLIs will be monitored through the annual verification audits conducted by SAV. To ensure
adequate and timely information for oversight and support of implementation it is recommended to
establish a simple Program MIS based either on proprietary software or on a spread sheet system. The
MIS will track physical and financial progress, achievement of capacity development targets and will
also capture compliance with PAP actions including public disclosures and complaints procedures.

41.      City PMUs do not have specialist monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity at present.
M&E capacity, either within PMU or at CPC level, should be strengthened to focus on: (a) systematic
tracking of results; (b) monitoring of key transparency indicators; and (c) later in the Program,
development of a capacity for assessing the economic and social impacts of completed infrastructure
investments. It is recommended that cities should carry out an impact assessment of completed
infrastructure as an input to the Program mid-term review and to learn lessons for planning and
implementation of future investments.

Economic Analysis
42.     The physical outputs of the Program are public goods that will stimulate economic growth
and facilitate orderly management of urbanization. Initial sub-projects selected from the master plans
have been screened using a set of pass/fail conditions and prioritization criteria. 7 A cost-benefit
analysis was conducted for a sample of 78 of the proposed sub-projects, accounting for about 85
percent of sub-projects by number and value, and using the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal
Rate of Return (IRR) indicators to evaluate economic viability for the period up to 2039.

43.      The tangible benefits of the sub-projects will consist mainly of reduced journey times and
operating costs within the urban areas. Intangible benefits include improved living conditions for
urban residents, particularly the residents of low-income areas. The integrated package of investments
will stimulate private investment by reducing costs of doing business, improving transport links,
improving access to land for development and increasing the attractiveness of the urban environment.
Poor and low-income residents of the cities will benefit directly from investments in social
infrastructure and environmental improvements. Urban economic growth will create employment
opportunities in the cities and the surrounding rural areas. Development of the cities will improve
access to services for both urban and rural residents. Therefore, the Program investments are expected
to contribute to poverty alleviation and inclusive economic growth.

44.      The Program is assessed to be economically viable. Economic modeling has shown the road
and bridge sub-projects (60.8 percent of the total) to have positive NPVs. Social infrastructure
investments will deliver intangible benefits and selection of these sub-projects by the cities is
considered as an indication that the implicit value of these investments is equivalent to that of the
transport sub-projects. The IRR of all appraised sub-projects is 22 percent. A sensitivity analysis
accounted for decreases and increases of 20 percent in benefits and costs, given that all sub-projects
are at the pre-feasibility study phase. The overall IRR of all sub-projects in seven cities remains
satisfactory even in the worst case scenario, with the exception of one Low Income Area sub-project
(Hoa Binh) and one road sub-project (Cao Bang) where “worst-case” IRRs fall below 12 percent.

45.    World Bank support will assist the Government to develop a programmatic, results-based
approach to urban development through the NUDP, to strengthen country systems for planning and
implementation of infrastructure investments and to address key policy and regulatory issues.




7 Compliance with these conditions and criteria will be confirmed at the feasibility study phase and will
form part of the DLI verification process. This system is considered adequate to ensure that the sub-
projects represent high priority investments for the CPC and the city residents.

A. Program Description
National urban program

46.      Government has been responding to rapid urban growth with both institutional reforms and
financing. Since 1986, a program of decentralization has gradually devolved authority for urban
governance and service delivery to City People's Committees. This has been accompanied by fiscal
transfers to cities, which have been routed via the provinces, typically via discrete project-based
transfers and a growth in local level spending in response to demand8. This approach has resulted in
significant progress in access to basic urban infrastructure services. An estimated 75 percent of urban
households have access to water services (from 35 percent in 1997), 67 percent have access to toilets
(from 17 percent), and 8 larger cities now have waste water treatment plants (from a baseline of zero).
At a national level, 96 percent of households have access to electricity services, and over 90,000 km
of roads have been paved in the last decade.9
47.      However, massive challenges remain as urban populations continue to expand and their
spending power increases. Residual shortfall in access to services needs to be addressed, while
networks require expansion to accommodate growth in households and their demands. The number of
vehicles on urban roads has more than doubled in the last decade, while still only 8 percent of waste
water is currently treated. It is estimated that an additional 50 million m2 of housing stock will be
required each year to 2020. The above gaps will drive demand for associated bulk, connector and
internal infrastructure services.

48.    Government has established ambitious national targets for addressing these urban investment
needs by 2020 (see Decision No. 1659/QĐ-TTg), including expanding access to:
        Water supply to 90 percent of households, and 120 liters / person / day and reducing non-
           revenue water to between 10 percent and 25 percent, depending on the class of town;
        Sewerage and drainage systems to over 80 percent of urban catchment areas, with at least
           secondary treatment of 60 percent of waste water (rising to 100 percent and 70 percent
           respectively by 2025);
        Solid waste collection and disposal services to 90 percent of households and firms (with
           100 percent coverage for hazardous waste);
        Street lighting to over 85 percent of urban roads outside of the largest urban centers (and
           100 percent within them) ;
        Housing to 75 percent of the urban population, with an average floor area per person of
           29m2;
        Road space to between 20 percent and 30 percent of urban land (depending of class of
           town),and expanding access to public transport services; and
        Urban green spaces per person to between 4m2 and 15m2, depending on the class of town.

49.      These targets will require large but as yet poorly quantified amounts of investment. Initial
estimates suggest that US$1.5 billion is required annually for water supply, wastewater and low-
income housing investments. Other estimates suggest that at least US$1 billion is required annually
just for wastewater investments10. Disaggregated estimates for energy and transport investment needs
are not available.



8 Disaggregated  financial data on urban investment is not available by sector, national transfers are not
fully disclosed by target area, and provincial and city level reporting is not aggregated nationally nor does
it fully account for sources of revenues. Budgeting practices and functional overlaps also significantly
complicate financial analysis.

50.      Disaggregated estimates for energy and transport investment needs are not available. The
Infrastructure Finance Review notes that despite these uncertainties, there is a significant shortfall
between investment needs and available resources (estimated at between 50 percent and 60 percent
for all infrastructure sectors nationally), and significant policy, regulatory and local capacity
weaknesses that will need to be addressed. Capacity-building programs, for example, have typically
provided only generic training on technical topics, rather than also focusing on improved results
through strengthening the public expenditure management cycle.

National Urban Development Program (NUDP)

51.      Government adopted the National Urban Development Program (NUDP) (Decision No.
1659/QĐ-TTg of the Prime Minister) in 2012 to address the lack of coherence in the management of
urbanization, and to provide a programmatic focus to achieving the 2020 targets for urban service
delivery. The objective of the NUDP is to promote an efficient, sustainable and equitable process of
urban development by improving levels of access to basic urban services (water supply, sewerage and
drainage, solid waste management, public lighting, roads and public transport, environmental services
and public space), expanding the provision of serviced land for high-density housing and economic
activities, and through integrated urban upgrading of low-income urban areas. The NUDP recognizes
the importance of developing effective planning, financing, implementation and monitoring systems,
particularly at the local level, to ensure the efficient execution and sustainability of required
investments in urban infrastructure. It specifically notes the importance of strengthening urban
management through improving mechanisms for investment planning and works management,
increasing public awareness of local government roles and responsibilities, building the capacity of
local officials and encouraging new mechanisms to finance infrastructure.

52.      The NUDP is an "umbrella" program through with the Government aims to coordinate and
focus current efforts by all levels of government in addressing the urbanization challenge. The Prime
Minister thus assigned responsibility for program coordination and implementation to the Ministry of
Construction (MOC), and established a multi-departmental Steering Committee (headed by the
Minister of Construction) to supervise the execution of the program. It thus complements existing
government programs (such as the Urban Upgrading Program). Until now, the NUDP has not had
designated resources, as its operating expenses have been covered by budgets of implementing
agencies and resources for infrastructure investment have been channeled through existing transfer
mechanisms or own-source revenue. It is not possible to estimate past or current annual urban
development expenditures in Vietnam. The NUDP has sought to leverage these expenditures without
specific program expenditures assigned to it, operating through existing government agencies and
budgets. This fundamental weakness in the government program of expenditures will be addressed
through the Program, which establishes a dedicated resource envelope and implementation modalities
for the NUDP.

53.     Progress with the implementation of the NUDP has been slow in the first year of its
implementation. This has been due to the limited attention paid to the design of detailed
implementation modalities. MOC has recognized this, and initiated a stocktaking exercise in May
2013 across all provinces on NUDP implementation. A concluding workshop in December 2013
found that, overall, provinces across the country have started to align their implementation of urban
development activities with the NUDP’s core principles and that a revision to implementation
modalities and timelines is necessary, specifically to align financing mechanisms, capacity support
and national oversight systems with NUDP objectives and to account for variations in progress
between classes of cities. Government is now proposing to implement the NUDP incrementally
through a series of regional sub-programs that will provide a comprehensive package of performance-
based fiscal support, capacity support and enhanced oversight. The Results Based National Urban
Development Program in the Northern Mountains Region (RBNUDP-NM - the proposed Bank-
supported operation) would be the first regional implementation of the NUDP.

Results-Based National Urban Development Program in the Northern Mountains
Region (the Program)

54.      The RBNUDP-NM, the Government will introduce a regionally focused, performance-based
transfer program with capacity building support for participating cities and improved national
oversight systems. The Program operates at two levels: (a) in selected cities within the target region,
through performance transfers and capacity support activities; and (b) at national level by
strengthening program management systems, urban policy development, and oversight. These
activities will influence both the continuing implementation of the NUDP and the framework for all
government expenditures on urban development (including, as a first step, assisting the Government
to quantify existing financing arrangements and investment needs).

55.      Program expenditures are estimated to total US$ 300 million and the implementation period is
anticipated to be six years from 2015 to 2020. US$ 280 million will constitute the performance-based
transfer system, financing infrastructure investments and project management activities by CPCs as
specified in the investment menu. This includes US$ 50 million in counterpart contributions from the
participating cities. US$ 20 million will support MOC activities, including the provision of capacity
support (training and technical assistance) to participating cities, the development of national
implementation frameworks, and the strengthening of oversight systems (see Table 12). Note that city
level expenditures include direct recurrent costs associated with the implementation of sub-projects
under the Program. Program Expenditures will consist of:
         a) Construction costs of priority infrastructure investments through budgets of participating
             Cities;
         b) Associated costs of services for social and environmental related studies pertaining to the
             infrastructure investments;
         c) Compensation costs associated with the infrastructure investments;
         d) Operating costs of the City administrations associated with management of the
             infrastructure investments;
         e) Costs of program administration and capacity development activities implemented by
             MOC;
         f) Costs of verification audits undertaken by the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV).

Program expenditures in the context of participating CPCs

56.      City People’s Committees (CPCs) will plan and implement sub-projects in the Program. As
these cities are the project owners for individual sub-project investments, the funding under Results
Area 2, above, will be reflected in the revenues and expenditures of the CPC annual budgets. Sub-
project implementation will be undertaken by Project Management Units (PMUs) reporting to CPCs.
Existing asset management arrangements will continue. Provinces will continue to play their role in
the approval of city plans and budgets.

57.     As a level of government, CPCs have a range of functions that are not directly related to
urban development. The total expenditures of CPCs amounted to US$ 154.8 million in 2012 (or
US$ 189 per capita), and have grown by an average of 25 percent per year since 2010. Expenditures
on urban infrastructure investments (capital investments including direct project management costs)
accounted for 24 percent of this expenditure (US$ 38 million US$ 46 per capita) and have grown at an
average of only 15 percent since 2010. Personnel expenditures (in four cities for which data is
available) accounted for an average of 52.1 percent of recurrent spending since 2010. City
expenditures are financed through a mixture of local taxes and fees (34 percent) which are subject to
revenue-sharing arrangements with provincial governments, transfers from provinces (30 percent),
land sales and leases (20 percent) and accumulated savings (15 percent).

                                                  13
58.     These existing CPC expenditures are expected to continue. On average, the Program will add
an additional US$ 5.5 million to the annual expenditures of each city, or US$ 47 per capita. This
constitutes about 24.8 percent of total CPC expenditures in 2012, and 101 percent of their capital
spending baseline. However, this is anticipated to decline sharply due to ongoing growth in existing
revenues and expenditures outside of the Program. If the current rate of growth and expenditure
composition is sustained over the Program period (to 2020), CPC expenditures are projected to
increase more than seven fold by FY2020, with capital expenditures more than doubling. They will
then far outstrip annual Program expenditures. This provides a critical window for the Program to
enhance the effectiveness of these future CPC expenditures, in line with NUDP objectives.

B. Program Strategic Relevance

National Context

59.      During the last 10 years, Vietnam has maintained a significant growth rate of 7.5 to 8 percent
and has attained middle-income country status. This strong economic growth performance has been
accompanied by rapid urbanization. Over 30 percent of the population currently lives in urban areas,
and this is growing by 3.4 percent annually. Globally, this process of urbanization has proved
unstoppable and has the potential to generate significant opportunities for growth, poverty alleviation
and environmental sustainability. Urban centers provide agglomeration economies that can enable
economic dynamism, scale for the financing and development of major facilities, and can provide a
growing source of tax receipts. Yet, poorly managed urbanization processes can lead to growing
inequality, environmental damage and bottlenecks to economic growth as the provision of urban land
and infrastructure fails to keep pace with demand. Inadequate or poorly planned land development can
create inefficient urban forms and exclude poor people from effective participation in the benefits of
urban growth.

60.     Urbanization involves significant changes beyond the national demographic profile and
economic structure, including transitions in welfare and basic service delivery needs, the physical
form of urban areas and the administrative arrangements for urban management. The Vietnam
Urbanization Review 11 (2012) emphasizes the influential and cross-cutting nature of the
administrative transition (the overarching policies, institutional and management practices central to
urbanization) in ensuring that Vietnam is able to maximize the benefits of the urbanization process.
The Government has recognized that it has “only one chance to get urbanization right” (Deputy PM
Nguyen Sinh Hung, 2009).

61.     The Government of Vietnam faces physical, financial and institutional challenges in the
successful management of urbanization. Physical challenges include ensuring efficient allocation and
management of land; management of residential settlement patterns, efficient and effective planning
of public investments to ensure service delivery and stimulate private sector investment; ensuring a
high standard of construction of public infrastructure to avoid incurring an excessive financial burden
for maintenance and repair in the future; and ensuring environmental sustainability.

62.      Except for the largest cities, Vietnam’s urban centers have limited capacity to mobilize
finance for investment in urban development. Therefore this investment is heavily dependent on
transfers from the national budget which are managed and allocated at the provincial level. Vietnam
faces the challenge of financing a large and growing demand for urban infrastructure investment
within the constraints of sound macro-economic management and the need to ensure an equitable and
efficient allocation of available finance. In turn, the current financing framework does not provide the
cities with a predictable medium-term financing plan for investments nor adequate discretion in

selection of priority sub-projects. A World Bank report12 examined reforms to budgetary allocation
norms introduced in 2006 and concluded that these had had a positive effect, including increasing the
capital resources available to the less developed provinces, but city administrations remain dependent
on project-by-project allocations at the province level and other unpredictable sources to finance their
capital investment plans.

63.     Responsibility for planning, financing and management of urban infrastructure development
in Vietnam is split between national, province and city levels and between various sectoral agencies at
each level. The fragmentation of responsibilities leads to unpredictable planning decisions,
duplication of responsibilities particularly technical oversight of projects, and delays in the budget
execution process.

Northern Mountains Cities

64.      The growth of the Northern Mountains cities presents a significant opportunity to support
regional growth and poverty reduction. The region is historically important but lagging, and faces
significant development challenges, including a rapid growth in the size of urban centers. These urban
centers play a key role in local area development, serving as economic and administrative hubs and
are increasingly the engines of regional economic growth. However, there is a widening gap between
their need for urban infrastructure investments and the available financial resources. City and
provincial administrations tasked with urban development and management functions are currently
weak, fragmented and under-resourced. They are unable to respond adequately to changing local
needs, are unable to leverage local resources effectively for sustained investment and asset
management, and – despite clear evidence of capabilities in some areas - have generally weak
capacity and incentives to deliver investments on time and within budget.

65.      The strategic challenge facing these cities, as with others in Vietnam, is to establish an
effective urban management and implementation model, including a sound framework for predictable
financing of their significant infrastructure investment needs. The Government of Vietnam (GoV)
identified this challenge as early as 2011, requesting the World Bank to finance a US$250 million
“Urban Upgrading Project for Northern Mountain Area” that prioritized the cities of Dien Bien Phu,
Bac Kan, Cao Bang and Thai Nguyen. In July 2013, the GoV added three more cities (Hoa Binh,
Tuyen Quang and Yen Bai). World Bank support will assist government to develop the
implementation framework for the wider National Urban Development Program (NUDP).

Relevance of Strengthening Capacity of Cities

66.      Smaller cities in Vietnam have limited own-source revenues and are largely dependent on
transfers from central and provincial governments to finance their annual budgets and associated
investment programs. Although they are assigned responsibility to implement certain types of capital
investment they have traditionally had only limited discretion in planning and financing capital works.
As the cities grow their resources will increase and there will be an increasing need for capacity for
efficient, responsive and accountable planning and implementation of infrastructure works of
increasing size and complexity. Therefore, limitations on capacity in this area could become an
important constraint to growth.

67.     Through a combination of performance-based transfers which will provide the cities with the
incentive to strengthen and efficiently utilize capacity, and targeted capacity support in key areas
including planning, procurement and contract management, the Program will assist the cities to
develop the sustainable capacity required to support future growth.

68.      Therefore, the experience gained from implementation of the Program, the increased city
revenues arising from economic growth stimulated by the infrastructure investments and the
strengthened capacity arising from the Program capacity development activities will all enhance the
ability of the city administrations to plan and execute similar investments in the future. The systems of
planning, financing, implementation, reporting and results verification established or strengthened
under the Program will serve as a template for the extension of performance-based transfers through
the National Urban Development Program to cities at a similar stage of development nationwide.

Relevance of Investments to Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Growth

69.     The Northern Mountains region is one of the poorest regions of Vietnam with about 44
       13
percent of the population living below the national poverty line, as compared with a national average
of 20.7 percent14. Since 1999, the Northern Mountains region has had the lowest income per capita in
the country.15 Poverty rates in the urban areas are generally lower than in the surrounding countryside
although a significant proportion of the urban population remains poor or dependent on low, insecure
incomes and with inadequate access to social infrastructure and services.

70.      Urban growth and development generates improved employment opportunities for both urban
residents and for rural dwellers in surrounding areas, many of whom are likely to migrate to the cities
in search of new opportunities in any case. By supporting the development of urban transport
infrastructure the Program will encourage and facilitate the private investment needed to promote
growth and employment. Better developed urban centers will support markets and services needed to
stimulate growth in agriculture, natural resources and tourism that will directly improve economic
opportunities in the rural areas of the Northern Mountains region.

71.     The Program will also support investments in improved infrastructure (roads, electricity
supplies, water supplies, drainage and sewerage and street lighting) in identified low income areas of
the Northern Mountains cities, thus preferentially targeting the poorer sections of the community. The
Program will support an improved urban environment through investments in surface drainage
improvements with associated landscape enhancement. The Program will support construction of
kindergartens, schools and community buildings to improve social services to city residents.

C. Institutional Context
Role of Ministry of Construction

72.      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) is a central agency of the Government of Vietnam that
performs state management functions in the areas of construction planning, architecture, construction
activities, urban development, urban infrastructure and industrial parks, economic zones, hi-tech parks,
housing, offices, real estate market, construction materials, as well as public services under its
jurisdiction as prescribed by law. According to Decree No. 62/2013/NĐ-CP, these functions include
setting policy, standards and guidelines for urban planning, as well as guiding and inspecting the
implementation of construction processes and activities including those under the executive power
and ownership of sub-national governments (People’s Committees). The Ministry proposes these
policies and guidelines for the Prime Minister’s approval and issuance on the one hand and, on the
other hand, issues the final opinion on related subject matters for sub-national governments to use as a
basis for implementation in their respective area.

                                                   16
73.      Under the leadership of the Minister and 7 Vice-Ministers of Construction, there are 9
departments, 6 agencies, and 5 institutes, in addition to the Ministry’s Front Office, the Inspectorate,
and 3 media and information functions. Among these offices, the Urban Development Agency (UDA)
is assigned to assist the Minister to perform the Ministry’s functions in the field of urban development.
Specifically, the Agency develops policy documents and guidelines for the Ministry to submit for the
Prime Minister’s approval, and guides sub-national People's Committees in the implementation of
urban development and construction programs as per approved plans. The UDA is authorized to
prepare and implement urban development programs and projects that are under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry.

74.     In this capacity, UDA is directly responsible for Ministry’s functions with regards to a
National Urban Development Program for the period of 2012-2020 (NUDP) per Decision No.
1659/QĐ-TTg, dated 11/7/2012, in which MOC is assigned to chair the Steering Committee and to
serve as the standing agency to host, coordinate and supervise activities under NUDP. These activities
include development of urban housing; urban rehabilitation and upgrading; management of new urban
development areas; and urban technical infrastructure development.

75.      The UDA is divided into five units of which the Management Board of Urban Development
Projects (MUDP) is one. MUDP supports the Director General in preparing annual and 5 years budget
plans for urban surveys and planning projects. These plans are normally submitted by the Director
General to forward to the Minister or higher authorities for approval and implementation. The Board
is responsible for investment plans and procedures regarding the planning, implementation and
monitoring of ODA funded projects (including hiring consultants) and sometimes acts on behalf of
local governments and other Ministries. The Board is a legal body which has a stamp for commercial
activities and an account in the National Treasury and Bank.16

City Mandates and Functions

76.     Decentralization has been ongoing in Vietnam since the “Doi Moi” policy reform of 1986,
gradually delegating powers down the government’s four-layer unitary system from the central to
provincial, district, and communal governments. The subnational public administration operates in a
system of dual subordination. The local executive government - the People’s Committees (CPC) – at
all subnational levels are accountable to the respective legislative body – the People’s Council – at the
same level and the People’s Committee at the higher level. This assessment focuses on the city
executive agency (the City Peoples Committee, CPC) as the sub-project owner in the Results-based
National Urban Development Program in the Northern Mountains Region.

77.     The CPC government structure and functions are delineated in the following key legal
documents: the 1992 Constitution (under revision); Law on Organization of the Government (No.
32/2001/QH10 on 12/25/2001); Law on Organization of People’s Council and People’s Committee
(No. 11/2003/QH11 on 11/26/2003); and Decree No. 14/2008/ND-CP on 02/04/2008 on the
organization of specialized bodies of People’s Committees of rural districts, urban districts, provincial
towns or cities. In this regard, the central government reserves the ultimate power to decide on the key
structure and functions of the CPC. However, with decentralized power, the provincial People’s
Committee may adjust and delegate more functions on an ad hoc basis, subject to the approval from
the People’s Council of the same level.

78.      CPCs are principally responsible for the planning, implementation, and operation of public
infrastructure under the city’s jurisdiction. According to Articles 100 and 108 of the Law No.
11/2003/QH11, the CPC develops and executes the approved city master plan (to be approved by the
Provincial People’s Committee), as well as operating or supervising the operation of assigned urban
infrastructure including urban lighting, water supply and drainage, urban transport and safety, and

environmental sanitation. The CPC oversees construction activities and policies and manages the land
and housing funds in its jurisdiction.

79.     Overlapping functions remain among different levels of the government, however, as a
residual from the era of central control. It is important to understand that decentralization is a long
term process. The Program will enhance this process, providing additional momentum by bringing to
the cities a combination of much needed resources with clarification of implementation
responsibilities, a performance-based orientation through the Disbursement-Linked Indicators, and an
enforcement of accountability through audits and verification activities.

City Planning Framework

80.     The City People’s Committees do not have full autonomy to prepare and implement
development plans and budgets. Most key decisions are subject to approval from the provincial level.
The city budget is subordinate to the provincial and ultimately, the national State budget. In practice,
however, the CPCs are able to prepare plans, select and implement investments without being
subjected to excessive interference by higher levels of government.

81.      CPCs approve long term master plans which are prepared their Urban Management Units
(with the assistance of consultants), but which are subject to additional approval by the PPC (or in
case of higher level cities, by the Prime Minister). The master plans are public documents and public
consultation is a mandatory part of the preparation of the plans. However, based on field observations,
the effectiveness of disclosure to residents and businesses that will be affected by the plans appears to
be limited. The general practice of public consultation in planning should be strengthened. In
particular it will be essential that residents who will be subject to resettlement or otherwise affected
by construction works are adequately informed consistent with the guidelines specified in the
Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA). The disclosure of Enhanced Annual City
Plans is proposed as a sub-indicator of DLI 1 (Institutional Strengthening).

82.      Based on the approved master plan, cities prepare five-year implementation plans which are
also approved by the PPC. The key unit responsible for coordination of the plan is the Urban
Management Unit. The five-year plans set targets and identify key investments but do not allocate
resources for implementation. Most cities (with the partial exception of Thai Nguyen amongst the
cities participating in the Program) depend entirely on transfers from the province and ultimately,
from the national budget to finance investments. There is no predictable medium-term expenditure
framework and so investments, selected from the plan, have to be programmed once funds become
available in the annual budget. The amount available may not be known until December of the
previous year. Investments with a multi-year implementation period may be started, only to halt due
to lack of fund allocations in subsequent budgets, or be disrupted by in-year delays in the
disbursement of allocated funds from provinces.

83.      Through these performance-based transfers, the Program will introduce results-based
dimensions to the cities’ planning system for infrastructure development. Currently, without a
predictable medium-term expenditure framework, investments selected from the five-year plan can
only be programmed once funds become available in the annual budget and this practice, in effect,
makes the annual plan largely a list of ad hoc investments with available funding. In this context, the
Program will help improve the cities’ planning system with a predictable source of results -based
financing in the medium-term that requires the cities to: (a) prioritize and select only the most needed
and feasible investments from a long wish list; (b) sequence these investments in a timeline (i.e.,
several annual plans, that are both practical and strategic) to ensure completion and, in the case of
under-performance in some areas, to avoid to minimize liquidity constraints. Such practice will
incrementally reshape planning activities from a perfunctory exercise into a meaningful process to
efficiently use public resources for the city’s development.



                                                   18
City Fiscal Framework
84.     City People’s Committees are not fully autonomous budget entities. Not only do provincial
governments retain significant powers to approve tax rates and expenditure levels, but the functions of
revenue administration and expenditure management are often tightly intertwined. Tax revenues, in
particular, are shared revenues that are collected locally, remitted upwards and then partial re-funded.
Grant revenues are primarily based on the assessed gap between own source revenues and authorized
expenditures, subject to resource availability. These grants are supplemented by earmarked transfers.
Inter-governmental fiscal analysis is weakened by current accounting and reporting formats and
practices that complicate data consolidation and aggregation17.

85.     The revenues and expenditures of the seven participating cities were assessed, using actual
financial information reported by the cities for the period 2010 to 2012. There is a significant
variation in fiscal position and performance between cities, generally based on population size.

Revenues

86.      The seven Program cities reported total revenues amounted to US$ 154.8 million in 2012 (or
US$ 189 per capita), which have grown by an average of 23 percent per year since 2010. Core18 own
source revenues of cities account for 54.5 percent of total revenues and amounted to US$ 103.48 per
capita in 2012. Tax revenues, drawn from a combination VAT, income and property taxes account for
the largest share of all revenues (28 percent or US$ 53.10 per capita) and have grown at over 28
percent per year. Rapid revenue growth has also been reported in land-based revenues (rentals and
leasing), which has grown at an average of over 21 percent per year and now accounts for 20 percent
of all revenues. Transfers from provinces provided similar nominal revenues to tax revenues (US$ 57
per capita in 2012), and have grown at a similar average rate since 2010 (29 percent per year). The
growing significance of own-source revenues, and of land-based revenues in particular, is strongly
influenced by activity in Tuyen Quang and Thai Nguyen (two of the larger participating cities). The
latter, in particular, has seen a significant decline in transfers while needing to respond to rapid
population growth.

US$189 per capita). Total spending has grown at an average of 25.2 percent since 2010, though
annual growth slowed to 19.5 percent in 2012. Recurrent costs and outward transfers to other tiers of
government absorb 76 percent of total spending and have grown most strongly since 2010. Personnel
expenditures (in four cities for which data is available) accounted for an average of 52.1 percent of
recurrent spending since 2010. Specific data on operations and maintenance expenditures is not
reported. Specifically, no dedicated financial or operational arrangements are in place to support
effective asset management (planned asset maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement). Immediate
spending needs on salaries and day-today operations has thus increasingly squeezed out non-capital
asset management expenditures (i.e., planned maintenance) and capital investments (including
rehabilitation and replacement) since 2010. Capital investments have declined to 24 percent of total
expenditures, despite an average growth rate of 14.8 percent. Capital spending growth has also been
volatile, with a decline of 0.3 percent between 2011 and 2012. Total capital spending amounted to
US$ 38 million in 2012 (or US$ 46 per capita).

Issues

88.      The consolidated fiscal position of these cities presents both challenges and opportunities.
Current levels of capital expenditures are insufficient to support current levels of urban growth, and
operational expenditures appear to give limited priority to effective asset management practices. Few
cities have in place adequate plans or financing for effective asset management to ensure the
sustainability of investments. This has led to accumulated shortfalls in the provision of infrastructure
that in turn may create constraints to local economic performance which is felt most directly by poor
households. This situation is unlikely to be alleviated by either a reduction in recurrent expenditure
pressures or increases in existing government transfers. Larger cities, which are experiencing more
rapid population growth, typically receive lower levels of transfers per capita and thus already
experience these challenges most directly. Most cities have begun to take measures to address this
through securing increases in core own-source revenues to finance expanded maintenance and capital
expenditures. Specific strategies have been improved revenue administration on local taxes and fees,
and the utilization of land-based financing mechanisms, through land incorporation, servicing and
leasing arrangements that have the capacity to both provide an immediate source of capital finance
and grow the local tax base. However, the acquisition of land for these purposes raises governance
concerns.

89.      The analysis of city-level revenue and expenditures for the last few years highlighted that
there are surpluses in revenues relative to expenditures, indicating that cities’ funds are being carried
over. This could be due to a number of reasons. First, it could be due to late receipt of transfers in the
calendar year. Second, in any infrastructure sub-project involving land resettlement, the city is
expected to finance the resettlement compensation. Because cities sometimes find it difficult to raise
the resources for the compensation, the spending of the central share gets delayed. Finally, it could be
due to accounting practices. This issue should be closely monitored during the course of the Program
so that Program design can be adjusted if necessary.

90.      The Program design emphasizes the importance of strengthening the sustainability of
investments, both through incrementally improved asset management regimes and securing additional
local resources for maintenance and capital expenditure programs. DLI 3.1 requires CPCs to
undertake Asset Condition Assessments and develop basic Asset Management Plans before 2017.
Cities are subsequently required to ensure that sub-project investments in the Program are in full
service two years after completion. DLI 3.2 requires each city to achieve a 12 percent annual increase
in own source revenues (defined as taxes and fees, but excluding land and rental incomes due to

                                                   20
governance concerns). Capacity support will be provided to cities to meet these requirements.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of investments is a complex, multi-faceted challenge for all
local governments. These measures are assessed as adequate to enhance the sustainability of
expenditures within and beyond the Program implementation period. Measurement constraints
prevent the use of financial indicators of operations and maintenance expenditures, which will not
necessarily provide a more suitable proxy for efficient asset management practices.

Transfer size relative to budget
91.      The proposed provision of a performance-based transfer to participating cities for
infrastructure investment will provide an average annual allocation of US$ 5.48 million per city, or
US$ 47 per capita. The population-weighted allocation of the transfer between cities will address the
bias in the current distribution of transfers towards smaller towns.

92.      In aggregate the transfer will double existing levels of capital expenditure in 2012, though this
contribution will decline over time due to the effects of compounding growth in other revenues. These
are currently growing at 25 percent per year. Although no significant under-expenditures are reported
in comparing budgeted to actual expenditures in all cities since 2010, this increase in resources may
outstrip the spending capacity of participating cities. This is assessed elsewhere.

93.      There is also a risk that increased transfer revenue may displace the own-source revenue
efforts of cities, reducing the sustainability of the investments financed via the Program and of their
investment programs as whole once this support is withdrawn. This risk is mitigated by the
performance requirements in the proposed transfer associated with DLI 3.2, which incentivize
improved collection of core own-source revenues over time.

94.      An assessment was undertaken to calibrate the appropriate target level for revenue
improvement in accordance with DLI 3.2. Own source revenues for CPCs currently include taxes,
fees and proceeds from land sales and leases. However, it was considered appropriate to exclude land
sales and leases (including housing rentals) from the calculation of the indicator. This is because these
revenues are show extreme volatility between years (i.e. there are large single transactions in only
some years, and in some cities), which makes its annual application problematic. In addition, there are
governance concerns associated with the social effects of the acquisition and disposal of this land
(particularly for poor and peri-urban households who might be displaced). Revenues from taxes and
fees are also better placed to fund ongoing asset management costs (planned maintenance as well as
refurbishment and replacement of assets). The results of this analysis are shown in Table 4 below,
indicating that a 12 percent year-on-year increase in defined own source revenues (taxes and fees) is a
sufficiently simple and appropriate target for all Program cities. This performance benchmark will
encourage poorly performing cities to adjust their revenue management practices, while ensuring that

                                                     21
better performers maintain their current performance levels. Cities will be supported to achieve this
target through capacity support activities in the Program.

95.      A final risk is that “free” transfer resources may be put to less productive use than own-source
revenues, resulting in assets that are of limited value and a drain on the recurrent budget of the city.
These risks are addressed through performance requirements for improved planning and demonstrable
utilization of assets.

CPC Administrative Structure and Staffing

Structure

96.     Participating cities, classified as district-level administrative units, are all organized according
to the Law No. 11/2003/QH11 and Decree No. 14/2008/ND-CP. Each CPC is headed by a Chairman
and 2-3 Vice Chairmen dividing up the management responsibilities over a number of line units (also
known as đơn vị quản lý hành chính or public administrative management units) and public service
units (or đơn vị sự nghiệp). Line units help the CPC realize its “state management tasks in the
locality… and ensure a unified management of the sector,” while public service units include services
such as hospital, schools, TV/radio station, etc.




                                                       22
                          Figure 1: Administrative Structure of the CPC




97.     Line unit staff are expected to be specialists in their respective field in order to provide
technical (sectoral) advice or help the CPC leadership perform their assigned functions described
above. For example, the Urban Management Unit develops the city master plan in coordination with
the land use plan developed by the Natural Resources and Environment Unit, and advises the CPC on
the management of city urban infrastructure. In reality, cross-unit collaboration is still weak, creating
shortcomings in the CPC performance.

98.      It is important to note that although the 2005 State Audit Law requires internal auditing to be
implemented in every organization using state budget, funds, and assets, there are no implementation
guidelines to clearly define the internal auditing functions, roles and responsibilities, and currently
there is no active leadership on the implementation of internal auditing within the public sector.

Staffing

99.      Depending on the size of the city, the participating CPCs employ between about 150 – 480
staff on a permanent and contractual basis, including both professional and support staff. On average
CPCs in the Program employ 1.8 staff members per 1000 residents, although this varies by population
size. Each unit is headed by 1-4 managers (often 1 Head and 0-3 Vice-Heads of Unit). Line units tend
to be small in size (5-25 staff) while public service units can host up to 45-50 staff members. Unlike
in larger city governments, the participating CPCs do not fill all their allocated permanent posts,
especially for line units. This situation is mainly because of a restriction on public administrative
management units hiring professional staff on a contractual basis ( hợp đồng) beyond their allocated
headcount for permanent staffing (biên chế), except for support positions such as driver, cleaning, etc.,
according to Decree 68/2000/ND-CP.


                                                   23
100.    Staff turnover is typically quite low, and usually due to transfer across government units
outside of the CPC. In those situations, replacement can come from other external government units
or from new hiring but mostly the former. CPCs report that it should not take more than 6 months for
these vacancies to be filled. Line unit staff can also be seconded to other units, including public
service units, to fill capacity gaps. In the context of the RBNUDP-NM this is particularly important
because these sectoral experts can strengthen the capacity of the PMU (a public service unit), bringing
in technical expertise particularly in financial management, urban management and transport
engineering.

Staffing of Key Units for Implementation of the Program

101.     Staffs with functions related to the RBNUDP-NM are mainly assigned to the Finance &
Planning and the Project Management Units (especially the one tasked with basic infrastructure
construction, as in the case of cities with more than one PMU). Table 5, below, summarizes the
staffing of these units in participating CPCs. Except for the case of the Finance and Planning Units in
Bac Kan and Tuyen Quang, all other units employ about 3-4 managers to oversee about 10-20 staff.
Overall, staff have backgrounds relevant to their respective function: 67 percent and above with at
least a university degree and an average of 9.8 to 21.1 years of experience in their field.

102.      The PMUs are mainly staffed by technical staff with transport and general infrastructure
construction backgrounds (35 – 66 percent of PMU staff) and lack specialists to handle environment
and social safeguards. Most staff have basic procurement training and some PMUs include
procurement sections in their structure but in practice it seems there is limited specialization. Any of
the technical staff may take on environmental impact assessment, social impact assessment or
procurement responsibilities as needed. This approach will not be adequate for implementation of the
Program and the PMUs will need some professional specialists to handle the procurement workload
and to meet the standards that the Bank expects in these areas. It is fortunate that the PMUs are public
service units and can create and manage contractual employments (in addition to receiving seconded
staff) to fill these gaps.

D. Program Institutional Arrangements
General Implementation Arrangements

103.     The Program will be implemented through the planning, budgeting and implementation
arrangements applicable to infrastructure investments funded through annual budget of the CPC. In
this system, the Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) has a number of important oversight functions
in budget planning and implementation. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the transfer
funds to the cities through the State Treasury system. The Ministry of Construction (MOC) will
coordinate the Program and will ensure proper use of the funds and financial and physical reporting.
MOC will also be responsible for capacity development activities carried out under the Program at
both city level and in leading the further development of national urban policies and programs. The
State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) will undertake annual verification of results and Program financial
audits of participating cities in accordance with international audit practice, though contracts with
qualified firms.

                Figure 2: Institutional arrangements for Program Implementation




104.    The participating cities have identified priority sub-projects to be financed by the Program, by
selecting priority investments from their existing master plans and five-year investment plans (see
Section E below). The cities have prepared implementation plans indicating the planned dates for
preparation and implementation of each sub-project. During Program implementation, the cities will
review and update these plans annually as part of their annual budget planning cycle, which begins
around mid-year. In doing so, the cities will need to review: (a) any exogenous factors that could
necessitate changes to the outline plans; (b) progress to date, particularly with ongoing multi-year sub-

                                                   25
projects and with preparation of sub-projects scheduled for implementation in the next year; and (c)
financing, taking into account the planned annual allocation, the expected achievements of the DLIs,
and availability of finance mobilized at the city or province level. The cities will then consolidate the
annual plan with the annual budget which is approved by the City People’s Council in December. The
verification of the DLIs will take place during the first quarter of the following year, so actual release
of disbursements (which will be reconciled against advances on an annual basis) will take place in the
middle of the subsequent year. Cities will need to adapt the timing of procurement and
implementation to match the availability of funds. The general budget planning cycle of the Program
is illustrated in Figure 3.

                                   Figure 3: Program Budget Cycle




105.    Program funds will be transferred by the Ministry of Finance to a special purpose account
operated by CPC (Planning and Finance Unit) at the State Treasury. Financial management
arrangements of the Program are described in detail in the Fiduciary Assessment Report.

Roles of Program Implementing Institutions

Role of Ministry of Construction

106.     The Ministry of Construction, as the designated coordinator of the National Urban
Development Program, will be the lead agency coordinating the Program and acting as lead
interlocutor with the Bank on behalf of the Government of Vietnam. The Ministry of Construction
will assign Program coordination responsibilities to its Urban Development Agency (UDA).

107.   The MOC is responsible for activities contributing to Results Area 4 of the Program: Policy,
Support, Oversight and Capacity Development. In this role, MOC will:
    a) Review lists of sub-projects proposed by the cities to ensure that the sub-projects comply with
       the eligibility criteria and the prioritization criteria;
    b) Ensure that adequate arrangements are in place for implementation of the Program at the
       provincial and city level before funds are released;



                                                   26
    c) Finalize the amounts of annual advances and disbursements to the cities based on the annual
       allocations and achievement of results measured by the Disbursement-Linked Indicators;
    d) Provide technical advice and support to the cities;
    e) Conduct regular monitoring visits to the cities;
    f) Monitor the implementation of the Program investments including physical and financial
       progress reports, and compile reports for submission to the SAV and the World Bank; and
    g) Design and deliver capacity development activities to strengthen the capacity of the city
       administrations.

108.   The MOC will develop an Implementation Strategy for National Urban Development
Program which will draw upon the experience of implementing the Program in the Northern
Mountains cities and will establish an implementation framework for the NUDP in other regions.

109.    The MOC will carry out the tasks described above using its own staff resources assisted by
consultant services as needed.

Role of the State Audit of Vietnam

110.     The State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) will be responsible to contract independent audit firms to
conduct the annual verification of results which will consist of financial and technical audits and will
verify achievement measured by each of the Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs). The SAV will
report the results of the Verification Audits to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).

Roles of the Provincial Peoples’ Committee

111.    The Provincial Peoples Committee (PPC) has the role of approving the master plan and
annual budget plan of the CPC, must approve implementation of investments at a number of key steps
and receives and consolidates financial reports.

112.   The PPC of the relevant provinces have taken a leading role in preparation of the Program, in
some cases by creating a Project Preparation Team (PPT) led by a senior member of the PPC
administration. Close engagement of the CPC with the PPT in the preparation phase will be key to a
smooth handover of responsibilities to the cities and their PMUs for implementation.

113. During implementation the PPC will continue to perform a number of important oversight,
approval and technical support roles. The key department for coordinating these roles will be the
Provincial Departments of Planning and Finance. The Department of Planning and Investment acts as
a clearing house, bringing in other technical departments (for example, Department of Transport and
Department of Construction) as needed to review the proposals prepared by the cities.

114. Roles to be undertaken by the PPCs will include:
    a) Review and approval of the annual budget plan of the CPC, including financial provision for
       Program investments;
    b) Outline planning approval for Program sub-projects;
    c) Review and approval of Project Investment Reports including basic designs (for larger sub-
       projects, in accordance with applicable thresholds) and review of Technical and Economic
       Reports including detailed designs (for smaller sub-projects);
    d) Review of detailed designs and cost estimates through the appropriate technical department,
       most often Department of Construction (DOC);
    e) Review and approval of procurement plans;


                                                  27
    f) Procurement monitoring;
    g) Oversight and technical support during implementation; and
    h) Ensuring the liquidation (final closing) of contracts in a timely manner.

Role of the City People’s Committee

115. The CPC will be the budget holder and implementing agency for Program investments. The City
People’s Committee will assign the principle technical and administrative responsibilities for sub -
projects to the city Project Management Unit (PMU) and will ensure that the PMU is adequately
staffed and resourced to carry out its functions. Financial management will be undertaken by the City
Planning and Finance Unit.

116. The CPC will prepare the annual work plan and budget plan for the Program, consolidated with
the annual budget plan of the city. The annual budget is submitted for adoption by the City People’s
Council after approval by the PPC. The Program annual work plan and the annual budget are
disclosed after adoption.

117. The CPC will be responsible for final adoption of feasibility studies and basic designs, detailed
designs and cost estimates and procurement plans after these have been approved by the PPC and its
technical departments.

City Project Management Unit

118. The city PMUs will be responsible, under the authority of the CPC, for the following tasks:
    a) Preparation of the annual work plan of the Program and submission to the CPC for approval;
    b) Preparation of sub-project concept notes and work plans including terms of reference of sub-
       project preparation consultants;
    c) Preparation of sub-project feasibility studies, including necessary social and environmental
       impact assessments, and preparation of outline designs, through engagement of qualified
       external consultants;
    d) Preparation and submission to the CPC of the Project Investment Report (for larger sub-
       projects) or the Technical and Economic Report (for smaller sub-projects);
    e) Preparation of detailed designs and cost estimates, through engagement of qualified external
       consultants;
    f) Preparation of tender documents;
    g) Preparation of the Procurement Plan;
    h) All procurement actions including advertising, receiving and opening of bids and tender
       evaluations following proper rules and procedures, or identification of the best available
       qualified consultant, contractor or supplier where sole source procurement procedures apply,
       and making recommendations to the CPC for award of contract. Procurement procedures and
       applicable laws and regulations are described and assessed in the Fiduciary Systems
       Assessment;
    i)   Contract administration;
    j)   Technical supervision, through engagement of a qualified external consultant;
    k) Verifying contractor’s claims for payment, and issuing payment instructions to the City
       Finance Unit; and
    l)   Monitoring and proper reporting of physical progress of investments.


                                                  28
Role of the City Planning and Finance Unit

119. The City Planning and Finance Unit will be responsible for assessing the annual financing
available for the Program including Program funds and own-source revenues and informing the
preparation of the annual work plan, including:
     a) Preparation of the annual budget plan of the city;
     b) Entering spending limits for each sub-project into the State electronic accounting system,
        known as TABMIS;
     c) Budget monitoring;
     d) Managing a special purpose deposit account at the Provincial State Treasury, into which
        Program funds will be deposited and from which payments will be made;
     e) Execution of payments;
     f) Monthly reconciliation of accounts with Treasury records; and
     g) Preparation of annual Program financial statements, to be ready for audit before February 15
        of the following year.

Role of the State Treasury

120. The City branch of the State Treasury will combine the roles of banker and financial controller
for Program funds as well as maintaining financial records of expenditures.

121. Program funds will be managed through a special purpose channel opened at the State Treasury
which allows CPC to directly withdraw.

122. The State Treasury is responsible to determine that payments can legitimately be made from the
State Budget (which includes the city budget) by checking that the expenditures that are listed in the
approved budget estimates, are in line with State norms and standards, are approved by the authorized
officer of the spending unit and are supported by adequate documentation.

123.    State Treasury enters payment information directly into the TABMIS system, thus ensuring
the sharing of information with the Planning and Finance Unit.

Sub-Project Preparation Process

124.     The sub-project preparation process follows a number of well-defined steps with some
variations according to the size, type and cost of investment. MOC categorizes construction works
into classes I to III with the largest/most complex works considered as “special”19. MOC guidelines
specify requirements for preparation and design of investments according to the cost of the investment
and the works class.

125.    At the first step, a Project Concept Note is prepared for approval by the PPC. The sub-
projects in the lists submitted by the cities for inclusion in the Program have all reached this stage.
The CPC then assigns the PMU to begin preparation of the design

126.     For larger sub-projects with estimated cost over 15 billion VND20 (i.e., about US$ 700,000)
the PMU prepares a Project Investment Report. The Project Investment Report includes a technical
feasibility study, an environmental impact assessment, land acquisition requirements, a social impact
19
   The classification system is defined in Annex I, Section III of Circular 10/2013-TT-BXD and depends on
technical parameters according to the type of construction. For example, bridges with piles that are > 150m
apart are “special” class, 100-150m Class I, 50-100m Class II and 25-50m, Class III.
20
   Specified in Decree 12.2009/ND-CP.

                                                    29
assessment including resettlement needs, and an outline technical design (“basic design”) for the sub -
project. At this stage the cost estimate of the sub-project is based on unit cost norms issued by MOC
(Decision No. 725/QĐ-BXD dated 9th August 2012).

127.     The Project Investment Report is submitted to the PPC for review. PPC assigns coordination
of this task to the Department of Planning and Investment (DPI), which in turn may request relevant
technical departments such as Department of Construction, Department of Transport, Department of
Environment and Natural Resources, etc. to review and comment. DPI consolidates the comments and
coordinates any necessary revisions before submitting the Investment Report to the PPC for approval.

128.     The PMU then prepares a detailed design and cost estimate for the sub-project. The design
will normally be prepared by external consultants on behalf of the PMU. The design must follow
relevant standards and technical specifications. The detailed cost estimate is prepared based on input
costs (labor, materials, etc.) using norms issued by MOC and regularly updated to reflect market
prices.

129.     Decree 15/2013 NĐ-CP dated 6th February 2013 on Quality Management of Construction
Works specified that detailed designs must be submitted to the appropriate provincial technical
department – most often this will be Department of Construction – for a design check. This represents
a change from previous practice which was for the PMU to conduct its own design check either
internally or by engaging a consultant. The decree does not appear to have been implemented up to
the time of the city visits conducted by the assessment team in August-September 2013. The
requirements of the decree will be implemented for the Program investments. Decree 15/2013
specifies a maximum of 40 days to complete design checks for Class I investments and 30 days for
Class II investments. The design check will include a verification of the cost estimate. The output of
the design check is a set of design documents stamped as reviewed and approved.

130.    Following the design check, the final design is adopted by the CPC. The PMU prepares the
tender documents.

131.    For smaller or less complex sub-projects valued less than 15 billion VND, a single-stage
document known as a Technical and Economic Report, and comprising a feasibility study and a
detailed design, is submitted for review and approval by the PPC.

132.     The procurement plan requires approval by the PPC after review by the DPI. Standard
practice is for a procurement plan for each sub-project to be prepared separately, with procurement
starting immediately once the plan is approved. Better practice would be for preparation and approval
of periodic procurement plans showing all procurement actions to be undertaken during each budget
year.

133.     Under the revised Public Procurement Law, which was approved by the National Assembly in
November 2013 and will be effective from July 1, 2014 (see the Fiduciary Systems Assessment), the
threshold for open competitive tendering for works is 1 billion VND or about US$48,000. Therefore,
it is expected that nearly 100 percent of works under the Program will be mandatorily procured by
open competitive tendering. Procurement procedures are described and assessed in the Fiduciary
Systems Assessment.

134.    The sub-project preparation process, as described, is essentially sound but its effectiveness
depends on the quality of the consultants engaged for the feasibility study, the design and the design
checks, and also on the availability of adequate budget for essential field studies and surveys,
including ground investigations for larger infrastructure. The Ministry of Construction applies fee
norms to the hire of technical consultants by city administrations and it appears that these fee norms
are well below market rates. The procurement rules permit single sourcing of consultants in most
cases without any clear rules to ensure that the best qualified available consultant is selected.


                                                  30
135.    Therefore, the Program should ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to guarantee
proper and equitable selection of the best qualified available consultants and to ensure that both
consultant fees and costs of surveys, ground investigations, etc. are adequately funded. In line with
Decree 15/2013, design checks will be carried out at the provincial level, most likely by DOC. For all
Program investments, the design check report should be kept on file and should be available for audit.

Sub-Project Implementation

136.  For infrastructure investments financed through the city budget, CPC usually assigns contract
management responsibility to the PMU.

137.    Site supervision is assigned either to a consultant or to a member of the PMU staff, depending
on the nature of the sub-project. There is a budget for quality control testing and tests are normally
carried out by the laboratory of the Provincial Department of Construction. In the past the quality
control testing was normally carried out under the contract of the construction contractor but a
recently introduced guideline states that testing should be done under the contract of the supervision
consultant instead.

138.     Acceptance of works requires review and approval by a committee formed from various
interested agencies – for large projects this can include Ministry of Planning and Investment. A
financial and technical audit of the contract is carried out before final “liquidation” of the contract.
This can take time and can in fact exceed the contractor’s liability period.

139.    The Program should take measures, through procedures to be adopted in the Program
Operational Manual, to ensure the highest standard of technical supervision of construction. Poor
construction supervision not only results in poor quality construction but encourages and rewards bad
practice by contractors and impacts on procurement – if a bidder does not expect to have to fully
honor the contract conditions, technical specifications and undertakings given regarding personnel,
equipment and working practices, then the basis of bid evaluation is undermined.

140.    A number of contract management procedures that are commonly applied are not conducive
to ensuring the highest possible standards of construction work. These include:
        a) Large advances – usually 25 percent to 30 percent of contract value but can be up to 50
           percent - are routinely paid to contractors – it is not clear whether these large advances
           are necessary or adequately secured.
        b) Payment procedures do not involve retention from each stage payment – good practice
           would be for retention to be deducted and held in a reserve account at each payment
           stage, rather than deducted only from the final payment.
        c) Final acceptance (“liquidation”) procedures can extend beyond the expiry of the
           contractor’s liability period, in which case normal practice is to return the 5 percent
           retention to the contractor. Then, if any further liability of the contractor is discovered, it
           is necessary to recover the money through institutional or court proceedings, which can
           be very time consuming.

141.     Work in progress or completed but not yet paid for is not recorded as a liability in the city
accounts. It appears that in some cases city administrations may enter into contracts for consultancy or
construction works despite a lack of sufficient funds to pay for the work to be carried out in the
current budget year. The consultant or contractor then carries out the work in expectation of future
payment, or in some cases implementation of the work is delayed until funds become available. Both
of these practices are highly non-conducive to ensuring the quality of work carried out.

142.   Advance payments may be justified to offset the contractor’s mobili zation costs and initial
purchases of materials. Allowing advance payments may assist in increasing competition by allowing

                                                   31
contractors with limited financing to take part. However there is an obvious discrepancy between this
practice and that of relying on contractors to pre-finance works when funds are not available. Cities
should review the size of advance payments and settle on an appropriate level, sufficient to finance
the contractor’s start-up costs and properly secured, then this practice should be applied consistently
to all contracts. The size of the advance should not become a matter for negotiation after the contract
is awarded.

143.    Program Operational Manual should include the following provisions to ensure a high quality
of contract management and technical supervision:
         a) Review rules for provision of advances to contractors; consider partially or wholly
            replacing these with mobilization payments;
         b) Introduce stage-by-stage retention with retention amounts held in a ring-fenced account;
         c) Allow release of retention on completion, in exchange for adequate security to be retained
            until completion of the “liquidation” process;
         d) Ensure adequate cash-flow planning and that contracts cannot be signed until availability
            of funds to make payments is assured;
         e) Ensure proper enforcement of contract conditions including liquidated damages where
            applicable;
         f) Ensure that serious breaches of contract and/or contractor malfeasance automatically
            result in placing the contractor on Government and World Bank disbarment lists;
         g) All contracts of a value above US$250,00021 should be supervised by properly qualified
            independent consultants. Supervision consultants should be selected by a process
            ensuring that the best qualified candidate is selected and should be remunerated in a
            manner that does not create perverse incentives (supervision consultants should not lose
            financially by ordering necessary delays in the works, for example).
         h) Ensure clear and systematic record-keeping by supervision consultants including all
            significant communications to the contractor and reports to the PMU on quality and
            quantity of works completed; and
         i)   Any construction defects or deviations from design and specification identified during
              technical audit and not found to have been specifically notified in writing by the
              supervision consultant to the PMU, to be automatically taken into account in evaluation
              of the consultant’s qualifications for future supervision contracts. Serious cases should
              result in disbarment of the consultant from further work under the Program.

  This value is the current threshold for competitive tendering (although this threshold is likely to be lowered)
and is chosen as a working definition of the upper limit of what can be considered as minor works.

Capacity and Experience of MOC

144.     MOC has been a key counterpart of the World Bank, as well as other donors, in many urban
infrastructure projects and technical assistance activities, most recently in areas of urban water supply
development, urban upgrading, and urban governance. Within MOC, the UDA has been gradually
growing in their role of overseeing major ODA projects in urban development. In the past 10 years,
UDA – through the MUDP – has completed two large projects to improve urban environmental
sanitation (including drainage, wastewater and solid waste) in seven cities of the central region
totaling US$97 million, funded by ADB, AFD, and JFPR. MUDP has also benefited from various
capacity development activities, most significantly a grant from DANIDA in 2004-2006 to strengthen
its capacity in planning and managing the urban environment. The UDA has a strong team of 23 staff,
including 12 technical specialists (60 percent with Master’s degree, and the rest with Bachelor degree)
with an average of 7 years of experience in urban planning, architecture, construction, and project
management. This team is supervising a number of government and ODA projects, among which is
the Mekong Delta Region Urban Upgrading Project (MDR-UUP - US$292 million) where the MOC
has a major role to play in supporting six cities on implementation of urban infrastructure sub-projects,
very similar to its role under the RBNUDP-NM.

Priority Needs for Strengthening Capacity of MOC

145.      While the MOC and its agencies have considerable experience in setting guidelines for cities
and supporting them with infrastructure projects, the performance-based transfer instrument and
assessment mechanisms of the Program will be a new function. One of the goals of the first phase of
the NUDP is to prepare the MOC to replicate the results-based approach nationwide in the future. The
priority for strengthening within MOC should be to institutionalize the capacity to manage the
performance-based transfer mechanism and, more broadly, the capacity of MOC to assist the city
administrations to improve the cost-effectiveness of planning and implementation of infrastructure
investments using clearly defined, measurable, and achievable results as a reference framework. Key
skills areas will include medium-term investment planning as well as ex-ante appraisal and ex-post
evaluation of investments. The capacity development provided by MOC to the cities on these topics
and others will be primarily through specialized consultants. It is anticipated that the MOC will also
require support to analyze and integrate lessons learned in the first phase of the NUDP to the national
roll-out.

146.     As part of the Program, the MOC will further develop national strategy for urban
infrastructure development. A critical first step in this process is improved analysis of the overall
framework for the financing of urban development. This will require data gathering, analysis and
quantification (costing) of: (a) urban infrastructure investment needs in relation to backlogs in access
to basic infrastructure, asset refurbishment and replacement requirements, and new asset creation
required to support growth; and (b) current sources of finance for urban infrastructure investment,
including own source revenues, transfers and leveraged financed (borrowing, partnerships and land /
asset sales/leases). This is a critical but complex priority for the NUDP and may require technical
assistance in the form of advisory services from international experts.

147.     The Program will also support the SAV, with contracted national or international expertise as
needed, to conduct an annual audit of city expenditures and Program expenditures and undertake the
verification of DLIs in accordance with the verification protocol. Because SAV’s expertise is in
financial auditing, they will initially hire a professional firm to carry out the technical audit function
and, through Program implementation, develop such capacity in-house for the longer term.

Performance of the City PMUs

148.    The city PMUs have in most cases been established and operating with a stable and
experienced leadership for a number of years. The PMUs have a thorough understanding of the rules
and procedures applicable to the tasks that they are assigned. The PMUs are experienced in
procurement under the Government of Vietnam procedures. The PMUs have in most cases handled
individual sub-projects of similar size and complexity to the larger sub-projects projected under the
Program. However, the volume of work under the Program will represent a considerable increase for
most PMUs. The financial impact of delays, through the linkage of transfer funds to results under the
Program arrangements, will represent a new challenge for the PMUs.

149.    Although the largest sub-projects said to have been managed by the city PMUs in the past are
up to around US$15 million value, the typical workload appears to be no more the three to five
competitive procurements per year, plus a number of single source contracting actions for
consultancies and small works, with a total capital budget executed by the PMU in the range
US$2.5 million to US$5 million per year. Table 6 summarizes the number of works contracts (most of
which require competitive tendering) and approximate value of procurements of works each year,
implied in the preliminary implementation plans of the cities for Program sub-projects.

150.    The efficiency of execution of procurement and contract administration tasks by the PMUs
appears to be satisfactory. Significant delays occur in implementation of investments but the primary
reason for these delays appears to be shortage of funds (this risk in relation to the Program is
discussed in Section F below).

151.     The PMUs in most cases have around 10 to 20 staff (see Table 5) who can be a mixture of
permanent and contract staff. PMUs use external consultants to carry out many technical tasks
including design and supervision work, although in some cases these tasks may be undertaken in
house, particularly for smaller projects. The majority of the PMU staff are engineers and in most cases
they hold the Ministry of Planning and Investment certificate of competence in procurement. This
certificate is awarded after a training course of only three days’ duration but is only available to staff
with engineer or equivalent qualifications and at least 3 years’ professional experience. The PMUs
generally include one accountant amongst their staff. However, PMUs are not responsible for
financial management tasks, which are assigned to the City Planning and Finance Unit. Routinely, the
PMUs prepare a financial report on completion of each sub-project and submit this report to the PPC
Department of Planning and Investment. Although the PMUs are responsible for producing basic
environmental and social impact assessments for investment sub-projects, they do not have staff who
are specialized in these areas. The PMUs do not have staff specialized in monitoring and evaluation or
IT.

Priority Needs for Strengthening the PMUs

152.    The PMUs will contract most technical tasks including feasibility studies, design,
environmental impact assessments and construction supervision to independent consultants. Therefore
the tasks carried out directly by PMU staff will comprise: (a) work planning and procurement
planning; (b) preparing terms of reference, recruitment, managing and reviewing the outputs of
consultants; (c) preparation of tender documents for works; (d) procurement of works; (e) reviewing
contractors’ requests for payment and (6) monitoring, evaluation and reporting tasks.

153.    The workload of recruitment and management of consultants will be considerable. Potentially,
five separate consultant assignments may be required for a single sub-project: (a) feasibility study
(Project Investment Report); (b) environmental impact assessment; (c) design and cost estimation; (d)
design and cost estimate check; and (e) construction supervision. For larger sub-projects it is
preferable to engage a consulting firm with the capacity to take on a number of these tasks under a
single contract. Alternatively, similar tasks in relation to a number of different sub-projects could be
consolidated in a single contract.




                                                           35
154.   Level of expertise will be more important than gross staff numbers, particularly to enable the
PMUs to review and absorb the recommendations of its consultants. Nevertheless, a significant
administrative capacity will also be required.

155.    It is suggested that at a minimum each PMU should be able to deploy the following staff able
to work full-time or virtually full-time on Program activities:
        a) Two design qualified engineers with at least 5 years’ experience, led by one staff member
           with 10 years’ experience, to be responsible for control and technical review of the sub-
           project preparation process’;
        b) One staff with University’s degree in an appropriate discipline who will be responsible to
           coordinate and review environmental impact assessments and who will also coordinate
           social (including gender) and resettlement issues;
        c) At least two qualified and experienced procurement staff led by one staff member with 5
           years’ experience led by one staff member with 10 years’ experience. All procurement
           staff must have certificate of competence in procurement;
        d) One qualified engineer with at least 7 years’ experience who will be responsible for
           control and review of contract supervision activities;
        e) One specialist in monitoring and evaluation, who should have an appropriate qualification
           and strong IT skills; and
        f) Two general administrative assistants.

156.    A rapid capacity needs assessment was carried out during Program preparation, and identified
three broad areas for capacity building support at the city level, including: (a) infrastructure
investment prioritization and planning; (b) management of infrastructure sub-projects, especially
technical quality, procurement, and integration of environmental and social aspects; and (c) systems
and mechanisms for operations and maintenance.

157.     Infrastructure investment prioritization and planning. A majority of surveyed staff indicated
that they lack key technical skills necessary to translate city master plans into annual prioritized
infrastructure development plans, especially in terms of integrating economic, environmental, and
social development considerations. This reflects a concern among participating cities that prioritizing
and planning will play an extremely important role in the Program, not only because it is part of a DLI
but also because it will guide the implementation of infrastructure sub-projects. Participating cities
understand that if they do not prioritize and plan well, they will not have enough liquidity to sustain
implementation throughout the whole six years and can potentially fail in this Program. Therefore,
cities stressed a need for hands-on, on-the-job training at the very beginning of the Program to help
them identify priority investments and develop realistic and feasible annual plans for their
implementation.

158.    Management of infrastructure sub-projects. City-level staff indicated that they expect
training in all aspects of project management, including professional project management skills,
technical assessment, procurement, financial management and accounting, social development, and
environmental management in order to fulfil Program requirements. These trainings will include
sessions on the additional requirements in the sub-project implementation procedures that are
introduced by the Program Action Plan and how they are harmonized and integrated into the existing
Government procedures. Among these areas, a few topics emerged as top priority – technical quality,
procurement, and integration of environmental and social aspects.
           Technical quality: Applying technical knowledge into infrastructure sub-project
            management requires technical staff to develop relevant Terms of Reference in
            collaboration with social and environmental specialists to minimize negative impacts.


                                                  36
            Technical staffs also asked for training in technical assessment of built infrastructure to
            ensure the verification process, and subsequently disbursement, could be done smoothly.
           Procurement: All cities consider procurement a challenging topic. Cities have sent staff to
            procurement training courses but the overall feedback is that these courses are not very
            effective in terms of preparing participants for real-life situations, and the supply of
            courses is inadequate vis-à-vis the demand and the complexity of the work. In the context
            of harmonizing existing Vietnamese procurement procedures with the proposed
            procurement actions under the Program Action Plan, especially given the number and
            scope of the procurement packages that cities will deal with under the Program, there is
            unanimous demand for hands-on training that uses real-life situations to help cities
            develop capacity for (a) competitive bidding; (b) bid evaluation; and (c) communication
            and response to concerns of bidders.
           Environmental and social management: Additional training was requested to support
            cities to build capacity in (a) carrying out social and environmental assessment; (b)
            implementing livelihood recovery mechanisms for the affected people; and (c) organizing
            community consultations.

159.     Systems and mechanisms for operations and maintenance and revenue enhancement . Most
participating cities have experienced inadequate funding for the operation and maintenance of
infrastructure, and transfers from the National Maintenance Fund are insufficient to meet the huge
need. With new infrastructure being built under the Program, cities recognize that they will need an
assigned management entity and sustainable funding mechanisms. While expenditure instruments
such as an operation and maintenance (O&M) Fund may be appropriate, these will need to be
complemented by efforts to maximize the collection of own source revenues. In addition, cities will
require practical technical assistance to seek additional sources of capital finance, including land
based revenue options, to sustain their capital investment programs beyond the Program
implementation period. DLI 3 recognizes the importance of effective operational expenditures and
own revenue enhancements to the longer terms sustainability of investments made in the Program
through two sub-indicators. Technical assistance is needed to prepare policies and guidance for both
O&M mechanisms and revenue enhancement strategies at the city level. This can be informed by best
practices from Vietnam and elsewhere, and assistance will be tailored to specific types of
infrastructure (roads, bridges, water & wastewater, social infrastructures, etc.), revenue management
challenges and opportunities for capital financing that exist, depending on demand.

160.     Annual Capacity Development Plan. While there are some topics for which a majority of the
participating cities demand support (e.g., translating master plans into annual infrastructure
development plans), the existing capacity and context of each of the cities are quite heterogeneous. It
is also expected that the demand for capacity building activities will shift over time as initial needs are
satisfied and new needs emerge. As such, to provide flexibility for adaptation to specific capacity
building needs as the Program evolves, an annual Capacity Development Plan will be developed by
MOC each year and submitted to the World Bank for review and approval. A template and required
contents for the annual plan is included in the POM. At a minimum, it is anticipated that the plan will
specify: (a) the capacity building activity topic; (b) objective and intended intermediate results; (c)
target audience, including projected enrolment levels or participants; (d) delivery modality (i.e., class
room-based training, distance learning, guidebook, “hands on” technical assistance, etc.); (e) timeline;
and (f) assigned resources. Each activity will also include a ‘measurable output’ indicator to serve as a
proxy for its contribution toward the achievement of DLI 4.

Consultants and Contractors

161.     The total volume of works to be executed under the Program, though significant, is likely to
be small compared to the total size of the market for civil works construction in the region and
therefore should not exceed the capacity of available works contractors. Smaller sub-projects are
likely to be executed by city or province based contractors while larger sub-projects are likely to
attract bids from regional or national contractors. Therefore, provided that tenders are properly
advertised with sufficient time allowed for bid preparation (contractors without local knowledge will
generally require a longer bid preparation period) there should be no difficulty in attracting bids from
qualified contractors with adequate capacity to execute the works.

162.    In principle, the same argument applies to design and supervision consultants – there are
many other schemes of similar size and complexity implemented in the region so it is evident that
adequate capacity exists. However, the procedures routinely used by the city PMUs for engaging
consultants may not ensure that the best available consultant is selected, and may not be adequate to
cope with a large and sudden increase in work volumes. Essentially, it appears that most consultants
are engaged using sole source procedures on the basis of the familiarity of the city PMUs with their
work record. To avoid encountering capacity problems and to ensure selection of the best available
candidates, the cities should either adopt competitive procurement procedures for selection of
consultants (Quality and Cost Based Selection), or adopt a procedure including public advertisement
for expressions of interest and a formal procedure for comparing the qualifications of interested
candidates (Selection Based on Consultant’s Qualifications).

163.     The MOC operates a website including a “black list” of disbarred or suspended contractors
and consultants. In addition, cities will also be required to conform to World Bank disbarment lists
that will be provided to cities by the MOC and regularly updated. The city PMUs refer to this list and
also maintain their own lists of sanctioned or disbarred contractors. Within the Program, technical
audit of completed works should form part of the results verification process, and in cases of serious
technical defects being identified, this should result in sanctions or disbarment of the responsible party
(design consultant, contractor and/or supervision consultant) from further work under the Program.

E. Technical Soundness of Sub-Projects
Planning and Sub-Project Selection Criteria

164.   Sub-projects included in the Program are selected from the master plans of the cities in
conformance with selection criteria agreed with the MOC to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.

165.   All cities included in the Program have master plans which are periodically updated. Table 8
shows the year of latest update of the master plans for each city.

                                                   39
166.     The city master plans are spatial development plans indicating proposed development zones
for industrial, commercial, administrative and residential use and the necessary supporting
infrastructure. The plans are developed by consultants under the supervision of the Urban
Management Unit and are approved by the Provincial People’s Committee, with the exception of the
plan for Thai Nguyen which, in line with the Class 2 status of the city, is approved by the Prime
Minister.

167.    The master plans are based on an ambitious vision of future urban expansion and
development and in all cases indicate surrounding rural or semi-rural areas that will become urbanized
under the plans. In most cases the plans include expanding the administrative boundaries of the city to
include neighboring rural communes. In several cases (for example Dien Bien Phu, Hoa Binh) the
plans include re-location of the administrative functions of the city to a new site.

168.    The master plans are based on projected population increases of up to 8 percent per year,
which is considerably higher than the average rate of urban expansion (3.4 percent per year) quoted in
the Vietnam Urbanization Report22 .

169.    The master plans do not appear to be strongly constrained by available resources, nor do they
represent a commitment by the Government to mobilize the resources needed to implement the master
plan within a specific timeframe. The master plans are periodically updated but this process does not
imply completion of the previous plan. Investments from the master plan are included in five-year
development plans, however it is only at the annual budgeting stage that resources from the State
budget are committed. In some cases investments under the master plan with a multi-year
implementation timeframe are begun and then postponed for one or more years due to the non-
availability of funding to continue.

170.    The master plans do not appear to include a strong sequencing element indicating the order in
which investments will be implemented so as to ensure a phased, integrated expansion and to
maintain connectivity of infrastructure. The five-year plans indicate intended timing but are not based
on assured availability of funding and tend to concentrate all the investments in the first years of the
plan. In this situation, projects begin when funding becomes available even though funding for
necessary complementary investments (for example, a bridge creating access to a major new facility
such as a hospital or university) has not been secured.

171.    Participating cities will be required to prepare the various sub-projects (the infrastructure
types included under the Program are shown in Table 9 below) to be funded under the Program in a
participatory manner, with involvement of the municipal units as well as the local communities. This
is consistent with the legal requirement which provides for bottom-up participatory planning in
Vietnam. The costing of selected sub-projects will be subject to prevailing government cost norms. To
ensure transparency and accountability, the sub-projects to be funded under the Program will be
screened by the CPC using the screening (pass/fail) and prioritization criteria summarized in Table 10,
and which are detailed in the POM.

   consulting services, estimated to cost US$
   20million equivalent or more per contract; or (4)
   consultants’ services, estimated to cost US$ 15
   million equivalent or more per contract.

172.      The MOC has reviewed the list of sub-projects proposed by the cities and appropriate changes
have been made to ensure conformance with the pass-fail and prioritization criteria. Compliance with
the criteria will be verified at the feasibility study stage of each sub-project. The application of these
criteria, together with the economic analysis reported below, are adequate to ensure that the Program
investments are used efficiently to address infrastructure deficiency that constrain the expansion and
development of the cities.

Assessment of the Proposed Sub-Projects

173.     The city administrations have prepared provisional lists of sub-projects to be financed by the
Program. These lists have been determined by the CPCs in consultation with provinces, by identifying
the highest priority investments from the city master plans and detailed five-year plans (2011-16).
These lists have been reviewed by the MOC and confirmed as complying with the eligibility and
prioritization criteria.

174.    There are a total of 88 sub-projects identified for the seven cities with a total investment cost
(including counterpart funding) of US$ 280 million. The size of individual sub-projects ranges from
US$ 317,000 to US$19.5 million, with an average size of US$ 3.2 million. Eighteen sub-projects have
values less than US$1 million, 66 are in the range US$US 1 million to US$ 10 million and 4 are
above US$ 10 million.

175.     Sub-project preparation costs including feasibility study and design will be financed by a
Project Preparation Technical Assistance Facility (PPTAF). Therefore feasibility study and design
costs are not eligible Program expenditures. It is expected that at least the detailed design of
infrastructure to be constructed during the first two years of the Program, 2015-2016, will be
completed by the start of the Program itself.

176.    The total estimated cost of sub-projects in the lists prepared by the cities is approximately
equal to the total allocations to the cities for the full six years of the Program. However the lists are
not final and some sub-projects may be added or deleted according to need and funding availability
during the implementation period. Cities will review and update the sub-project lists as part of the
annual Program planning exercise. Table 11 summarizes the proposed sub-project outputs by type
while an expanded matrix is presented in Annex 1.

Road Sub-Projects

177.    There are 40 proposed road sub-projects with a preliminary estimated total cost of US$124
million, representing 44.3 percent of all proposed investments under the Program and an average cost
of US$3.1 million. In addition, several other sub-project types can include residential roads or paths.


                                                   42
The proposed roads vary from 7m to 24m in total width (carriageway width 5m to 15m). These roads
are the main spinal roads providing access to urban areas. In most cases the proposed sub-project will
either: (a) upgrade an existing minor road or track, or (b) repair, resurface or provide adequate
drainage for an existing sealed road. Only in a minority of cases will the proposed sub-project build a
new road.

178.    Proposed technical details of the roads follow MOC design specifications for the appropriate
road class. None of the sub-projects appear to present any unusual technical complexity and all are
considered to be Class II or III works under the Government’s t echnical classification. Therefore,
construction of the carriageways and pavements should not present any major difficulty in design or
construction. Proper attention to design of side drainage and cross drainage will be needed to prevent
flooding and to avoid damage to the road. Drainage design should take into account increased
capacity needed due to the future effects of climate change where relevant.

179.     In some cases, there are existing buildings, temporary structures, boundary fences and other
obstacles within the proposed road reserve area and these will require clearing with suitable
resettlement arrangements. In some cases there will also be a need to relocate utilities such as
electricity transmission lines. One road in Thai Nguyen runs parallel to a railway and should be
provided with a safety fence to separate vehicles and pedestrians from rail traffic. While the road will
not encroach upon the railway reserve, it will be prudent to communicate with the railway authority to
ensure that no problems arise.

Bridge Sub-Projects

180.    There are 5 proposed major bridge sub-projects with a total estimated cost US$ 46 million,
representing 16.43 percent of total investment costs and an average cost of US$9.2 million. The
proposed bridges vary between 7m and 19.5m in width and carry mainly strategic urban roads. Three
of the bridges are entirely new river crossings; one replaces an existing road bridge that is too narrow
and in poor repair (verified by site visit); one replaces an existing steel and timber bridge and one
replaces a suspension footbridge in extremely poor condition.

181.    All the bridges will use simply supported span type construction and so can use standard
specifications and design details. Technical complexity could arise from foundation requirements and
from the river hydraulics. It will be important to ensure that adequate ground investigations are
carried out to ensure that foundation designs are appropriate. Design procedures should include a
check that the bridge opening is sufficient for maximum (100 year) flood conditions and that
appropriate measures are adopted to prevent scour and/or damaging erosion of the river banks
adjacent to the bridge site. None of the bridges are considered “special” under the Government’s
technical classification of works: 1 is Class I (in Hoa Binh), 2 are Class II (in Thai Nguyen and Dien
Bien Phu) and 2 are Class III (in Bac Kan and Thai Nguyen).

182.    Future effects of climate change should be taken into account in hydraulic analysis. Some
bridges will require clearing of buildings and other structures on the bridge approaches and suitable
resettlement procedures should be followed. Resettlement arrangements will be made by the city, in
coordination with relevant authorities.

Drainage and Environmental Improvement Sub-Projects

183.    There are 12 sub-projects in this category with a total cost of US$41.5 million and an average
cost of US$3.46 million. The sub-projects consist of provision or improvement of stormwater
drainage channels (three schemes); construction of masonry embankments to natural streams (four
schemes) and improvements that include excavation, embankment improvements and construction of
perimeter roads or tracks to natural lakes which have a drainage function (four schemes).



                                                  43
184.     One scheme, in Thai Nguyen (cost US$ 4.8 million), will carry waste water as well as storm
water and discharge into a wastewater treatment plant recently constructed with finance from the
Government of Finland. This scheme complements drainage works in other priority areas of the city
that are also financed by Finland.

185.    The drainage works should not pose any major complexities in design or construction. There
will inevitably be considerable disruption to traffic and also to buried utilities during the construction
period. It is common, particularly with combined storm drainage and sewerage systems, that it is not
financially feasible and/or not economic to construct the system with adequate capacity to prevent any
flooding from occurring during the heaviest storms. Experienced design consultants should be
engaged to ensure that the system is designed so that any flooding that does occur will dissipate
quickly and without causing physical damage, and to ensure that flooding does not result in discharge
of foul water to the surface. The temptation to “stretch” the available finance to cover a larger area by
using a specification below this minimum, should be avoided. Drains carrying untreated waste water
should discharge into a treatment plant.

186.     The lake and watercourse improvement schemes have a dual function of creating public
amenity space within the urban areas in addition to the drainage function. These sub-projects should
not present any major technical problems, although embankment constructions always entail some
risk of local collapses occurring – this can most effectively be prevented by careful attention to
conditions encountered during construction and a willingness and ability to revise the design to take
account of conditions. There will be disruption to existing users of the watercourses and the
possibility of temporary loss of water quality downstream due to wash-out from construction works.
The ESSA provides guidance on environmental protection measures to be taken in connection with
these schemes.

187.    According to the Government’s technical classification framework, all proposed sewers are
under the Class III.

Low Income Areas Sub-Projects

188.     There are 18 sub-projects with a total estimated cost of US$23 million proposed for
upgrading of “low income areas” at and an average cost of US$1.28 million Characteristically, these
are residential areas with poor provision of infrastructure, perhaps reflecting a history of informal or
piecemeal development, and in which a high proportion, though not all households, are in the low-
income group. The proposed activities comprise provision of residential roads, water supply, drainage
and street lighting to these areas. According to the Government’s technical classification, all of these
works are considered Class III.

189.    The low income areas sub-projects appear technically unproblematic, although it will be
necessary to pay adequate attention to the proper design of drainage and – as with all sub-projects – to
the quality of construction. In many of these areas, upgrading will require widening and re-alignment
of streets and this will result in the need to clear or relocate some structures, with appropriate
resettlement procedures.

Buildings (Social Infrastructure) Sub-Projects

190.     Four cities have included construction of public facilities such as kindergartens, schools,
cultural centers and one market renovation scheme in their sub-project lists. The total estimated cost
of these sub-projects is US$6.6 million and their average cost is US$1.3 million. Thai Nguyen
proposes to construct a large kindergarten (300 – 400 pupils) to serve the central area of the city. Dien
Bien Phu proposes a number of smaller local facilities including one kindergarten, one elementary
school and four community cultural centers. According to the Government’s classification framework,
all buildings such as schools, kindergartens, markets with 1-4 stories are considered Class III.


                                                   44
191.    It is expected that these facilities will be constructed using standard designs and as they will
consist of relatively light buildings, there should be no major technical difficulties beyond ensuring
quality of construction. Engagement of relevant sectoral agencies (for example, education) will be
needed to ensure that the needs of the end-users are met. The cities should also verify that personnel
and operating costs for operating the facilities will be available upon completion.

Resettlement Area Sub-Projects

192.    Six cities propose to finance preparation of resettlement areas – i.e., areas in which
households relocated due to infrastructure developments elsewhere – including, but not limited to,
developments funded by the Program – can be allocated housing land. The estimated cost of these
sub-projects is US$ 28 million and their average cost is US$4.67 million. The funds will be used to
prepare the areas and provide basic public infrastructure – roads, water supply, drainage and lighting.
Therefore, from a technical point of view, the sub-projects will be similar to the Low Income Area
sub-projects discussed above. According to the Government’s technical classification, all of these
works are considered Class III.

193.   Development of the resettlement areas may require some re-location within the site of
households already living in the area.

Other Sub-Project Types

194.     The provisional sub-project lists include two sub-projects that do not fit into any of the
general categories listed above: they are sub-projects in Thai Nguyen and YenBai or re-routing of
overhead electric supply cables through underground cable ducts in main city streets (length 8.8km;
estimated cost of sub-projects US$ 11 million). According to the Government’s technical
classification, this type of sub-project is considered Class III.

Ensuring Technical Quality: Summary

195.    The city administrations of the Northern Mountains cities, usually working under the
oversight of the provincial administrations, have a significant track record in delivering substantial
investments in urban infrastructure including roads, bridges, water supplies, wastewater treatment
plans and other facilities of similar size and complexity to the sub-projects proposed under the
Program. There is adequate capacity in the local (mainly Hanoi-based) engineering consultancy sector
for feasibility study and design of these investments and in the contracting sector for construction.
However, it is clear from observation of existing and recently built infrastructure that flaws in design
and poor quality of construction can occur in some cases. Technical failures could arise from
inadequate technical studies and design, particularly for the larger and more complex sub-projects;
from use of standard designs that are not appropriate to the local circumstances and from poor
contract management and construction supervision practices. Technical failures are likely to be
associated with weaknesses in institutional relationships and procedures as much as with lack of
technical capacity in the narrow sense.

F. Description and Assessment of Program Expenditure Framework
Program Budget Structure and Classifications

196.    Program expenditures are estimated to total US$300 million. US$280 million will constitute
the performance-transfer system and finance infrastructure investments specified in the investment
menu. This includes US$50 million in counterpart contributions from the participating cities. US$20
million will support MOC activities and results directly linked to the execution of the Program.




                                                  45
197.     The performance-based transfers, along with contributions from the participating cities, will
fund the construction of local infrastructure, social and environmental related studies, compensation
costs, sub-project management, and operation costs associated with management of the infrastructure
investments. At the national level, expenditures will include Program administration, capacity
development activities implemented by MOC (primarily through specialized consultants), and
verification audits undertaken by the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV).

198.    The Cities have prepared sub-project lists indicating the cost of each sub-project broken down
by construction, preparation and supervision, resettlement compensation and other costs; together
with indicated time required for preparation and for construction and projected start dates. Table 12
shows projected expenditures by year based on the sub-project plans prepared by the cities.

 * Expenditures by cities include recurrent expenditures associated with sub-project management. Vietnamese public sector
 accounting practices require these costs to be included in sub-project cost estimates and budget provisions.


Program Financial Sustainability and Predictability

Framework for Assessing Program Financial Sustainability and Predictability

199.     The participating cities, with the exception of Th i Nguyên, rely on transfers from central
State budget revenues to fund a large part of their recurrent spending (typically around 50 percent)
and have almost no ability to mobilize capital funds at the city level. The draft sub-project lists imply
that substantial amounts of counterpart financing will be required in some cities. About 83 percent of
the sub-project financing needs will be met through advances and performance-based disbursements
from the Program. Taken together with the relatively large size of some individual sub-projects, this
creates a risk that cash flow difficulties could impede implementation of the Program.

200.    The following sections focus first on assessing and identifying appropriate measures to
mitigate the risk of delays in implementation of the Program due to inadequate availability of capital
funds to complete Program activities, and second on assessing the financial impact of the Program on
the recurrent budgets of the city administrations.

                                                            46
201.     The existing framework for capital investment planning at the city level is weak, with annual
capital budget allocations not known until December in the previous budget year. This is particularly
a problem for larger sub-projects requiring multi-year implementation periods. During field
investigations for this Technical Assessment, several examples were encountered of ongoing capital
investment projects which have experienced serious delays due to non-availability of finance in
annual budgets subsequent to inception of the project. In one case, contracts were awarded in 2010
but have not yet been implemented because of lack of funds. There also appears to be a troubling
practice of pre-financing of works by contractors, who work in expectation of payment when funds
become available under a future budget. Shortfalls of cash, as compared to the approved budget, could
also occur but discussions with the city and provincial administrations did not reveal this as a serious
problem.

202.     DLI 2 “Local urban infrastructure investments delivered as per each Participating City’s
approved Annual City Plan” accounts for 67 percent of the total disbursements to the cities under
DLIs 1, 2 and 3, and is therefore a critical consideration in projecting cash flow. Achievements could
fall short of targets for this DLI if any of the following occur:
        a) Inadequate cash-flow leads to delays in inception or completion of construction works;
        b) Delays in procurement or construction for non-financial reasons; or
        c) Failure to fully comply with procedural or technical criteria for verification of a
           “completed sub-project”.

203.     In order to assess the risk of these events occurring and having a serious impact on Program
implementation, annual financing needs have been calculated based on the target implementation
dates included in the sub-project lists prepared by each city. These financing needs must be met from:
(a) advances; (b) disbursements linked to the DLIs, and (c) capital funds available to the cities from
own-source revenues or transfers from general State budget revenues. A projection of advances and
disbursements of the performance-based transfers leads to identification of potential financing
shortfalls overall and at the city level. These shortfalls can be reduced or eliminated by adjustments to
the implementation plans. The residual risk of funding shortfalls is assessed below, and measures to
mitigate this risk are identified.

205.     Each city will be entitled to receive a fixed maximum amount of disbursements each year,
subject to achieving the DLI targets. These allocations have been adjusted to assist the cities to meet
their annual cash flow needs, up to the maximum amount allocated for each city. The first verification
of results will be conducted in early 2016, so the first disbursements will be in mid-2016. Because the
most significant DLI indicator (i.e., the one linked to the largest amount of financing) is based on
completing infrastructure sub-projects in accordance with the Enhanced Annual City Plan, there can
be no certainty that these targets will be consistently achieved and so actual disbursements could lag
behind the schedule. Cities will be entitled to receive an advance of up to 25 percent their total
allocation, beginning in 2015. Table 14 shows the projected advances and disbursements to each City
on this basis and assuming that the DLI targets are achieved.

207.    Table 15 shows the difference between the estimated disbursements and the estimated total
financing needs of each City in each year. The estimated counterpart financing needs vary markedly
from year to year. Thai Nguyen is projected to need US$28.3 million of counterpart funds in 2016 and
US$10.9 million in 2017 (though these amounts will be offset somewhat by a surplus of US$5.5
million from 2015). The highest need for a single year is projected to be over US$10 million in Yen
Bai, Tuyen Quang and Hoa Binh and between US$ 5 million and US$ 10 million for the other cities.
These estimates are not out of scale with the annual capital budgets of the cities (see Section C, Fiscal
Framework, above) but careful budget planning will be needed to avoid cash flow shortages.

208.     The year with the highest counterpart financing need will vary between cities but all occur
between 2016 and 2018. It is projected that in 2020 and 2021 disbursements will exceed expenditures.
One consequence is that the cumulative maximum amount of financing that the Cities will need to
mobilize will occur in the middle years of the Program. This is illustrated in Figure 5 below. The
largest cumulative “deficit” or gap between cumulative expenditures and cumulative receipts of
transfer funds (advances and disbursements) will occur in 2019.

Potential Measures to Minimize Cash Flow Risk

209.   All cities should carefully review their implementation plans including the timing and
sequencing of sub-projects, based on a thorough understanding of the financial implications under the

                                                   49
performance-based transfer system. If necessary, MOC should engage an expert consultant to assist
the cities with this task.

210.    Based on the revised implementation plans, cities should prepare projections of their cash
flow needs through the Program period. They should also prepare detailed multi-year procurement
plans that can be used for monitoring progress and identifying promptly where difficulties may occur.

211.     Based on these projections, cities should take appropriate steps to ensure that non-transfer
financing will be available when needed. This could be achieved through mobilization of resources at
the city level (for example, Thai Nguyen raises funds for capital investments through land lease sales)
or through discussion with the PPC. The possibility of cities raising loans (short term “bridging”
finance) from central government or from banks to cover Program financing shortfalls should also be
investigated.

212.    Financing shortfalls could be alleviated by reducing the advances paid to contractors. It seems
that contractors are routinely paid advances of up to 30 percent of the contract value (20 percent was
assumed in the calculations described above). This is more than is needed to cover the contractor’s
mobilization costs and contrasts with the alternative practice of pre-financing of contracts by
contractors.

213.    Cities should ensure that adequate financing is available before proceeding with procurement.
In case of financing shortfalls, it will be preferable to delay the start of a sub-project rather than to
experience cash flow difficulties during implementation.

214.     A high quality of design work and construction supervision will be conducive to reducing risk
from cash flow shortages by ensuring that all relevant technical factors are taken into consideration in
the design and that construction is implemented to a high standard. Conversely, one of the biggest
financial risks undertaken by the cities under the performance-based transfer system is that the
verification process determines a completed sub-project to be sub-standard and thus ineligible to be
counted against the “completed sub-projects” DLI.

215.     The initial plans prepared by the cities indicate a number of large sub-projects, mostly bridge
constructions, to be completed in the final year of the Program, 2020. Disbursement of DLI-2 funds
linked to these sub-projects will fall in 2021. However, delays caused for example by unforeseen
conditions or events encountered during construction – as can occur in any construction project –
would have the effect that construction would not be completed within the Program period and thus
the allocation linked to the sub-project would not be disbursed. With this consideration, it will be
prudent for Cities to plan to complete major sub-projects by 2019 at the latest, allowing a margin of
error for unforeseen delays.

216.    An effective Program MIS will be invaluable in assisting MOC to avoid cash flow difficulties
by adjusting the allocation of available advance amounts and transfer disbursements, through the
annual budgets of the cities, in response to cash needs. An effective MIS will also allow MOC to
identify where delays or bottlenecks may occur and to provide necessary assistance to the cities to
resolve difficulties in a timely manner.

Operation and Maintenance Funding

217.     With the exception of Thai Nguyen, the cities’ own-source revenues are insufficient to meet
their recurrent expenditures and they are reliant on transfers from the province. The annual budget
plan includes funding for maintenance of infrastructure. Maintenance of urban roads is generally
regarded as a priority. However budgets are limited and some roads in the urban areas, observed
during the field visits, appear to show evidence of lack of adequate maintenance.



                                                   50
218.     Reliance on transfers for funding makes it more difficult for cities to plan essential
maintenance activities efficiently. In general, delayed or inadequate maintenance of roads and other
infrastructure will lead to higher repair costs later.

219.    The Program will result in an increase in the amount of infrastructure under management of
the city and, thus, ultimately will increase the level of maintenance expenditures required.
Maintenance costs of new infrastructure should remain low for several years and therefore this
increased maintenance burden will not be felt immediately. In the longer term, the increased
maintenance burden should be more than offset by increased own-source revenues resulting from
urban economic growth, stimulated by the Program investments.

220.    Failure to effectively manage assets will limit the impact of the Program over the long term.
While this is beyond the Program implementation period, it is no less important. However, the
Program will have limited leverage on City decision-making by this point. The focus of risk
mitigation is therefore appropriately placed on ensuring that CPCs establish a sound framework for
asset management, and are demonstrably keeping newly created assets in full service within the
Program period. These are the focal areas for the sub-indicators in DLI 3, relating to serviceability of
assets and the financing of maintenance activities respectively. In addition, DLI 3.1 requires cities to
undertake Asset Condition Assessments and develop asset management plans in the first two years of
Program implementation, prior to the subsequent inspection of asset serviceability from 2017.

221.   Capacity support will be required to assist cities to strengthen their asset management
programs, and this should be provided for in the annual Capacity Development Plan.

Adherence of Program Budgeted Expenditure and Execution to Government Priorities

222.    The Government of Vietnam is facing huge demands for urban infrastructure investment and
considers it a high priority to meet these demands in order to facilitate urbanization and continue
sustainable growth and development of the economy. Therefore, the Government has strongly
requested Bank support for investments in the seven Northern Mountains cities through the NUDP.

223.    The investments have been identified through the city master plans which have been
extensively reviewed and approved at Prime Ministerial level in the case of Thai Nguyen and at
provincial level for the other cities. The investments have also been selected from amongst master
plan projects for inclusion in the current five-year implementation plans. The criteria for sub-project
selection and prioritization determined by the Ministry of Construction in agreement with the Bank
ensure selection of the highest value sub-projects and appropriate sequencing and connectivity of
separate sub-projects.

224.     The CPC are almost entirely reliant on transfers from national and provincial level to finance
infrastructure investments. City annual investment plans and budgets are subject to approval from the
provincial level, thus providing a further assurance that planned investments adhere to Government
spending priorities.

225.     Most capital provision in the city annual budget is earmarked for specific investments and is
used for the intended purpose – the assessment did not encounter evidence of finance provided for one
purpose being diverted to another, which would entail deviation from Government-determined
priorities were it to occur. There is some evidence of the State Treasury temporarily using funds
earmarked for one purpose to cover expenditures for a different purpose, in order to ease cash flow
shortages.

Efficiency of Program Expenditures

Overview

226.    In this section the efficiency of proposed Program expenditures is assessed in terms of overall
cost-effectiveness (appropriateness of costs of infrastructure outputs) and of proposed spending on
non-construction items, mainly compensation costs.

227.    Because of the low volume of similar works previously undertaken by the cities, it is
necessary to rely mainly on the initial estimated costs and cost breakdowns provided by the cities in
the sub-project lists. Three approaches are taken to assessing the appropriateness of these costs:
comparison with the published cost norms of the Ministry of Construction for these output types; the
size of variations in unit costs between sub-projects of similar type proposed for the Program; and
comparison with similar outputs supported by other Bank projects in Vietnam.

228.    The potential impacts of the cost norm system on cost effectiveness are discussed in the light
of previous Bank experience with this system. Finally, the extent to which the use of competitive
procurement can be relied upon to ensure cost-effectiveness is discussed.

Sub-Project Estimated Unit Costs

229.    Table 16 shows calculated unit costs for each sub-project type based on the estimates and
breakdowns provided by the cities, for those sub-projects for which unit quantities were provided.
Because of the very variable nature of the outputs included in the LIA, resettlement and environment
and drainage sub-project types, the costs have been calculated by unit area.

230.    These average figures appear reasonable for the road, bridge and buildings. The level of
expenditure on the LIA, for providing basic infrastructure to high density residential areas, is quite
modest.

231.     The investment in developing the resettlement areas is quite high – about US$0.5 million in
total, but this would probably represent only about 10 percent of the cost of constructing housing on
the sites, which appears reasonable. However the sub-project data submitted by the cities show
notably limited information about the resettlement areas (number of households to be accommodated
etc.) and the value for money of these investments should be re-examined carefully at the feasibility
study stage.

232.    The average figures conceal significant differences in unit costs between very similar sub-
projects. For example, estimated construction costs of major bridges vary between US$1,165 and
US$3,063 per square meter. Similar variations are found for other sub-project types. Some variation is
expected according to the local situation (some of the bridge sub-projects include approach roads, for
example) but the size of the variations still appears larger than would be expected given that the
estimates are supposedly based on MOC unit cost norms. This gives rise to the concern that final costs
may vary significantly from these estimates.

Use of MOC Cost Norms

233.    The Ministry of Construction publishes output-based unit cost norms for estimating the costs
of different types of construction, as well as detailed input-based norms based on quantities of
different types of construction work for use in estimating costs based on final designs. Initial cost
estimates are derived from the output-based norms while final cost estimates, following detailed
design, are based on input costs.

234.     The use of cost norms should provide a reliable basis of comparison with estimated and actual
sub-project costs and should in principle assist in ensuring that construction costs are not excessive.
However, there is some concern regarding the accuracy of the cost norms in use. There is also the risk
that a cost estimate based on cost norms can become a “floor price” even where the efficient cost
based on market prices of construction labor, materials and equipment might be less. The Technical
Assessment for the Rural Water Supplies PforR Program i n Vietnam commented on this point: “The
use of published construction cost norms provides bidders with clear guidance on the maximum bid
that will be deemed compliant. Although this puts a cap on costs, when combined with a process that
underutilizes fully open and competitive bidding (by overusing shopping as a procurement method) it
also tends to put a floor on them. The IDA-funded, on-going, Red River Delta RWSS Project provides
evidence that the cost norms and procurement practices may be a source of inefficiency.”

                                                           53
235.    There is a concern that cost norms applied to recruitment of consultants are much lower than
market rates. This will make it difficult to recruit consultants with sufficient capacity and may lead to
consultants failing to carry out all necessary design or construction supervision procedures in an effort
to economize on time.

Competitiveness of Procurement

236.     Because of the larger size of the sub-projects, use of shopping as a procurement method will
be less of an issue in the RBNUDP-NM than in the RWSS PforR Program referred to above. Only
around 15 out of 88 works procurement packages are likely to fall below the existing threshold for
competitive tendering, and it is expected that under the new Procurement Law the threshold will be
lowered so that virtually all works contracts will be competitively tendered (see Fiduciary Systems
Assessment). However, the tender evaluation procedures in use by the cities have the effect of
eliminating the majority of tenders submitted on non-price grounds: either because of errors in tender
preparation which may be quite minor in some cases, or because of low scores on a technical
assessment which is subjective and liable to produce significantly variable results between individual
assessors. In most cases only one or two tenders reach the price comparison stage. In effect, there is
limited incentive for a tenderer to submit a competitive price.

237.    For this reason, the procurement process as currently applied cannot be fully relied upon to
secure the most efficient price for construction works. Improvements to the procurement procedures,
outlined in the Program Action Plan, should have the effect of improving the competitiveness of
procurement.

Comments on Breakdown of Cost Estimates

238.     The cities have provided cost estimates for the sub-projects broken down into construction
costs, costs of preparation and construction supervision, compensation costs and other costs. Table 17
summarizes the proportion of each cost category by sub-project type.

                             Table 17: Percentage of Total Costs By Type

239.    It is understood that cities have not included sub-project preparation costs in the cost
estimates as these costs will be funded by the PPTAF. On this basis, the costs estimated for
supervision seem reasonable. Excessively tight budget limits for consultant services for supervision
could lead to implementation delays or could have deleterious effects on the quality of completed
works.

240.    As expected, compensation costs are a significant component of the costs of road and bridge
sub-projects. Some compensation costs will inevitably occur in LIA schemes as infrastructure
improvements require rationalization of informal settlement patterns. It is rather more surprising that


                                                   54
compensation costs should be significant for community buildings which would normally be
constructed on existing sites.

241.     The estimated costs for the “resettlement areas” - essentially, preparing vacant land with
infrastructure so that families displaced by infrastructure schemes elsewhere can be allocated house
plots there – include a 20 percent element of compensation cost, presumably for resettling households
that are already present in these zones. This seems remarkably high and this point should be re-
examined.

Conclusion

242.    The sub-project costs available at this stage are initial estimates based on output unit cost
norms. There appear to be some inconsistencies in the application of these norms. The initial
estimates are not sufficiently reliable to be used as a basis for calculating the value of works
completed (DLI-2) and the final, input-based detailed cost estimate should be used for that purpose.
These latter cost estimates will be used for annual budgeting purposes by CPCs in any event.
Disbursements to cities will still be required to fall within the agreed annual and total envelopes for
this DLI. Any cost over-runs relative to budget figures will be borne by CPCs, who may also retain
any savings. These savings, if any, are unlikely to be significant given the application of final cost
norms and small project sizes, but will provide an incentive for cost-efficiency in sub-project
implementation in a manner that is consistent with a results-based approach.

243.     There is a risk that the final costs of sub-projects will vary considerably from these initial
estimates. This could cause difficulties both for overall financing of the Program and (even if the
overall effect of cost variations is neutral) for the cities’ cash flow planning.

244.     Cities should review the cost estimates based on the outline preliminary design proposals
which are already available in most cases. MOC should oversee this process and if necessary should
provide additional support to the cities in order to arrive at appropriate and consistent cost estimates
for the schemes.

245.   Competitive tendering procedures should be improved to ensure that there is genuine price
competition so that final construction costs accurately reflect market prices.

Program Requirements for Monitoring and Evaluation

246.     The key Program results will be monitored through annual verification audits (technical and
financial audits including verification of all DLIs by city). These verification audits will be conducted
by independent external auditors contracted by the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). Detailed
definitions of the criteria relating to fulfilment of each DLI are developed and included in the PAD
and the POM.

247.   In order to enhance transparency and to facilitate implementation and management of the
Program a management information system (MIS) should be put in place. This need not be highly


                                                   61
sophisticated – as there are only seven cities implementing sub-projects; either a system based on
proprietary software or a system of standardized information regularly entered in spreadsheet format
and compiled at national level should be sufficient. This will allow the cities to track progress against
annual plans and will allow the MOC to monitor overall progress, to assess capacity developed and to
identify management or capacity development interventions that may be needed in a timely manner.

248.  The MIS should also be used for tracking results indicators, particularly those that are not
DLIs.

249.    At a minimum, the MIS should track progress in the following areas:
    a) Annual City Investment Plans and implementation;
    b) Technical and impact data per sub-project;
    c) Procurement planning and implementation;
    d) Staffing and capacity development of key units of the city administrations;
    e) Records of public consultations; and
    f) Records of complaints received and responses.

250.  Operation of a basic Program MIS will require specialized M&E staff located in the city
PMUs and adequately trained to carry out their functions.

Existing M&E Capacity of the Cities

251.    The city PMUs do not currently have specialized M&E staff. There does not appear to be a
systematic procedure for electronic tracking of plans, budgets or sub-projects implemented, or for
compiling information on sub-projects of the NUDP at national level in MOC. Present M&E practices
rely mainly on narrative reports.

252.   At present there is only limited capacity to assess the impacts of completed infrastructure
investments and to use the insights gained to improve future planning.

Strengthening M&E Capacity

253.    Efforts to strengthen M&E capacity under the Program should focus on the following areas:
    a) Better tracking of achievements against annual investment plans and procurement plans,
       based on a simple MIS;
    b) Tracking of key transparency indicators including public consultations and complaints
       procedures; and
    c) Establishing a specialist M&E capacity within the CPC, either in the PMUs or in another
       appropriate unit.

254.    It is recommended that the CPC should carry out, with suitable technical support, an
evaluation exercise as part of preparation for the Program mid-term review. A major focus of this
evaluation will be a simple impact assessment of the completed infrastructure sub-projects and lessons
learned for future planning and sub-project preparation.

H. Program Economic Evaluation
Rationale for Public Provision and/or Financing

255.     The infrastructure outputs of the Program are public goods that are unlikely to be attractive
investments for private investors. The types of infrastructure: mainly urban roads and bridges,
improved infrastructure in low income residential areas, and drainage and environmental
improvements are not suitable for a user fee-based financing model. The sub-project selection criteria
specifically exclude investments providing a direct commercial benefit to a private interest that would
as such be suitable for private financing. The economic benefits of the investments will stimulate
private investment in the productive economy as well as facilitating an orderly increase in the urban
population and these effects will lead to increased revenues for the city administrations.

Economic Impact of the Program

256.    The tangible economic benefits of the Program are expected to arise mainly from investments
in roads and bridges, resulting in reduced journey times and vehicle operating costs within the urban
areas of the participating cities, reduced accidents, as well as reduced congestion and improved access
from the urban areas to the highway network. Improvements in surface water drainage will also
reduce traffic congestion caused by surface runoff or river flooding.

257.   Investments in improved drainage, environmental improvements, local infrastructure in low
income residential areas and social infrastructure will result in intangible economic benefits through
improved living conditions for urban residents.

258.    The integrated package of investments in economic and social infrastructure will stimulate
private investment by reducing costs of doing business in the cities, improving transport links,
developing access to land for industrial and commercial investment and increased attractiveness of the
urban environment.

259.     Urban economic growth stimulated by the Program investments will create employment
opportunities for poor and low-income citizens of the participating cities and also of the surrounding
rural areas. The participating cities serve as hubs for transport, trade in inputs and services for the
rural economy and concentration points for rural produce as well as representing a significant end user
market. Development of the cities will improve access to services for both urban and rural residents.
Therefore, the Program investments are expected to foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
Through the focus on low income area improvements and community services, poor and low income
urban residents will receive a high proportion of these benefits. Therefore the Program is expected to
have a direct, though unquantified, impact on poverty.

World Bank Value Added

260.    The Bank’s urban program in Vietnam has been successful but piecemeal. The mostly “retail”
approach is no longer sustainable as current engagement spans about 30 cities. It has also been
effective at focusing on infrastructure expansion but less so on institutional development and urban
management.

261.    The Government is facing huge demands for urban infrastructure investment, with
particularly acute needs from cities in the Northern Mountain region. The government’s ability to
meet these demands is constrained not only by the availability of finance but also by limitations in the
capacity of the city administrations to effectively plan and implement investments. The Bank’s
engagement will assist the Government to introduce a results-based implementation framework to
strengthen arrangements for infrastructure planning, appraisal, implementation and monitoring
alongside effective urban management and supervision systems. Key dimensions of this approach are:

                                                  63
(a) rewarding performance through a results-based financing approach that provides an incentive to
encourage cities to strengthen their own planning and implementation capabilities; (b) clarifying roles
and responsibilities for infrastructure delivery; and (c) providing a simple and replicable
implementation framework.

Results of Economic Evaluation

262.     The Program sub-projects involve seven cities and a considerable variety of infrastructure
types. Even within the main types the economic benefits will vary, for instance, according to the type,
purpose, and existing situation of each road or bridge investment. A cost-benefit analysis was
conducted for 78 of the proposed sub-projects related to Low Income Area upgrading, environment
sanitation and drainage improvements, road rehabilitation/upgrading and bridge construction in the
seven cities, accounting for about 85 percent both in terms of the number of sub-projects and project
cost. The activities not evaluated include undergrounding power-telecommunication lines,
kindergartens, and resettlement areas. The results of this analysis should be considered as
supplementing the qualitative description of economic benefits presented above.

263.     The analysis is based on the incremental benefits and costs of the sub-projects to society as a
whole for the Low Income Area upgrading and environment sanitation and drainage sub-projects, and
on the comparison of sub-project costs and benefits in “with” and “without” cases for road and bridge
sub-projects using the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) indicators to
justify the economic viability for a period up to 2039, allowing for a 3-5 year construction period
starting in 2015 and a benefit period of about 20 years. The robustness of economic feasibilities of
sub-project components was tested through sensitivity analyses that reflect the inherent uncertainties
in all cost and benefit estimate inputs to the analysis.

264.    The majority of investments (about 64 percent) are in roads and bridges which are the types
for which economic benefits are most readily quantified. The RED23 and HDM424 models have been
used to estimate internal rates of return for these sub-projects. Quantified benefits include (a) vehicle
operation cost (VOC) savings; (b) VOT (time value) savings; and (c) accident cost savings. In
addition to these quantified conventional benefits, most sub-projects will also improve drainage and
landscape, as well as result in land price appreciation. These have not been included in the evaluation.

265.    VOC units were computed using the World Bank’s HDM4-VOC model. Figures on vehicle
operation and characteristics are based on recent projects such as MCDP and SCDP.

267.     Reductions in truck travel times are also a measurable benefit of transport projects. Reduction
of travel time can be translated into reduced working capital, fleet investment, disruption to
production or spoilage or damage of perishable goods. However, these savings were not accounted for
in the analysis.


268.    Accident costs are based on the values provided in the 2012 Implementation Completion and
Results Report for the World Bank Vietnam Road Safety Project.

269.     In regard to travel forecasting, the RED model evaluates benefits accruing to: (a) normal
traffic; (b) generated traffic; (c) induced traffic; and (d) diverted traffic in dry and wet seasons
depending on the nature of the proposed sub-projects (i.e., new construction, rehabilitation,
maintenance, etc.). The base traffic in 2013 was derived from the benefited population, typical
composition of modes, and average trip factor25 in northern cities in Vietnam.

  Trip rates and modal shares are taken from the JICA comprehensive surveys for master plans and other local
studies on urban transport development in Vietnam.

270.    For the Low Income Area upgrading and environment sanitation and drainage improvement
sub-projects, the MCDP, DPIIP and SCDP models were employed. Works in these categories are
expected to reduce travel time and improve road safety for low income urban citizens; to improve
public health with the benefits of reduced health expenditures and increased productivity and to
reduce costs of damage and other economic loss due to flooding. There will be savings in drainage
maintenance costs. Secondary benefits will include an increase in land prices and increased
employment (in the construction works) for lower income citizens. The benefits quantified in the
analysis include: (a) reduced expenditures on health and increased productive working time; (b)
savings from reduced cost due to flooding; and (c) appreciation in land and property values.

271. The analyses use the unit benefits, which were updated from the recent World Bank MCDP to
2013 prices in the seven Program cities and set out in Table 23. Beneficiaries taken into the analysis
are based on the population projections of the identified catchment areas and are subject to the facility
capacity.

272.     The below table provides the summarized results of the economic analysis by proposed sub-
project and city. Overall, the conclusion is that the Program is economically viable as the IRR of the
all appraised subprojects in seven cities is 22 percent. Given that all of the sub-projects are at the pre-
feasibility study phase, the sensitivity analysis accounted for decreases and increases in the benefits
and costs of 20 percent. In the worst case scenario, the overall IRR of all sub-projects in seven cities
remains satisfactory, with the exception of the road sub-projects in Cao Bang City and the Low
Income Area sub-projects in Hoa Binh City which have IRRs that fall below 12 percent.

273.     Direct compensation costs are already included in the costs of the other sub-project types. The
resettlement area sub-projects are essentially investments in new infrastructure to improve urban
zoning and provide residents with better access to infrastructure and services and a higher quality of
life, in many cases, as compared to the locations from which the residents are resettled. Therefore
these sub-projects can be considered as having similar benefits to the low income area sub-projects,



                                                   68
over and above the component of the cost which is properly considered as a cost of the infrastructure
investment necessitating the resettlement.

274.    The benefits of the social and environmental sub-projects cannot be quantified. However the
cost control mechanisms in place for the Program including use of MOC cost norms and competitive
procurement procedures, properly applied, should give confidence of the acceptability of these
investments on a least-cost basis.

275.     Therefore the conclusion of the economic analysis is that the proper application of sub-project
selection and prioritization criteria should ensure a positive net present value. Social infrastructure
investments will deliver intangible benefits and selection of these sub-projects is taken as an
indication that the implicit value of these investments is equivalent to that of the other sub-projects.
Program cost-control arrangements are expected to deliver essential economic and social
infrastructure investments on a least-cost basis. The assessment confirmed that the Program will
reduce poverty and foster inclusive growth by (a) stimulating private sector investment resulting in
employment opportunities for residents of the Northern Mountains region as a whole; and (b) by
directly improving the quality of life and environment of citizens of low income areas of the cities.

I. Technical Risk Rating
276.     The main risks identified through the technical assessment are (a) financing risk, including
shortfalls of counterpart funding, cash-flow problems and inadequate financing of operation and
maintenance; (b) planning risk, including the selection of sub-economic investments; (c) inadequate
capacity leading to delays in implementation; (d) technical failure due to inadequate feasibility studies
and design; and (e) technical failure due to poor quality of construction.

277.     The final net amount of counterpart financing needed for the Program seems within the
capacity of the cities given the size of their regular capital budgets. However these budgets are
unpredictable in the existing framework and this leads to delays in implementation of investments.
There will be quite large variations in the amount of financing needed by each city each year. Because
the performance-based transfer system releases funds for results achieved, the gap between
cumulative expenditures and cumulative disbursements in mid-Program will be larger than the final
net amount. The risk of cash flow difficulties can be mitigated by careful planning, by strengthening
own-source revenue collection and by improving predictability of the cities’ capital budget allocations.
Cities face difficulties in adequately funding operation and maintenance at present but the net effect of
the Program is expected to improve this situation. The overall risk of financing problems impacting
on Program implementation is assessed as Moderate.

278.    The existing framework for investment planning is not adequate to ensure that available
funding is allocated to the highest value investments from amongst those available in each period. The
Program will support capacity development to improve planning procedures but in the short term will
address the problem by use of a set of pass-fail criteria for eligibility of investments. There is a
moderate risk that some sub-economic investments will be financed by the Program but, given proper
application of the eligibility criteria, the risk that the Program investments overall will be sub-
economic is assessed as Low.

279.     The Program will represent approximately doubling of the total capital spending of the cities
during the implementation period. There is a basic existing capacity for implementation of
infrastructure sub-projects, but this capacity is not sufficient to ensure efficient implementation of the
Program. The risk of delays will be mitigated by strengthening the human resources and improving
the procedures of the PMUs. The risk of significant overall delays in implementation of the Program
is assessed as Moderate.




                                                   69
280.     The sub-projects, although of significant individual size, are not technically complex and
there is adequate technical capacity, in the city PMUs assisted by expert consultants and in the
provincial technical departments with oversight responsibilities, to ensure adequate quality of sub-
project preparation and technical design. This work will be financed by the PPTAF. The risk of
failures due to poor design is assessed as Low but this risk could increase if the quality of design
consultants is insufficient, either because of weak selection procedures or under-funding of these
activities in line with MOC cost norms.

281.    Technical failure due to poor construction quality is considered a more significant risk than
poor design and should be mitigated by ensuring a high standard of construction supervision. If the
recommendations of this Assessment for strengthening contract administration and construction
supervision are implemented (i.e., improved contract administration procedures, improved supervision
procedures, improved selection of supervision consultants and stronger accountability of supervision
consultants for quality of work) the risk of poor construction quality having a significant impact on
overall Program results is assessed as Low.
