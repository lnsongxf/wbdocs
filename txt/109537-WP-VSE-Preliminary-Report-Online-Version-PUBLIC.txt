    Foreword
    Increasing access to finance for Very Small, Small and Medium Enterprises (VSEs/SMEs) has become an important
    goal for many governments and development agencies as VSEs/SMEs are viewed as main drivers of economic
    growth and creators of employment. However, a missing middle between the ceiling of MFI lending and the
    segment defined by banks as SMEs is currently underserved and in some markets even unserved, despite the fact
    that it presents a significant growth opportunity for MFIs looking to upscale and/or to grow with their best clients.


    The report presents the findings of Sanabel’s and IFC’s VSE Survey which aimed to identify what has been done
    to date to serve the VSE segment, and how successful MFIs as well as other players in the region have been in
    catering to this segment and upscaling lending activities.


    What is clear from this survey is that MFIs in the Arab World do indeed recognize the opportunity that the VSE
    segment presents and as such are interested in upscaling to serve VSEs. Several reasons have been cited for this
    interest including job creation, supporting growing micro clients and business growth opportunities for the MFIs.
    Despite the high level of interest though, efforts to target VSEs in the region have remained quite humble to date.
    Limited know how, particularly relating to product development, has emerged as the most critical internal challenge
    that MFIs seeking to target this segment face.


    While this report documents where the sector stands today in terms of serving the VSE segment, it also offers some
    lessons learned by MFIs who have already upscaled to serve VSEs from the region and beyond, which MFIs in the
    Arab World can benefit from in order to be able to better serve this segment.


    This report represents the second report in a series of leadership papers, Voices, developed by Sanabel, the
    Microfinance Network of Arab Countries, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

institutions1 (MFIs) in the Arab World have started

2. Definitions
What is a VSE? Defining a very small enterprise is challenging -- a consensus definition has
yet to be created. In general, the VSE segment can be seen as a segment that overlaps with
the upper micro- and lower small enterprise segments, as shown in Figure 1.


According to the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX),                                             the lowest income (average loan balance is about 10 percent
microfinance loans are loans whose average outstanding balance                                        of GNI per capita). Given these considerations, the definition
does not exceed 250 percent of the average income per person                                          proposed in this paper is that a VSE loan is a loan that has an
(GNI/capita). But looking at the current average MFI loan                                             average loan balance from 25-250 percent of GNI per capita

Notes:
- Cap on loan size for MFIs is based on microfinance laws in respective countries
- In Tunisia, the ceiling presented here is that placed on NBFIs. NGO MFIs may only disburse loans up to $2,500
- GNI per Capita data is extracted from World Bank Database

    	 While this is applicable to the MFBs regulated by the Central Bank, it does not apply to the MFIs registered with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. However, the average loan
      size of these NGOs and companies have been very small compared to those of MFBs as a result of self-imposed caps.
6
    	In Lebanon, while there is currently no microfinance law or regulations, the Central Bank defines small (microfinance) loans as loans up to $7,000.
7
    	While the ceiling on loan size in Bahrain appears to be the highest in absolute terms, it is in fact the lowest when we calculate the ceiling as a percentage of GNI/capita.
8
    	These values are approximate based on FX rates as of 29 January 2016.
9
    	The cap on loan size in Yemen is based on the minimum capital requirement for microfinance banks. A microfinance bank can increase its loan size by increasing its capital.

     	In most cases if a definition exists, it is specifically for micro and small enterprises and not very small enterprises. Annex 3
      presents some of the currently existing definitions in the different countries covered in this report.

     	This is a broad range which is expected to differ by country. Table 6 in Annex 2 presents suggested range by country. However, for the purposes of simplification, this definition will be
      used throughout the remainder of this paper.

      considered a “survival strategy” for poor households.

3. Why should MFIs target the VSE segment?
Market Opportunity: In the Arab World, serving the VSE segment represents a substantial
market opportunity for MFIs. A 2008 IFC study developed by McKinsey estimated that the
Arab region had about five million VSEs. As shown in Figure 3 below, only 10 percent of them
are well-served, leading to a credit gap of roughly $13.5 billion (McKinsey Data for IFC, 2008)14.


These statistics do not take into account informal VSEs, which                                                financing to unregistered businesses. In some of these markets,

countries, regulations prohibit banks from extending business


14
     	The data shows the percentage of enterprises who are well-served, under-served, unserved or not interested for each segment. It must be noted here that the authors considered
      enterprises classified as ‘micro’ and ‘very small’ in the initial dataset as ‘VSEs’ and enterprises classified as ‘informal’ as ‘micro’. The reason for this reclassification is that, according to the
      survey, micro enterprises are formal enterprises with 0-4 employees and very small enterprises are formal enterprises with 5-9 employees. However, in practice, micro enterprises tend
      to be informal and do not have additional employees whereas VSEs have a higher degree of formality and a few employees. The definitions used throughout the study are as follows:
     • Well-served: Enterprises that need credit and have access to it
     • Unserved: Enterprises that need credit but don’t have access to any form of credit
     • Underserved: Enterprises that need credit and find financing as a constraint i.e. do not get access to desired credit.

continues to suffer from high unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy,                                  micro clients
particularly in rural areas. Observers widely agree that financing
VSEs and supporting entrepreneurship can create jobs for little
cost and spur empowerment and economic development, given
their potential to generate employment at a lower capital cost.
It is also believed that the development of such enterprises can
play a critical role in social inclusion and reduce political unrest.                                       2

Client Retention: Serving the VSE segment enables MFIs to support
micro clients along their growth trajectory. This allows MFIs to                                   6
support job creation and retain their best and most loyal clients
-- those who have shown potential to grow and may have already
outgrown the typical smaller loans.                                                                                                   2

existing micro- clients, but rather to entirely new clients. As
shown in figure 5, less than a quarter (24 percent) of responding
MFIs believe that existing clients make up more than half of their
VSE portfolio. This is an interesting result given that “following
growing micro clients” was identified by respondents as one of the
main reasons MFIs target VSEs. This suggests there are different                                           1%-5%         6%-10%           11%-20%

graduating their clients – or proactively, as outlined in Box 1.




        Box 1: Serving VSEs: Proactive vs. Organic Models
        MFIs generally follow two types of business models when moving into the VSE segment. The first is the

        Proactive Model, which borrows from the know-how and processes typical in banks, including those

        that have downscaled to VSEs. It is more complex and in many ways more deliberate in that it requires

        important structural decisions and adaptations from the start.



        The alternative model is the Organic Model, which is relatively self-explanatory. This shift is often a reaction

        to a trend observed as an MFI’s microenterprise portfolio begins to grow, as larger clients require larger

        loans and even resort to other financial service providers if MFIs are unable to meet their needs. Both

        models are common today, and we also see hybrids that borrow practices from both to help balance the

        trade-offs between efficiency and depth. See Figure 6.

     Repayment would typically be $10 per week for 11 weeks. Given the high APR (83%) and the automated disbursement process (no loan officers), the operational cost is minimal and
     the profit margin is very high, allowing the mobile company to absorb some defaults. If the client pays back on time, then s/he is offered a bigger loan.

        Box 2: How Digital Models Can Disrupt Conventional Microfinance

        The Case of M-Shwari: M-Shwari is a combined savings and loan product launched in Kenya in November 2012.

        It is a collaboration between the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) and mobile network operator Safaricom,

        through its mobile money service, M-PESA. The M-Shwari account is issued by CBA but must be linked to an

        M-PESA mobile money account provided by Safaricom. The only way for a client to withdraw or deposit money

        is via the M-PESA wallet.

        The Case of Cash Credit: Cash Credit is a non-banking financial institution founded in 2011 in Bulgaria that

        partners with mobile network operators to offer micro financial services to mobile subscribers. The company

        uses an innovative, proprietary credit scoring approach to offer consumers rapid credit decisions with convenient

        service and billing through partner operators. Cash Credit offers loans from BCN 200- 2000 (approximately

        $110-1,100) for 1-18 months. Approval is given within six minutes, disbursement is immediate and repayment is

        available through five different channels.

So what are the main reasons MFIs in the Arab World serve                that the most important reason for serving this segment was
VSEs? The results of the survey show that many MFIs who have             job creation (19 MFIs, or 76 percent of the sample), followed
begun serving this segment have done so for some of the reasons          by business growth opportunities (17 MFIs, 68 percent) and
mentioned above. When asked, as clear in figure 7, MFIs stated           following micro clients over time (15 MFIs, 60 percent).

4. What do VSEs need?
When asked in the survey what services are most needed by VSEs, Figure 8 shows that MFIs
have pointed to short-term and long-term loans with little emphasis on other products or
services. Of course, given the regulatory framework that has historically limited the legal
structure of most of the responding MFIs to credit-only institutions, micro and VSE loans are
typically the only products these MFIs are able to offer.

     Interestingly, the majority of MFIs believe that their offerings                                           the identification, understanding, and design of these products is

     	 In fact, research has shown that not only do very small enterprises need an array of products and services besides credit, financial institutions that effectively target these segments
       typically start with payments and savings products as the transaction decision point is simple and low risk. Furthermore, these products and services provide a higher financial return
       for the financial service provider when compared to credit products.

   Box 3: Credit Bureaus and Moveable Asset Registries

   Credit bureaus play an important role in helping small and very small businesses access financing. Reliable credit

   information on individuals and small businesses helps lenders reduce the uncertainty typically associated with

   lending, as reliable credit information allows financial institutions to reduce risks, loan processing times, costs,

   and most importantly default rates. In addition, detailed credit information also benefits small businesses as

   it often leads to lower interest rates, making loans more available and more affordable. Credit bureaus also

   support responsible lending practices and help borrowers avoid over-indebtedness.



   Collateral provides the basis for free-flowing credit markets, reducing the potential losses lenders face from

   non-payment. While land and buildings are widely accepted as collateral for loans, the use of movable collateral

   is also important as it allows businesses to leverage their assets into capital for investment and growth, making

   it easier for smaller businesses to access finance.



   While these mechanisms are important for MFIs seeking to serve the VSE segment, their presence depends on

   having effective regulations in place to support them. Unfortunately, in the MENA region, many countries still

   do not have such regulations in place. But in the absence of such mechanisms, some national microfinance

   networks have been working to establish information exchange platforms for their members. Although this

   may not be an ideal solution, it is a positive step in offsetting the obstacles posed by the lack of credit bureaus.

     	 While it is not essential for VSE loan officers to focus exclusively on VSE loans, it is essential that they be appropriately trained to undertake VSE lending.
23
     	 This is usually not the case with a micro business where the borrower has very little capital. Whatever capital is available is typically working capital.
24
     	Indeed, many institutions no longer insist on clients having a business as a condition for a loan and in some MFIs/Markets, it is estimated that more than 50% of the microloans
      disbursed are used for consumption purposes.
25
     	Theoretically, this should be the case in a micro-loan, but in reality, a good percentage of those loans do not rely on the capacity of the business to generate enough profit and cash to
      pay back the loan. This is because most households have multiple income sources and are capable of repaying the loan even if their micro business is weak. This is why in most of the
      cases we find that the amount of the micro- loan exceeds the amount of the assets of the micro- business and while officially the loan is taken for the business, in many cases, some
      or part of the loan is used for consumption.

6)	 In VSE lending, with larger exposures, MFIs typically want to                                            resulting from such default28. An MFI may gain a competitive

        for micro- loans. MFIs developing such a product need to                                             them as a service to clients. In general, collateral should be

               Box 5: Collateral
               Collateral is something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in the event of a default

               Collateral is more important in VSE lending than in micro lending because:

                  •	 Higher repayment amounts are more difficult to collect from VSEs than in micro lending, even if the client is

                     willing to pay

                  •	 Business may not be able to rebound quickly when they are in distress

                  •	 Given that in micro lending individual loans are smaller and interest margins tend to be higher, it is possible

                     to write-off a larger number of micro loans and remain profitable. In the case of VSE lending, where not only

                     are loans larger, but margins are typically smaller, writing off individual loans will have a greater impact on

                     profitability.



               When analyzing collateral, the following points need to be taken into account:

                  •	 Collateral coverage: This covers the capital, interests and recovery costs (120-150 percent of the loan). If a

                     large proportion of this is not easily liquidated, it is better to have lower coverage with higher liquidation

                     value. Trusted repeat customers can get lower coverage requirements.

                  •	 Choice of collateral: which depends on i) what is permitted as collateral under the local legislation and ii) 	




26
     	In micro- loans, MFIs tend to focus follow up on delinquent loans only.
27
     	 Based on the results of the survey, MFIs are requiring additional and firmer forms of collateral from their VSE clients. These include physical assets, letters of guarantee, real estate
       guarantees, and deposits/cash.
28
     This means that risk and financial analysis are even more important for VSE/SEs than in microfinance.



                                                                                                                                                                                                   23
              the probability that the collateral can be sold when needed. The choice of collateral of VSE clients is wider

              than that of micro- enterprises, but not always abundant. In VSE lending, we usually find the following

              categories: business assets; vehicles; guarantors; mortgages; deposits; household assets (excluding vehicles);

              bonds and post-dated cheques. Given the advantages and disadvantages of the different collaterals, it is good

              to envision a mix, where it is possible. It is also possible to collateralize goods that are part of the investment

              purpose of the loan, if appropriate control and monitoring mechanisms are in place.

           •	 Collateral evaluation: Though it is possible to use external evaluators (very costly for the customers) to

              conduct a collateral evaluation, for most VSEs, the collateral amounts are too small to make external

              evaluators worthwhile. At the same time, loan officers are biased and may also over-value collateral, and in

              many cases they may not have the expertise to assess the right value. While this bias and lack of expertise

              may do only marginal damage in microfinance, in VSE finance, the damage can be major due to the amounts

              at stake and the reputation of the MFI.

           Some ways to overcome the dilemma are:

           •	 Have some internal personnel trained to do the evaluation

           •	 Have the loan officer’s evaluation validated by an independent internal evaluator, although this can be

              challenging in a large branch network

           •	 Train the loan officers and supervisors and conduct peer evaluations with respective portfolio responsibility

           •	 Have reference list for ranges of collateral value for common collaterals



           Before considering an item as collateral that the institution is not familiar with, it is important to know:

           •	 The legislation and the procedural requirements

              - 	 There are different formalization and registration procedures for different types of collateral. These include

                 how and where the collateral is to be registered, how much time is needed for registration, how much

                 registration costs and who pays the registration fee.

              - 	 There will also be specific requirements for specific types of collateral. For example, does the person signing

                 a mortgage contract need a power of attorney from the Board of Directors

           •	 The evaluation process requirements

              - 	An internal evaluation process is required that conforms to local standards and legislation

           •	 Staff are appropriately trained and have current information

              - 	Staff need to know how to analyze collateral and any changes in legislation that may affect this

              - 	Staff need to keep customers informed so as to avoid surprises, particularly in terms of cost or timing

           •	 Respect all legal requirements

              - 	Whilst legal requirements exist in micro lending, but the power asymmetry in VSEs may lead towards VSE

                clients having more difficult attitudes regarding their obligation towards financial institutions

              - 	All MFIs are required to observe legal requirements. However, when lending to VSEs, reputational and legal

                risks become more significant

               Box 6: Loan Approval Processes
               For microloans, speed of service is key. As such, loan approval is generally decentralized. For very small micro loans,

               senior loan officers or credit committees comprised of several loan officers may even have approval authority.

               For larger micro loans, loan approval often requires branch manager signoff. However, for VSEs, full autonomy

               for loan approval should generally not rest at the branch level, despite potential reductions in the agility of loan

               disbursement. If they do not already exist, an MFI should establish different levels of loan approval based on loan

               size and segment served. It is best that for larger loans such as VSE/SE loans, loan decisions are made through

               the presentation of comprehensive loan files to credit committees that include senior management as well as

               branch staff, whose incentives are not linked to approval amounts. (IFC, 2014)

8)	 It is crucial that during this process, MFIs strike the right                                       support VSE officers and have ownership of the VSE portfolio

        to be too busy to review every VSE loan, especially beyond                                      history, which makes it more difficult to assess the risks associated

7. Concluding Remarks
Based on the results of the survey, it appears that MFIs in the Arab World are interested in
upscaling to serve the very small enterprise segment. Several reasons have been cited for
this interest, including job creation, supporting growing micro clients, and business growth
opportunities for the MFIs. Despite the high level of interest, however, efforts to target VSEs
have remained minimal in the Arab region.


This is mainly due to limited know-how as the most critical          do so. Given that VSE loans carry higher risk due to their larger
internal challenge that emerged from the survey was a lack of        size, it is also essential that before approving any loan, MFIs are
capacity to develop adequate products for VSEs. However, MFIs        certain that the VSE loan will indeed contribute to the growth of
in the Arab World can benefit from the experiences of MFIs in        the business activity and income and that the loan is backed up
other regions who have already upscaled to serve this segment        by sufficient collateral. MFIs seeking to serve the VSE segment
and have accumulated enough experience in VSE lending. The           should have strong controls and risk management structures in
most critical point to remember is that a VSE loan is not simply     place, and where possible should leverage technology to strike
a larger loan. In lending to VSEs, analysis of the actual business   the right balance between prudence and efficiency. Finally, MFIs
in terms of financial analysis and risk analysis becomes even        seeking to serve the VSE segment should carefully pilot test any

Annex 1: Methodology and Respondents
SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The findings of this report are based on a survey conducted in May and June of 2015 designed to better understand how MFIs in
Arab countries have targeted the VSE/SE segments and what efforts have been made in this space thus far. The survey was sent to a
select number of MFIs via email and was broken down into three main sections. The first section was designed to collect background
information on the responding institutions. This included information on whether or not there exists a definition of VSE/SE in the
countries in which they operate and whether or not they are serving the VSE/SE segment. The second section was designed only for the
institutions who serve VSEs/SEs, with the objective of understanding MFIs’ reasons for serving VSEs/SEs, the differences they perceive
between the microfinance segment and the VSE/SE segment, the size of their VSE/SE portfolios, and the challenges and opportunities
that they face. The final section was designed for the institutions not currently serving the VSE/SE segment to better understand their
willingness to move into this space.
In addition to the survey, the authors have benefited from: multiple conversations with the leaders of many of the responding MFIs
to better understand their involvement in the VSE/SE space; discussions during Sanabel’s 11th conference and the workshop IFC
conducted on the subject prior to the conference; IFC’s study on the same subject, “Experiences of Microfinance Institutions Serving
Very Small Enterprises in Latin America;” several VSE institutional assessments and/or product development support provided by IFC
to five leading MFIs in the MENA region (in addition to IFC’s work on the topic globally); and finally CGAP’s focus note “Financing
Small Enterprises: What Role for Microfinance Institutions”, written by Glisovic and Martinez in 2012.


PROFILE OF RESPONDENTS
The survey was sent to a select group of MFIs, who are either the leading/largest MFIs in their countries and/or who are known to
have begun exploring the VSE/SE segment. Responses were received from 32 different institutions operating in ten different Arab
countries,31 and are somewhat evenly distributed by country, with a slight preponderance in Jordan and a bit less response from
Yemen, Tunisia, and Bahrain, where there are fewer MFIs operating in this space (breakdown shown below in Figure 17). In terms
of the legal structure of the responding MFIs, just over half of them (53 percent) are NGOs while about 28 percent are non-bank
financial institutions or for-profit companies. Meanwhile, 16 percent of the MFIs in the survey are microfinance banks (MFBs), but
these are limited to certain countries where regulations allow for such a legal structure - namely Bahrain, Yemen, and Sudan. Of the
32 MFIs who completed the survey, 25 (78 percent) indicated that they do serve VSEs.

     	 While this may not seem like a large number of responses, these 32 MFIs combined serve more than 75% of the region’s active borrowers, so we can consider this sample to be
       representative.

Annex 2: An Attempt to Define the VSE Segment
According to the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX), microfinance loans are loans whose average outstanding balance does
not exceed 250 percent of the average income per person (GNI/capita). As the average loan size is approximately equal to 1.67 times
the average loan balance32, one can calculate the ceiling on microfinance loans based on this definition, as shown in table 4 below.
Comparing this ceiling to the one that exists based on the current regulations, we find that the ceiling for the size of loans disbursed
by MFIs should be three to five times higher than the existing loan amount ceilings (in countries where there are specific regulations)
and, in the case of Bahrain, it should be almost ten times higher.

     cap on loan size

Notes:
- Number and value of outstanding loans are extracted from IFC’s database on MFIs in the Arab World which uses a combination of data from the MIX, data
  reported to IFC and the respective MFIs’ websites as of end of 2014.
- Ceiling based on MIX definition = 250% x 1.67 x GNI per capita to demonstrate maximum loan size.




When we calculate the current average loan balances as a percentage of GNI (table 5), we see that the average loan balance over
GNI/capita is still quite low –approximately equal to or less than 10 percent of GNI in all countries, except Palestine and Sudan33.




32
     	 Based on the assumption that the average loan balance lies somewhere between 55%-65% of the average loan size.
33
     	 Based on the data that was presented in section 5, MFIs in Palestine are some of the few in the region that have actually started serving VSEs with any significance, and this is why
       their average loan balance and accordingly average loan size is relatively higher. In the case of Sudan, the authors believe that the data is not representative as data is only available
       for two MFIs when there are several others in the market.

     GNI Capita



Given the low average loan balance/GNI per capita ratios prevalent in most countries (≈10%), which suggest that MFIs are only
targeting the very poor clients, we propose here that a VSE loan is a loan with an average loan balance/GNI per capita between 25

  One can argue why we are using the 250% figure from the MIX, which represents micro, and not taking something mid-way between micro-
and something we might have on small or SME (e.g. 100%-500% for example). However, the fact that the average loan balance in the region
as a percentage of GNI/capita is too low (≈10%) indicates that the ceiling the MIX had put for the micro definition is too high.

Annex 4: Survey Findings on MFIs that currently
do not Serve VSEs
Among the MFIs that do not offer VSE loans, there appears to be clear interest, with the majority saying that they are interested.
These MFIs expect to move into the VSE space in the next 3-5 years.
