                   Demographic, Fertility, and Education Play an Important Role in Shaping Long-run FLFP
       BOX 2.1  |  

       Several assumptions have been put forward and tested empirically in the literature to justify the observed long-term trends in FLFP
       across countries and their link with the country level of economic development. The structural transformation of the economy seems to be
       linked to the declining portion of the U curve, which explains how the move of the economy away from agriculture and industry frees some of the labor
       intensive sectors in agriculture where most of the women are employed, in the case of countries lower income levels. However, the explanation of the
       rising part of the curve relies on a more complex combination of factors. Fertility has been among the first factors to be identified (Golding, 1995) a
       factor that found consistent evidence in subsequent studies (Angrist and Evans, 1998; Bloom et al., 2009). Similarly, female education was detected
       early on as a major factor of rising FLP rates (Goldin, 1995) and found matching evidence over the years across countries.a A more controversial set
       of factors relates to culture, gender norms, and identity.
       Traditional explanations for FLFP long-run trends account only partially for observed outcomes in Morocco. While the drop in fertility
       rates and the increased educationb of the female labor force (highly correlated to each other) appear significant in determining upward trends in
       participation, other factors that should have accounted for an increase in participation—such as economic factors—do not appear to be significant.
       A potential explanation for the relative stagnation in FLFP is to be searched in the (slow) pace of structural transformation of the economy and the
       lack of expansion in sectors that have been proved critical for expanding female employment like manufacturing and services (Chapter 3 will look
       into this more in detail). A second influential factor is “culture” or social norms, which could also explain the finding that women seem to exit the labor
       force around marriage age (the cohort around 25 years of age).

       a	
            These two factors are also related to each other (female education delays marriage and pregnancies) so that identifying the specific contribution of each factor on
            FLP is not straightforward but the evidence is rather solid in determining a correlation between fertility and education and FLP cross-country and longitudinally.
            (Verme 2014).
       b	
            Moroccan women have achieved comparable results in several education and health indicators to that of women in other countries with similar income levels or
            cultural background. Morocco’s Total Fertility Rates are similar to comparable groups of countries, for both incomes level and cultural or geographical proximity
            (see Chapter 1 and Annex 1). Remarkable progress has been made in the past 4 decades, where the TFR has been decreasing more dramatically than in any other
            country or group selected as comparators. The same is true of the ratios of female to male in the different levels of education. Although Morocco’s educational
            outcomes have consistently ranked lowest among the other comparable countries and regions, there’s a steeper trend in its series that suggest convergence in
            the future. While the ratio of female to male gets smaller with advancing education levels, it grew relatively more for higher education (jumping from 20 percent to
            almost 90 percent for the tertiary level; secondary and primary ratios increased respectively from 40 percent to 85 percent and from 53 percent to 95 percent).
            Overall, these trends seem to support an upward trend in FLFP.

  BOX 2.2  |  The Effect of Marriage on Educated Women’s Labor Force Participation

  Married and educated women in urban areas are most likely not to join the labor force. As mentioned earlier, urban women’s extremely low
  participation rate explain most of the low FLFP at national leave. Furthermore, marriage has a major role in urban areas in keeping FLP rates low. The
  probability of participation for married women in urban areas is below 10 percent as compared to a probability for unmarried women of close to 40
  percent. This marriage effect is not visible in rural areas where marriage can even increase participation.
  If we consider that most women in rural areas are uneducated, we should conclude that low FLFP rates in Morocco are mainly explained by women
  in urban areas with secondary education. This group is not likely to participate mainly because of marriage and because they have an education level
  matching sectors that are not growing. In addition, educated women are likely to marry educated men who we know have done better than women
  in the labor market and may be able to support their families on their own. Married women with secondary education are often married to highly
  educated men who might be able to provide for the family without the need for additional income. This last factor, in turn, contributes to the reduction
  of the likelihood for educated women to seek employment

       Many key development outcomes depend on women’s ability to negotiate favorable intra-householda allocations of resources. There is
       sufficient evidence from rigorous studies to conclude that women’s bargaining power does affect outcomes. But in many specific instances, the
       quantitative evidence cannot rigorously identify causality. In these cases, policy recommendations can be drawn from a combination of quantitative
       and qualitative evidence.b Moreover, the literature supports the current conventional wisdom that women’s education, incomes, assets, age, marital
       status, and culture influence the dynamics of intra-household decision making (Doss, 2013, Angel-Urdinola and Wodon, 2010). The ability to make
       decisions—such as participating in the labor markets—comprises three inter-related dimensions: resources (defined broadly to include not only
       access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources); achievements (well-being outcomes); and agency (including
       processes of decision making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as negotiation, deception, and manipulation).
       Women’s agency is closely linked to gender equality and growth. Recent research focused on MENA underscores the crucial role that
       agency plays in the region. Ilkkaracana’s (2012) examination of aggregate employment data in the 1955–2009 period, as well as household survey
       data for 1988, 2000, and 2008 and qualitative data from a 1997 field study, shows that absence of alternative to males as the sole breadwinner
       resulted in the institutionalization of the gendered labor division and roles as binding constraints on female labor supply. The prevalence of informal
       sector employment and absence of family friendly policies such as paid work or family reconciliation measures further suppress women’s labor
       supply response, but social conservatism is a more limited constraint. Nevertheless, women’ desire for increased autonomy emerges as the primary
       motivation for entering the labor market. Using the Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000) identity economics approach, Caris and Hayo (2012) investigated
       the female labor market participation in the Arab region. Employing two rounds of the World Values Survey, they found that women’s labor market
       participation decisions are influenced by the importance they attach to their identity, which could be lost by taking a job outside the home. The authors
       also indicated that traditional culture manifestation is a more significant factor in female labor force participation than religious identity.

       Measuring agency
       Agency is measured in terms of the ability to make and enforce decisions relating to a specific outcome. Recent literature suggests ways
       to measure agency directly. In her review of the literature, Jejeebhoy (2000) finds the following common direct measures of autonomy: economic
       decision-making; child-related decision-making; marriage related decision-making; freedom of movement; power relations with husband; access
       to resources; and control over resources. Most commonly, researchers construct indices of each (often denoting whether the respondent has sole
       control or joint control over a range of decisions, or whether she can visit a list of places unescorted). The Oxford Poverty and Human Development
       Initiative (OPHI)’s module on agency, which draws from the indicators originally proposed by Ibrahim and Alkire (2007), focuses on indicators related
       to power over, power to, power with, and power from within, and address each in turn. Indicators for “power to” include the indicators of control
       and decision-making that have characterized most direct measurements of agency. For specific domains, like employment, the decision-making
       indicators denote the ability of respondents to make decisions (either alone or jointly), and further, whether or not they would be able to make
       decisions if they wanted to (Samman and Santos 2009). This is the concept of agency used in this chapter.

                                                                                                                                            (continued on next page)


     in meeting family expectations. Moreover, women                                   shows the extent that household members, especially
     with more education feel a stronger urge to work to                               fathers and mothers, influence women’s agency in oth-

  BOX 2.3  |  Agency and Economic Empowerment Start in the Household (continued)

  Data and indicators used in this chapter define “Agency in employment.” The analysis presented in this chapter builds on the 2010 Morocco
  Household and Youth Survey (MHYS). The MHYSc [see Annex 2.2] is a survey conducted in 2009–2010 (La Cava et al. 2012) and contains standard
  labor market–related statistics typical of a standard labor force survey, The survey data is uniquely suitable for analyzing agency because it contains
  a separate section about Women in Decision Making, covering all women aged 15–49. The questionnaire contains questions about “Who in your
  household decides” about women’s schooling,d whether women can seek or remain in paid employment, how to spend their own income, choice of
  husband, and age of marriage. Additionally, among women who are not in paid employment or are not seeking work, the survey asks the reasons why
  they are not actively seeking paid employment. Based on the above framework, the MHYS data are used to create measurement of agency: dummy
  variables (whether women have full control in their decisions) and ordinal categorical variables, consisting of an arbitrary scale of women’s agency
  in each dimension. They are coded from the worst (code 1) to best (code 4)e in which only the relative ranking is important. To explain female labor
  force participation in Morocco, the analysis will emphasize decisions about employment. Other types of decisions about women will be analyzed as
  well, to the extent that they can help explain female employment.

  a	
       Not all individual decisions are made solely by the individual; intra-household decision making mechanism must be taken into account when one considers
       analyzing decisions such as the decision of women to enter the labor market. Decisions such as where to live, how to generate income, how much to invest and
       consume, and how many children to have constitute common dilemmas faced by households. The outcomes of such decisions are often linked to economic
       performance at the household level as well as in the aggregate for the country as a whole. In poor households, the intra-household dynamics of decision making
       and resource allocation may have an even greater impact on the welfare outcomes of family members. If various household members (including male, as opposed
       to female, members) have different preferences, it is expected that households will behave differently according to who controls household resources. (Angel
       Urdinola and Wodon 2010)

  c	
       It should be noted that the estimates of female labor force participation in the MHYS appears lower than the official estimates of the Morocco Employment Survey.
       For example, for all women aged 15 and above, the Employment Survey of 2009 suggests female labor force participation to be 25 percent nationally; the MHYS
       estimates it to be about 15 percent. Apart from sampling error and differences in the time periods the surveys were implemented, it is likely that differences in
       survey protocol contribute to this difference. The timing of the two surveys do not coincide perfectly; the 2009 Employment Survey covers four quarters from
       January through December 2009), while the MHYS 2009–2010 was conducted between October 2009 and March 2010. Furthermore, the questions asked to
       participants for measuring employment and unemployment are different across the surveys. For example, in the MHYS, individuals are considered employed only if
       they have worked the equivalent of one day in the last seven days, whereas the Employment survey does not have any such minimum work requirement. Also, the
       MHYS has a seven day recall period whereas the Employment Survey has a 24 hour recall period to collect employment and unemployment information. This likely
       leads to MHYS’s employment estimates, and in turn its labor force participation estimates for women being comparatively lower. (La Cava et al. 2012). Due to such
       data issues, the analysis of MHYS will not focus on the labor outcome, but on women’s ability to make decisions. However, other demographic statistics appear
       to be similar. For example, on marriage, proportions of unmarried people according to age group, sex, and location do not differ between the two data sources.
       Literacy rates from both data sources are quite similar, at 74 percent for men and 52 percent for women.

       BOX 2.4  |  Women in the Labor Force: Roles and Perceptions

       According to the findings of the interviews, women’s employability, salary, and skills are strongly impacted by cultural norms around women’s mobility
       and their capacity to access better opportunities outside the community.
       All salaried women report working for pay out of necessity, as they consider this activity less noble and adapted to a woman compared to staying
       at home. Both men and women agree that men are more deserving of economic opportunities as women are more suited for economic activities
       that help to reconcile family responsibilities and income-generating activities. All groups report family responsibility as the core responsibility for a
       woman.
       According to the informants, salaried work entails some minor and major risks, such as humiliation, fatigue, and depression as well as abuse and
       violence in some cases. Both men and women can face humiliation, but only women seem to face stigma for salaried work. The reason men do not
       encounter social stigma is because men are considered to be as the principal breadwinners and providers for the family. On the other hand, the fact
       that women are ‘obliged’ to work dangerously flags men’s inability to provide. In addition, greater agency is attributed to men than to women. Both
       men and women portray men as more capable of fighting back, quitting the job if conditions become too harsh, or even using physical violence.
       None of these characteristics is attributed to women: on the contrary both men and women often emphasize women’s docility and submission.
       Interestingly, all informants rephrase women’s labor force participation as “la femme qui sort travailler” (the woman who goes out to work) to
       differentiate the one who stays and ‘works’ at home and the one ‘who works for others.’
                                                                                Despite all odds, women accept the risks associated with work because
                                                                                their salary benefits their families and children. Rising costs for education
                                                                                and health care seem to push women to work for pay. Some women with a
                                     Public Sector                              higher education in urban areas also report what motivates them is
                                  (teachers, nurses)                            autonomy, self-esteem, and financial independence. There seems to be a
                                                                                huge divide between rural and urban areas in the profile and motivation of
                                   Care givers in the                           working women. In the light of gender norms attributed to women, there
                                     private sector                             seems to be an informal ranking among the type of jobs or type of industry
                           Manufacturing in women-only                          that are acceptable (or honorable) for women—the best option for a woman
                                     environment                                is to stay at home and having other women working for her: (i) Public sector
                                                                                work seems to enjoy greater consideration and social esteem, especially
                   Agriculture in mixed gender work (fruit picking              because they enjoy more social protection, fair contracts, and working
                 in green houses), hospitality (restaurants, cafes),            hours conciliate work within and outside the house. However, looking more
                               transport (ticket sales)                         carefully, such jobs enjoy greater consideration insofar as they constitute a
                                                                                prolongation of women’s care within the house: for example salaried work
                                                                                as teachers or nurses is highly regarded as an excellent job opportunity for
       women. (ii) Manufacturing appears a second-class opportunity but is still well regarded. Women mostly operate in the olive processing and fish
       processing industries where most of the personnel are female, including the supervisor. Some men may work in the same facility but risk is perceived
       as low because most of the time men and women perform different and separate tasks. Men also tend to be known by the women, as they often
       come from the same community and are known as family members or acquaintances. (iii) Salaried work in mixed-sex contexts and/or entailing
       interaction with the public can tarnish a woman’s honor. Some tasks in agriculture and hospitality (such as being a servant in a café or restaurant)
       imply risks of sexual harassment from male clients, stigma, and various forms of social control through gossiping and disrespect from neighbors and
       acquaintances.a All female informants operating in these industries report enduring harsh conditions such as abusive or hard language from
       colleagues or clients, and community ostracism. Neighbors’ critiques are perceived as particularly damaging if the woman’s job entails a night shift.b

       BOX 2.5  |  Curriculum Reform to Promote Gender Equality through Education

       For girls, both access to education and completion rates are not enough strong parameters to achieve their empowerment. Curricula content and
       teaching methods also play a fundamental role. In Morocco, in many traditional families, literacy practices are believed to be rather masculine. Example
       of social norms preventing girls from attending school are the fear that too much freedom engendered from education can have a negative effect
       on the girls’ sexual conduct, on her willingness to participate in the household chores, or in agricultural labor. Moreover, parents tend to invest more
       in their son’s education with a view that parental support will rather come from their sons, whereas the girls will be part of their husband’s family.a
       Social norms influence textbooks, curricular choices, the sex distribution of teachers and administrators, teacher attitudes and behavior, classroom
       and discipline practices, and the presence of violence, all of which shape opportunities for boys and girls (Connell, 1996, 2000, 2010). National
       curricula can reinforce existing social and gender inequalities by implicitly upholding traditional gender stereotypes or by disregarding the diversity of
       learning needs and learning styles among girls and boys. At the same time, schools have enormous potential to effect social change and transform
       gender relations by expanding the range of possibilities for both boys and girls.
       Gender-sensitization of school curriculum such as revising textbooks, could be a solution.b A number of countries are taking action to address these
       biases. For example, in Thailand policies have been instituted directing textbooks to be revised and all gender stereotypes to be removed. In Vietnam
       in 2009, the Vietnamese Ministry of Education, conducted a national textbook review and developed teacher-training modules to promote gender
       equality, while in Indonesia teachers are being trained in gender-sensitive methodologies to engage boys and girls.

          The obstacles to literacy are not always a factor of school coverage and curriculum inadequacy. Indeed many studies link illiteracy to “access” to education and
          poverty. The gender gap in education attainment and completion is due to poverty, to the high cost of books, clothes, and transportation. Girls’ labor is demanded
          in the house and in the fields, and parents’ opposition to their daughters’ education has in turn an effect on the girls’ demotivation. The causes of female illiteracy
          are linked to cultural, economic, and school-based reasons. Adult literacy has been designed to recover the wasted efforts of a school system failure generated by
          the lack of primary education or early removal from it. In many developing countries, these programs are addressed to women, who are the most affected by lack
          of basic literacy and numeracy skills. However, drop out rates are often very high.
       b	
          Textual analysis revealed that men occupy 65 percent of the space, whereas women only 35 percent. The predominance of masculine pronouns and verbs over
          feminine varied across the textbooks but the arithmetic section used exclusive masculine forms of the imperative such as /la:hiz/ “observe”, /fakkir/ “think”, /anjiz/
          “perform.” Such grammatical forms have a gender sub-text, which attributed superior arithmetic and cognitive skills to men. In addition, pictures associated with
          the text pointed at men as audience, thus insinuating that such skills are not suitable for women. Further, training programs are often gender neutral and focus
          exclusively on what women learn, and rarely on how they learn. In textbooks, women are cast exclusively in female traditional roles, like performing domestic
          chores, child rearing, washing, and food shopping. On the opposite men are portrayed as reading the newspaper, responding to mail, signing checks, reading for
          children. Such forms of representation implicitly infer that female literacy is less crucial for women and rather it is a masculine activity. In regards of leisure time
          and citizenship, women are never portrayed as having rest, whereas men are showcased while relaxing, doing sport, reading, weight lifting, and fishing. Women
          are exclusively portrayed in labor activities and their only involvement as citizens is in the Green March.

  BOX 2.6  |  Immobility Can Mean More Than Just Restricted Spatial Movement

  Because of greater distances and more pronounced social conservatism, gender norms are more likely to constrain women in rural areas in their
  choices of work outside home, particularly when women have to interact with men or work at night. The qualitative survey reveals social acceptability
  of women working in manufacturing sectors in sectors/areas where most of the workers are female, including the supervisor (as for instance in olive
  processing and fish processing industries). Some men may work in the same facility but it is still social acceptable because most of the time men
  and women perform different and separate tasks. Men also tend to be known by the women, as they often come from the same community and are
  known as family members or acquaintances. This however restricts access to all other types of jobs and industries where these conditions do not apply.
  A way for women to evade the restrictive “mobility” across sectors and jobs is to start a “micro-business” or home-based activities. Home-based
  micro-entrepreneurship enjoy greater social acceptance than salaried work. Since home-based work does not require too much mobility, this activity
  is perceived as less risky and more suitable for women. Clients tend to be already well known (as they oftentimes reside in the same village) and
  generally are female. The entire micro-business is interwoven around family and same-sex networks. To promote their business and purchase the
  necessary raw materials women use informal networks. Informal networks seem to operate as marketing tools; source of information and goods.
  These restrictions are true in most of the country but become particularly binding in less developed rural areas.
  Policy interventions to promote women’s agency in employment must therefore consider the stark differences between rural and urban areas to be
  effective. The analysis reported in Chapter 2 highlights areas in which urban-rural difference should be emphasized: (i) in rural areas men’s opinion,
  especially the women’s fathers or husbands, can hamper women working outside home. Therefore, the effort to address agency in employment in
  rural areas must engage men, either through outreach, advocacy, or a tailored specific component for men; (ii) agency among rural female youth is
  low despite their work in the agricultural sector: young women aged 15 to 24 do not have the agency even to spend income that they earn; (iii) the
  urban-rural differences are not uniform across the country. Policymakers are invited to consider these differences when designing programs to
  support female economic participation.

       BOX 3.1  |  The Demand Side: Do Firms Hire Women in Morocco’s Manufacturing Sector?

       Young firms in emerging sectors tend to hire more women. Analysis of firm surveys between 1995 and 2006 reveals that only one in every
       four employees in the Moroccan manufacturing sector were female. However this average hides large differences across industries within the
       manufacturing sector. Female employment shares are highest in the wearing apparel sector, where about 75 percent of workers were women,
       followed by the manufacturing of radio, telecommunications and communication equipment (58 percent), the tanning and dressing of leather
       products (33 percent), the textiles sector (33 percent), the medical and precision instruments sector (29.5 percent), etc. The sectors with the lowest
       share of female workers are concentrated in mineral and metallurgic industries such as in the manufacturing of basic metals (6.8 percent), fabricated
       metals (6.3 percent), coke and refined petroleum (5.4 percent) etc. (see Figure A3.1 in Annex 3). These results suggest that the hiring of female
       workers in the Moroccan manufacturing sector was higher in young emerging sectors (e.g. electrical, electronic, and mechanical equipment), and in
       more labor-intensive and export oriented sectors (e.g. textile, leather, and apparel sectors).
       Exporting firms hire five times more women than non-exporting firms. These ideas are tested using firm-level data; the elasticity of female
       employment with respect to total firm employment is estimated to examine the influence of firm age, size, and export-orientation on female
       employment. On the basis of these elasticities, it is possible to derive the number female jobs created as firm employment expands providing
       indications on firm level factors that influence female hiring.a Turning first to firm export status, the results show that for every 10 new jobs, non-
       exporting firms employ only 1 additional female worker on average. On the other hand, for exporting firms every 10 new jobs is virtually equally split
       between female and male hires. The results indicate that younger firms hire more female workers for each additional job suggesting that startups,
       younger firms, and emerging sectors (sectors with a high share of young firms) are more female labor intensive. For instance firms with less than 4
       years of activity employ 3.3 female workers for every 10 new jobs compared to 1.5 female workers on average among firms with 15 years of activity
       or more. Put together, the findings point to the important role of young firm and emerging sectors, and labor-intensive and export-oriented sectors
       as a source of employment for women in Morocco.
       Moroccan manufacturing jobs are particularly important sources of employment for urban women with low educational attainment. In
       urbanizing countries women tend to benefit more from growth in light manufacturing. In Morocco, about 42 percent of urban women with some
       primary schooling (and over 33 percent of urban women with no education) who work are employed in the manufacturing sector—the corresponding
       figures for rural women are respectively 6 and 3 percent only. The low educational attainment of urban women in the manufacturing sector also
       points to the low-skill activities they are engaged in. The overwhelming majority of these women (over 75 percent) are employed to perform low-
       skill tasks in the textiles, apparel, and leather sector and to a lesser extent in the electrical, electronic, and mechanical equipment industry. Among
       urban women with tertiary education, about 10 percent work in the manufacturing sector (4.2 percent in the electrical, electronic, and mechanical
       equipment and 3.1 percent in the textile, apparel and leather sector) pointing to the fact that women are under-represented in high-skill activities
       in the manufacturing sector.
       Manufacturing firms—particularly the exporting ones—have the potential to hire more women in better jobs. This will in turn also support
       firms’ productivity and growth. Exporting firms have the potential to hire more women and to grow as businesses exploit the new markets that
       are opened to Morocco by their immediate neighbors, including the EU. Women can contribute to firms’ growth if given the chance to work in the
       firms and occupy also high-skills positions (including as entrepreneurs). In turn, the growth in young and open industries within manufacturing (but
       also—sometimes even more so—in dynamics services sectors) can contribute to women’s progress in many other aspects. In East Asia, growth in
       the manufacturing sector—particularly in textile and food services industries—has increased women’s wage work and improved female and child
       health and education outcomes.




     common perception that women are not prepared or ef-                             of foreign direct investment—is also similar, though
     fective in managing a business. The presence of female                           female-owned firms have an edge. According to past
     ownership, however, remains too low for this to make                             Enterprise Surveys,54 in Morocco, female-owned enter-

  Note: The figure shows the estimated number of additional female workers hired for each 10 new jobs (in continued lines and bars) and the corresponding 95 percent
  confidence intervals (in dashed grey lines and black vertical lines). These results were obtained from the estimation of the elasticity of female employment with
  respect to total employment as specified in equation (1).

      The empirical strategy is based on the estimation of the following equation: ΔFi,st = βΔNi,st + δXi,st + αi + αs + αt +εi,st (1); where i indexes firms, s sectors and
      t years. ΔN is the change in the logarithm of total employment between t–5 and t, ΔF is the change in the logarithm of female employment between t–5 and t.
      The authors use employment changes over a five year period to smooth out short-run evolutions and capture medium to longer-run dynamics. X is a set of firm
      and sector time-varying control variables. The α’s are firm, sector and time fixed effects. The control variable X includes the following variabales: a set of dummy
      variables for variable firm age and size categories[1] at time t–5, the logarithm of firm productivity at time t, a dummy variable for the firm export status at time
      and the logarithm of 3-digit sector level Herfindahl index for sales at time t. The coefficient of interest is β and measures the elasticity of female employment with
      respect to total employment. Assuming that the share of female workers is m the number of new female jobs for each new jobs at a firm is given by β * m.

       BOX 3.2  |  Salary Gap: the Facts and the Perception

       Official data
       In 2007, the raw gender gap based on average earnings was 17 percent. Despite progress in the recent two decades (it was 56 percent in
       1991 and 28 percent in 1999), gender wage gaps remain considerable.a This gap differs widely, however, when looking across different locations
       and individual characteristics. For instance, HCP reports a gender gap on salaries of 27 percent in urban areas and 37 percent in rural areas. This
       is despite the fact that women seem to have a higher return to education than men (almost 7 percent in 2007 against 4.8 percent for men) and
       to have experienced better returns from professional experience (7.5 percent vs 6.6 percent for men, with a decrease in terms of salary after 28
       years of work, which means close to retirement). The analysis from HCP reports that only 36 percent of this gender gap in retribution is explained by
       individual characteristics, while the biggest part (64 percent) is due to pure discrimination. This discrimination is higher in rural areas (92.6 percent
       vs 44.7 percent respectively) and within primary sectors (i.e. agriculture, about 105 percent vs 64 percent and 23 percent respectively in industry
       and services). While this gap seems to have slightly diminished in the past 16 years, it still remains wide and not justified if not from a pure gender
       discrimination effect. In addition, the portion of salary gap that is explained by different levels of schooling/education attainments and professional
       experience also hides the fact that women most likely face an unequal access to education, as shown in Chapter 1.

       Perceptions
       Inequality of opportunity and gender-biased norms are behind wide gender gaps in wages and salaries. Men enjoy greater freedom of
       movement (both geographically and in terms of jobs) compared to their female counterparts. This has a direct impact on the salary gap between
       men and women, girls’ school completion rates (especially in the rural areas), and women’s capacity to access quality jobs. Salary gap reports
       indicate that women earn between 30 and 50 percent less than men—depending on the sector—for the same job and the same qualifications. In
       agriculture, for example, for the same task women earn 50 percent less than men. In some cases, the salary gap is harder to assess because men
       and women occupy different sectors/industries. A woman employed as a worker in a factory, in agriculture, or as a domestic helper earns on average
       40–50 dirhams per day (between US$5 and US$6).
       Among the reasons that justify such discrepancy, informants quote:
       •	   Women’s lack of mobility and lack of better opportunities. Women cannot look for better jobs in bigger centers and access better opportunities;
       •	   Women cannot negotiate their salary;
       •	   Lack of legal protection, lack of formal contracts offered to women;
       •	   Double burden as the care responsibility within the family remains unchanged for women; and
       •	   Constraints to women mobility at work: women cannot work after 5 pm.
       On the other side, low salaries for women are justified as follows:
       •	   Work for less money. Men can refuse a lower salary because their honor can be tarnished if they get paid like a woman. Moreover, they ‘deserve’
            a better salary since they are the principle breadwinners and perform physical tasks that women cannot do;b
       •	   Women work more than men, endure fatigue and humiliation, and take breaks less often;
       •	   Do not protest and accept all tasks with docility; and
       •	   Are more loyal and accountable for their jobs.

       BOX 3.3  |  Women and Micro-Finance in Moroccoa

       Women entrepreneurs in Morocco tend to use micro-finance as a last resort. This indicates a negative perception of this type of financial service: it
       is often perceived as too costly (the interest rates are too high); the conditions are too stringent and do not match with the uncertainty coming from their
       economic activity (which is often seasonal and subject to fluctuation). Some women report having resorted to micro-finance to pay utility bills, get a lump
       sum during inactivity or unemployment, or, more rarely, to finance an investment. Most of women’s experiences appear to be mixed or negative in this field.
       Women who resorted to micro-finance by necessity reported the feeling of undertaking a risky activity, as they feared punishment and
       imprisonment for their inability to repay. Debt in traditional society appears as something as potentially ‘dishonorable’ as it publicly displays ‘a need’ for
       money. Further the inability to repay, despite the legal consequences, can tarnish the man’s honor as it publicly admits the husband’s inability to provide.
       Most commonly debt, and therefore microfinance liability, operates through two different gender channels in Morocco: the woman—after consulting
       her husband—asks for a loan and normally repays it. However, if she is unable to pay back, implicitly her liability is transferred to the husband. When
       a husband is unemployed—as in many of the cases illustrated by the interviews—and de facto the woman is the only breadwinner, asking to take
       out a loan is an even more hazardous activity for a woman. Many women feared that their inability to repay could have even harsher consequences
       over their husbands. In one case the woman seemed uncomfortable with the idea of paying interest, which is in conflict with the tenets of the Shari’a
       and reported to cast more trust in Islamic finance.
       Very few women seemed to be financially literate and using credit in the framework of business/financial planning to grow their activity. On
       the contrary, most of the women—who reported having no savings, no assets at al—used credit along with consumption smoothing during hardship.
       As Rutherford (2000) has emphasized, the poor tend to use credit as a lump sum that operates as substitute for insurance, as well as savings.

  BOX 3.4  |  Morocco’s Labor Code

  A comprehensive new labor law went into effect in Morocco in 2004,a offering greater protection for women in the labor market. The
  amended Labor Code raises the minimum employment age from 12 to 15; reduces the work week from 48 to 44 hours with overtime payable
  for additional hours; and raises the minimum wage by ten percent. All these features might benefit women. The Code also stipulates penalties for
  gender-based discrimination and requires equal pay for equal work. It contains gender-specific employer mandates, including:
  •	   Employer-paid maternity leave (14 weeks),
  •	   Flexibility to extend the maternity leave period if medically justified up to eight weeks before delivery and 14 weeks after,
  •	   Reduced workload for expectant mothers,
  •	   Allowance of breast feeding time in the workplace,
  •	   Childcare requirements based on the number of female employees,
  •	   Flexibility in resignation procedures for expectant mothers and possibility of requiring a longer rest period or an unpaid year-long leave,
  •	   Prohibition to end the employment contract of an expectant mother during pregnancy or during the 14 weeks after delivery,
  •	   Restrictions on work hours that apply to female employees (In order for women to work at night, transport must be available from home to the
       workplace in case public transport is not available,)
  •	   Restrictions on types of job women can perform,
  •	   Mandatory rest day for women less than 20 years old.
  While this code provides greater protection for women and ensures minimum working conditions, it may constrain their opportunities,
  because it raises the costs for firms that hire women. Restrictions on women’s working hours and types of jobs make it more difficult for firms
  to add extra shifts. Mandatory leave and rest days as well as time allowances for breast-feeding and childcare requirements incur additional costs
  when financed by firms. Evidence from studies in East Asia shows that firms respond to these mandates by substituting men for women workers,
  which reduces women’s welfare by limiting their opportunities. In Taiwan, for example, a study found that restrictions on certain types of work and
  on work hours for women significantly reduced women’s employment and actual working hours. These measures in effect impede greater gender
  equality in the labor market.
  Other provisions in the new Labor Code that are not related to working conditions can similarly work against women:
  •	   Restrictions on shift work except in enterprises whose organizational structure requires it. Flexible or shift types of work might be more practical
       for women who need to combine paid work with other duties, so restricting their ability to do shift work may restrict their ability to work in the
       market at all.
  •	   Lack of flexibility in the list of standard absences (wedding, death, surgery). As a woman is responsible for the wellbeing of the family, her
       absences might differ from the ones accepted and exceed the number of days allowed. Again, if productivity and reliability are major factors
       used to evaluate an employee,
  •	   Employee delegates within an enterprise are chosen on the basis of their age (minimum 20 years old) and duration on the job (minimum one year). As
       women tend to have less regularity in a job for the reasons seen above, they are less likely to be eligible for delegate positions. Similarly, prerequisites
       to be part of the enterprise committee and trade unions do not take into account women’s different needs and do not favor the election of women.

     The new Labor Code complies with ILO conventions and recommendations. Compared to several other MENA countries, relatively few employers in Morocco (16
     percent) consider labor regulations as a major constraint to expanding their formal employment. The skills and education of the labor force are two times a more
     significant problem than employment regulations. In 2014, Morocco will be celebrating the10th anniversary of Labor code. Up to now, no changes or amendments
     are envisaged to address the key issues mentioned earlier; however, the government envisions evaluating the new labor code and draw key impacts of these
     regulations on labor market.

       BOX 3.5  |  Regulations Can Play an Important Role in Supporting Female Economic Participation

       Reforms of the Labor Codes should be designed taking into account obstacles for female economic participation. The Labor Code reform
       has introduced greater protection for women in the labor market. The main recommendations going forward would be to introduce more flexibility
       in dismissal procedures, extending the benefits that come with fixed-term contracts, and modernizing minimum wage policy and aligning them
       with international standards.a All these potential reforms are likely to benefit women as they would tackle some of the most relevant obstacles that
       currently impede female economic participation. It is also advisable to introduce actions specifically designed to address the constraints faced by
       women. For instance in Turkey, during the 2007 reforms of the labor code, it was specifically addressed in the measure to reduce indirect labor costs
       the need to ease (and render them more cost effective and cost sharing) regulations on in-site facility such as kindergarten. This would reduce the
       cost for employers to hire more women. Specific incentives to vulnerable groups were also targeted to support women such as subsidies for new
       youth and women hires (until April 2010) consisting of 100 percent of employers’ social security contributions (at the legal minimum wage) in the
       first year, with a 20 percentage points decline per year in the subsidy in the following four years.
       Gradually integration, or at least harmonization, of the various social insurance programs while expanding coverage would benefit women
       working as domestic workers or wage employees in the agricultural sector.b The principle would be that all Moroccan residents, regardless of
       where they work, would have access to the same system under the same rules. Self-employed workers, domestic workers or wage employees in the
       agricultural sector, for instance, would also join the current system for private sector workers. Like them, they would benefit from the basic pension and
       be allowed to make additional contributions. Because it is difficult to observe their earnings—and for many, these earnings fluctuate seasonally—the
       system would give them more flexibility in terms of the level and frequency of their contributions. The contributions, for instance, do not have to be set
       up as a percentage of earnings; they can be made in absolute terms subject to a minimum floor (for example, 5 percent of the guaranteed minimum
       wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti, SMIG).

       a	
            In particular, a revised regulation should allow employers to dismiss workers for economic or technical reasons without requiring third-party authorization, while reinforcing
            controls and penalties for wrongful dismissals. This can be done if an adequate unemployment insurance program is implemented. The main condition regulating dismissal
            would be to provide adequate advance notice (for example, at least three months), a period during which the worker continues to receive his or her salary but is allowed
            to engage in job search activities. The Labor Code could also consider the introduction of a dismissal tax that is designed to internalize the social costs of making a worker
            redundant. In this case, employers would be asked to pay a given percentage of the salary of the employee who is made redundant. The revenues from this tax could be
            used to finance, in part, the unemployment insurance fund. The tax, however, should be small in order not to discourage the use of open-ended contracts.
       b	
            A reform that goes in this direction has been recently implemented by the ANPME with the introduction of the status of “Auto-entrepreneur,” allowing MSMEs
            entrepreneurs to benefit from health coverage (including family members); maternity leave; pension; and a specific and simplified fiscal policy (1 percent tax wage
            floor of the total income).
