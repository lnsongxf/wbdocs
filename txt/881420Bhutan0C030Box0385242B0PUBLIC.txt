                                      I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Bhutan
        perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Bhutan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Bhutan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Bhutan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               project/program related issues, knowledge work and activities, and
               communication and information sharing in Bhutan; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Bhutan.
       Use data to help inform Bhutan country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In May and June 2013, 205 stakeholders of the World Bank in Bhutan were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the Prime Minister; the office of
a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 132
stakeholders participated in the country survey (64% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned it accordingly or completed the
questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Bhutan; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group; the World
Bank Group’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank Group’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank Group; project/program related issues; the World Bank Group’s
future role in Bhutan; and communication and information sharing in Bhutan.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Bhutan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Bhutan is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Bhutan, and how to best achieve “shared prosperity”.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the World Bank Group (WBG), the effectiveness of the WBG, as well as the
   World Bank and IFC, staff preparedness to help Bhutan solve its development challenges,
   how well the parts of the WBG collaborate in Bhutan, the alignment of the WBG’s program
   with Bhutan’s program, the extent to which the WBG should seek to influence the global
   development agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were also
   asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which the WBG should focus its resources, the WBG’s
   greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping
   to reduce poverty in Bhutan, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate
   more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Bhutan, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Bhutan’s needs for knowledge services, the extent to which IDA and IFC meet
   Bhutan’s needs for knowledge services, the extent to which the WBG meets Bhutan’s needs
   for financial instruments, the extent to which IDA and IFC meet Bhutan’s needs for
   mobilizing financial resources, and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty-two
   development areas, such as social protection.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG knowledge work and activities, the areas on
   which the WBG should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness
   and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as working
   with the WBG increasing Bhutan’s institutional capacity.
F. Project/Program Related Issues: Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with
   statements regarding the WBG’s support to the urban and rural sectors in Bhutan, the WBG’s
   development policy credit program, and the WBG’s move to a programmatic approach.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Bhutan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the WBG should play in Bhutan’s development in the near future and how
   important a role the World Bank and IFC will play in helping Bhutan achieve its economic
   and social development goals. Respondents were also asked to indicate what the WBG
   should do to make itself of greater value in Bhutan.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   WBG’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the WBG and that the WBG is responsive to information requests.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Bhutan, with which WBG agencies they primarily work, and geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position
       For further analyses, the one respondent from a PMU was combined with consultants
        working on WBG-supported projects; respondents from bilateral agencies and
        multilateral agencies were combined; respondents from the financial sector/private banks
        were combined with those from the private sector; and the one respondent from the office
        of a Ministry was included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

       There was a strong trend for respondents from academia and research institutes to have
        the highest levels of familiarity with the WBG in Bhutan whereas respondents from
        NGOs had much lower levels of familiarity; however, this difference did not reach
        statistical significance.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Bhutan and significant, but
        smaller correlations with the WBG’s relevance to Bhutan’s development and perceptions
        of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Bhutan.

IV. General Issues Facing Bhutan

Bhutan Heading in the Right Direction

       The majority of respondents from all stakeholder groups indicated that Bhutan was
        headed in the right direction; however, respondents from academia/research institutes
        were the most likely (100%) whereas respondents from independent government
        institutions were significantly less likely (67%).

        reform efforts in the country compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.
       Respondents from NGOs were significantly more likely to indicate that the World Bank
        Group’s greatest weakness was not collaborating enough with non-state actors compared
        to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were just two instances in which there were statistically significant stakeholder
        group differences across these twenty-five areas of development.
             Consultants on WBG-supported projects/PMUs gave the highest ratings for the
              WBG’s effectiveness at “Information and communications technology” whereas
              respondents from the media and academia/research institutes gave significantly
              lower effectiveness ratings.
             Employees of ministries, consultants on WBG-supported projects/PMUs, and
              respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks gave the highest
              ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness at “Public sector governance/reform”
              whereas respondents from local government and NGOs gave significantly lower
              effectiveness ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Bhutan, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectivene ss in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Bhutan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Bhutan, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at global/regional integration.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates

The World Bank Group’s Work in Bhutan

       Respondents from local government had the highest levels of agreement that “Overall the
        World Bank Group currently plays a relevant role in development in Bhutan” whereas
        respondents from NGOs and independent government institutions had significantly lower
        levels of agreement.
       Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement for
        the indicator question, “The World Bank Group’s work is aligned with what I consider
        the development priorities for Bhutan”.

Overall Perceptions
       Respondents from local government, bilateral or multilateral agencies, the private sector/
        financial sector/private banks had the highest levels of agreement that “The World Bank
        Group disburses funds promptly” whereas respondents from NGOs and independent
        government institutions had significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Consultants on WBG-supported projects/PMUs and respondents from local government
        had the highest levels of agreement that “The World Bank Group effectively monitors
        and evaluates the projects and programs it supports” whereas respondents from
        independent government institutions had significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement for
        the indicator question that “Where country systems are adequate, the World Bank Group
        makes appropriate use of them”.

       Employees of ministries, consultants on WBG-supported projects, and respondents from
        local government, bilateral or multilateral agencies, and the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s “Being inclusive” whereas
        respondents from NGOs gave significantly lower ratings. Respondents from local
        government gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s “Collaboration with groups outside

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Bhutan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Bhutan, greater insight into how the Bank’s
work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders.
With this understanding, the World Bank Group hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and
programs that support development in Bhutan. The World Bank Group commissioned an independent
consultant to oversee the logistics of this effort in Bhutan. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope
you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your
opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.

THE PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH

The World Bank Group is considering moving to a strengthened programmatic approach that would
consolidate/group task managers and missions around common themes. The objectives are to reduce
transaction costs with one focal World Bank expert, focusing the program around a few central themes, and
