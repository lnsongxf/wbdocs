               After identifying patterns of where people from Ayeyarwady and Magway

                         Despite the reasonably high rates of migration, there are yet to be significant
                         observable economic impacts on sending households. This reflects the nature
                         of the most prominent form of migration, with movement toward cities to
                         take up predominantly low-skilled employment. Earning differentials are not
                         significant and, as a result, any remittances are used primarily to supplement
                         food expenses; only a minority of households are able to allocate funds
                         toward productive assets. In terms of social impacts, migration appears to be
                         affecting roles within sending households as those left behind are required
                         to take on more responsibilities: for one-third of households with migrants,
                         responsibilities at the household level increase for those left behind. At the
                         household level, family members of migrants use remittances to smooth
                         income and reduce debt.


                         Similarly, it is still too early to definitively identify collective impacts on
                         sending villages, but some initial findings warrant further observation. Firstly,
                         migration is perceived as having a more positive impact on village dynamics
                         in Magway than it does in Ayeyarwady. This reflects the differing nature of
                         migration; in Magway there is a prevalence of both shock response migration
                         and international migration associated with upward mobility, resulting in,
                         respectively, perceptions of migration as something that facilitates the

                   migration practices and dynamics from those studied in this report.


                   The research does not examine the net flow of migration but focuses on
                   out-migration. Both the quantitative survey and qualitative work did not
                   capture information on the effects of migration into the regions researched.
                   With the exception of a defined number of migrant interviews in destination
                   locations, the research does not examine the migrants’ experience at their
                   destinations. The focus of the research is on the impact of migration on the
                   communities from which the migrants originate. Information about actual
                   migrants in the quantitative survey is captured primarily through interviews
                   with household members rather than directly from the migrants themselves.
                   Household members may not always have accurate information about the
                   type of employment migrants are engaged in, the networks from which it
                   was obtained, or even their location. Social and economic impacts on villages
                   as a whole are difficult to quantify given the relatively recent phenomenon
                   of increased domestic migration. The primary tool used for this draws on
                   a module on the perceptions of people in the sending villages. Relying on
                   perceptions differs from documenting actual experiences and has its own
                   limitations.

     The availability of labor within the household is a key variable associated with
     the decision to migrate for people seeking to manage risk. The decision to
     commit resources to migration is closely linked to the availability of sufficient
     household labor to compensate for the lost labor of the migrating individual,
     and to cover existing income streams until the migrant can begin to remit
     funds home. In both Ayeyarwady and Magway, migration rates increase as

     It was never her plan to move out of the village. The 29-year-old woman              could not afford it, considering the high cost of living in the city, but also
     said that even after working for the last six years, she still missed home           because she still harbors hopes of returning to the village permanently
     in her village in the Labutta Township, Ayeyarwady. Her family did not               someday. She is now trying to save money and raise enough capital to open a

     even before she left. During that time she sold food, mostly mohinga (a
     traditional Burmese fish soup), in the village. She lived with her parents,
     who supplemented her income by fishing from a nearby stream. When they
     managed to catch enough fish to sell, they could earn K5,000 to K10,000 but
     most days they could not catch any. In total their income was barely enough to
     support the household, but they managed to get by.


     When Cyclone Nargis hit in 2008, however, their various income-earning
     activities were disrupted, and were no longer sufficient to meet the
     subsistence constraints of the household. She and the rest of the household
     hoped that in the post-Nargis landscape they would be able to continue
     their previous livelihoods, but life in the village never really recovered its
     equilibrium. With the village economy decimated, selling food and fish no
     longer became a viable option. They soon found themselves in debt and
     could not make the repayments. She decided that her family’s best chance of
     survival was if she found a job in Yangon to provide the necessary income. Her
     family was against the idea, saying that it was not safe for a young woman to
     go to the city by herself, but she insisted that it was the only choice available.

          Households facing food insecurity episodes are less likely to migrate,                             This entails poor households responding to negative shocks and a lack of

          Households with less access to land and fewer years of education are                               across these factors. To do so, households are placed into four groups
          more likely to migrate. However, higher levels of wealth/income are not                            based on the degree to which they hold assets that allow them to diversify

     •	   Households with access to a greater diversity of income streams are
          less likely to migrate. Households who are able to earn income from                                •	      Land ownership: Households with access to land are able to mix labor for
          different sources—own agriculture or small business, along with casual                                     their own farm with casual labor for others; as land ownership increases,
          labor for others—are less likely to migrate.                                                               households are less likely to depend on employment as agricultural labor

     Evaluating the Migration Decision for Livelihoods Groups                                                        distribution show much larger variation in relation to the flat, bottom
     The results above demonstrate that household asset factors (land, education,                                    90 percent and are presumably able to manage a variability of income
     wealth) are not always key drivers of migration decisions. For Ayeyarwady,                                      streams due to existing wealth.
     those with land and education are less likely to migrate but this is not the case
     for Magway. For both regions, measures of household welfare (in this case,
     consumption) are not significant. This is not surprising given the variation of
     migration rates by different asset-based sub-groups: households with different                          23

     Figure 19 illustrates the distribution of households across the four livelihood
     types. It is worth noting that the number of landless is significantly smaller in
     Magway than in Ayeyarwady due to a larger group of households owning very
     small plots of land. While the size of the landholding is probably not enough
     to sustain a household independently through subsistence agriculture, the
     income stream derived still provides a measure of risk mitigation that is not
     available to those without land.



     Significant Factors Driving Migration Across Livelihood Groups

     driver in Ayeyarwady than in Magway. Migration decreases across livelihood
     groups as household assets increase: the land, education and wealth assets
     owned by small landholding, medium landholding and non-poor livelihood
     groups in contrast to the landless, lead to less frequent migration. In Magway,
     only households with small landholdings are less likely to migrate than
     landless households. Those with larger land ownership or the non-poor
     (with access to education or wealth) migrate at similar rates. Although small
     landholders are probably not able to provide enough income solely from their
     own agricultural activities, the ability to diversify income streams using casual
     labor in addition to agriculture probably reduces overall risk, making migration
     less attractive.

     extra household members or males, indicating households do need labor
     at home and only release members for migration when they already have
     sufficient working-age members to work on their own land or engage in other
     household activities. For landless households and non-poor households,
     members are more likely to migrate regardless of their number of working-
     age members or males in the household.

                                identified above using a model that tests, via multivariate regression analysis
                                and a set of control variables reflecting available assets (land, labor, education,
                                and capital), the likelihood of households having a migrant. The model
                                confirms that migrant households seeking to manage risk choose to migrate
                                in order to create a diverse and potentially more reliable income stream,
                                assuming availability of labor and an information network. Risk management
                                migration decisions are influenced by three factors: 1) the availability of labor
                                in the household for migration; 2) the capacity of the household to diversify
                                income streams; and 3) the relative availability of jobs in the sending areas and
                                information concerning jobs in the destination areas.



              The decision to migrate is inversely correlated with the availability of alternative
              income sources—households without access to such income streams are more
              likely to migrate—confirming the idea that for many households migration is a
              coping mechanism to respond to the lack of regular income streams.



                               Regression analysis also demonstrates the decision to migrate is inversely
                               correlated with the availability of alternative income sources—households
                               without access to such income streams are more likely to migrate—confirming
                               the idea that for many households migration is a coping mechanism to respond
                               to the lack of regular income streams. In Ayeyarwady, households with a
                               greater diversity of income sources are less likely to migrate, indicating that
                               they do not need to use migration as a risk-management tool. In Magway, small
                               landholding households migrate at a lower rate than the landless, probably

              Migration has important effects on poverty reduction. A key instrument through which migration
              transfers benefits to sending households and, indirectly, communities is through remittances.
              This section examines key ways in which migration is changing the social and economic lives of
              households and communities in sending areas, including through remittances and the return of
              migrants.                                                                                                                          Through                                            Bank in

        Economic Effects on       Remittances from domestic migration can provide a more stable and reliable
         Sending Households       income source, an important resource in the context of rural Myanmar. In
                                  upwardly mobile cases, migration can also contribute to poverty reduction
                                  by providing higher incomes than work in the agriculture sector, and
                                  offer opportunities to climb the income ladder.24 These effects are well                                                       59%             32%                            25%         41%
                                  documented across the world: a 71-country study concluded that remittances
                                  “reduce the level, depth, and severity of poverty” of receivers and their
                                  communities.25 In Tanzania, researchers tracked migrants and non-migrants
                                  between 1991 and 2004 and found that the poverty rate decreased by 23
                                  percentage points for those who moved versus 4 percentage points.26 Gains
                                  from migration were even greater for domestic migrants in Ethiopia: there,                                     Personally                                         Carrier/

                                  non-migrants for those who moved to urban areas was almost 200 percent.27
                                                                                                                                                                  11%            22%                            2%          2%
                                  The majority of migrants in Ayeyarwady and Magway, 69 percent and 55
                                  percent respectively, remit; mostly only once or twice per year. The amount
                                  that migrants remit depends on the type of migration, which is related,
                                  as demonstrated above, to the type of migrant. The median amount of
                                  remittances over a 12-month period is K250,000; however, the mean is closer
                                  to twice that amount, K415,800. This is driven by a small number of cases of                                   Moneygram                                            Western

                                  Many migrants avoid regular banking services when sending money back to
                                  their families. Instead, they rely on relatives and friends to carry cash back;
                                  to a lesser extent they carry it back themselves. The method of sending
                                  remittances is closely correlated with the type of migration and destination:
                                  international migrants overwhelmingly use the formal banking system; the
                                                                                                                                                    Hundi

                                         As a result, migration theory offers little on the collective economic impacts

     Qualitative research showed that most village authorities welcomed and            contexts or in areas of international migration, where remittances tend
     even encouraged migration because of the possibility of a better and regular      to be larger. This is related to the relatively recent nature of migration in
     income. However, they also acknowledged that migration causes labor               many areas, as well as the relatively small volume of remittances, especially
     shortages during farming season and consequently increases wages. They also       when compared with international migration. However, potential horizontal

     young people for youth associations, which amongst other activities, provide
     volunteer labor for community-development activities. Interestingly, some
     villagers cited the same phenomenon as a cause of increased social cohesion,
     though this view was less common: “As there are fewer people in the village,
     people become more united in organizing social events and funeral cases
     because one needs the other’s help.” (Focus group discussion with village
     authorities in Ayeyarwady.)


     There is also a perception that returning migrants bring new skills and
     knowledge, as well as tastes, perceptions, and attitudes. Migrants in the
     sample reported returning more confident, worldly, and better able to engage
     with others in a social and professional sense. Meanwhile, villagers who have
     not migrated tend to see migration as having a positive impact in individual
     migrants when they return. In several focus groups discussions, villagers argue
     that when migrants return to the villages they are more polite, knowledgeable,
     and have better social and communication skills. One returned male migrant
     in Magway explained: “Migrants seem more knowledgeable because of their
     work experiences, more sociable; talk to people nicely.”


     Migrants also remit funds for religious and social activities in their
     communities, further serving to raise their esteem in the eyes of non-
     migrants. A non-migrant from Magway stated during a focus group discussion
     with village authorities in Magway that: “Migration is good for the community
     because migrants can contribute money to social events and community
     festivals.”


     Yet, returned migrants reported ambiguous experiences as they reengage
     with their communities. On one hand, they can be respected as more worldly
     and experienced, and some return wealthier. Many devote a portion of their
     remittances to social and religious ends, and this can improve their community
     standing. On the other hand, there are isolated instances in the qualitative
     research of migrants absorbing bad habits related to drugs and alcohol, and
     there is a concern that they may introduce them to the village. Moreover,
     there is at least one reported instance of an older migrant being discriminated
     against in his bid for village office because others in the community assumed
     he would migrate again, abandoning his office to do so. This may be an
     important development to monitor, since—in a community in which individuals
     rely on social institutions to respond to shock and hardship—the emergence
     of stratified socioeconomic groups may potentially recalibrate expectations
     between individuals in those groups, although it is too early to draw
     conclusions.


     There is limited evidence from the research that tensions are emerging
     between migrant and non-migrant households or that remittances are
     impacting on inter-household social relations, as it has in other national

                                This study has attempted to provide insight into why people in Myanmar’s Ayeyarwady and
                                Magway regions make the decisions around migration that they do. To do so, the preceding
                                sections have developed illustrative types of migration and subsequently used that typology to
                                understand different experiences of migration, both for those leaving and left behind. Critical
                                points that shape the trajectory of migration episodes within those experiences were identified.
                                Based on these observations this section develops recommendations on how external actors,
                                including LIFT and the Government of Myanmar, at the national and sub-national level, can
                                intervene at these critical points to support both more choices and more informed decisions
                                around migration.




                                      Findings      Overall, the report identifies a high level of migration from both Magway and
                                                    Ayeyarwady. In Magway almost one in four households had at least one family
                                                    member migrating at the time of research. The figure was slightly lower,
                                                    but still high, in Ayeyarwady, where it was one in five. Moreover, this study
                                                    confirms that, in Ayeyarwady and Magway, migration rates are increasing,
                                                    especially in recent years, as Myanmar undertakes a wide-ranging economic
                                                    and political transition.


                                                    Migration patterns across both regions have some important similarities. In
                                                    both regions, landless households are more likely to have family members
                                                    migrating than the rest of the population. This reflects a lack of year-round
                                                    income generating opportunities locally. It also indicates a dependence of
                                                    small- and medium-landholding households on labor provided by family
                                                    members. Men are significantly more likely to migrate than women across
                                                    both regions, with double the number of men migrating in Magway than
                                                    women, and 60 percent of migrants from Ayeyarwady being men. Women
                                                    comprise at least one-third of all migrants in both regions.


                                                    There are also significant differences between the two regions. Migration
                                                    in Ayeyarwady follows a more uniform geographic pattern: with 58 percent
                                                    of migrants moving to Yangon, it is, by far, the primary location of choice.

                                choices that may not exist in rural areas, opportunities in other, particularly
                                urban, locations may drive migration decisions. Education levels and
                                household wealth are the primary means of seeking an alternative lifestyle;

                                Enabling Factors
                                Social networks: As noted above, the key concern cited by households with
                                respect to destination areas is the ability to find a job and accommodation.
                                The greater the number of migrants in a given village, the more likely it is
                                that such information will be both available and accurate with respect to the
                                likelihood of securing jobs and the cost of living in the destination area.


                                Low cost of transport and communication: The data above demonstrates
                                that the costs associated with migration are low, including the transition to
                                the new location and communication with family members, and allow for
