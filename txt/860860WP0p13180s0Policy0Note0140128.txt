Sumário Executivo

Moçambique é um país rico em recursos naturais – mas estes não geram automaticamente rendimentos
para a população do país. Serão necessários esforços para gerar uma série de rendimentos a partir da
riqueza dos recursos naturais e investir noutras formas de geração de riqueza. O desenvolvimento dos
sectores de gás e carvão oferece uma oportunidade para Moçambique progredir e utilizar os seus recursos
naturais para alavancar o desenvolvimento e melhorar o bem-estar da sua população. Estima-se que os
depósitos de carvão sejam de 20 biliões de toneladas e as exportações do carvão podem atingir os 100 milhões
de toneladas por ano, tornando Moçambique num dos maiores exportadores de carvão do mundo. As reservas
conhecidas de gás na bacia do Rovuma são estimadas em 130 tcf, com um risco significativo de um aumento
das mesmas e caso os actuais planos de investimento de LNG se materializem Moçambique vai tornar-se num
actor global nas exportações de LNG. Esta riqueza do subsolo não gera automaticamente rendimentos para
Moçambique. Os recursos devem ser extraídos e Moçambique vai precisar de recolher uma parte considerável
dos proveitos e os mesmos devem ser utilizados de forma sustentável com vista a transformar as riquezas do
subsolo em outras formas de riqueza.

O desenvolvimento dos campos de gás e dos depósitos de carvão vão mais do que duplicar a riqueza em
Moçambique mas apesar desses desenvolvimentos Moçambique continuara um dos países mais pobres da
região. O desenvolvimento dos sectores de gás e carvão em Moçambique tem a possibilidade de aumentar
significativamente a riqueza do país. Assumindo os prováveis desenvolvimentos dos enormes depósitos de gás
e carvão na região centro e norte do país, a riqueza per capita vai mais do que duplicar. A riqueza vai apenas
aumentar se os sectores se desenvolverem conforme planificado uma vez que os recursos naturais em questão
valem em função do seu valor comercial. Por outras palavras, o país terá apenas a possibilidade de obter
receitas desses recursos caso os mesmos sejam comercialmente valiosos. Apesar destas recentes descobertas
de recursos naturais Moçambique vai continuar a ser um dos países mais pobres da região.

A dimensão dos benefícios que Moçambique irá obter dos sectores de gás e carvão depende da forma como
gere os sectores e da maneira como investe os rendimentos provenientes dos recursos naturais. A famosa
“maldição dos recursos naturais” nem sempre acontece, e em geral parece existir uma relação positiva entre
recursos naturais e crescimento. Mas, esta relação positiva é influenciada pela qualidade das instituições do
país. Os países ricos em recursos naturais e com instituições fortes tendem a crescer mais rápido, embora
pareça não existir qualquer relação entre recursos naturais e crescimento em países com instituições fracas. Os
países que geriram bem os seus recursos naturais investiram os rendimentos dos recursos naturais em outras
formas de riqueza (como o capital físico ou o capital humano) mantendo, por essa via, níveis elevados de
rendimentos. Os países que investem uma grande porção dos rendimentos dos recursos naturais em outras
formas de capital tendem a crescer mais rápido e de forma mais duradoura. Países com taxas de investimento
baixas apresentam crescimento limitado a longo prazo e podem ter pouco a apresentar no que respeita ao
desenvolvimento após a exploração dos recursos naturais por uma geração ou mais. Mas, para a
sustentabilidade do crescimento importa não apenas quanto o país investe mas também a qualidade desse
investimento. A qualidade do investimento público determina em grande medida o impacto do investimento


                                                      3
sobre o crescimento. Moçambique vai precisar de investir em sistemas com vista a melhor gerir os
investimentos públicos e, por conseguinte, garantir a sua qualidade.

Moçambique pode crescer a uma taxa elevada na próxima década – mas isso não irá necessariamente
significar que o país esteja a ficar mais rico. O Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) mede o rendimento anual que o
país obtém da sua riqueza. Maior riqueza estará consequentemente associada a níveis de rendimento mais
elevados. Mas o que o país faz com tais rendimentos terá um impacto directo sobre a sustentabilidade do
crescimento e níveis futuros de riqueza e de rendimento. Do ponto de vista do crescimento sustentável, mais
riqueza é gerada todos os anos a medida que o rendimento é investido em capital humano e físico. Por seu
turno, o crescimento do PIB pode ser mantido. Do ponto de vista do crescimento insustentável, o rendimento é
normalmente derivado pela redução e o consumo dos recursos do país. O crescimento do PIB pode ser
positivo, mas a riqueza estará em declínio e assim também os rendimentos no futuro. Muitos países ricos em
recursos naturais experimentaram um crescimento elevado do PIB embora passando por um crescimento
negativo da riqueza. Em países ricos em recursos naturais o crescimento elevado do PIB não pode ser sempre
associado a uma base crescente da riqueza, muitas vezes reflectindo a diminuição do capital natural. Alguns
dos países com taxas elevadas de crescimento do PIB quando os recursos naturais esgotam tornaram-se de
facto mais pobres. Os países ricos em recursos naturais devem prestar especial atenção as fontes do seu
crescimento e se estão num rumo de crescimento sustentável visto que os recursos são finitos.

Moçambique, como muitos outros países no continente Africano, parece ter crescido ao longo da última
década mediante a diminuição dos seus recursos naturais. Com vista a garantir um rumo de crescimento
sustentável, Moçambique deve investir uma porção mais elevada dos seus rendimentos tanto no capital
físico bem como no capital humano. Muitos países ricos em recursos naturais experimentaram um
crescimento extremamente rápido através da diminuição da sua riqueza. Este rumo de crescimento não se
afigura sustentável e tem a probabilidade de conduzir a um crescimento e bem-estar mais baixos no futuro.
Este tem, também, sido o caso de Moçambique, que parece ter crescido na última década através da
diminuição dos seus recursos naturais, conforme demonstrado pelas “poupanças liquidas ajustadas” negativas,
uma medida de sustentabilidade de crescimento de um país. A proporção de capital físico sobre o capital
natural tem estado a diminuir ao longo do tempo em Moçambique e a porção de capital físico na riqueza total
em Moçambique é uma das mais baixas da região destacando a necessidade de investir os rendimentos dos
recursos naturais noutras formas de capital: infra-estruturas públicas bem como na melhoria da prestação dos
serviços públicos de educação e saúde.

 Com vista a garantir que uma grande porção dos rendimentos dos recursos naturais seja investida,
Moçambique pode aprovar um quadro de política fiscal que tome em consideração as características
particulares das receitas dos recursos naturais. Muitos países com indústrias extractivas na fase embrionária
precisam de reformar as instituições e estruturas actuais com vista a gerir melhor os recursos naturais,
incluindo a aprovação de um quadro de política fiscal que aborde os desafios relacionados com a gestão das
receitas dos recursos naturais. O sucesso e a eficácia de tais instituições dependem fundamentalmente da
qualidade no ambiente institucional geral no país. O ambiente institucional em Moçambique é relativamente
fraco – levantando preocupações sobre a capacidade do país de gerir bem os recursos naturais. Em especial no

caso de países com escassez de capitais como é o caso de Moçambique, existirá pressão para se gastar uma
grande porção dos rendimentos dos recursos naturais com vista a melhorar o bem-estar da população a curto
prazo, limitando a capacidade do governo para afectar uma grande porção das receitas para o investimento e
para melhor gerir questões particulares relacionadas com os recursos naturais tais como a volatilidade dos
preços e a natureza finita dos recursos naturais.

Executive Summary

Mozambique is rich in subsoil assets – but these do not automatically generate income for the country’s
population. Efforts will be needed to generate a stream of income from natural resources wealth and invest
it in other forms of wealth. The development of the gas and coal sectors provides Mozambique with an
opportunity to leap forward and use its natural resources to accelerate development and improve the well-
being of its population. Coal deposits are estimated at 20 billion tons and coal exports could be 100 million tons
annually at peak, making Mozambique one of the top ten coal exporters in the world. Known gas reserves in
the Rovuma basin are estimated at 130 tcf, with a significant upside risk and if current LNG investment plans
materialize Mozambique will become a global player in LNG exports. This subsoil wealth does not automatically
generate income for Mozambique. It has to be extracted, Mozambique will need to capture a fair share of the
rents, and these need to be wisely used – to transform subsoil wealth into other forms of wealth.

Development of the gas fields and coal deposits will more than double wealth in Mozambique but despite
these developments Mozambique will remain one of the poorest countries in the region. The development of
the gas and coal sectors in Mozambique has the potential of significantly increasing wealth. When taking the
likely development of the large coal and gas deposits in the north and center of the country into account, per
capita wealth more than doubles. Wealth will only increase if the sectors are developed as planned, since these
natural resources are worth only as much as their commercial value. In other words, the country will only be
able to derive an income of these assets if they can be commercially developed. Despite this newly discovered
wealth Mozambique will continue to be one of the poorest countries in the region.

The extent to which Mozambique benefits from the gas and coal sectors depends on how Mozambique
manages the sectors and how it invests the rents from natural resources. The (in)famous ‘natural resources
curse’ does not always hold, and in general there seems to be a positive relationship between natural
resources and growth. But this positive relationship is influenced by the strength of the country’s institutions.
Countries rich in natural resources with strong institutions tend to grow faster, while there does not seem to
be any relationship between natural resources and growth for countries with a weak governance environment.
Countries that have managed their natural resources well have invested income from natural resources into
other forms of wealth, therefore maintaining higher income levels. Countries that invest a large share of
natural resources rents on other forms of capital tend to grow faster and longer. Countries with low
investment ratios show limited growth over the long term and may have little to show by way of development
after exploiting natural resources for a generation or more. But for sustainability of growth it matters not only
how much a country invests but also how well it does. The quality of public investment to a large extent
determines the impact of investment on growth. Mozambique will need to invest in systems to better manage
public investments and ensure their quality.

Mozambique may grow at a rapid rate in the next decade – but this will not necessarily mean that the
country is getting richer. GDP measures the annual rent that a country derives from its wealth. Higher wealth
will therefore often be associated with higher income levels. But what a country does with that income will



                                                        6
have a direct impact on the sustainability of growth and future wealth and income levels. On a sustainable
growth path, more wealth is generated every year as income is invested in human and physical capital. In turn,
GDP growth can be maintained. On an unsustainable growth path, income is often derived by depleting and
consuming the country’s assets. GDP growth may be positive, but wealth is declining and so will income in the
future. Many resource rich countries have seen high GDP growth while posting negative wealth growth. In
resource economies, high GDP growth cannot always be associated with a growing asset-base, often reflecting
the depletion of natural capital. Some of the countries with high GDP growth rates when natural resources are
depleted have in fact become poorer over time. Resource rich countries should pay particular attention to the
sources of their growth and whether they are in a sustainable growth path, as resources are finite.

Mozambique, as many other countries in Africa, seems to have grown in the last decade by depleting its
natural resources. To ensure a sustainable growth path, Mozambique should invest a higher share of its
income on both human and physical capital. Many resource-rich countries have grown rapidly by depleting
their wealth. This growth path is unsustainable and likely to lead to lower growth and wellbeing in the future.
This has also been the case in Mozambique, which seems to have grown in the last decade by depleting its
natural resources, as evidenced by negative adjusted net savings, a measure of the sustainability of a country’s
growth. Over time, the share of productive over natural capital in Mozambique has been declining and the
share of produced capital in total wealth in Mozambique is one of the lowest in the region, highlighting the
need to invest resource rents into other forms of capital: public infrastructure as well as improvements in the
provision of health and education public services.

To ensure that a large share of the rents from natural resources is invested, Mozambique may want to adopt
a fiscal policy framework that takes the particular characteristics of natural resources revenues into account.
Most countries with nascent extractive industries need to reform the institutions and structures in place to
manage natural resources better, including the adoption of a fiscal policy framework that addresses the
challenges of natural resources revenues. The success and effectiveness of such institutions depend largely on
the general institutional environment in which they are established. Mozambique’s institutional environment is
relatively weak – raising concerns about the country’s ability to manage natural resources well. Particularly in
the case of cash-strapped countries, such as is the case in Mozambique, there will be pressure to consume a
large share of the resource rents to improve the well-being of the population in the short term, limiting the
ability of the government to allocate a large share of the revenue for investment and to better manage issues
particular to natural resources management such as volatility and the finite nature of natural resources.

    1. Wealth in Mozambique


             a. Introduction and conceptual framework

Mozambique is rich in subsoil assets – but these do not automatically generate income for the country’s
population. Efforts will be needed to generate a stream of income from this wealth and invest it in other
forms of wealth to sustain income levels. The development of the gas and coal sectors provides Mozambique
with an incredible opportunity to leap forward and use its natural resources to accelerate development and
improve the well-being of its population to a level it did not seem possible just a few years ago. Coal deposits
are estimated above 20 billion tons and coal exports could be around 100 million tons annually at peak, making
Mozambique one of the top ten coal exporters in the world. Known gas reserves in the Rovuma basin are
estimated at over 130 tcf (trillion cubic feet), with a significant upside risk, providing Mozambique with the 3rd
largest gas reserves in Africa and if current LNG investment plans materialize Mozambique will become a global
player in LNG exports. This subsoil wealth does not automatically generate income for Mozambique. It has to
be extracted, Mozambique will need to capture a fair share of the economic rents, and the rents need to be
wisely used – to transform subsoil wealth into other forms of wealth. Given their enclave-type nature, the coal
and gas sectors will benefit Mozambique primarily through paying taxes and the use that the Government of
Mozambique makes of that additional revenue. As in other countries experiencing a natural resources boom,
there is a wide set of reforms that need to be implemented to maximize benefits and ensure they are
widespread. The experience of many countries in exploiting natural resources is one of unmet expectations
and a significant concentration in the distribution of the benefits, often accompanied by worsening governance
and stability.

The wealth accounts framework can tell us something about the sustainability of growth patterns –
particularly important for resource rich countries such as Mozambique is about to become. Wealth
accounting differs from conventional national accounting in its primary focus; whereas Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) measures the flow of income accruing to a country within a year, total wealth measures the stock of
assets a country uses to generate its income2. In that sense, knowledge about wealth allows us to say
something about both current and future income. Income that is derived from depletion of current wealth
affects future wealth, depending on the use that countries make of that income (consuming vs. investing it).
Wealth accounting has become increasingly popular in recent years since the method allows researchers to
account for the improvement or degradation of forms of capital that are often ignored by economists and
policy-makers, but nevertheless enormously important for the long-run development of a country.

 Another relevant measure of income flows is the Gross National Income (GNI). GNI is the sum of value added by all
resident producers plus net receipts of primary income from abroad. It is often very similar to GDP, but in Mozambique’s
case for example large transfers from abroad (in the form of grants) mean that there may be significant differences
between GDP and GNI.

Box 1: How are wealth estimates built? A brief note on methodology
The idea of wealth can be conceptualized in much the same way as that of GDP. However, some components
of wealth are not observable in the same way and must be deducted. Total wealth is seen as the present value
of future consumption, and the sum of the wealth components must equal this. A basic decomposition of
wealth may look this way:



where K is produced capital, including machinery, equipment, structures and urban land. V measures natural
capital (energy resources, minerals, timber, forest, crop land, pasture land and protected areas), NFA stands for
net foreign assets and IC intangible capital. The latter can be estimated as a combination of human capital and
rule of law, but in practice is calculated as the residual of the above equation when total wealth is estimated as
                                                         (   )
the present value of future consumption, ∫     ( )               .

It is important to note that future consumption is not easy to measure. Therefore, in practice the estimate for
present value of future consumption is calculated in a way to mimic a situation where the economy is on a
sustainable path (i.e. where savings offset capital depletion). In order to do this, researchers use 5-year
averages centered on the year of interest in order to smooth out any irregularities in consumption and
afterwards adjust the savings/ consumption breakdown to reflect a sustainable consumption path.

For a more detailed discussion on the methodology used to estimate wealth, please see Annex A in the World
Bank publication ‘The Changing Wealth of Nations’ (2011).

Wealth is divided into three types of wealth: produced capital, natural capital and intangible capital (which
includes human capital). Wealth accounts attempt to measure the wealth of a country by decomposing its
total wealth into produced capital, natural capital and intangible capital. The former encompasses what is
normally seen as capital in national accounting (machinery, structures, equipment) but also urban land. Natural
capital includes agricultural land, protected areas, forests, minerals and energy whereas intangible capital is
supposed to measure human, social and institutional capital. Produced capital and natural capital can be
observed, but intangible capital is in practice derived as the residual of the equation described in box 1. The
exercise of updating Mozambique’s wealth accounts up to 2011 focuses on developments in the subsoil assets
category. Although this focus is limiting and it does not capture important developments in other sectors, the
focus is justified because some of the major changes in wealth in the past few years are related to the
discovery and commercial exploitation of subsoil assets and there are important policy questions related to the
management of these resources. Future exercises should look at wealth in a more comprehensive manner
(including other types of natural resources or with a focus on human capital) to address other types of policy
questions.

The objective of this policy note is to inform policy discussions around the management of natural resources
and reforms needed to translate natural capital into other forms of capital, and it does so by using the
wealth accounting framework. Wealth (e.g. in the form of natural resources) may or may not translate into
sustained flows of income in the long run. The extent to which natural capital translates into other forms of


                                                        9
capital from which to derive a sustainable income stream is what lies at the heart of natural resources
management and what differentiates successful natural resource rich countries from less successful ones. The
outcome of the process depends on institutional capacity and political decisions along the way. Experience
shows that the quality of governance and institutional capability are key for countries to be able to translate
natural capital into other forms of capital in an effective way. According to a variety of governance indicators,
Mozambique’s institutions are relatively weak – raising concerns about the country’s ability to manage natural
resources well. But Mozambique can also build on significant progress in some areas. Democratic elections,
free press and a vocal civil society suggest of a gradual strengthening of institutions. Although the main
audience of this policy note is Mozambican policy makers – the discussion around management of natural
resources needs to be much broader, and as such civil society, private sector and the international community
may also find the note useful.

The management of natural resources revenue will need to deal with the decision of how much spend today
vs. save for precautionary purposes and the future as well as reforms to improve public spending and asset
management. Translating natural capital wealth into other forms of wealth will need to be led by the public
sector. Given the characteristics of natural resources, the state will play a major role in recovering and using a
share of the economic rents from natural resources. A strategy for transforming natural capital into other
forms of capital should therefore focus on, but not be limited to, the public sector. Countries seeking to
translate their natural resources into other forms of capital have to get policies in three key areas right: (i)
policies to ensure efficient resource extraction to maximize resource rents, codified in a clear legal, regulatory
and contractual framework (ii) a stable and fair fiscal regime that balances the interests of companies and
governments while enabling government to recover a fair share of the rents, taking into account the country’s
administrative capacity and fostering transparency and (iii) a clear policy for effective investment of resource
rents in productive assets, with a framework that helps decide how much to save and spend from the resource
revenues, as well as reforms for more efficient public spending and management of financial assets.


            b. The relation between GDP and wealth

GDP is the annual rent that a country derives from its wealth – and the sustainability of that rent depends on
the extent to which the country consumes or invests those rents. Consideration of the relation between GDP
and wealth can help to see why it is important not only to concentrate on flows of the economy but also the
assets. Since GDP can be seen as the annual rent of a country’s total wealth, higher wealth would, ceteris
paribus, lead to higher GDP, just like a farmer can decide to consume income or invest it in mechanizing the
farm, better seeds, livestock. If the farmer choses the latter, by consuming less and using the savings to invest
in the mechanization of the farm, she is likely to have higher income in the future.

There is a positive relationship between wealth and GDP growth – as wealth grows, so does the income
derived from that wealth. One should therefore also expect a second order relationship between the two;
namely that growth in GDP and growth in wealth are positively related. On a sustainable growth path, more



                                                       10
wealth is generated every year as the stocks of physical and intangible capital increase. In turn, growth in GDP
can be maintained. The most recent cross-national data on wealth accounts3 indicate that this is the case for
most countries, and the relationship seems to hold for both resource rich countries (proxied by a share of
natural capital in total wealth of 30 percent and higher) and those that are not rich in natural resources (Figure
1 and Figure 2). High GDP growth does not guarantee widespread welfare improvements though. Investments
in key public services (health, education), infrastructure and institutions that allow people to participate and
share in the benefits generated by rapid growth all contribute to ensuring that growth translates into welfare
improvements across the population.

But the relationship between wealth and growth is not always positive – and for resource rich countries it
often shows that the country is growing by depleting its wealth – not growing it. There is a significant number
of countries rich in natural resources that have seen high and positive GDP growth while posting negative or no
growth in wealth over the period. In resource economies, high growth in GDP cannot always be associated with
a growing asset-base, but often only reflects the depletion of natural capital. Indeed, some of the countries
with high GDP growth rates have in fact become poorer in terms of total wealth over time. The growth rates of
these countries do not seem sustainable in the long run, suggesting that resource rich countries should pay
particular attention to the sources of their growth and whether they are in a sustainable growth path, as
resources are finite. The reserve horizon for Mozambique’s gas reserves is not clear yet, particularly as the
discoveries are still relatively new and exploration is ongoing, but reserves in existing fields could be exploited
over a 40-50 year horizon.

The quality of governance seems to be a key determinant in the relationship between natural resources
wealth and growth. The positive relationship between wealth and growth for resource rich countries would
seem to contradict the ‘resource curse’, that claims that there is a negative relationship between natural
resources wealth and growth. Figure 3 and Figure 4 depict the relationship between the share of natural

governance indicators). The relationship is positive, but as suggested by the literature, the quality of
governance is a key determinant in the relationship between natural resources and growth and the ability of
countries to benefit from natural resources, with a much stronger positive relationship between natural
resources and growth for countries with good governance.

             2. The role of natural resources in wealth creation – investing in human
                and physical capital

Resource-rich countries can develop by investing their natural resources into other forms of capital
(productive, human capital). In the context of developing countries, out of the three forms of capital described
above, natural capital is particularly important for two reasons; firstly, because usually in poor countries, a
larger part of the economy is based on agriculture and extractive industries and secondly because natural
resources can be used as a catalyst for a rapid transition into a higher level of development. This has been the
case in a number of countries such as Botswana, which has increased wealth above the average of upper
middle income countries by investing in other forms of capital (physical, human, foreign assets), resulting in
significant improvements across a whole set of development outcomes (Figure 5)

Sustainability of development is partly determined by the level of investments that countries chose – the
Hartwick rule argues that consumption can only be maintained if rents from non-renewable resources are
invested. One possible explanation as to why countries perform differently in terms of turning natural capital
into sustainable development point towards investment levels. According to the Hartwick rule (Hartwick 1977;
Solow 1986), consumption can be maintained if the rents from nonrenewable resources are continuously
invested rather than used for consumption. Some countries have failed to translate their natural capital into
other forms of capital, because investments in human and productive capital have been limited while natural
resources have been exploited or because investments made did not generate significant returns. Botswana’s
wealth almost doubled from 1995 to 2008 on account of significant growth in all types of wealth (productive,
foreign assets as well as human capital) while wealth growth has been significantly lower in Nigeria – with
productive capital falling over the same period (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Botswana’s wealth has almost doubled from 1995 to 2008, while Nigeria’s wealth has grown less and
continues to depend heavily on its natural capital. This is best reflected in the growth in produced capital.

Countries following the Hartwick rule and investing rents from natural resources in other forms of capital
have seen a significant growth in their wealth over time. Botswana has been following the Hartwick Rule for
sustainability and from the mid-1990s this was institutionalized by a formal rule, the Sustainable Budget Index
(SBI). SBI is the ratio of spending on non-investment divided by recurrent revenue, and it should be 1 or less to
ensure sustainability of public consumption. Analysis of wealth and per capita value of capital stock shows
significant increases over the past 30 years, signaling that Botswana is investing a large share of the rents from
resources. Wealth has also been increasing in all of the countries in Table 1 below, although different growth
rates also partly reflect use of resources, with Nigeria’s per capita wealth growing by around 16 percent in the
thirteen years between 1995 and 2008, and per capita wealth growing by over 40 percent in both Botswana
and Chile over the same period.

Those countries that invest a large share of their natural resources wealth tend to grow faster over longer
periods of time, while countries with low investment ratios show limited growth over the long term. In
Angola, for example, capital expenditure accounts for less than 10 percent of GDP, significantly lower than
most other countries in South-Saharan Africa. This results in relatively low capital formation, estimated at only
13 percent in the past decade. This compares with GCF of 28 in Botswana for the same period4. Nigeria seems
to be a case of low quality of investments; i.e. investments with low rates of return. These differences in
approach and results are well illustrated in Figure 7. While in 1960 Botswana and Nigeria had a very similar per
capita income, over the past 50 years GDP per capita has grown by 6 percent per year in Botswana, while it has
only grown by 1 percent in Nigeria.

For sustainability of growth and wealth creation – it matters not only how much a country invests but also
how well it invests. Some countries may be following the Hartwick rule, but investments are of poor quality,
not able to generate the returns that would allow for sustainable consumption levels. Sala-i-Martin and
Subramanian (2003) investigates the role of public investment in the case of Nigeria. While Nigeria has some of
the largest oil deposits in the world, which have generated huge government revenues since the 1970’s, the
country continues to experience relatively high poverty 5 . While Nigeria significantly increased public
investment during oil booms, with almost the entire windfall gains from oil re-invested in physical capital, this
has not led the country onto a path of sustainable development. The returns to investment seem to have been
low as a result of relatively poor investments. Average capacity utilization in manufacturing plummeted from
around 80 percent in the 1970’s to a level of around 30-40 percent since the mid-80s. In the same period, total
factor productivity (TFP) had a negative growth rate of about 1.2 percent p.a. which suggests over investment
in capital. There is also anecdotal evidence to illustrate the argument that investments may not have
generated the expected returns. In the late 70s the Government of Nigeria started to build the Ajakouta steel
complex. After the government reportedly spending over US$5 billion in the past 40 years, the complex has not
produced any commercial steel to date. The quality of public investment to a large extent determines the
impact of investment on growth (as suggested by recent literature such as Arslanalp et al. 2010; Gupta et al.
2011) and Mozambique scores relatively poorly in its public investment management system, highlighting the
need to improve its ability to manage a potentially increasing resource envelop for investment.

Many countries struggle with ensuring that a large share of revenues from natural resources is invested –
and that it is done in an effective manner. Even in a success story such as Botswana, recent analysis shows
some limitations in the adoption of a policy framework favoring investment (such as the adoption of certain
fiscal rules). Lange et al, 2004, and Kojo, 2010, discuss Botswana’s application of the SBI and argue that much
of what is considered public investment to estimate the SBI is actually recurrent spending, such as subsidies or
recurrent spending on health and education. A revised SBI from 1976 to 2001 with a more stringent definition

resource revenue).

                       a. Trends 1995-2011

The sustainable development of the gas and coal sectors in Mozambique has the potential of significantly
increasing wealth. The recent discoveries of coal and gas have significantly increased Mozambique’s wealth,
since they seem to be commercially viable. The determination of the country’s wealth depends on if and how
recent large discoveries of coal and natural gas are entered into the equation. The chart below shows total
wealth in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2011 in two scenarios; to the left a situation where the current
knowledge about stocks of natural resources to be extracted in the future is taken into account and increases
wealth (a departure of the usual methodology described below), and to the right a situation in which natural
capital is estimated as usual, which assumes zero growth in rents, and therefore wealth estimates are based on
current and not future potential rents from natural resources (Figure 8). In the first scenario, the future
consumption stream was also adjusted to take into account projected rents from natural resources, resulting in
an overall increase in wealth. See annex II and World Bank (2011) for further details on methodology.

Per capita wealth in Mozambique would be less than half in a scenario with no or limited development of
the gas and coal sectors. In the first scenario, wealth in 2011 totals around US$15,500 per capita and includes
potential future rents of gas and coal under relatively conservative scenarios – but assuming that investments
and developments go ahead as planned. The development depicted to the right shows the much lower per
capita wealth of Mozambique if the natural capital discovered in recent years is not taken into account. This

scenario would represent a situation in which recent gas discoveries in the Rovuma basin are not exploited and
the coal sector stagnates at current low levels. Total wealth in 2011 would lie around US$6,600 per capita,
around 40% of the estimate of wealth if coal and gas sectors are developed.

Despite this newly discovered wealth Mozambique will continue to be one of the poorest countries in the
region. The alternative methodology used more than doubles per capita wealth. But wealth remains relatively
low, as Figure 9 illustrates. Despite this new wealth in natural resources, Mozambique’s wealth is still
significantly lower than many other countries in the region, such as Botswana, Mauritius and South Africa,
highlighting the need to continue investing in other forms of wealth (physical and human capital) that can lead
to higher and sustainable income levels.

Over time, the share of productive over natural capital in Mozambique has been declining – a result of
strong growth of natural capital over the last fifteen years. A sustainable development process for a low
income country rich in natural resources often involves transforming natural capital into produced and human
capital. While the overall wealth of Mozambique has grown and is likely to continue growing as the country
continues to benefit from rents from natural resources, it is important to look at the shares of the different
components of wealth. The table below presents wealth divided into the components of natural, produced and
intangible capital for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. For Mozambique it is particularly interesting to
observe the ratio of produced to natural capital, which has been declining since 1995. This has been primarily
the result of large increases in natural capital – partly the result of the start of mining and petroleum
operations – although produced capital has also been growing at rapid rates.

The share of produced capital in total wealth in Mozambique is one of the lowest in the region. The trends
above can also be put in perspective by comparing Mozambique with some countries in Africa. Compared with
these countries, some of them also rich in natural resources, produced capital accounts for a relatively small
share of Mozambique’s wealth (Figure 10). The ratio of produced capital to natural capital is the lowest in the
group of comparison countries chosen. This may be a reflection of strong growth of natural capital recently,
not so much a lack of investing in physical or human capital, but it reinforces the need to invest the newly
found natural resources into other forms of capital to move in the direction of Botswana or South Africa, both
rich in natural resources but with significant shares of both intangible and physical capital.

                 b. The concept of Adjusted Net Savings

To measure to what extent countries are saving and investing in a sustainable manner, the wealth
accounting framework uses the concept of adjusted net savings, which takes into account investments in
different forms of capital as well as their depreciation. Savings and investments play a critical role in
determining the changes in wealth over time. In national accounting, the focus is on investments in physical
capital whether gross or net. In wealth accounting, the analogous term is adjusted net savings (ANS). Apart
from the depreciation of (produced) physical capital, the calculation of the ANS also considers the effect of
educational expenditure, depletion of natural resources and damages to the environment done by pollution.


                                                                    18
Educational expenditures are seen as investments in intangible capital whereas depletion of natural resources
is a negative investment in the natural capital of a country. Adjusted net saving approximates the changes in
wealth over shorter periods. While the measure fails to take into account parts of the intangible capital (e.g.
public health) and natural capital (e.g. agricultural land) it will work as a reasonably good proxy especially in
developing countries with high resource dependence. And to quote the World Bank (2011), “A policy maker
noting an ANS of – 10 % can be certain that the country is not on a sustainable development path”. Below is an
excerpt from the World Bank (2011) showing the calculation route from gross savings to adjusted net saving
(Figure 11) and the relationship between adjusted net savings and rents from energy and minerals as a
percentage of GNI (Figure 12), illustrating that many resource-rich countries do not seem to be on a
sustainable development path.

Adjusted net savings illustrates the sustainability of growth – negative ANS point at non-sustainable growth
patterns, a characteristic of growth in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa rich in natural resources. There
is a clear tendency for countries with a higher dependency on non-renewable resources to record lower
adjusted net savings meaning; the growth these countries experience is less sustainable. While gross savings
may be positive and growing, adjusted net savings become negative. The recent boom in natural resources has
resulted in relatively fast growth in countries with abundant natural resources, but this growth does not seem
to be sustainable and is built on rapid depletion of natural resources. When comparing adjusted net savings in
Sub-Saharan Africa with East Asia the diverging trends are illustrative of the drivers of growth in these two
regions. While Sub-Saharan Africa seems to be growing by depleting natural resources, with ANS declining and
turning negative in the middle of the past decade, ANS has been growing in East Asia over the past 10 years
(Figure 13).

Adjusted net savings in Mozambique were negative for most of the last decade, a result of increasing energy
depletion. Looking at the ANS for the past decade shows a declining trend from 2004 (the start of gas exports
by Sasol) to about 2008, mirrored by a significant increase in energy depletion. That the ANS decreases and
becomes negative when natural resources are depleted suggests that the gains stemming from these resources
have not been adequately re-invested. Since 2008 there seems to have been a reversal. While from 2004 to
2008 energy depletion seemed to be driving ANS, since 2008 positive ANS seem to be the result of higher gross
savings, resulting in a positive (but relatively low) ANS by 2010 (Figure 14).

For the past few years ANS in Mozambique have been low, but positive… Another aspect that affects the
sustainability of savings and investments in an economy is demographics. Adjusted net savings can be positive
as a percentage of GNI, but negative when taking into account population growth. Analogous to Figure 11,



                                                                                 20

… while population adjusted ANS as a share of GNI suggests a non-sustainable growth pattern. Population
adjusted ANS takes into account population growth. Mozambique has a population growth rate of around 2
percent p.a. This figure is multiplied with the per capita tangible wealth (produced + natural capital) to obtain
the so-called Malthusian term, which in turn is subtracted from per capita adjusted net savings. The change in
per capita wealth is reported in the second row from the bottom in US$ per capita (Table 3). The bottom row
shows the population adjusted ANS, i.e. how much more needs to be invested as percent of GNI in order to
maintain wealth per capita. The table shows clearly that Mozambique is not on a sustainable development
path. Adjusted Net Savings amount to 2.5 percent of GNI while taking population growth into account yields a
negative savings rate of 39 %. In fact, according to World Bank (2011) many developing countries reported
negative change in per capita wealth with many African countries at the bottom of the chart due to high
population growth rates.

          4. Translating fuel and mineral resources into other forms of capital


                                 a. Management of wealth composition and the role of institutions

There is a positive relationship between adjusted net savings and growth, which tends to disappear when
focusing on natural resource rich countries. Translating natural capital into other forms of capital requires the
right investment policy; firstly the application of a rule that ensures that enough of the natural capital is re-
invested and secondly that investments are of good quality. Looking at the relationship between GDP growth
and adjusted net savings in the period 1990-2011 there seems to be a positive relationship; more investment in
both produced and human capital in general means higher GDP growth rates. The relationship between ANS
and GDP growth seems to be somewhat different when looking at resource-rich countries only (defined as
countries in which natural resources account for more than 30 % of total wealth) and two points seem to
appear; resource rich economies on average have a much lower adjusted net saving, often negative, and the
positive correlation between ANS and growth disappears (Figure 16 and Figure 17). Understanding the factors
that influence these observations is key to avoid the resource curse and to ensure that rents from natural
capital help developing countries transit out of poverty.

For cash-strapped countries there will be significant pressure to consume a large share of the revenue
generated by natural resources. Ensuring positive adjusted net savings and translating it into sustainable
economic growth is further complicated by the observation that most of the economies that are highly
resource dependent are in their early stages of development. Revenues from natural resources may alleviate
fiscal space constraints that have affected countries in the past and it can be tempting to use the new fiscal
space on an enlarged or better remunerated public sector or social programs. Often revenue from natural


                                                                       22
resources is first spent as part of the national budget, and it is only when the most pressing needs are met by
public spending that governments consider saving some of the rents from natural resources. In Mongolia, for
instance, public expenditure rose dramatically during the last decade due to increased revenue from mining.
After realizing the risks of such a policy framework during the global financial crisis, the country is
reconsidering its fiscal framework to increase savings and insulate the use of savings from political
interference.

Most countries with nascent extractive industries need to strengthen existing policy frameworks and often
implement reforms on the institutions and structures in place to manage natural resources. Political
institutions play a pivotal role in the management of natural resources and determination of asset
compositions (Atkinson and Hamilton 2003; Collier et al., 2010; Humphreys and Sandbu, 2007). Part of better
managing natural resources will entail strengthening existing PFM systems and key agencies (e.g. tax
administration). Most countries also introduce new laws and revise the policy frameworks to decide how much
of the revenue from natural resources is going to be spent and saved. These laws often seek to maximize the
share of the resource revenue attributed to the government and add some constraints to the discretion of the
executive on the use of the natural resources revenues. It is likewise common to establish a natural resource
fund serving the dual purpose of reducing the volatility of revenues due to large variations in commodity prices
and limiting public investments to the absorptive capacity of the economy.

Yet, the success and effectiveness of such institutions and structures depend largely on the general
institutional environment in which they are established. First, it matters if a government plans in advance and
introduces the necessary legislation and instruments before the mining or drilling starts. Secondly,
implementation of new policies and legislation being adopted is likely to differ based on the strength of
governance – and will be affected by issues such as bureaucratic quality or corruption; in fact, without the right
institutional set-up from the start governance is likely to suffer, since there is often less accountability attached
to resource rents than to, say, tax-money or grants from donors. In this regard, the term ‘rentier state’ has
been coined. This refers to governments that obtain revenue from natural resource, and therefore do not tax
citizens and hence become less accountable to them (Moore, 2004). According to Barma et al, 2012, “Natural
resource booms turn countries into rentier states that live off unearned income; the state is resourced through
rents rather than taxes and requires correspondingly little organizational effort from the state apparatus”, thus
leading to weaker administrative and institutional capacity. Institutions are endogenous in the sense that they
are partly the result of economic growth and income levels, affecting directly how countries use natural
resources wealth, but natural resources wealth can also affect the quality of institutions, creating therefore a
dynamic (negative) relationship between resource dependence and institutional quality, as illustrated in De
Rosa and Iootty (2012).

According to a variety of governance indicators, Mozambique’s institutions are relatively weak – raising
concerns about the country’s ability to manage natural resources well. In the Mozambican context, it is
difficult to predict how the present institutions will cope with the presumably large future influx of revenue
from coal and gas, although a look at some governance indicators suggests that weak governance, broadly
understood, is likely to become a constraint in the management of natural resources. According to the World
Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators6, which include government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of
law, control of corruption, political stability and voice and accountability, Mozambique belongs to the second
quarter from the bottom for all indicators except political stability in which Mozambique belongs in the third
quarter. Mozambique’s scores are always slightly above the regional average except in political stability and
voice and accountability, in which it scores significantly better than its peers in the region (Table 4). On the
international comparison index Polity4 that measures constraints on the executive as a proxy for democracy,
Mozambique has a similar position globally scoring 5 on a scale that goes from -10 (autocracy) to 10
(democracy). Other countries around the same position include Haiti, Pakistan, Malawi and Nigeria. These
indicators draw a general picture of concern about the capabilities of Mozambique to handle large resource
rents. However, a weak starting point does not pre-determine the final outcome: capacity and institutions can
be built. Democratic elections, free press and a vocal civil society speak in favor of a gradual strengthening of
institutions of which there is already some signs; in 2012 Mozambique was declared compliant with the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), a strong signal of increased transparency in managing
revenues from natural resources. That it is not impossible to strengthen the institutional capacity prior to
resource booms has already been shown in countries that had similarly low capacity levels such as Botswana
two decades ago or Sao Tome and Principe or East Timor more recently. A whole set of countries is currently
embarked on implementing reforms to better manage natural resources which greatly broadens the
possibilities for peer to peer learning.

 The Worldwide Governance Indicators reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for 215 economies over the period
1996–2011, for six dimensions of governance: (i) Voice and Accountability, (ii) Political Stability and Absence of Violence, (iii)
Government Effectiveness, (iv) Regulatory Quality, (v) Rule of Law, and (vi) Control of Corruption. These aggregate indicators combine
the views of a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. They are based
on 30 individual data sources produced by a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international
organizations, and private sector firms. The scores run from -2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to better governance. For

There are three main areas in which Mozambique will need to get policies right: (i) efficient resource
extraction to maximize resource rents, (ii) a fiscal regime that balances the interests of companies and the
Government, and (iii) effective investment of resource rents in productive assets. This policy note has
focused on highlighting the need for Mozambique to translate natural resources into other forms of capital, to
avoid the development path taken by many resource-rich countries, that have depleted their natural resources
without necessarily increasing other forms of capital. Countries seeking to translate their natural resources into
other forms of capital have to get policies in three key areas straight: (i) policies to ensure an efficient resource
extraction to maximize resource rents, (ii) a fiscal regime that balances the interests of companies and
governments while enabling government to recover a fair share of the rents, and (iii) a clear policy for
investment of resource rents in productive assets. While each country will need to design a policy framework
that is appropriate to country circumstances, there are a number of elements that should be reflected (the
following is based on the discussion in Mayorga Alba, 2009):

Mozambique will need a clear legal, regulatory and contractual framework for the exploration and
exploitation of the country’s petroleum and mining resources. This should clearly define the role of the state,
providing investors with the needed security, comprehensive environmental protection requirements and a
framework for fiscal terms. The law should clearly differentiate between the roles of the state as a regulator
and an investor, providing a clear distinction of responsibilities to avoid conflicts of interest. The policy
framework should also take into account the country’s specific circumstances and inherent risks. Transparent,
competitive and non-discretionary procedures will be necessary to attract investment and provide stability to
the system. Most countries use ‘local content’ requirements which can improve the project’s e conomic and
social benefits to the country, although if not well designed, taking into account local supply constraints, they
can introduce additional risks and costs, jeopardizing the viability of investments. Mozambique will also need
the capability to enforce the legal and regulatory framework being established, a concern of policy makers
given skills and resources scarcity. Mozambique is currently revising the legislation governing mining and
petroleum, with draft legislations already approved by the Government and sent to parliament for approval.

Mozambique will need a stable and fair fiscal regime that takes into account the country’s administrative
capacity and fosters transparency. The fiscal terms determining how economic rents are shared between the
government and investors are often set in the law, with some elements sometimes reserved for contracts or
licenses, particularly in the petroleum sector. The system should foster transparency and a comprehensive
recording of all transactions, with revenue from extractive industries regularly published by the government.
The choice of the fiscal regime needs to take into account Mozambique’s administrative capacity. In addition to
a stable and fair fiscal regime, Mozambique will also need to build a strong administrative and audit capacity in
the relevant institutions, to be able to efficiently collect revenues. Mozambique should also adopt
internationally accepted accounting and reporting standards developed to deal with key financial accounting
and reporting issues unique to the extractive industries (e.g. transfer pricing). The fiscal terms should be
progressive but also simple to administer – particularly in a relatively weak institutional environment. The fiscal
terms can evolve over time as uncertainty over the commercial viability of resources (e.g. through availability
of newly built infrastructure) as well as country risks are mitigated. How the fairness of the distribution of
economic rents between investors and the Government is perceived often determines the stability of both


                                                         25
contracts and the framework as a whole. Mozambique is currently revising its fiscal regime for both petroleum
and mining. It would be important to ensure that the elements discussed above, particularly on a balanced
sharing of economic rents between government and investors as well as the need for transparency, are taken
into account. Mozambique has also recently become compliant with the EITI, which requires Mozambique to
disclose all payments from companies active in the extractive industry.

Finally, Mozambique will also need to define a clear policy framework to effectively invest resource rents in
productive assets. That framework would help decide how much to save from the revenues of extractive
industries and how much to spend, as well as contribute to improved public spending, e.g. through an
enhanced system for appraisal and implementation of public investment projects7. For natural resources
revenue management systems to be long-lasting, it is important to design institutional arrangements that
foster transparency and sound governance, this is particularly important for the operation of sovereign wealth
funds or any other savings arrangements. Key for improved management of public resources and improved
allocation of public expenditure is the preparation of an MTEF that reflects the country’s priorities as well as
clear, rule-based and transparent arrangements that govern the sharing of revenue between the central and
local governments, particularly those where extractive industries are located.

Coordination, both within government and with other key stakeholders, will be key to advance this relatively
broad reform agenda. This section has discussed some of the challenges that Mozambique will face to improve
natural resources management and to be able to translate natural capital into other forms of capital. The
breadth and depth of reforms to be implemented, in a relatively weak capacity environment, is illustrative of
the difficulties in managing natural resources well and partly explains why many countries have failed to
efficiently invest resource rents into other forms of capital. The breadth of the reforms to be implemented also
calls for intense coordination between all relevant stakeholders, with some ministries taking a lead role in
some reform areas (e.g. MIREM on sector regulation or MoF on the fiscal framework). While intra-government
coordination will be key, coordination with other stakeholders will be equally important, such as coordination
with the parliament, local governments, civil society and the private sector, both domestic and foreign.


    5. Conclusions

GDP measures income, not wealth, and it does not provide accurate information for how a country is
managing its assets. This is particularly relevant for resource rich countries, which often grow rapidly by
depleting their wealth. Most countries use GDP or GNI to collect and measure wellbeing, but these are
measures of income that a country derives from its wealth, not wealth per se, and the sustainability of GDP
growth depends to a large extent on the use that countries do of their wealth. Wealth is divided into three

 This policy note is part of a broader program of analytical support from the World Bank with a focus on enhanced public expenditure,
the focus of this third policy area being discussed. A set of other analytical pieces will cover a number of aspects – such as natural
resources revenue management, a public expenditure review or technical assistance on public investment management. As such, the
discussion on these areas has been more limited in this policy note since it will be covered in greater detail in other work.


                                                                  26
types of wealth, produced capital, natural capital and intangible capital (which includes both human capital and
institutional development) and many successful countries have developed by translating their natural capital
into other forms of capital – investing in both physical and human capital. There is a positive relationship
between wealth and GDP growth, as wealth grows, so does the income derived from that wealth. But the
relationship is not always positive, and resource rich countries can grow for a period of time by depleting their
natural resources wealth – without necessarily investing it. This growth path is unsustainable and likely to lead
to lower growth and wellbeing in the future. Natural resources or rapid growth does not guarantee improved
welfare for a country’s population – this often being the result of investments in physical and human capital as
well as institutions that allow people to share in the benefits of growth. The quality of governance seems to be
a key determinant in the relationship between natural resources wealth and growth and also determining the
use that countries do of their wealth and whether they embark on sustainable growth paths.

Countries that have managed their natural resources well have invested a large share of the income derived
from exploiting non-renewable resources. The sustainability of consumption is determined by the level of
consumption and investments that countries chose. Consumption can only be maintained if rents from non-
renewable resources are invested. Countries that do so, such as Botswana, which has institutionalized this
approach in its sustainable budget index (SBI), invest a significant share of the rents from natural resources on
other forms of capital and witness a significant growth in their wealth over time. They also tend to grow faster
over longer periods of time, while countries with low investment ratios show limited growth over the long
term. Other countries have been exploiting natural resources for a generation or more and have little to show
for it by way of wellbeing of their populations. Low investment levels are often behind this poor performance.
But for sustainability of growth and wealth creation – it matters not only how much a country invests but also
how well it does. The quality of public investment to a large extent determines the impact of investment on
growth, and Mozambique seems to have a relatively poor public investment management system, highlighting
the need to improve the public investment system. Poor management of natural resources will probably lead
to a significant waste in scarce resources, but it can also lead to poorer governance, macroeconomic instability
and in worst case scenarios social conflict.

Commercial development of the gas fields and coal deposits will more than double wealth in Mozambique –
but despite these developments Mozambique will remain one of the poorest countries in the region. The
sustainable development of the gas and coal sectors in Mozambique has the potential of significantly
increasing wealth. When taking the likely development of the large coal and gas deposits in the north and
center of the country into account, per capita wealth more than doubles. Wealth will only increase if the
sectors are developed as planned, since these natural resources are worth only as much as their commercial
value. In other words, the country will only be able to derive an income of these assets if they can be
commercially developed. Despite this newly discovered wealth Mozambique continues to be one of the
poorest countries in the region.

Mozambique, as many other countries in Africa, seems to have grown in the last decade by depleting its
natural resources. To ensure a sustainable growth path, Mozambique should invest a higher share of its
income on both human and physical capital. Over time, the share of productive over natural capital in


                                                       27
Mozambique has been declining and the share of produced capital in total wealth in Mozambique is one of the
lowest in the region, highlighting the need to invest resource rents into other forms of capital: public
infrastructure as well as improvements in the provision of health and education public services. Over the last
decade, adjusted net savings, a measure to analyze the sustainability of growth, has been negative. Only in the
past few years has ANS turned positive although it remains relatively low. This is in line with developments in
many other resource rich countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, which seem to have achieved relatively high growth
by depleting its natural resources.

To ensure that a large share of the rents from natural resources is invested, Mozambique may want to adopt
a fiscal policy framework that takes the particular characteristics of natural resources revenues into account.
Most countries with nascent extractive industries need to reform the institutions and structures in place to
manage natural resources better, including the adoption of a fiscal policy framework that addresses the
challenges of natural resources revenues. The success and effectiveness of such institutions depend largely on
the general institutional environment in which they are established. Mozambique’s institutions are relatively
weak – raising concerns about the country’s ability to manage natural resources well. Particularly in the case of
cash-strapped countries, such as is the case in Mozambique, there will be pressure to consume a large share of
the resource rents to improve the well-being of the population in the short term, limiting the ability of the
government to allocate a large share of the revenue for investment and to better manage issues particular to
natural resources management such as volatility and the finite nature of natural resources.

The policy framework for managing the mining and petroleum sectors may also need to be reformed, to
ensure the sustainable development of the sectors and that Mozambique is able to capture a fair share of
the rents from coal and gas. The objective of this policy note, rather than proposing a set of readily
implementable policy recommendations, is to generate policy dialogue and debate about the need to translate
natural resources into other forms of capital. There are three main areas in which Mozambique will need to get
policies right: (i) the definition of a clear legal, regulatory and contractual framework for the exploration and
exploitation of the country’s natural resources, (ii) a fiscal regime that balances the interests of companies and
governments and is in line with the country’s administrative capacities, and (iii) a clear policy framework to
effectively invest resource rents into other forms of capital (human, institutional and physical. Coordination,
both within government and with other key stakeholders, will be key to advance this relatively broad reform
agenda as well as a focus on enhancing the capacity of the government to design this broad reform agenda and
the capacity to monitor enforcement.

Annex II. Constructing the Mozambique Wealth Accounts

Published in 2011, The Changing Wealth of Nations (CWON) presented a global dataset of comprehensive
wealth accounts for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005. The World Bank team carried out another update to the
wealth database later in 2011, adding the year 2008 to the wealth accounts. These 2008 estimates, though
used internally, are not yet published.

For this policy note, the team wants to use the most up-to-date data for Mozambique. Given the immense task
and time required to complete another full update to the comprehensive wealth accounts to include the latest
years 2010 and 2011, the team decided to use the previously updated database (which includes the year 2008)
as a baseline and prioritize the components to update for 2010 and 2011 for Mozambique only. The following
is a summary of the approach in creating the Mozambique comprehensive wealth accounts, which include
years 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2011. All data are reported in constant 2005 US$.

Total Wealth
The total wealth component was updated for years 1995, 2000, and 2005, and also included years 2010 and
2011, drawing from the most recently available data (up to 2011) from the World Development Indicators
(World Bank) as well as World Bank staff projections.

Total wealth is calculated as

                   
           Wt   C s   e r s t ds
                   t
where Wt is the total value of wealth, or capital, in year t ; C(s) is consumption in year s; and r is the social rate
of return to investment. The social rate of return to investment is expressed as (Ramsey Formula):




                                                                   32
                      
                 C
        r   
                 C
where ρ is the pure rate of time preference and η is the elasticity of utility with respect to consumption. The
standard World Bank approach (as used in CWON), is to assume that   1and that consumption grows at a
constant rate, allowing the total wealth to be expressed as
                
        Wt   C t   e   s t ds                                             (A.1)
                t


The total wealth at time t is a function of the consumption at time t and the pure rate of time preference;
therefore, total wealth can be calculated independently from the growth rate of consumption. For
computation purposes, the pure rate of time preference is assumed to be 1.5 percent, and the time horizon is
limited to 25 years. This time horizon roughly corresponds to a generation. The 25-year truncation is used
throughout the calculation of wealth, in particular, of natural capital. While the CWON uses a five-year
centered average in order to smooth consumption when calculating wealth in a given year, this note uses a
five-year lagged average in order to use the latest available data.

The methodology in this policy note allows for a variable growth rate of consumption, given the changes in the
structure of the economy projected to occur with the rise in subsoil extraction. Therefore, rather than
assuming that consumption will grow at a constant rate, the estimates account for the actual future
consumption stream as projected by World Bank staff. This change to the methodology creates an issue of
what social rate of return to investment (r) to use when calculating wealth. For simplicity, the estimates
continue to use equation (A.1) to estimate total wealth, therefore using 1.5%. A more precise approach would
be to estimate total wealth using r, which is a function of ρ and the consumption growth rate, still assuming
elasticity is 1.

Expression (A.1) implicitly assumes that consumption is on a sustainable path, that is, the level of saving is
enough to offset the depletion of natural resources.

Sustainable consumption is the consumption level that leaves the capital stock intact. So if depletion adjusted
savings (gross savings minus consumption of fixed capital and mineral, energy, and net forest depletion) is
negative, then the capital stock is being run down. Sustainable consumption would then be estimated as final
consumption expenditure minus the amount of depletion adjusted savings. But if depletion adjusted savings is
positive, then final consumption expenditure is considered sustainable consumption.

The following table summarizes the data sources and gap-filling measures for the indicators required to build a
stream of future sustainable consumption:

While natural gas resource rent [ (unit price – unit cost) x total production ] was calculated consistently with
the CWON methodology, the wealth calculations were adjusted in order to reflect the projected increases in
gas production, which would significantly affect the future rent stream. Wealth is estimated as the present
value of resource rents, where the discount rate is 4% and the time horizon of extraction is capped at 25 years.
While the standard WB approach is to assume a constant stream of future rents when estimating wealth, the
estimates in this policy note accounted for future variability by using the projected rent stream, going up to
year 2035.

Hard Coal: Using the most recently available data, hard coal wealth was updated for years 1995, 2000, and
2005, and also included years 2010 and 2011. The following table shows how country data were used to
update the accounts and provide more accurate information:

  When combining World Bank international price for natural gas (source: World Bank Commodity Price Data) and the country data,
there was a significant jump (decrease) in the series from 2006 to 2007, going from WB source to country estimate. This was not the
result of gas prices declining, but a result of different types of gas. Whereas the World Bank estimates use an international price for
natural gas, the country data series is based on actual prices from Sasol to South Africa via pipeline, which are significantly lower than
LNG prices. Therefore in order to capture the approach gas price in Mozambique, the note uses the earliest country data point (year
2007) as the baseline for previous years and constructs the historic series using the MUV index as a deflator.
