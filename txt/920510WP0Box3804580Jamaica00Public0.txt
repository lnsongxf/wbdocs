THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        BuildCo must obtain approval of building plans from the Planning
        Authority, the Fire Department, the National Environment and Planning
        Agency (NEPA), and other authorities concerned. Several documents
        are required to obtain this approval, including a property title and
        proof of ownership. Approval is valid for 2 years and can be renewed.

        To obtain approval, BuildCo files the drawings with the municipality.
        Four meetings are held to review the drawings:
        • Fire
   1    • Health                                                                   120 days        JMD 506,448

        • A general meeting after all others are completed and NEPA approval
        is received

        Each meeting has a set date, normally one per week sequentially. If
        there is a holiday, the meeting will be postponed. If BuildCo misses a
        meeting, the whole process will be prolonged.

        Meanwhile, BuildCo files the same document with the National
        Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) for approval of the plans. In
        simple cases, the approval takes 10 workings days. In complicated

        When the service order is generated, the parish office is informed and a
        team dispatched to conduct site visit which includes easement needed to
        ensure that construction process will not be held up and time and other
        resources are not spent unnecessarily. The findings from the inspection
        will be entered into a database that has predefined measurements based
        on the regular, current and projected factors that facilitate the successful

        Via Registered Licensed Electrician, the relevant inspection fees are paid
        at the Government Collectorate Office. Payment receipt accompanied
        with the relevant application forms are submitted to GEI's office for
        review and site inspection. Inspection is scheduled with the Electrician
        (normally done within 2 weeks).

        The inspector conducts the internal wiring inspection based on the
        Jamaican 21 standard. If the customer premises structure of internal
   2    wiring used is accepted, the record of the inspection and results is           21 calendar days          JMD 0
        recorded and the relevant information based on size, type and location
        of customer premises is sent to JPS. In cases where the internal wiring is
        not accepted, the customer is informed and has to restart the process.

      * Submit application to Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo)
      and await site visit

      At the Application stage, applicants are only required to submit an
      application letter stating the following: Name & Contact details, address
      where service is required, when service is required, load details of major
      equipment, to be used in new/expanded facility - rating in kilovolt

      should state details of load balancing for a 3 phase supply ( a single line
      drawing and copies of GEI Report/Certificate is normally accepted, but is
      not a requirement at this stage of the process).

      Receive site inspection and await estimate from JPSCo

      When the service order is generated, the Engineering Team is informed
      in the case of complex connections to conduct a site visit. The site visit is
      conducted to determine the site layout and the requirements that will
      have to be met to supply the customer with electricity. Requirements
      include number of poles, transformers, length of conductor among
      other items that will be needed. A drawing is prepared of the site layout,
      to outline to the Easement team, any situations that may require legal
      action or reference and the reasoning behind such action; as well as the
      Construction Team, to facilitate the successful execution of the
      development process. The findings from the site visit will be entered into
      an application that has predefined measurements based on the regular,
      current and projected factors that facilitate the successful completion of
      any particular job. The result will determine the final estimate. This cost is 18 calendar days       JMD 0

      communicated to the customer. [This particular case is not considered as
      such to warrant the inclusion of easement costs in total estimate, but in a
      many cases, a provision is made for such costs when an electrical
      equipment other than a service wire may need to be placed on a
      customer's or connecting customer's premises to successfully execute
      the construction process].
      In short, the process is as below:
      1. Engineering team conducts site inspection and determines site layout
      and other requirements to meet customer's supply needs.
      2. A drawing of the site layout is prepared and easement requirements
      noted, where necessary.
      3. Estimate reflecting the costs for material and labour is prepared.
      4. This cost is communicated to the customer.

        3. It is at this stage that GEI certification for the customer facility is also
        required. Such certification is normally submitted directly to JPS from
        the GEI's Office.
        4. Upon confirmation of GEI certification for both the customer's facility

      The transfer instrument needs to be witnessed, according to section 152
      of the Registration of Title Act (Attestation of Instrument), by any of the
      following: the Governor-General, any of the Judges of the Supreme
      Court, or any Justice of the Peace, or the Registrar under this Act, or a
      Notary Public, or a Solicitor of the Supreme Court. The instrument of
      transfer must be witnessed prior to submitting the document to cross
      stamping, and before submitting for registration at the Land Registry.          1 day             50 USD

      The Act lists several functionaries including the Justice of the Peace and
      Attorney of Law and Notary Public. The Notary Public charges a fee but
      the Justice of Peace does not charge a fee. A notary will charge around
      50 USD for this operation. If a lawyer is involved in the entire process, he
      can act as a witness.

                    Jamaica improved access to credit by establishing credit
                    bureaus and by adopting a new secured transactions law that
                    implements a functional secured transactions system, broadens
                    the range of assets that can be used as collateral, allows a
                    general description of assets granted as collateral and
                    establishes a modern, notice-based collateral registry. Jamaica
