the rise. Importers and exporters are experiencing
an increasing level of government transparency.
Customs operations are nearly fully automated
and border clearance times have been drastically
reduced. As a crowning achievement—and after 15
years of negotiations—Lao PDR is now a member
of the WTO, with its eyes set on establishing
itself as an equal partner in the ASEAN Economic
Community (AEC). The situation has improved to
such an extent that the country has become a
model for other LDCs undertaking trade reform.
Optimism is in the air, and reformers know that
having come so far there is still a tremendous
amount to be done.

Within the context of a complex and largely
incomplete transition from a planned to a market
economy, the strides taken by the Lao government
in the relatively niche area of trade policy reform
and trade facilitation merit attention. In particular,
the political will and commitment to press for
trade reforms in such a low capacity environment
have resulted in a string of successes that are
well-documented by departments within the Lao
government and by their donor counterparts.

And yet, outside these circles, this string of
successes is not well known. The country still
has many visceral challenges to overcome. Trade
reform is much less visible, quite often not a
front-page story, and rarely capable of changing
people’s fortunes overnight. Rather, it is a process
of deliberate, subtle changes that over time provide
the atmosphere for a country to bloom— and Lao
PDR is blooming. Understanding the scope and
scale of reform that has occurred in order for the
country to reach this point is not always easy.
Without looking back over the last few years,
without peering deeper into the structures that
have changed—it is possible to miss just how
remarkable this story truly is.

a broad scope, one that would require changes in
governance, operational models, and technical
architecture.

The exercise began in mid-summer 2011,
immediately disrupting the status quo. Ministries
with contradicting regulations were forced to
reconcile inconsistencies in a massive streamlining
effort. This ensured that only final, polished
versions of regulations were posted on the portal.
For procedures that had previously been either
unformalized or nonexistent, new protocols were
created. In effect, the project quickly became one
not just of aggregating information, but also of
creating information, with anything posted on
the portal representing the utmost legitimacy for
government and traders alike.

The Lao Trade Portal (LTP) was officially launched
on June 22, 2012, twelve months after the start of
the project. The portal offers extensive instructions
to traders in Lao and English, and allows them to
target queries to specific government agencies.
Since its inception, the LTP has increased voluntary
compliance amongst traders, by significantly
reducing the amount of time needed to track
down accurate information, as well as reducing the
likelihood that they follow inaccurate procedures
or incorrectly interpret laws and regulations.
Traders no longer have to make multiple trips to
government ministries to complete a transaction.

The LTP has been instrumental in helping Lao PDR
comply with WTO and ASEAN commitments that
require member countries to make their trade-
related regulations publicly available and easily
accessible. The NTFS has instituted a network
of contact points within each agency to monitor
changes in laws, regulations, or procedures and
ensure they are reflected on the portal in a timely

What can other client countries learn
from the Lao trade program?

In the case of the Lao trade program, the ownership
of the process lay squarely on the shoulders of the
MoIC. The core people working on the program
came from within the Ministry, creating a culture
not of outside people spending outside money with
outside intentions, but rather of the Government
implementing its own program with donors
supporting them in that process.

Thus, other LDCs can learn a lot from the
experiences in Lao PDR, not by being told simply
to “take ownership”, but by understanding the
capacity building elements at the more granular
and pragmatic level that helped foster country
ownership. Increasing capacity is a component
of every development strategy, but with regard
to trade reform in Lao PDR, it was truly effective.
Why?

Phouvieng’s team called the shots, as well as in
the administration of the Lao Trade Portal project,
which was implemented by a young and dynamic
team of MoIC professionals with the guidance
(but not managerial control) of a technical advisor
whom they themselves vetted and chose.

Due diligence in the process of vetting and placing
a technical advisor is imperative. Merely scanning
curricula vitae and conducting phone interviews is
unlikely to lead to the best selection of a candidate.
Personality and personal constitution are key traits
that merit deeper consideration. Technical advisors
can serve many roles beyond simply TA. For
instance, they can serve as conduits through which
managers and ministers within the government,
who must be cognizant of certain political realities,
can push through change. Provided the level of
trust is deeply ingrained and genuine, an embedded
technical advisor can deliver hard messages, and
have them be seen as coming from someone
internally, who has been part of the reform struggle.
And finally, the situation may call for a TA that
can act as a much needed, and preferably willing,
safety valve to protect young reformers and those
taking risks when putting forward controversial or
drastic proposals.

Yet, from the perspective of the World Bank, the
trade program in Lao PDR thus far—these first few
chapters—has been a tremendously positive story.
Not only has it begun to deliver real results, but it
represents the fruits of what genuine long-term
country engagement on trade can realistically
achieve. The ends are not analytics, investment
lending, and policy dialogue. These are the means.
And in the Lao trade story, as the second chapter of
the TDF turns a new page, one sees strong evidence
of confident central characters with the capacity
to effectively manage aid-for-trade resources.

Of course, with WTO accession now achieved,
the overarching and tangible goal that drove
the process forward for over a decade is gone.
Complacency is a real threat, especially if the
MoIC allows its influence and convening power to
dwindle in the absence of such a clear mandate.
But sustaining its reform momentum presents
Lao PDR with an opportunity to prove doubters
wrong. The accession process was not a superficial
undertaking. By demonstrating its commitment
to maintaining a WTO-consistent regulatory
framework, Lao PDR can reveal a deeper
understanding that accession was not an end in
itself, but a broader means of building economic
competitiveness. Meeting its WTO commitments
and fulfilling its pending regional commitments in
the ASEAN Economic Community should provide
healthy incentives.

Mme Khemmani sums it up wisely: “How can you
call it a success story, there are still a million things
to do!”
