     Pretoria
     *On starting a business, each city is ranked either 1 or 4 because the only diﬀerence between cities is their proximity to the oﬃce of the Compensation Fund (Department of Labor) in
     Pretoria. Entrepreneurs from Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg and Tshwane conduct the registration of their employees at the Pretoria oﬃce and these cities rank equally at the top. In the
     other cities the process takes longer as the applications are ﬁrst submitted to the local labor centers, then forwarded to the provincial oﬃces and then to Pretoria. These cities are
     equally ranked at number 4, just behind the 3 cities ranked at the top.
     Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) score shows how far on average an economy is at any given point in time from the best performance achieved by any economy on each Doing
     Business indicator since 2005. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better). For

         that aims at supporting the 8 largest urban
         municipalities in (a) strengthening the
         capacity of cities to improve the delivery
         of human settlements and public transport
         functions; (b) strengthening their core
         spatial planning functions; (c) strengthening
         governance, including ﬁnancial management
         and social management; and (d) improving
         environmental outcomes by, among other
         things, mainstreaming climate resilience
         measures. All of these initiatives are
         underpinned and informed by a need to
         strengthen economic development and
         growth. This report was initiated to support
         the CSP in working with these 8 cities to
         improve their business environment and
         increase competitiveness.

     NOTES
     1.   The focus of the Doing Business indicators
          remains the regulatory regime faced by
          domestic ﬁrms engaging in economic activity
          in the largest business city of an economy.
          Doing Business was not initially designed
          to inform decisions by foreign investors,
          though investors may in practice ﬁnd the
          data useful as a proxy for the quality of the
          national investment climate. Analysis done
          in the World Bank Group’s Global Indicators
          Group has shown that countries that have
          sensible rules for domestic economic activity
          also tend to have good rules for the activities
          of foreign subsidiaries engaged in the local
          economy.

          indicator area benchmarked in the report

          DC. Principal components and unobserved
          components methods yield a ranking nearly
          identical to that from the simple average
          method because both these methods assign
          roughly equal weights to the topics, since
          the pairwise correlations among indicators
          do not diﬀer much. An alternative to the
          simple average method is to give diﬀerent
          weights to the topics, depending on which
          are considered of more or less importance in
          the context of a speciﬁc economy.

     2 1.   In Ekurhuleni the utility allows bank
            guarantees only for certain types of
            customers and only for one third of the
            amount of the security deposit.
     22.    Doing Business distinguishes between
            two cases: connecting to the low-voltage
            network and connecting to the medium-
            voltage network. The ﬁrst case involves
            laying low-voltage underground cables or
            installing low-voltage overhead wires from
            the metering point to the closest connection
            point on the network. The second case
            usually occurs when the capacity of the
            utility’s low-voltage network cannot
            accommodate the power demand of a
            customer. This case involves installing a
            distribution transformer and connecting
            it between the customer’s installation
            and the utility’s medium-voltage network.
            According to the standardized case study,
            the customer requests a nontrivial but still
            relatively modest 140-kilovolt-ampere (kVA)
            connection. By comparison, the demand of
            a residential connection is about 20 kVA.

      BOX 6.1 Quality of land administration in South Africa
      The South African land administration system has established veriﬁcation practices and procedures (prescribed by the
      Deeds Registries Act 47 of 1937), which ensure legal security of land transactions involving registered lands.a The validity
      and authenticity of the registration process in the deeds registries are backed and upheld by the courts. Surveying is under-
      taken exclusively by registered professional land surveyors who submit documents to Surveyors-General for examination
      and approval. The deeds registries and the Surveyor-General’s Oﬃce mainly interact when there is a change to the property,
      such as a redeﬁnition of the boundaries. In instances where the property is subdivided as part of the transfer transaction,
      the property will be surveyed and the Surveyor-General’s Oﬃce will produce a new diagram to update the deeds registries’
      parcel records. Deeds registries across South Africa follow the same process to verify and approve transfer deeds ﬁled by
      conveyancers (see ﬁgure below). The registries have a workﬂow tracking system—each deed has an assigned bar code that
      is scanned as ﬁles are moved from one location to another. Deeds are ﬁrst taken to the data unit to check the property
      number against the registry’s database and link the transfer deed number with the conveyancer’s registered ﬁrm number.
      Subsequently, handlers print out information to accompany the transfer deed. The deed is then passed on to a dispatch unit
      that scans and delivers the ﬁle to examiners tasked with checking for transfer conditions included in the deed and compli-
      ance requirements.

      Transfer deeds are checked by three levels of examiners at the deeds registries to verify compliance and accuracy of the
      data. Junior level examiners check that all documents necessary for the transfer have been included and signed by the autho-
      rized signatory. Senior level examiners check for overall accuracy of the work done by junior level examiners. Lastly, assistant
      registrars monitor the quality of the examinations performed by both levels of examiners. Once the examination process has
      certiﬁed that the transfer deed is valid, the conveyancer will sign the transfer deed before the registrar or deputy registrar at
      the deeds registry. When the deed is signed, the property is legally transferred to the new owner.

      The process to approve transfer deeds is the same in all deeds registries across South Africab

      The amount of land covered by the registry is one of the main pillars of the quality of land administration. The utility of
      even the most reliable and transparent land administration system will be undermined if it covers only a limited area of the
      economy. Around the world, 27% of economies have a registry with full coverage of private land and 34% have a mapping
      system with complete coverage.c The maps and diagrams registered with the Surveyor-General Oﬃces cover all territories of
      South Africa, and information is available online on the Chief Surveyor-General’s website.d According to the Chief Surveyor-
      General’s Oﬃce, up to 90% of individual private properties are formally registered. But it is estimated that between 25% and
      30% of the population live on the remaining unregistered land.e

NOTES
1.   The Doing Business 2015 data for
     Johannesburg for starting a business
     and dealing with construction permits
     have been revised and updated since the
     publication of the Doing Business 2015: Going
     Beyond Efficiency global report. The complete
     data set can be obtained from the Doing
     Business website: www.doingbusiness.org
2.   There are no subnational distance
     to frontier (DTF) ranking for South
     African ports, but the report compares
     Johannesburg internationally.
3.   While diﬀerent types of containers are used
     around the world, the 2 most important
     are 20-foot and 40-foot containers. Use
     of 40-foot containers is growing, but this
     year’s research conﬁrms that 20-foot
     containers are still common in the majority
     of economies. According to respondents
     questioned in each of the 189 economies
     covered by Doing Business, 20-foot and
     40-foot containers are equally common in
     49% of the economies, 20-foot containers
     are more common in 29%, and 40-foot
     containers are mostly relied on in only 10%.
     For the remaining 12% of economies no
     data on the use of the 2 types of containers
     were available. The trading across borders
     indicators will continue to be based on 20-
     foot containers because this size remains
     the most relevant for international trade
     across the globe.
