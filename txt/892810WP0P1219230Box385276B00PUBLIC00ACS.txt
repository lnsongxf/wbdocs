    	SUMMARY




         Entrepreneurship and innovation in agribusiness offer tremendous opportunities for many developing
         countries. Yet few instruments exist to help low-income countries with a comparative advantage in
         agriculture advance the competitiveness and growth of local growth-oriented companies. Agribusiness
         incubation—a holistic service focused on enabling the growth of innovative early-stage enterprises—is
         one vehicle that can be utilized. However, agribusiness incubation can also go terribly wrong if not
         carefully designed and implemented.

	   AGRIBUSINESS TRAINING


                  Direct results: degree of satisfaction
  5.1
                  The following section analyzes the direct results, meaning the level of satisfaction
                  of participants with training delivery and quality, as well as the usefulness of the
                  training. This includes relevance of the content, quality of the delivery, overall
                  usefulness of the training and appropriateness of the training approach.




   Key Findings
   	
   • The direct results of the agribusiness training can be rated as a success. More than 90%
     of participants state that the training met their expectations.
   • Aspects that are valued particularly positive are the quality of the trainers, the training 			
     methodology and the case studies provided during the training sessions.
   • The only negative aspect pointed out was the limited time available for the agribusiness
     module. Participants perceived that they were “rushed through” the module and would
     like to receive further and more in- depth training in this topic.

               Key Findings
               	
               • The infoDev training is the only agribusiness incubation training available to the majority of 		
                 respondents.
               • Participants stress the value of the training methodology, its interactivity and the usefulness and
                 relevance of the examples that are provided.
               • The possibility to network and interact with stakeholders from different regions has been highly 	
                 valued, especially at the trainings of the Global Forum.




     In total, only 12,5% of respondents knew about a similar training offered elsewhere by other organizations.
     Thus, the infoDev training is the only relevant training course available to the majority of respondents and
     is thus in an excellent competitive position.

                 Conclusions and
5.5              Recommendations
                 Based on the findings of the Outcome Assessment, the training has successfully
                 reached the training objectives. It has proven successful in conveying the fundamentals
                 of agribusiness innovation as well as the agribusiness incubator business models.



Participants also emphasized the knowledge acquired with regard to value chains and how these have
transformed their activities. The last key objective to promote networking and next steps required to
implement and improve the incubator’s scope and operation are also being successfully fulfilled by
the training. Important outcomes from the training are improved networking and contacts, as well
as improved service delivery subsequent to the training.

Based on the results of the Outcome Assessment, the following aspects could still be improved
further to use the results of the training sessions even more:

     Annex
     Assessment methodology


     Approach and rationale
     The assessment consisted of three parts:



                  Desk review of infoDev brochures and training materials, as well as existing training reports

      1           elaborated by infoDev staff and training delivery partners. These short reports contain information
                  about training participants, as well as basic evaluation data from questionnaires filled in directly
                  by trainees subsequent to the training events.



                  Primary data collection was conducted in two ways:
      2
                  (i) An online survey was sent to 121 training participants from 25 countries by email. 32 participants
                  from 14 countries (Burundi, Senegal, Kenya, South Africa, England , Ghana, Australia, France, Mali,
                  Nepal, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, and Kazakhstan) responded to the survey, which represents a
                  response rate of 25%.

                  (ii) The online survey was complemented by 16 in-depth interviews conducted face-to-face in
                  Mozambique, South Africa and Kenya, and via phone calls with Thailand, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda
                  and Burundi. As the six participants interviewed by phone have also participated in the survey, the
                  Outcome Assessment relies on information from 40 participants, representing a total of 27% of all
                  training participants.

                  This approach of combining online survey with in-depth interviews was chosen because the
                  survey provides comparable output and outcome data on the training sessions, while the in-
                  depth interviews imply a degree of interaction that makes it possible to understand the behavioral
                  changes generated in the trainees’ work subsequent to the training. In-depth interviews were also
                  appropriate to gain insights into potential impacts on the incubation ecosystem in the participants’
                  countries of origin.



                  Data analysis: The answers to the survey were tabulated and analyzed statistically. This statistical
      3           analysis has been complemented with in-depth interviews that have been used as a qualitative tool
                  to get deeper insights about the effects that generated, and how and why they occurred.




       7 Evaluation reports exist for the trainings in India 2011, Uganda 2013 and Senegal 2013. For the Global Forums 2011 and 2013, as well as the

       trainings in Burundi 2013 and Mozambique 2013, no data are available.

Selection of interviewees and survey participants
The online survey was sent to all training participants for whom email addresses were available and
that had not been interviewed in person during field visits. As mentioned, 25% of these participants
answered the survey, which is the sample that was analyzed for the Outcome Assessment. The
sample is illustrative, as respondents come from all types of stakeholder groups , as well as all type
of training events that have been delivered so far.

                                                        Distribution of respondents by training session



     For face-to-face interviews conducted during the field mission to Mozambique, South Africa and Kenya,
     trainees were chosen based on availability for an interview. For the in-depth phone interviews, purposeful
     sampling based on the responses to the online survey was used. The rationale for this choice is that the
     Outcome Assessment should mainly serve infoDev to learn to what extent their trainings contribute to build
     capacity when it comes to setting up Agribusiness Innovation Centers or improving existing agribusiness
     incubators. Therefore, interviewees with a higher potential to provide substantial insights were chosen.
     This method is usually applied when the objective is to study information-rich cases in depth.
     After completion of data collection, the information was processed and analyzed according to the three levels
     of analysis: immediate effects; short and mid-term effects and long-term effects and impact prospects.




     Specific aspects and considerations

     While this Outcome Assessment is specifically dedicated to Module 12 of the Business Incubation
     Management Training Program, many of the trainees have participated in additional modules, especially
     modules 1 and 2, which are the basic business incubation modules. Answers from the participants,
     especially answers associated to the application of learning and potential impacts, include participation
     in all training modules.

     In addition, it is worth mentioning that five of the seven training events took place in 2013 and thus,
     mid- and longer term effects of the training sessions have not yet occurred, as participants are still
     in the process of planning the application of the knowledge acquired in the training sessions. As a
     consequence, in most cases the longer term effects can only be estimated on the basis of qualitative
     information gathered from individual trainees. Additionally, Module 12 is a one-day training and one has
     to be cautious when drawing conclusions with regard to impacts and long-term effects.
