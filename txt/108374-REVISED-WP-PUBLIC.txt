Twenty years ago…The last eighteen months have brought peace and a start to political, economic and social recovery in war-
ravaged Bosnia and Herzegovina. With a massive internationally supported construction effort, schools and health clinics have
reopened; commercial flights land at the Sarajevo airport; repairs to infrastructure, essential to economic revival, are underway; and
commerce has picked up. Growth last year reached 50 percent, and unemployment, though still unsustainably high at 50 percent,
has fallen dramatically from its war-time levels. Following the first national elections in September, BiH’s State Council of Ministers
and the Federation and Republika Srpska (RS) Entity governments were established – important milestones on the road to a more
stable political future for the country. (World Bank Country Assistance Strategy FY98-FY99, World Bank 1997)


Today…The country has been at peace for the past twenty years, and despite a complex political setup has been able to achieve
significant results. Much of infrastructure destroyed in the war has been rebuilt, and institutions have been established to govern the
country at all levels of authority. A framework for economic and fiscal management has been established that has brought lasting
macroeconomic stability. Multiple reform efforts have improved economic links between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Republika Srpska, and some progress has been made in creating a better environment for private sector development and job
creation. Much more now needs to be done if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to achieve sustainable prosperity for its citizens and join
the ranks of the European Union. … A consensus is emerging at different levels of society that the time has come for the country to
change course and unleash its growth potential. (World Bank Country Partnership Framework FY16-FY20, World Bank 2015a)
