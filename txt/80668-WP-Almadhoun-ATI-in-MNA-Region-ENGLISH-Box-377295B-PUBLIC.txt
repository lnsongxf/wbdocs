    I.        INTRODUCTION

The right to access and request information is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. Information is considered “the oxygen of a democracy.”
Access to information (ATI) plays an essential role for promoting accountability and
citizens' ability to monitor the actions of the government, and it contributes to
participatory development. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of the
situation of access to information in the Middle East and North Africa (MNA) region, in
particular the cases of Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia.

This report looks at previous and current efforts for promoting ATI in the region in order
to facilitate knowledge exchange among ATI practitioners across those countries and to
help them identify areas for collaboration in the region.

For each country, this report will first examine the legal and/or institutional framework,
including a range of factors such as constitutional provisions, restrictive legislation,
relevant regional and international conventions, and key administrative bodies.
Government initiatives affecting the right of access to information are then considered in
detail for each country. Next, this report examines the practice of access to information
for each of these four countries, including the use and implementation of ATI legislation
or other applicable transparency provisions. Finally, a summary of recent developments
of the ATI coalitions and campaigns in these countries is provided.

    II.       JORDAN

In 2007, an access to information law was passed in Jordan. Although Jordan has an ATI
law, there are limitations due to its vagueness, exceptions regime, and its relationship
with the larger legal framework. The Jordanian experience serves as an example about
limited progress regarding ATI despite the passing of legislation. In this case the law has
not supported improvements in access to information. The majority of Jordanians have
no knowledge of the law, and those who know about it have not tested government
openness fully.

 A. Legal frame work

Jordan's Constitution
 1. In September 2011, the Jordan’s Constitution wa s amended, including a number of
    legal reforms. However, Article 15 of the Constitution was not amended to include
    the right of access to information despite the demands by civil society. 3 This article
    was however reworded to include an obligation on the State to "secure" freedom of
    opinion and freedom of the press within the limits of the law.

Access to information law
2. Law on Securing Access to Information (LSATI) no. 47 of 2007, the first of its
   kind in the Arab region, was perceived as an important step towards government
   openness. However, the implementation of the law during the last five years since
   its adoption has shown little progress. The law scored 52 out of 150 points on the
   ATI rating developed by the Center for Law and Democracy and Access Info

    Europe. This rate is attributed to its vagueness, the broad regime of exceptions, and
    the problematic requesting procedure.
 3. Media law expert Yahia Shukkeir noted that "for the ATI law to be effective, it is
    necessary key amendments to the Law on the Protection of State Secrets and
    Documents are needed. Otherwise, [the] ATI law will not be adequately effective." 4
    He added: "[the] ATI law did not represent a huge transition in facilitating the flow
    of information, and [it] did not change the widespread culture of secrecy among
    government agencies."
 4. Journalist Rana Sabbagh commented that "the ATI law was expected to stimulate a
    white revolution, but the community's failure to make use of it, the vagueness of its
    provisions, and the government’s failure on it s implementation have undermined the
    effectiveness of the law." 5 Journalists also called for amending the law criticizing its
    "prolonged request process". 6
 5. In March 2011, Jordanian news sites reported that the Information Council asked
    the Ministry of the Interior to prepare an amendment to the law. 7 In May and June
    2011, news sites also reported that the government was considering amendments to
    the law, and that a special committee was examining a proposal of amendments that
    would remedy the negative aspects of its implementation. 8 However, there is no
    progress reported on these efforts.

National Charter
6. Jordan's Second National Charter of 1990 9 was prepared by a royal committee to
    mark a new phase in Jordan following the elections of 1989. The Charter was meant
    to lay down the foundations of pluralistic political activity based on constitutional
    principles and to facilitate Jordan’s transition to a democracy. The Charter has been
    the subject of national consensus and acquired a unique status subordinate to the
    Constitution, but no mechanisms or procedures were formulated to implement it. 10
7. Chapter Six of the Charter on “Information and Communication” highlights the role
    of mass media in “strengthening democratic process”, and provides that "Citizens
    must have the right to know and to access information from legitimate transmission

     and publication sources within Jordan and abroad." 11 “The circulation of news and
     data must be regarded as an indivisible part of the freedom of the press and
     information. The state must guarantee free access to information to the extent that it
     does not jeopardize national security or the national interest.” 12

Amended Press and Publications Law No. 8 of 1998 13
8. The Press and Publications law guarantees journalists' right to access information.
    Article 6 (c) provides that freedom of press includes “the right to access
    information, news and statistics of interest to the citizens from various sources.”
9. Article 8 requires public authorities to facilitate the journalists’ access to
    information. “A journalist has the right of access to information; official authorities
    and public agencies shall facilitate their task and allow them to view their programs,
    projects and plans.” It also “prohibits the imposition of any restrictions on freedom
    of the press in fulfilling the flow of information to citizens or procedures that would
    hinder the exercise of such right.”
10. However, Law no. 17 of 2011 amending the Press and Publications law broadened
    the definition of a Press Publication to include electro nic websites. 14 Therefore, they
    shall be subject to the provisions of the Press Law on licensing and prohibitions.
    The amending law also subjected electronic newspapers to sanctioning such as
    heavy fines for violating the law’s prohibitions.

Restrictive legislation
11. The Provisional Law on Protection of State Secrets and Documents No. 50. Of 1971
    is considered the most detrimental to access to information in Jordan. The scope of
    classified information is overly broad. In addition, it identifies neither the competent
    body in charge of classifying information and documents nor an independent
    agency to verify and review the classification system. 15 According to Yahia
    Shukkeir, "this law has turned the law on access to information into just ink on
    paper". 16
12. The Anti-corruption Law of 2006 provides in Article 21 (a) that "all information,
    data and documents, received by the commission and to which its employees have
    access, are secret and it should not be disclosed or made available except within the
    limits of the law." A 2012 amendment of the law added the phrase “without
    prejudice to any severer penalty provided in any other law” to paragraph (b) of the
    article, which states that “a violation of this provision is punishable with a one -year
    prison sentence.”17
13. Article 9 of the Financial Disclosure Law of 2006 considers "all financial
    statements, data, documents and the audits thereof secret and can only be accessed
    by the competent investigation committee and bodies; their publication or disclosure
    is prohibited subject to legal responsibility."

 14. Article 68 of Civil Service By law of 2007 18 provides that, subject to disciplinary
     procedure, "public officials are prohibited from keeping any official document or
     communication, or any copy thereof, or leaking it to any outside body or writing or
     speaking about it without an authorization to do so. " In addition, a decree by
     Jordan's Prime Minister instructed the government officials not to give any
     information to the press except through the minister or the deputy minister. 19
     Journalists have frequently complained about public employees refusing to give
     information fearing repercussions by their superiors.
 15. Article 11 of Cyber Crime Law of 2010 provides: “Every person that intentionally
     enters without permit, in violation of the permission into an electronic site or
     information system in any manner for the purpose of acquiring access to data or
     information unavailable to the public and harming national security, the foreign
     relations of the Kingdom, public safety or national economy shall be penalized with
     no less than four months of imprisonment and a fine of no less than 500 JD and no
     more than 5,000 JD.” “If the entry seeks to delete, damage, destroy, change or
     transfer or copy the data or the information, he or she shall be penalized with
     temporary hard labor sentence and a fine of no less than 1,000 JD and no more than
     5,000 JD.”

International and regional Conventions
 16. On 19 May 2004, Jordan signed the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was
     adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Arab League in March of the same year.
     The Arab Charter entered into force on January 2008 after seven Arab countries
     ratified the text. 20 Article 32 of the Charter largely mirrors Articles 19 of the UDHR
     and ICCPR.
 17. In addition to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), on
     24 October 2005, Jordan ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
     Jordan has also adopted the Rio Declaration that includes the principle on access to
     environmental information.


 B. Institutional Frame work

Information Council
 18. According to the LSATI, the Information Council (IC) is the competent institution
     responsible for the implementation and promotion of access to information. The
     National Library was designated to perform the functions of the Information
     Commissioner. 21 The law was passed without adding any financial obligation on the
     state's budget. The National Library had not received any funding, in its role as the
     Information Council, for the implementation of the law; this has had an impact on
     the capacity of the Information Council to promote access to information. This
     Council is based in the National Library Department, and headed by the head of this
     department.

18
   Civil Service Law of 1963 was repealed in 1965. The Civil Service Bylaw was adopted by the Cabinet in
accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution that provides that public departments and agencies are regulated by
bylaws adopted by the Cabinet after they are approved by the King.

 19. All the members of the IC come from the government with no participatio n by
     independent experts, media professionals or academics. 22 IC's lack of members
     from outside the government was lamented by media practitioners and experts.
     There is also a vacant place in the IC which belongs to the Higher Media Council,
     the body that was dissolved in 2008. 23
 20. The decisions of the IC are non-binding. In different occasions the IC failed to
     oblige government agencies to disclose information. 24 (See the section on practice of
     access to information).

 Ombudsman Bureau25
 21. Although the mandate of the Ombudsman is not directly related to access to
     information, it may provide a forum for requesters to file a complaint against refusal
     to release information by government agencies. Jordan's Ombudsman examines
     complaints from individuals relating to any decree, procedure, practice or any act of
     refusal by public administration." 26 The Ombudsman has helped citizens to access
     information withheld by government agencies. (See the section on practice of access
     to information.)

 C. Government Initiatives on ATI

Government Websites
22. A 2009 survey was conducted about journalists' use of the government website,
    www.jordan.gov.jo.27 Sixty five percent of the sample surveyed said that they have
    browsed the website, while 36% stated that they had not done so. Only 46 percent
    of female journalists had visited the website. On the other hand, 63% said that the
    website did not provide information required for their work, while 37% percent
    found the information useful.
23. Responding to a question about why journalists have not benefited from public
    agencies' and private sector entities' websites, 32.3 % said that the information was
    not regularly updated, while 15.5 % said that the quality and content of information
    was irrelevant to the needs of journalists.




Disclosure of Information by State Pro-Accountability Institutions
24. Jordan's Anti-corruption Commission started publishing its annual reports on its
    website in 2011. In the same year the Audit Bureau published its annual report on
    its website for the first time after being unavailable to the public.

   The Open Government Partnership formally launched on September 20, 2011, when the 8 founding governments
(Brazil, Indonesia, M exico, Norway, Philippines, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States) endorsed an
Open Government Declaration, and announced their country action plans.

                                                         6
 25. The Open Government Partnership (OGP) has created an opportunity to review the
     legal framework on ATI. Jordan is the only Arab country member of the OGP.
 26. Jordan expressed interest to join OGP in September 2011, and since has worked on
     developing its commitments. The OGP declaration include a commitment to
     "increase the availability of information about governmental activities" which
     comprises of a number of goals: "promoting increased access to information and
     disclosure about governmental activities at every level of government; increasing
     efforts to systematically collect and publish data on government spending and
     performance for essential public services and activities; pro-actively provide high-
     value information, including raw data, in a timely manner, in formats that the public
     can easily locate, understand and use, and in formats that facilitate reuse; providing
     access to effective remedies when information or the corresponding records are
     improperly withheld, including through effective oversight of the recourse process."
 27. In January 2012, Jordan submitted its national action plan. 29 The action plan
     contains a number of commitments on three pillars including "increasing public
     integrity". Under this Jordan has committed itself to "improve access to information
     through adopting amendments to the existing Access to Information Law in view of
     further improving it and ensuring that it is consistent with international best
     practices."


 D. Practice of Access to Information

Lack of public engagement and debate during the formulation of the ATI law
28. Journalists and media practitioners have written about the limited use of the law due
    to the genesis of the law. Yahia Shukkeir notes that "the law was not the outcome of
    national dialogue. Neither journalists nor citizens demanded the law." He believes
    that "the circumstances under which the law was adopted were quite similar to those
    leading to the adoption of the Tunisian ATI decree. The process was very quick." 30
29. Yahia Shukkier, who contributed to drafting Jordan's ATI law, relayed the events
    leading to the adoption of the law. During his work at the Higher Media Council,
    government officials asked for recommendations for improving Jordan's rank o n the
    Press Freedom Index run by Reporters without Borders (RSF). 31 Among others, the
    adoption of ATI law was then suggested. The Amman Center for Human Rights
    reported in its 2007 annual report that "the joint legislative committee - the
    Freedoms and Legal Committees – endorsed the draft in thirty minutes, while the
    House of Representatives took no more than 30 minutes to vote on the law."32

    as it was not the outcome of a systematic struggle by civil society." 33 She also argues
    that the majority of journalists rely on personal relations and acquaintances in
    obtaining information without filing an official request. A 2009 survey shows that
    42% of journalists do not know about the ATI law. 34
31. In addition, journalists cannot wait to write an article until the public agency gives
    its answer; the law establishes a thirty-day period for public agencies to respond.
    Media expert Said Heter has noted that journalists encounter a dilemma with the
    complexity of procedures from the moment of filing the request and the one- month
    time period awaiting government response and the complicated litigation procedure
    when there is a denial of information. 35
32. During a panel discussion on World Press Freedom Day on May 3, 2011,
    Communication Minister Odwan said that "Journalists do not create enough pressure
    to get more access to information. They should be professional and find the right
    sources from which to access information, and that documents will be classified in
    all ministries of Jordan and archived in accordance with the Access to Information
    Law." 36

Limited awareness of the law
33. According to Yahia Shukkeir, half of the ministries do not know about the law. To
    illustrate this, during a training workshop Shukkeir assigned a group of trainees to
    conduct an experiment in order to test knowledge of the ATI law. Trainees were
    sent to the ministry of health requesting the number of TB patients in Jordan, which
    is published in the annual report. The trainees found that there were no ATI forms at
    the ministry and the officers did not know about the law. 37
34. According to a 2010 survey by Al-Urdun Al-Jadid Research Center (UJRC), half of
    the ministries did not know about the law and 40% o f journalists had no knowledge
    of its existence. 38
35. In March 2010, a survey by Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ)
    found that only 5% of journalists used the law to request information. 39
36. In its 2010 annual report, Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ)
    surveyed 505 journalists and found that 29% of the targeted sample was unaware of

     the law. 40 The report stated that only 53% of the sample has used the law to request
     information.
 37. Despite lack of knowledge about the law, there are ongoing efforts to provide
     trainings to the government, private sector, and the media about the benefits of
     using the ATI law. For example, UJRC held trainings in conjunction with IREX in
     200941 and the abolished Higher Media Council organized training workshops in
     2008 in cooperation with the Information Council and the National Library. 42

Government classification of documents
38. According to Article 14 of LSATI, public agencies shall classify their documents in
    accordance with existing legislation. Classification of public documents would
    therefore be based on the Law on protection of state secrets and documents. A study
    by ARIJ found that 16 government agencies surveyed used different standards and
    policies in the classification process. 43
39. The study highlighted that despite the government's instructions to public agencies
    to complete the classification process, this has not been completed. 44 While the
    Information Council claimed that 85% of the 120 government agencies completed
    the classification of documents, ARIJ's study questioned this statement. 45 The
    government had not made any visits or a review of the implementation and
    completion of the classification process. A 2010 CDJF report highlighted that
    "implementation of the law suffers from arbitrary classification of information by
    the different ministries and state institutions. 46

Requesting information in practice
40. The requesting procedure requires citizens to fill out a form with their personal
    information and the purpose for such request, which is not in line with international
    good practice. Further, "such formal procedure has made some government officials
    hesitant and in some cases reluctant to give information. However, when

 42. Access to information about housing loan default: In October 2010, Journalist
     Mohamed Khateeb of Amman Net Radio requested the Central Bank of Jordan to
     disclose detailed information about the percentage of personal and housing loan
     default in 2009. Following the Bank's refusal to provide that information on the
     grounds of its confidentiality, he filed a complaint with the Information Council.
     The latter recommended that the Bank provide the information. But, the Central
     Bank did not comply with the decision of the Information Council.
 43. In its 2010 report, CDFJ examined the implementation of the LSATI in three
     government agencies: Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance and Public Security
     directorate. 50 The Center identified a number of problems, most important among
     which are “the agencies' failure to appoint an information officer, lack of clear and
     specific policy on classification of documents, adop tion of a subjective assessment
     to the classification of documents, lack of statistics about the number of classified
     documents and the overlap between the roles of spokesman and information
     officer.”51

44. In August 2010, Al- Urdun Al-Jadid Research Center (UJRC) published the results of
    a survey study52 about Jordan's private sector, which found that 75.2% of businesses
    have no knowledge of the ATI law and that businesses pointed out a wide range of
    obstacles in requesting information, such as slow procedures, inadequate responses,
    refusals, and high costs. 53
45. A few journalists have published on the right to access environmental information
    held by government agencies. 54 The Information Center of Jordan's Environment
    Ministry aims, among other goals, to provide and communicate information to
    interested groups and researchers. 55

Handling appeals
46. Until February 2010, Department of the National Library, in its role as the
    Information Council, received only ten complaints regarding denial of access to
    information. 56 Recourse to the complaint mechanism was very limited. This is
    probably due to the non-binding nature of the Information Council's decisions to
    government bodies.

Appeal to the High Court of Justice (HCJ) and resort to the Ombudsman Office
47. In September 2010, journalist Majdoleen Allan, filed the first appeal to the High
    Court of Justice against the Department of Lands and Survey for its refusal to
    disclose information about the price at which public property was sold and the
    identity of the buyer. 57
48. First, Allan submitted the appeal on behalf of ARIJ. The prosecution found that
    ARIJ had not disclosed its budget and renewed its registration. The court found
    ARIJ having no legitimate interest. Allan later submitted the appeal as a journalist.
    The Court however dismissed the application on the grounds that the applicant was
    not a registered journalist and therefore is ineligible to request such information.
    Then, the journalist appealed to the Court as a Jordanian citizen. The appeal in the
    end failed and the court found that the requester had no legitimate interest. 58
49. Many journalists would not be willing to appeal to the HCJ because they would not
    incur the cost of appeal - around 2,500 JD - with the likelihood that they would not
    win the case.

   Businesses pointed out the following obstacles in requesting information: 1) slow ATI procedures and late
government response; 2) provision of inadequate information; 3) difficulty in identifying the competent department
providing information; 4) lack of assistance to obtain the best possible information; 5) lack of information; 6) absence
of person competent to provide the information; 7) refusal to give information; and 8) high cost of access to
information. The Center organized a seminar to discuss the survey. Reem Badran, Second Deputy of Amman
Chamber of Industry, spoke about the role of ATI in promoting the right of local and foreign investors to the
transparency of economic and legislative information, and in promoting markets' activity. Badran noted article 8 of
the ATI law that obliges the government to "facilitate" not to "ensure" access to information. See Jordan, Badran calls

 50. Access to social security policy: Following the refusal by the Social Security
     Corporation (SSC) to provide a copy of the executive directives relating to social
     security benefits, and its demand that they can only be disclosed pursuant to court
     order, a Jordanian lawyer filed a complaint with the Ombudsman Bureau on the
     grounds that such directives are part of the legal rules regulating social security. The
     Ombudsman Bureau ordered the SSC to publicize those directives and all the
     legislation relating to social security in accordance with the citizen's right prescribed
     in the ATI law. The SSC abided by the order and the directives were published in
     the Official Gazette no. 5076 dated 16 January 2011. 59

Information Council’s annual reporting
 51. Although the Information Council (IC) produces annual reports about the
     implementation of the ATI law, such reports were only shared with the cabinet and
     not made public. According to media law expert, Yahia Shukkeir, "these reports
     would have shown the extent to which government bodies have responded to ATI
     requests, the number of requests received, grounds of denial of access and the
     efforts by the IC in raising awareness about the law." 60
 52. Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) filed a request with the cabinet
     demanding a copy of the 2008 report of the IC. However, the cabinet refused to
     provide ARIJ with the report on grounds that the latter had no legitimate interest. 61
 53. A Jordanian graduate student Omar Al- Elaiwi submitted a request to access the IC's
     annual report for the purposes of his Ph.D. thesis. He was initially denied access,
     and he decided to sue the IC. He then negotiated with the IC representatives who
     finally agreed to provide the student with a summary of the report. 62
 E. ATI Campaign Agenda

54. Jordanian civil society organizations are engaged in training government officials
    about the implementation of ATI law. Media law and human rights groups provided
    training for journalists and media practitioners about the practicalities of the law.
    Media groups also took part in conducting surveys about the awareness and use of
    the law and why information is withheld. 63
55. On the International Right to Know Day, September 28, 2008, UJRC launched the
    ‘Jordanian Alliance for Freedom of Information and Transparency’ (JAFIT) which
    includes a group of 18 civil society organizations, and more than 14 individuals
    including parliamentarians, academics, and media practitioners. 64 The Alliance
    started publishing a newsletter in September 2008.

56. Yahia Shukkeir, media law expert, believes that access to information agenda in
    Jordan in the short-term should focus on areas that would not raise government's
    concerns such as anti-corruption, national security issues or those of political
    implications. 65 Priority should be given to using access to information to help
    citizens, businesses, CSOs access information about development, economic growth,
    or the environment. Women groups may also need to expand their programs through
    access to information relating to reproductive health. The youth are also a prospect
    group that needs assistance to exercise their right to know and access information
    about jobs and opportunities.
57. Yet more than four years after the adoption of the ATI law, there is a limited
    community of practice and lack of strong ATI campaign that is able to foster use of
    the right to access information.
58. Overall, the ATI campaign in Jordan needs to carry out more research and
    documentation to diagnose the status of the implementation of the law and expand
    the dialogue about access to information among other community-based groups and
    grassroots campaigners.


     III.     LEBANON

There is no legislation guaranteeing the right to access public information. There is a bill
on access to information sent to the Parliament since 2009 but no significant
development has occurred since then. The Lebanese government and public agencies
have adopted a number of initiatives to disclose information to the public; publication of
annual reports and government web sites provide the public with key information. 66


A. Legal frame work

Since 2000, Lebanon witnessed several attempts by media and legal activists to have the
Lebanese parliament pass a law on access to information. 67 But these efforts have not
yet materialized in the adoption of an access to information legislation.

Constitution
1. Lebanon's Constitution68 recognizes the right to freedom of expression. Article 13
   provides that "freedom of expression, oral or written, and of publishing are
   protected within the limits of the law." The constitution's preamble also points out
   that the State "abides by the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration
   of Human Rights and that the State shall reflect these principles in all rights and
   fields with no exception."

1976 and 1990 after the Taif Agreement, also known as the "National Reconciliation Accord" that provided a basis for
the end of the civil war).

 2. The Press and Publications Law 69 has no specific provision on journalists' right to
    access information.
 3. Article 12 of this law includes a prohibition on publishing about the facts of
    criminal investigation during the pre-trial phase and investigations by the Inspection
    department, and about secret trials, cabinet sessions, and secret sessions of the
    Parliament. The article also contains a broad prohibition over communications,
    documents and any dossiers belonging to public agencies that are classified.

Environmental law
4. Lebanon's Environment Law of 2002 guarantees access to environmental
   information. Pursuant to the principle of participation, Article 4 (f) of the law
   provides that "every citizen has the right to obtain information relating to the
   environment in accordance with applicable laws and bylaws." This law is not
   applicable yet in Lebanon because no implementing ordinances were adopted.

Various legal provisions on access information
5. Law on Land Registry provides that "every individual has the right to obtain the
    information on property registration after paying the retrieving and copying fees."
6. The laws regulating the telecommunications and electricity utilities provide that
    "With no harm to commercial secrets and competition, the utility makes available
    all available documents, records and data. Every individual wishing to acquire
    access or obtain a copy shall complete a written form; the utility will then determine
    the fees in accordance with incurred cost."
7. Article 30 of the 1994 Law of Radio and Video Broadcasting gives the State,
    represented by the Ministry of Information, the power to use TV and radio outlets to
    disseminate information the State wishes to communicate to citizens.
8. A number of public agencies are obliged to publish their annual reports in
    accordance with applicable laws. These agencies include Central Inspection
    Council, Civil Service Council, Accountability Bureau, Lebanon's Central Bank,
    Ombudsman Office, etc.
Restrictive laws
9. The Amended Penal Code contains a list of prohibitions on publication violation of
    which is penalized with a fine. 70 The prohibition includes: publishing any document
    of criminal investigation before it is examined in public hearing, publication of
    court briefs, secret trials, trials in family, marriage affairs and disputes, or
    publishing information banned by the Court about a trial.
10. Article 15 of Public Service Law prohibits employees from 1) conveying speech or
    publishing articles, statements or publications without the supervisor's written
    permission or 8) giving official information he had known because of his/her job,
    even after the end of his/her service, unless the ministry authorizes such disclosure
    in writing. 71 Participants from public agencies highlighted in a training workshop
    that was organized by Lebanese Transparency Association that Article 15 is a
    significant obstacle to disclosing information. As a result, civil servants fear
    repercussions from their superiors. 72

 11. Article 9 of Bylaw 73 regulating the functions of the Prime Ministry states that
     cabinet deliberations are secret. Article 34 of the Bylaw of Lebanese Parliament
     states that the sessions, minutes, deliberations, voting of parliamentary committees
     are confidential unless the committee decided otherwise. 74 Article 35 of the Law of
     Municipalities provides that the sessions of the municipal council are secret. The
     Mayor may invite any employee or individual to attend a session.

International Conventions
 12. Lebanon ratified the ICCPR on 3 November 1972. On 16 October 2008, Lebanon
     joined the United Nations Convention against Corruption. It is worth noting that in
     accordance with the Law of Civil Procedure, "Courts shall abide by the principle of
     hierarchy of legal rules. If a conflict occurs between the rules of an international
     treaty and those of national law, the former prevail."75
 13. Lebanon approved several laws in line with the Rio Declaration in 1992 and is in
     the process of finalizing work plan to achieve economic, social and environmental
     reform. 76

Other relevant provisions
14. There is an Ombudsman office, "Waseet eljumhuria" , that was established by Law
    no. 664 of 2005. However, this law is still lacking the implementing ordinances to
    implement it. 77
15. Lebanon has a National Archive Center 78 that was established in 1978. Citizens can
    have access to the archives, but it is mostly used b y public agencies. 79


B. Government initiatives

Government bill on citizen-administration relations
16. In 2002, in order to bridge the gap between the administration and the citizen and to
    enhance transparency, the Ministry of Administrative Reform (OMSAR) designated
    a committee, including a judge from the Council of State and three lawyers, to draft
    a bill. The proposed bill acknowledged citizens' right to access administrative
    documents including "records, reports, studies, notices, memos, reports of
    administrative audit commissions and all administration's reports except those
    relating to national defense secrets, public security or the private life of
    individuals." 80

17. The bill stated that the "administration is not obliged to respond to requests that are
    arbitrary in terms of their number and repetitive nature", and mandated "public
    agencies to justify in writing their refusal to provide copies of documents." 81 It also
    required all agencies to reduce the number of required administrative decisions to a
    minimum in order to limit, as much as possible, potential abuse of power. 82
18. According to OMSAR’s website, the bill was reviewed and approved by the
    Legislative and Consultative Board, the State Council, Civil Service Board and the
    Central Inspection Board. 83

Public disclosure initiatives by ministries or agencies:
19. In 2002, OMSAR established the Central Office for Administrative Information
    (COAI), consisting of two elements: a phone help line (1700) and a website
    www.informs.gov.lb aimed at disseminating “transactions related to the public that
    specifies the documents that are required as well as the fees.” 84 The COAI also
    introduced administrative procedure forms that users can download and use to
    request services from the administration.
20. "Informs" website also contains information on more than 4,000 administrative
    transactions, list of addresses and contact information of ministries and public
    agencies. 85 However, the website was only the first step towards government
    openness, and further awareness-raising about the website is necessary. 86
21. "Informs" website established a one-way communication based on government
    provision of specific types of information to citizens, therefore allowing minimal
    level of engagement possible. "People will only know what the government wants
    them to know. There are no legal instruments that guarantee the people’s right to
    know nor are there oversight bodies to ensure that all relevant documents are
    disseminated."87
22. In October 2001, the Lebanese cabinet adopted Citizens’ Charters prepared by
    OMSAR under a plan for administrative reform and modernization of public
    administration. 88 The Charters inform citizens of their rights and duties regarding
    specific policies such as taxation, healthcare and education. Although these online
    resources opened up the government in Lebanon, "they fell short of securing two-
    way communication channels where citizens are empowered with knowledge about
    internal government processes.”89 Furthermore, the charter is considered to be non-
    binding to public agencies. 90

23. In 2002, with the support of USAID and the State University of New York, the
     Ministry of Interior and Municipalities published "the Citizen's Guide at the
     municipality." 91
24. In March 2007, with the support of United Nations Development Program POGAR
     program, OMSAR launched new six codes regulating citizen's relationship with the
     administration, on education, health, environment, heritage, public finance and
     public safety. OMSAR stated that it prepared a three-year implementation plan to
     disseminate the codes and raise public awareness about them. However, it is not
     clear the extent to which these codes have provided transparency about the
     administration. "The majority of Lebanese do not know about them. No training
     was delivered to public officials to implement the codes. In addition, they are not
     binding against the government" said Dani Haddad of the Lebanese Transparency
     Association.
25. With the support of UNDP, OMSAR and the Ministry of Justice established an
     information office that assists citizens in accessing legal information. 92
26. Before June 2009 elections in Lebanon, lawyer and member of the National
     Network for the Right of Access to Information (NNRAI), former Minister Ziyad
     Baroud published, in an individual initiative, a comprehensive report about
     implementing ATI law for the Interior Ministry in the hope to encourage other
     ministries to start implementing the law before its official ratification. 93
27. Following Lebanon’s ratification of the United Nations Convention agai nst
    Corruption (UNCAC), the NNRAI drafted a bill on Access to Information that was
    submitted to Lebanese parliament in April 2009 by members of the Lebanese
    Parliamentarians Against Corruption organization (LebPAC). 94 Yet there has been
    no progress since its submission; the bill was not presented to any parliamentary
    committee. 95


C. Practice of access to information

28. There is lack of awareness about the right of access to information in Lebanon. In
    general, journalists depend on their relationship with politicians as sources of
    information in their work.
29. In 2009, Maharat Foundation, in collaboration with International Freedom of
    Expression Exchange (IFEX), conducted a survey among 70 journalists about the
    practice of journalistic profession. Maharat found that 70% of the participants talked
    about difficulty in accessing sources of information. 96
30. In 2008, MAHARAT’s Observatory conducted a sur vey among 61 journalists to
    assess the situation of the Lebanese media. Journalists were not well acquainted

    with the laws that regulate their profession. Responding to a question about whether
    there were any law securing right to access public information, journalists were
    divided into three main categories: 18% said “I don’t know”; 20% said “YES”; 62%
    said “NO”. 97
31. A 2006 report about media in Lebanon compiled by Dr. Deema Dabous touched
    upon access to information. The report cited a survey by the Beirut-based
    Information International 98 in which 150 media professionals in Beirut participated.
    The participants highlighted their inability to access documents held by the
    government as the common challenging aspect of their work. 69.7% of the
    participants said that it was not possible to obtain government documents in a
    timely manner, while 44.9% believed that such documents cannot be made available
    to journalists without bias and favoritism. 99 According to a news editor at the
    Lebanese NTV channel, "journalists typically do not obtain information through
    professional means. While some journalists are completely denied access to news,
    others enjoy some favorable treatment by some politicians.” 100
32. A 1999 study 101 about the right to access information among 500 individua ls
    concluded:
     - Do you have any information about official procedures or documents related to
         your interests to which you are entitled to have access? 8% yes, 27% partially,
         65% no
     - Why do you lack knowledge of these records? 46% lack of information, 41%
         lack of information centers, 6% no ATI law, 7% don’t know.


D. ATI campaign agenda

33. There are around 7000 non-government organizations in Lebanon. 102 However, civil
    society organizations have not developed sustained strategies to demand the right of
    access to information as a vehicle to strengthen their mission. Demand for access to
    information was limited to anti-corruption groups and media activists who have
    been vocal about the need for the “right to know” and government transparency.
34. Lebanese activists came together and established the National Network for the
    Right of Access to Information (NNRAI). 103 NNRAI was initiated on 11 April 2008
    by Lebanese Parliamentarians against Corruption (LebPac), Lebanese Transparency
    Association, and the Association on the defense of rights and liberties "Adel", in co-
    operation with ABA Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI) Lebanon office.
    The Network brings together key actors from the public and private sectors in
    support of a comprehensive reform agenda. Throughout 2009 and 2010, the network
    engaged in a number of activities including: meetings with the media, lobbying of
    parliamentarians, training public servants, engaging with the private sector, building
    knowledge on ATI concepts and mechanisms and raising public awareness.

35. The NNRAI drafted an ATI bill proposal that was submitted to Lebanese parliament
    in April 2009, but no progress followed. 104 NNRAI and partner organizations held a
    series of events advocated for the bill’s progress in Parliament. 105
36. In June 2010, NNRAI submitted a bill proposal on whistleblower protection to
    Parliament. The bill covers the public and private sectors, offers protection for
    whistleblowers employment and their personal safety— including for family
    members—and provides compensation for violations. 106
37. Beyond the focus of some networks and a handful of organizations, access to
    information has not been a priority. Civil society organizations continue to face a
    challenging context where communities are suffering from unemployment and
    poverty.



      IV.     MOROCCO

There is no law on access to information. The Arab spring has mounted the demand by
Moroccan media and transparency activists for legal reforms on transparency. Morocco
has become the first Arab country to introduce a constitutional provision securing the
right to access information in 2011. However, in order to strengthen the legal framework
for transparency, a law securing access to information held by the government is needed.


A. Legal frame work

Constitution
1. The new Constitution in Morocco, adopted in July 2011, guarantees access to
   information. Article 27 states that "Citizens have the right to obtain information held
   by public administration, elected agencies, agencies tasked with the administration
   of public utilities. Such right cannot be restricted except by law for the purpose of
   protecting national security, the State's internal and external security, and private
   life, for the prevention of infringing upon basic rights and freedoms provided for in
   the constitution, and for the protection of the sources of information precisely set by
   the law."




104
    The draft bill was submitted in April 2009 and a campaign begun shortly thereafter. .1
105
    Key events included: (1) May: LebPAC, Nahwa al M uwatiniya (Na’am), ABA Rule of Law Initiative (ABA       .2
ROLI) partner organizations and members of the NNRAI began a campaign encouraging members of parliament
to support the bill; (2) 30 July: Nahar Ash Shabab, a Lebanese Society, organized in cooperation with ABA
ROLI and NNRAI a workshop on drafts of the ATI Law and the Law on Protection of Whistleblowers; (3)
September 28: NNRAI held a press conference for International Right to Know Day; and (4) October 7, 14:
Lebanese Transparency Association (LTA) with ABA ROLI organized four workshops on ATI for public
servants at the M inistry of Finance. M ore than 77 participants coming from 32 public agencies attended. The
workshops aimed at introducing ATI principles and discussing the draft submitted to Parliament.

Press and Publication Law107 and Statute of Professional Journalists
2. On 20 January 2002, Morocco introduced an amendment to the Press and
    Publication Law that contained a general provision on access to
    information. 108 Article 1 provided "all media have the right to access information
    sources and obtain information from various sources, unless suc h information is
    classified under the law".
3. The Press law however falls short in setting up a mechanism through which the
    media can access news sources. It does not specify the duties of the State and the
    consequences for refusing to give information. It a lso lacks an appeal mechanism
    against the refusal by public agencies. 109 The law has a number of shortcomings in
    terms of its ambiguity and its sanctioning system and penalties.
4. In February 1995, pressures exerted by the National Union for the Moroccan Press
    led to the government's adoption of the Statute of Professional Journalists. 110 Article
    4stipulates for "journalist's right to access news sources of information in the
    context of practice of his/her profession and within the limits of observance of the
    laws in force".
5. The National Union of Moroccan Press has been vocal about the need for regulating
    the right to access information. In its statement on the 2003World Press Freedom
    Day, "in the absence of provisions implementing of the right to access information
    prescribed for in the Press Law and Statute of Professional Journalists, it then keeps
    for public agencies full authority to withhold and conceal information that would
    hamper the materialization of informed public opinion.” 111

Archives Law112
6. Archives law 99/69 of 30 November 2007 contains a legal right to access the
   archives. Article 15 provides that "every individual can access, without adherence to
   any time limit, documents made available to the public or documents access to
   which the law authorizes." Article 16 provides that the public can have free access
   to public archives after thirty years of its production, except in the cases provided
   for in Article17.
7. Archives Du Maroc 113 (ADM) was inaugurat ed on 27 May 2010 after more than two
   years public demand to activate the Archives law. 114 However, ADM has not started

       functioning yet, and Moroccans are still waiting for the adoption of regulations that
       set the implementation mechanisms. 115

 Various provisions on legal right to access information
8. A number of laws guarantee the right of certain stakeholders to access information
    within time constraints so that they take actions to protect their rights. 116 For
    example the Law on Property Registrar, Law of the Commercial Code, the Law on
    Rural and Civic Development allowing the public to exercise their rights and ensure
    that their interests are fulfilled , the law on Confiscation of Private Property, and
    Law on Prices and Competition securing the right of consumer to information. The
    Decree on Public Procurement provides for the duty of public agencies to publish
    and to respond to inquiries.
9. The 1992 Law relating to Parliament Investigation Committees provided for an
    optional disclosure by the Parliament about the findings of its investigations. The
    Parliament may also discuss the findings in a private session. Those committees
    investigate corruption cases concerning government agencies, and may offer the
    public an important flow of information. 117 The committees had a legal right "to
    access public or private documents relating to the subject matter of the
    investigation". The Parliament did publish the findings of the committees in a
    number of occasions for example the investigations of the cases of the bank
    “Property and tourist loans (C.I.H)” and “National Fund for Social
    Security(C.N.S.S.)” between 2000 and 2001. 118 The Committees however did not
    continue this function in establishing Investigation Committees and did not publish
    any findings about important events such as Sidi Ifni in June 2008.

 Restrictive laws
 10. Despite legal reforms in the Moroccan constitution and the Press law, access to
     information can still be inhibited through a number of legal texts. There are still
     legal obstacles, mainly the ambiguity of the legal provisions of the Press Law, as
     well as the professional secret and the secrets of national defense. A small circle of
     government officials have access to information related to the military, diplomatic,
     economic and industrial institutions. 119

     Statute of Public Service of 1958120
11. This Statute obliges every public employee to keep the professional secret related to
    the "works and news that he/she learns while performing his/her duties or on the
    occasion of practicing the profession." 121 The Statute bans "the illegal seizure of
    papers or documents related to the profession and the notification thereof to others in
    a manner that violates the law". This includes correspondence, decrees, regulations,

    resolutions etc. Such ban is not removed unless permitted by the Minister in charge
    of the competent government agency. 122
12. Media and ATI activists called for reviewing article 18 of the Statute and for
    "publicizing the information to be the rule, and withholding it the exception." 123
    Activists lamented that government officials have abused this as they can give
    information to some journalists and withhold it from others.

     Penal Code of 1962124
13. The Penal Code bans employees of the private sector from disclosing information, if
    their work is of "sensitive nature", or related to public security or sovereign
    entities. 125 Article 187 provides for the secrets of national defense and contains a
    broad scope: "items, notes, graphs, designs, maps, copies, photographs, or
    documents because of its nature shall only be accessed by the individuals competent
    to use or preserve it …".
14. The code also punishes by up to five-year imprisonment and a fine of 222 to 10
    thousand Dirhams every director or worker who revealed or tried to reveal to any
    foreigner or Moroccan residing in a foreign country the secrets of the
    business/industry for which they work. If the secrets were leaked to a Morocaan
    resident of the country the penalty will be imprisonment between three months and
    two years and a fine ranging between 200 and 250 Dirhams. 126
15. CSOs are demanding a review of legislation including the Penal Code and Public
    Service law. In 2011, both laws were amended but the amendments did not touch
    upon those restrictive provisions. 127

 International Conventions
16. In addition to the ICCPR, Morocco ratified the United Nations Convention against
     Corruption on 9 May 2007, and the Rio Declaration of 1992 that contains an
     obligation to guarantee access to environmental information.


  B. Institutional frame work

 Administrative Court
17. In accordance with Article 23 of the law of Administrative Court, an individual may
    resort to the Court against the decision of a public agency refusing to provide the
    requested information. The requester may build his case on the grounds of the
    agency's failing to justify its answer. 128 The Court has the power to demand the
    agency to disclose the required information or documents.
18. The law also shifts the burden of proof to the public agency. If the agency fails to
    answer to the court, the court may find the agency admitting the facts of the case and
    therefore this would justify repealing its decision. However, if the public agency
    insists on refusing to disclose the information, the applicant may go to the court.

 Ombudsman “al -Waseet”
19. The Ombudsman office was established by Law of Ombudsman no. 1.21.2.1 of
    2001. On 17 March 2011, Morocco enacted a ne w law establishing “al-Waseet ”
    (Ombudsman) in a step to succeed and modernize the existing Ombudsman office. 129
20. Citizens may lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman office against any public
    agency. The Office conducts research and investigation to confirm the facts of the
    complaint and the damage suffered by the complainant. 130 The Office may contact
    the competent authorities requesting the necessary explanations on the subject matter
    and the supply of documents and information relating to the complaint. 131 If the
    Office confirms the facts and damage it make s recommendations, proposals and
    observations to the relevant agency that must take the necessary measures to
    examine the complaint and inform the Office afterwards of the decision and
    measures taken in that regard. 132
21. “The Agency shall provide the necessary support for the Ombudsman Office …
    through supplying all the documents and information relating the complaints except
    those considered classified under applicable legislation.”133
22. The Ombudsman Office is formed of a number of special officers among which the
    RTI Special Officer who is tasked, in accordance with the Ombudsman Office
    Bylaw 134 , with ensuring that persons with a direct legitimate interest can exercise
    their right of access to information held by public agencies, and taking the necessary
    measures to secure that exercise. 135
23. The RTI Special Officer requests the agency to supply the requested information
    except legally classified information, within a time the Officer sets, if it fails to
    supply the information to the complainant. 136 If the Office finds that the agency’s
    conduct breaches, in itself or by its consequences, the principles of justice and equity
    and results in damage to the complainant, the Office requests the agency to take all
    necessary measures to remedy the damage. 137
24. The Bylaw provides for three types of inaccessible information: the operations of
    judicial bodies that acquire the classified status, the preparatory works of public
    agency’s decision- making, and the private data as prescribed by the provisions on
    data protection. 138
25. The Office submits a special report to the Prime Minister after notifying the Minister
    or the head of the relevant agency for the p urpose of imposing the necessary
    sanctions and measures toward the agency’s conduct that th warts the functions of the
    Ombudsman or the Special Officers. Among these cases is the case when the
    agency’s person- in-charge is deliberately negligent in responding to the complaint or
    the observations or proposals or recommendation relating to it. 139

26. Article 37 of the law provides that the Ombudsman office submits its annual report
    to his Majesty the King. The report is published afterward in the official Gazette and
    publicized at a large scale. However the practice before the adoption of the new law
    points out that annual reports were not published in a timely manner; for instance,
    the 2008 report was published in 2010. 140
27. The Ombudsman office has been mostly approached with complaints related to
    human rights violations, not to access to information. 141


 C. Government Initiatives

Bill on access to information
28. The new government formed in November 2011 has made public statements about
    drafting a bill on access to information. The Ministry of Public Service and
    Modernization of the Administration is currently taking the lead in this process.
    However, no plan or project has been made public yet. 142 The Central Committee
    against Corruption ) ICPC) is taking part to the committee for drafting an ATI law.
    Civil society organizations working in this specific field are not consulted to take
    part in these processes.
29. In 2010, the Ministry of Public Service and Modernization of the Administration
    organized a new round of the National Debate on Administrative Reform, under the
    name of "Moroccan Administration and the Challe nges of 2010”. The report called
    in section 106 for the adoption of a law to guarantee the public's right of access to
    administrative documents. 143

Access to environmental information
30. April 2008. Morocco's Ministry of Environment prepared a bill on access to
    environmental information and submitted it to the secretary of the government. 144
31. On 22 April 2010 in celebration of Earth Day's 40th anniversary Morocco
    announced the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development, the
    first commitment of its kind in Africa and the first in the Arab World. The Charter
    contains a number of principles, including "access to information". It stated "it shall
    be respected access to information relating to the environment held by any individual
    to secure the realization of the objective of this charter." 145 However, this charter has
    not been activated as a means to access environmental information. 146

E-government websites
32. In 2006, Morocco launched the national web portal (www.maroc.ma). A number of
    ministries and public agencies established websites. However, these initiatives

    remain short of achieving government openness. There is no law that obliges public
    agencies to maintain a website, identifies its content, the rights of the public vis-à-vis
    the obligations of public agencies, or determines penalties for non-compliance and
    oversight mechanism. 147
33. Moroccan media expert Alexandra Balafrej, in her study with UNESCO about
    access to public information in Morocco, found that Ministry of the Interior and
    National Defense Department do not have websites. Also, the websites of other
    ministries were not updated regularly. 148
34. Civil society has also noted that e- government initiatives cannot substitute for access
    to information legislation. 149 Websites are not user- friendly, poor in terms of the
    content, inconsistent with the standards set up by the Committee of E- government.150
    Information on those websites contained the news and achievements of the
    government agency, but no substantive information for the users.
35. The websites were also not interactive; a 2005 survey of ten government websites by
    Center for Media Freedom, to evaluate the responsiveness of government ministries
    with the requests of the public, found that only four out of seven electronic messages
    were answered. 151
36. Morocco launched the "Maroc Numeric 2013" strategy that included a roadmap for
    setting up 89 new online services by 2013. 152 It is focused on forms for public
    services, not with divulging public information. Transparency Morocco (TM)
    recruited an expert to audit these sites. TM found that the government's websites
    were not homogeneous, not interactive, lacking information, and dated. 153


 D. Practice of access to information

ATI and the media
37. Journalists are aware of their legal right to access information. However, there are
    two issues in exercising this right. First, journalists prefer not to take a
    confrontational approach with those officials giving the information. If journalists
    complain about denial of access, they fear they may lose their source of information
    and therefore may be denied information later. Second, journalists believe that there
    are no consequences to public servants for refusing to give information.
    Furthermore, journalists do not trust the courts. 154
38. Journalists published about the significance of public access to information of the
    judicial sector as a guarantee for a fair trial. Journalist Idriss Ould El Kabla pointed

      out the public's need to know and observe at early stages the trials relating to
      corruption cases. 155 In April 2010 a one-day workshop was organized about
      "Judiciary and Media: a difficult relationship". The workshop pointed out the need
      for judicial reform and journalists' respect of professional ethics. Participants raised
      the issue for greater awareness and attention to the right to access the information of
      the judicial sector. 156

Parliament’s access to government information.
39. In June 2010, Center for Media Freedoms (CMF MENA) prepared a report about the
    information system at the houses of Parliament. 157 35% of the 150 parliamentarians
    surveyed asserted that executive authorities and public administrations do not
    provide the documents and information they need to perform their work. 46%
    percent who said that the Executive’s authorities do provide such information but did
    not respect legal deadlines; they attributed that to a number of reasons: 1) negligence
    (43%); 2) official agencies' failure to communicate (43%); 3) confidentiality of such
    information (14%).

Access to Environmental information
40. In April 2010, CMF MENA published a report on access to environmental
    information in Morocco. 158 The report emphasized the need to enact a law on access
    to information held by government agencies and by private companies whose
    economic activity may impact the environment, and to ensure public participation in
    environment-related cases and their right to enforce it through the courts.


ATI and Consumer protection
41. CMF MENA published a report on consumers' right to access information in April
    2010. 159 Funded by Middle East Partnership Initiative, the study found that
    economic actors were unaware of their responsibilities regarding consumer
    protection and consumer's right to access information; neither their code of ethics
    nor code of conduct included reference to these two issues. The research identified
    weaknesses in the capacity of consumer protection groups with regard to access to
    information and raising consumers' awareness.

Private Sector and businesses' access to information
42. In December 2008, CMF MENA published the findings of a study on "Moroccan
    Enterprises and Obtaining Information in the Possession of Public Authorities". The
    study surveyed 300 enterprises in seven economic sectors. 91.70% of the surveyed

    not given on a timely basis; 70% said it was not useful; 50.30% considered it
    unreliable; and 48.70% considered the information unusable. 160 Moroccan
    enterprises reported many difficulties including identifying the source. 161
43. Moroccan enterprises acknowledge that government agencies have developed
    websites providing information to the public, but most of its content relates to the
    activities of the minister while much needed economic information is not updated. 162


 E. ATI campaign agenda

44. Moroccan civil society organizations (CSOs) have focused on raising awareness
    about the significance of access to public information. For instance advocacy efforts
    coordinated by Transparency Maroc 163 with other stakeholders, in collaboration with
    the regional UNESCO office and Friederich Ebert Stiftung focused on raising
    awareness about the importance of ATI in order to promote governance reforms. 164
45. A regional study in 2009, developed a benchmarking of four countries (Algeria,
    Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) comparing the regional situation with
    international ATI standards. This project led to the implementation of a specific
    project on promoting access to information. 165 It aimed originally to develop a
    process of political and sector-based advocacy to guarantee that ATI was enshrined
    in the Constitution, as well as the promulgation of a specific law on ATI. These
    efforts led to the creation of the Moroccan network for the right to information
    (REMDI) 166 , launched with the Center for Media Freedom 167 (CMF-MENA) in May

     In 2006, TM launched its first report on ATI in M orocco. The report described the situation of secrecy that       .1
prevails in public agencies and the lack of the State's proactive role to provide public information to citizens.
The report recommended that a strategy be outlined to address ATI through raising awareness among CSOs. In
2005, TM launched its 15 measures to fight corruption in M orocco, half of those recommendations aimed to
promote access to information as the main tool to foster transparency and accountability.
164
     On 21 October 2011, Transparency Morocco (TM ) organized, in co-operation with UNESCO, a workshop on ATI.
The participants highlighted that the new constitutional provision on access to information was not the "end of the
road." UNESCO’s publication "Towards freed om of information in M orocco" which elaborates progress and
challenges related to FoI in M orocco, including the barriers on ATI in the penal code and public service law was also
presented by its co-author Alexandra Balafrej. Belfreej elaborated on the barriers on ATI in the penal code and public
service law. See UNESCO study in French. Available at:

    On 27 September 2010 the M oroccan Network for the Right to Access Information issued a statement on the Right
to Know day calling for a national discussion to adopt a bill on access to information, and abolish all laws and
regulations that hinder such access. The Network noted that public employees, judges and journalists were subject to
disciplinary and criminal procedures due to leaking information the government should have made available to the
public.

     On 15 July 2010 CM F M NA signed along with other African civil society organizations a statement to the 15 th
African Union Summit. The statement called upon head of statement and governments to "adopt national access to
information legislation to guarantee the right to information and guide citizens on how they can request and receive
information held by public bodies."

    2010. Since 2005, this organization released different reports describing the situation
    of ATI in different sectors: parliament, judiciary, private sector, environment, and
    media.
46. A number of journalists and human rights activists called for a regulation allowing
    access to the archives and documents collected by the Commission of Reconciliation
    and Equity. 168 The archives of the commission were held by the Advisory Council
    for Human Rights, but no regulation allowed public access to the archives although
    the Commission recommended such access. 169 The Commission published a number
    of publications on its findings. 170 Saad Meknassi believes that access to the archives
    of the Commission is important, but not a priority for the ATI agenda. Such demand
    may be sensitive, and the government may get defensive and concerned about access
    to information. 171
47. A variety of workshops and events have been jointly hosted by CSOs and media
    organizations to promote right of access to information for journalists as well as
    press freedoms. On 10 December 2010, on the occasion of Human Rights Day,
    UNESCO, Transparency Morocco and the Netherlands Embassy organized a
    workshop on the "Right to Access Information: The Way Forward for Morocco".
    The workshop brought together public policy makers, representatives of
    associations, information experts and journalists for a multi-stakeholder debate to
    discuss guidelines, standards and international good practices on access to
    information, and to make comparison with the situation in Morocco in a view to
    explore the way forward in Morocco for the recognition of public right to access
    information.
48. In May 2010 on World Press Freedom Day, CMF MENA organized a workshop
    entitled "Right to access information, toward media freedom in Arab countries."
    Media activists and senior press editors submitted a letter to the Minister of
    Communication and memo demanding the right to access information. 172 Other
    events linking ATI and the media were held as early as 2007. 173
49. Civil society needs to expand its engagement with local communities and attempt to
    understand their information needs. Civil society can maximize its impact through
    building alliances with community based organizations and help the latter make use
    of access to information to improve their advocacy and improve their services to the
    community.

       V.      TUNISIA

 In the aftermath of the 2011 revolution, Tunisia's interim government launched a reform
 process. Among other reforms, the government adopted a decree on access to public
 documents. Yet support for its implementation is needed. Public awareness of the legal
 right to access information is low. The ATI campaign is still in its early stages, and it
 needs to bring together individuals and activist groups around assisting the government
 in this shift from culture of secrecy to one of openness.


       A. Legal Frame work

 The Constitution
 1. Following the end of the previous regime, Tunisia started a process of political
    transition, among which included drafting a new constitution and reforming media
    laws. In October 2011, Tunisia elected the National Constituent Assembly (NCA)
    that was tasked to prepare a new constitution.
2. Activists created a website allowing Tunisians to participate by commenting and
    presenting their views on the articles of the constitution. 174 Tunisia's old constitution
    states that “[t]he freedoms of opinion, expression, press, publication … are
    guaranteed and exercised within the conditions defined by the law.” This guarantee
    however was not adequate because of the existence of a legal framework that was at
    odds with the constitution’s principles.
3. By Decree No. 10 of 2 March 2011, Acting President Fouad Mebazaa established
    National Authority to Reform Information and Communication (NARIC) that
    advises the government on the reform of the media and communication. NARIC had
    discussed with Tunisian political parties to include a constitutional provision on
    access to information. 175 In August 2011 NARIC hosted a discussion where
    journalists, lawyers and judges gathered to request the Constituent Assembly to
    adopt a constitutional article guaranteeing the right of access to information. 176

 Decree on Access to the Administrative Documents held by Public Authorities
4. On 26 May 2011, the Acting President promulgated Decree No. 41 on Access to the
    Administrative Documents held by Public Authorities. Article 3 of the decree
    provides that "any individual person or legal entity shall have the right of access to
    the administrative documents." 177
5. However, the decree falls short in a number of key areas. In addition to the weak
    sanctions for violating the right to information, the decree lacks the institutional
    entity that would promote access to information and assist in implementing the
    decree, and an independent oversight body that enforces the implementation by
    public agencies. According to Toby Mendel, director of the Centre for Law and
    Democracy, “it was a proper decision based on the circumstances in Tunisia.

    Because the decree was adopted as an interim decree, the government felt they could
    not put in place the main institutional arrangements.” 178
 6. On 11 June 2011, Tunisia introduced an amendment to the Decree. The amendment
    obliged public authorities in Article 22 (a) “to fully adjust with the provisions of the
    decree within a period of two years from the date of its entry into force.” It also
    abolished Article 23 that provides that “[u]ntil complete compliance with the
    provisions of this decree law is reached, the legislative and regulatory texts relating
    to access to administrative documents shall remain in force .” The law scored 71 out
    of 150 points on the ATI rating developed by the Center for Law and Democracy
    and Access Info Europe. This rate is attributed to the “lack of promotional measures,
    the absence of an independent oversight body, and weak sanctions for violations of
    the right to information.”
7. Different groups have highlighted concerns over perceived shortcomings in the
    decree. "The decree was adopted without consulting the stakeholders and contained
    no implementation mechanism," said Hesham Snousi, med ia activist and member of
    the Media and Audio- visual Communication Sub-committee. 179 Activists criticized
    the decree as it was not discussed with the Administrative Court and archives
    specialists, and excluded from its scope documents from the legislative and judicial
    branches. Moreover, the regime of exceptions was not clearly defined. 180
8. Commenting on the consultation with civil society about the ATI decree, Toby
    Mendel added that “limited consultation took place with civil society. NARIC and
    the High Commission for the Realization of Revolutionary Goals were consulted.
    Very few CSOs in fact were able to contribute much in ATI. The group tasked with
    drafting the law was willing to talk with any groups, but it happened pretty
    quickly.”181
9. On 3 May 2012, coinciding with World Press Freedom Day 2012, the Tunisian
    government published the circular regulating the implementation of Decree- law.


 Press and Audio-Visual Communications Laws
10. Tunisia adopted a new press law in November 2011, by Decree No. 115 of 2
    November 2011 relating to freedom of the press, printing and publication. Article 9
    prohibits any restrictions that would hamper freedom of information, thwart equal
    opportunity among media outlets in accessing information, or curtail the right of
    citizens to free, pluralistic, and transparent media. Article 10 provides for journalist's
    right to access information, news, data, statistics from different sources in
    accordance with the terms, and procedures under the Decree on Access to the
    Administrative Documents of Public Authorities.
11. The Decree No. 116 of 2011 on Freedom of Audio-Visual Communication was
    adopted on 2 November 2011 provides for the right of access to information and the
    right to audio and visual communication (Article 4).

    No. 51 of 3 May 1993 further elaborated its functions and operations.

 International Conventions
14. Tunisia ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption on 23 September
     2008.


       B. Government initiatives

15. The government established information and communication units at all government
    agencies.
16. The government publishes texts of law orders and ordinances in an official gazette
    (Journal officiel). This gazette is published and accessible on line. 183
17. The National Center for documentation (CDN) allows people to get general
    information about economic, social, cultural and politic affairs. 184
18. In every ministry there is a citizen liaison office. This office gives information to
    citizens and receives their complaints.
19. The government appointed press attachés that provide information about government
    activities and communicate it to media outlets. 185 However, many journalists accused
    them of assuming a propaganda role by redacting information not to the liking of
    officials. Some journalists were wondering whether "the purpose of their work was
    to offer information to media professionals or to enhance the image of the public
    authority for whom they work?" 186


       C. Practice of access to information

20. Despite the ATI decree, actual access is still challenging. For instance, on 28 January
    2012, Dar Assabah newspaper published a report about its bid to obtain information
    about an investment agreement between a Qatari investor and the government under
    which the investor bought government debentures. The newspaper requested
    information from the Ministries of International Co-operation and Finance, but both
    did not provide any and evaded responding to the request. The newspaper contacted
    the official responsible for the Tunisia-Qatar agreements who also asserted that she

       had no information about the content of the agreements, and that the details about
       these agreements are held with the ministry of finance. 187
21.    During the previous regime, al-Chourouq newspaper reported on the City of Culture,
       a project that was launched in 2006 and planned to be inaugurated in 2008.
       However, the project was never inaugurated; construction wo rks were very slow and
       halted many times. Ex-government officials refused to provide explanation about the
       interruption and suspension of the project. The Ministry of Culture and Heritage
       Preservation and the Ministry of Supplies and Housing exchanged blame about
       responsibility. The public and intellectuals were denied their right to know about the
       grounds for the incompletion of the national project. After the revolution the case of
       the City of Culture was submitted to the National Committee for the Investigation of
       Bribery and Corruption for allegations of corruption. 188 The Committee is criticized
       for having no communication with the public. It has not shared information about the
       number of cases, or provided updates about the status of the cases.
22.    During the previous regime, many journalists voiced their complaints about the
       withholding of information or delays in obtaining it from government agencies. Ali
       Zaydi, a journalist for Assabah, said "he often has to put forth tremendous effort and
       wait over a week for a piece of information, which usually falls short of what he
       wanted. In some cases, he did not obtain anything." 189
23.    In July 2011, journalists participating in training noted that access to economic
       information was difficult, and some statistics and data are unreliable. The training
       was aimed at exchanging views about strategies to tackle the economic crisis in
       Tunisia. Participants agreed on the significance of access to economic information
       through establishing communication offices at government agencies that facilitate
       journalists' access to updated, accurate, and useful information. 190
24.    In May 2009, 200 media activists, economists and academics discussed the ways to
       develop economic media. Participants called for guaranteeing journalists' access to
       sources of economic information and facilitating their access to the data of the
       National Council for Statistics that has to be collected and posted on one website, in
       particular the data of economic nature. 191


       D. ATI campaign agenda

 25. Civil society in Tunisia has recently started working on establishing a national
     coalition to include lawyers, media practitioners, bloggers, and CSOs. 192 Discussions
     have taken place with the National Organization for Human Rights. This coalition is

    still in its early stages and will seek to promote public awareness of the right of
    access to information and to advocate for implementation of the decree law. 193 There
    is no Transparency International chapter in Tunisia but there is the Tunisian
    Financial Transparency Association (ATTF) that has an anti-corruption mandate.
26. Public sector associations have convened their members to consider the importance
    of access to information for public sector operations. For example, in September
    2011 the National Association of public agencies' consultants with the Tunisian
    Association of Administrative Sciences organized a forum, which stressed the need
    for transparency. 194 Similarly, in June 2011 the Tunisian Association of
    Documentalists, Librarians and Archivists (ATDBA) organized a workshop on
    access to information held by public authorities. 195
27. Tunisian activists established a number of initiatives including "Open Gov
    Tunisie" 196 demanding transparency and citizens' participation in public
    administration. "Open Gov Tunisie" established a Facebook group named "7elll"197
    that aims at supporting Tunisians' access to the National Constituent Assembly.
    "7elll" demands that the minutes and reports of the committees be published, and
    that citizens can know about the drafting process of the new constitution. The group
    organized a sit- in across the office of the Constituent Assembly (CA) demanding
    access to the functions of CA. 198
28. It is worth noting that only a few CSOs are active on access to information. 199 The
    African Center for Journalist Training and Communication has engaged in
    organizing workshops discussing the ATI decree. 200 Informal groups were
    established that demand open government and use the right to access information to
    claim their right to participate in the activities of the new government in Tunisia.
    The economic crisis in the country, unemployment, and poverty continue to
    dominate the public scene. 201 Civil society has various priorities to deal with
    including delivering much needed services for people.

 Arab Freedom of Information Network
6. Arab Freedom of Information Network (AFOINET) is a coalition of four Arab
    NGOs, from Morocco, Egypt and Jordan, which was established in Casablanca in
    July 2008 and is dedicated to the defense and promotion of the fundamental right of
    access to information. 206 Marking the International Human Rights Day on 10
    December 2009, AFOINET published a report entitled “For the defense of the right
    of access to information in Arab States”. 207 The report appealed to Arab
    governments and parliaments to undertake national consultations to enact laws on
    the right of access to information. The Network sent copies of the report to
    government officials in Arab States and to offices of international intergovernmental
    organizations operating in Arab countries.
7. On 14 October 2008, AFOINET called on Arab states to adopt laws and regulations
    that preserve public access to information held by official authorities. 208
8. In January 2009, the first regional conference of the Arab Freedom of Information
    Network, titled “Information is a Right for All,” was held in Cairo. 209 The meeting
    was organized by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the
    National Council of Human Rights in partnership with the Center of Media Freedom
    in the Middle East and North Africa and was supported by the Beyster Institute at
    the University of California, San Diego. 210 Participants included media professors,
    journalists, lawyers, parliamentarians and civil society activists from six Arab
    countries - Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Palestine and Jordan. The
    conference endorsed a declaration titled “Cairo Declaration on the Right of Access
    to Information in the Arab World”. 211 The conference also adopted a draft set of
    Principles on Arab Media and the Right to Information. The Cairo Declaration called
    upon Arab governments to endorse the right of access to information and to revise
    and amend all the laws that obstruct access to information. The document also called
    for the engagement and encouragement of all parties in discussion of these draft
    laws. The declaration also asked Jordan to revise and amend other laws that hinder
    access to information.

   bans on the right to access information, and the endorsement of laws that protect the
   right to and the freedom of information.”



VII. RECOMMENDATIONS

    1. Shifting from a culture of secrecy to a culture of openness.
In the four countries, a culture of secrecy prevails over that of openness. This situation
can only be changed through a long-term process of legal and institutional reforms and
shifts in underlying beliefs through appropriate incentives. A number of activists in the
four countries emphasized the "culture" and "mindset" of public officials which prevents
access to information.

Leadership toward an open society is crucial. It is important to identify officials who
believe in openness and access to information and have them serve as champions within
the government. Unless governments realize the value of openness and the benefit of
openness vis-à-vis secrecy, very little can be achieved.

Governments can be helped in the development of policies on access to information and
be assisted in the design of a monitoring and evaluation system and indicators that are
specific, measurable, and achievable. This culture shift may also include incentives to
public agencies that put in place ATI systems in line with international standards,
including a reward system for public agencies that proactively disclose information
about its activities. Awareness raising and training is very important to assist public
agencies in this transition from secrecy to openness.

    2. Prioritizing the ATI agenda
The concept of access to information continues to encounter resistance despite public
statements by Arab governments. Maximum disclosure is not a concept that is fully
embraced by government officials. Therefore, it is important for ATI campaigns to
prioritize and advance access to information in areas that do not raise governments’
concerns (i.e. issues relating to national security and corruption). ATI campaigns can
demand routine information on health, education, housing, development, and the
environment. In these areas, ATI activists along with journalists should request
information on service delivery and government programs.



    3. Reviewing legislation and institutional mechanisms:
In Jordan and Tunisia, CSOs and media rights groups should advocate for reviewing
other laws that hamper access to information. Reforms should examine the regime of
exceptions for information disclosure. Additionally, governments need to develop clear
guidelines on the classification of documents to prevent discretionary classification.
Establishing an effective and adequate appeal mechanism is also important. In Jordan,
the Information Council has suffered from serious shortcomings in overseeing the
implementation process by public agencies. In the other countries, civil society and ATI
activists should advocate for stronger oversight mechanisms to ensure effective
enforcement of the legislation.

                                            37
    4. Capacity building:
There is consensus in the four countries that training should be conducted to help
government agencies shift from secrecy to openness. CSOs and international
organizations should use innovative methods in training public officials about access to
information. Local ATI trainers could serve as resource people. Case studies and ATI
examples from the local communities can assist trainees in understanding the concept
and principles of access to information. It is important that public agencies also develop
their own capacity building so that they have ownership of training, while civil society
provides technical assistance and expertise.

    5. Public awareness:
Public awareness regarding the right of access to information is critical. At the local
level, NGOs need to engage with community based organizations, trade unions, business
associations and citizen groups and associations and help them to advance their work,
claim rights, and request services through access to information. This will maximize
public awareness of the law and the right of access to information as a tool to advance
socio-economic rights.

    6. Resort to litigation and to every available body to demand the exercise of ATI
Advocates in the four countries highlighted the importance of an independent judicial
system that understands and believes in the legal right to access information. Although
judicial reform may take a long time, advocates should assist the courts to take a
progressive interpretation of the right to access information implied in the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of opinion and expression.

One successful case before the Court will have a great impact on government practices.
Additionally, civil society should test the will of the government through other
institutional mechanisms. The Ombudsman bureau or administrative courts may also
provide a forum for appealing administrative decisions relating to access to information.

    7. Records management.
The process of collecting, organizing, classifying and managing information needs to be
given more attention by public agencies. In some cases, information exists within public
agencies but it is not organized, but rather scattered and thus hard to retrieve.
Governments’ investment in records management is essential to ensure proper
implementation of any request-driven procedure.



    8. Resources’ allocation for ATI implementation
Governments are urged to allocate adequate resources into the implementation of ATI
laws. This involves not only budget but also technological tools and human resources.
Effective recruitment policies are needed to ensure that information officers are properly
appointed and trained to handle ATI requests.

Allocating resources to monitoring and evaluation is also a key component of the cost of
implementation. Governments need to develop mechanisms to collect data to monitor
implementation of ATI while elaborating public reports on it. International organizations
may assist in sharing international good practices.

                                            38
    9. ATI and the media
In the four countries, the media has been a key actor in the campaign for access to
information. Yet it needs to make use of the requesting procedure and test the limits of
governments’ openness. 218 Additionally, journalists can use ATI to cover sectoral
policies rather than political news. Furthermore, it is important that ATI is not seen as a
journalist’s or media issue, hence there is a need to build multi-stakeholder coalitions,
including grassroots groups, businesses, youth, etc.

    10. Regional networks and knowledge exchange
Civil society from the four Arab countries can build a community of practice around
access to information that fosters knowledge sharing and lessons learned. While the
approaches may vary in each country, there are problems that are common to the
countries in the region. In this regard the Jordanian experience on implementation of
ATI law can benefit Tunisian activists in their endeavor to advance the implementation
of the law. Lebanese activists may also take advantage of the Arab spring and the events
leading to the adoption of the ATI law in Tunisia to build up public demand for ATI
legislation.

A regional network could facilitate knowledge exchange with other regions document
concrete ATI examples from a human interest perspective, and support research to fill in
knowledge gaps.
