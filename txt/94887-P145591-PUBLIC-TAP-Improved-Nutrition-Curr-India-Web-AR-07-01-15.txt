EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Even after several decades of green revolution, malnutrition continues to be a major
development challenge in much of South Asia, and India has a major share of the
malnourished people in the region. The nutritional issues in India are complex and
therefore require a multifaceted, multidisciplinary solution. One facet of the solution
is increasing knowledge about the causes of and solutions to malnutrition at the farm
household level through agricultural extension. Disseminating nutrition-sensitive agri-
cultural knowledge is not currently an activity of agricultural extension in India, but
there is great potential for integrating it through the well-established network of exten-
sion oﬃcers. For nutrition goals to be integrated into extension, the curricula provided
to current and future agricultural extension agents must be revisited. As part of the
South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI), this paper focuses on
approaches to incorporating such nutrition content into the agricultural extension cur-
riculum. Three state agricultural universities in Tamil Nadu, united Andhra Pradesh,
and Bihar were used as case studies for the curriculum review. Through these case
studies, face-to-face consultations at the national level down to program implementa-
tion at the village level have been developed. These include consultative workshops,
and a conceptual framework and strategy for incorporating nutrition into extension
curriculum development to improve nutrition outcomes. This strategy, detailed in this
report, includes opportunities for collaboration from the national level to the com-
munity level. Speciﬁc lessons and follow-up actions are outlined that may be useful for
other South Asian countries.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Achieving nutritional and health objectives through agricultural development has
picked up momentum recently after the realization that food production and food
and nutrition consumption must be eﬀectively integrated (Ruel, Alderman, and the
Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group 2013). This is largely because agricultural
production gains in the past did not result in the nutritional transformation needed
for reducing high levels of malnutrition. The case of India is typical. This paper
explores how increasing nutritional knowledge through agricultural interventions can
help improve agriculture-nutrition outcomes. It focuses speciﬁcally on approaches to
improving the content and delivery mechanism of extension and advisory services to
more eﬀectively integrate agriculture-nutrition information.

In general, agricultural programming could be better integrated with nutrition goals
and outcomes in two broad pathways. First, as part of the multisectoral approach to
nutrition, the agriculture sector has a role to play at various levels—from the policy
design stage to program implementation. Second, agricultural interventions could be
made nutrition sensitive and nutrition smart more directly through better assessments
of the nutritional situation in communities and improving the design of agricultural
systems that meet nutritional goals. This paper focuses on the latter approach to
integration of agriculture and nutrition through improving the curriculum of the
extension and advisory services (EAS) and thus increasing the eﬀective delivery of
nutrition knowledge.

Nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions have been recommended for some
time to address the shortcomings of agricultural transformations that did not fully
address food insecurity and malnutrition in several developing countries (Kataki
and Babu 2002). Yet serious attempts to understand how agricultural and food
production improvements could be fully translated into increased food and nutri-
tion security at the household level remain limited (Levinson and Herforth 2014).
Making food and agricultural systems and program and policy interventions more
nutrition sensitive requires identifying opportunities for improving the inten-
sity of nutrition knowledge use at various stages of production, marketing, and

A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR INTEGRATING
NUTRITION INTO AGRICULTURE EXTENSION
Although nutrition goals have been identiﬁed as part of agricultural research and
development programs for the past 40 years (Pinstrup-Andersen, de Londoño, and
Hoover 1976), explicitly integrating nutrition goals as part of interventions has not
been given serious consideration until recently (Kataki and Babu 2002). Integration of
nutrition objectives as part of EAS is much more recent (Sulaiman and Davis 2012).
A major intervention approach to achieving nutrition goals through agriculture has
been the home garden, which required nutritionists and horticulturists to collaborate
to identify nutritional problems, develop plant-based interventions, and train rural
households to grow nutrient-rich crops. Although successful pilots have been reported
in the past three decades, it has been extremely diﬃcult to scale up plant-based nutri-
tion intervention, partly because of poor mainstreaming of nutrition-sensitive agricul-
ture interventions in agricultural EAS (Babu 2002).

Integrating nutrition into EAS has been attempted at various levels. At the national
level, nutrition policies have recognized the need to teach farm and rural households
the importance of nutrition- and plant-based interventions. However, much of this
remains to be accomplished. Despite helping transfer technology relevant to speciﬁc
crops already grown, extension services have not helped much to diversify crops so that
growers can gain higher incomes and better nutrition (Yu and Mwangi 2015). Exten-
sion departments and the sectors addressing nutritional challenges such as health and
social welfare did not converge at diﬀerent levels. Convergence is a major challenge
for the sectors involved in nutrition, even leaving EAS out of eﬀorts to coordinate
action. There have been some eﬀorts to integrate EAS in regions where malnutrition
is high. For example, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in some areas of
Tamil Nadu State in India were able to interact with agricultural extension workers to
identify foods that are available in abundance and at the lowest cost to use as part of
a diet developed for nutrition interventions (Pandi 2014). However, the development
of comprehensive programs at the national level that will integrate EAS at the policy,
program, and project levels remains limited.

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODS AND APPROACHES
To identify opportunities to eﬀectively integrate nutrition goals into EAS, several sets
of discussions and interviews were conducted in various parts of India. The ﬁrst con-
sisted of community-level consultations through focused group discussions. Several
rounds of focused group discussion were held between 2010 and 2014 in more than
30 villages in Tamil Nadu. The discussions revolved around information needs of the
farming community and how extension services could be better organized to provide
the knowledge and information needed to improve the income and welfare of rural
households. Consultations were then conducted with the various levels of EAS in the
southern states of united Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu to understand
the information sources, capacity levels of EAS functionaries, and the ability of the
system to meet the nutrition education needs of rural communities. Further, interviews
were conducted with scientists who are involved in adoptive research in the KVKs to
understand their perspectives on the nutritional challenges, how they addressed these
challenges in their research, and how their research results are translated into exten-
sion messages in rural communities.

This was followed by the mapping of the various approaches and pathways to nutri-
tion education in the current system of pluralistic extension services operating in
India. This process used the Net-Map method though consultations with various
extension functionaries and policy makers through both individual interviews and
joint discussions. The net-mapping process helps reveal the institutional architecture
of EAS in the context of policy making, program design, and implementation and
also helps show who is involved in decision making at various levels, their power rela-
tions, and how they are linked to various elements of EAS at the state and at central
government levels.

To revise agricultural extension and nutrition curricula eﬀectively to increase nutri-
tional impact, it is important to understand the key actors and players involved in
translating nutrition goals into nutrition and agricultural programs that have greater
impact in the ﬁeld. Agricultural universities are the primary medium for training
future extension agents, researchers, and trainers in the ﬁeld (Glendenning, Babu,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

MAPPING INSTITUTIONS FOR INTEGRATING
AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION
Although agriculture (that is, food production) is very closely linked to nutrition (that
is, food consumption) in theory, in most program implementations of education and
extension, the two concepts are presented and pursued separately. The agriculture-
nutrition-health continuum is increasingly recognized as the paradigm for nutrition
interventions in rural areas of developing countries. However, until recently, agricul-
ture has rarely been explicitly leveraged as a tool for improving health and nutrition.
The ﬁrst 40 years of development eﬀorts and interventions focused primarily on the
Green Revolution and the increased production of staple foods. Although these eﬀorts
did lead to major improvements in food security in terms of caloric availability at the
national level, this has not been suﬃcient to improve nutrition security.

Nutrition is a multidisciplinary issue with dimensions of health, social welfare, and
agriculture and should therefore be addressed in some capacity by all key actors and
stakeholders in these areas. However, although the need to address nutrition chal-
lenges has been recognized, a paradigm shift is still needed so that increased nutrition
security is seen as a goal of all agricultural programs. Many nutrition intervention
programs already exist in India; however, these are sectoral in nature and typically
work with limited coordination. To create a multidisciplinary nutrition curriculum for
agricultural extension, it is important ﬁrst to understand how communities and indi-
viduals receive their nutrition information. Figure 4.1 maps the common channels of
agricultural-nutrition linkages from the national level to the village level.

At the national level in India, nutrition challenges are addressed through four main
government entities: the Ministry of Agriculture; the Ministry of Consumer Aﬀairs,
Food, and Public Distribution; the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment; and
the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Ministry of Agriculture oversees the
national and state departments of agricultural extension. The National Institute of
Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) is run by the central Ministry of
Agriculture and is primarily responsible for the training and education of future and

SPECIFIC LESSONS
AND THE WAY FORWARD
Several speciﬁc lessons emerge from the curriculum review exercise and the consulta-
tions undertaken for this project:
    » Nutrition as a subject is largely missing in the curriculum of the agricultural
       universities that train agricultural extension professionals who could integrate
       nutrition as a ﬁnal outcome of the agricultural production process.
    » The current extension reforms undertaken under the rubric of ATMA should
       be used as an opportunity to integrate nutrition into the extension process. This
       will create the needed demand for the curriculum development. Without such
       demand from the extension system, there is little incentive for the curriculum
       of the universities to change.
    » Midcareer training of the agricultural extension workers does not include nutri-
       tion courses, and this has created a vacuum in the extension system in terms of
       nutrition content.
    » Training of the farmers in KVKs at the district level recognizes the nutrition
       challenges, but this program does not have a systematic way of training at the
       block, community, and farmer level or at the extension worker level.
    » At the university level, nutrition is taught in home science colleges, but the
       graduates of this program do not directly enter the extension services.
       Conversely, future agricultural extension professionals are not trained in the
       contents of nutrition-related courses.
    » Nutrition as a development challenge also needs to be taught to agricultural
       and social sciences students, given the slow progress made in reducing mal-
       nutrition levels. This challenge is often highlighted in national discussions on
       agriculture links to nutrition security, but the next step toward confronting this
       challenge through the development of capacity for addressing nutritional chal-
       lenges has yet to gain momentum.
    » Discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture and ICAR indicate that this is also
       the appropriate time to initiate and guide the curriculum review process as part
       of the proposed World Bank–funded National Agricultural Education Project.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
To address the large disconnect between agricultural growth and nutrition outcomes
that currently exists in several developing countries, the paper focused on approaches
to incorporating nutrition content into agricultural extension curriculum. To achieve
better agriculture-nutrition integration, there is a clear need for making agricultural
extension and other intervention programs more nutrition sensitive. This requires
understanding of the channels of knowledge ﬂow from the national to the community
and household levels and the demand and opportunities for knowledge-based inter-
vention through these channels. Agricultural education as currently designed in India
does not prepare future extension and other knowledge workers for such integration.
A review of agricultural curriculum with a nutrition focus revealed large gaps and
opportunities to address them. In the process of operationalizing the revision of nutri-
tion content and designing capacity-strengthening programs to enhance the knowl-
edge base of midcareer professionals, several lessons emerged for other developing
countries that face similar challenges. Given the resource constraints for designing and
implementing nutrition programs and agricultural programs faced by the develop-
ing countries where malnutrition levels are high, the need for eﬀective integration of
agriculture and nutrition through nutrition-sensitive knowledge interventions cannot
be overemphasized.
