                   Research on the role of contact farmers demonstrates how to increase the
                   adoption of new agricultural practices. Recent evidence on land tenure reform
                   shows it can encourage investments in land, especially benefiting women.

Peer learning among farmers in Mozambique
Strengthening the role of contact farmers, especially women, increases the
adoption of new agricultural practices.


  THE ISSUE                                    THE PROJECT

  OF MOZAMBIQUE’S        productivity in       transfer of information from extension agents to

                         failure.                •• Performance-based incentives.



  THE RESULTS
  For contact farmers:
    •• Male CFs reported learning significantly more techniques, especially mulching (although
       the increase wasn’t reflected in exam results).
    •• Male CFs adopted the techniques that they self-reported as having learned on their
       demonstration plots. The increase in use of these techniques was greater in the group that
       included women CFs relative to the group with only male CFs (e.g., 44% versus 35% for
       micro-basin adoption).
    •• Male CFs adopted mulching and micro-basins on plots other than their main farming plot.
       This may be for purposes of risk reduction (i.e., adopting new techniques on less important
       plots).
  For other farmers:
    •• Farmers seem to benefit more from CF visits than from going to see the CF’s
       demonstration plot.
    •• Farmers’ knowledge of mulching and micro-basins increased more for farmers who were
       served by both female and male CFs than for those who were only served by male CFs.
    •• There is a large and positive impact on adoption across the two treatment groups for
       one technique (micro-basins) but not for another (mulching). Contact farming can indeed
       be effective.

    THE IMPLICATIONS
    •• Training CFs can provide an effective way of addressing information supply as a market failure and
       increasing the adoption of new agricultural practices.

    •• Including women in CF training can bring more benefits and reach more farmers: this appears to result
       not only from a quantitative increase in training, but also from complementarities between male and
       female CFs.

    HOW IT WORKED
    The MSDVP was part of a larger national agricultural reform to rebuild the agricultural extension network
    in five districts of the Zambezi Valley.

    Objectives:
    •• Increase smallholder farmer incomes, and
    •• Decrease land degradation and improve the resilience of ecosystems to climate change.
    While CFs are commonly used, their ability to supply information is limited by the lack of a clearly defined
    role or compensation. The absence of women as CFs could also impede peer learning by female farmers.
    This project was an innovative effort to improve adoption of improved agricultural techniques in the face
    of these challenges.


       The project included:
       •• Specialized sustainable land management training to extension agents and CFs,
       •• Assignment of demonstration plots to CFs,
       •• Provision of performance-based incentives to CFs, and
       •• Specific inclusion of training for female CFs in one of the treatment groups.


    More on the training :
    •• Training for extension agents consisted of a three-day course in sustainable land management
       techniques, evenly split between class lectures and practical plot demonstrations.
    •• Eight techniques were covered in training: Mulching, Crop Rotation, Intercropping, Reduced Tillage,
       Micro-basins, Contour Farming, Row Planting, and Improved Fallowing.
    •• The extension agents then taught the same course to the CFs.
    •• CFs received a toolkit that included a bicycle and tools to plow the land, and had the autonomy to
       disseminate the techniques they deemed most appropriate for their village.

What Else You Need to Know about
Agricultural Extension
The following section highlights the results of recent impact evaluations. Along with other research
(highlighted on page 15), these studies suggest the following implications for policy-makers:

•• Lack of information is a critical barrier to the adoption of new agricultural techniques.
•• Social networks of farmers who share similar characteristics can be more cost effective for disseminating
   information than formal extension services – especially once a core group of farmers have adopted the
   technology.
•• Small, time-limited discounts on agricultural inputs may offer a more efficient solution to low input use
   than either heavy subsidies or doing nothing.
•• Different farmers will benefit from different investments, depending on their constraints. In some cases, a
   road will be more helpful than improved seed varieties.
•• Policies aimed at mitigating risks for poor farmers (e.g., insurance or drought resistant varieties) could
   help increase the use of expensive productive inputs, such as fertilizer.

                                                                           Evidence to inform development operations   3
    Initial data for the Agricultural Development Programme Support Project in Malawi suggested that
    lack of information was the most important reason for non-adoption of new agricultural techniques.
    Yishay and Mobarak (2013) then used a randomized controlled trial to test how three different models of
    agricultural extension affect the transmission of information related to agricultural techniques.

                FIRST MODEL                      SECOND MODEL                         THIRD MODEL

             This model entails only                This model supports
             using an AGRICULTURAL                  the EXTENSION
             EXTENSION OFFICER.                     OFFICER with a
                                          LEAD FARMER, a contact              This model supports the
                                          farmer selected by the              EXTENSION OFFICER
                                          extension officer together with     with FIVE PEER FARMERS,
                                          community leaders, and who          contact farmers selected by a
                                          tends to be more educated           community focus group, and
                                          than the average farmer.            who are more representative of
                                                                              the average farmer.


    The aim of the study is to test which of these three models is the most effective way to deliver information
    to farmers on agricultural techniques and to see whether leveraging the social networks provided by PFs
    and LFs is an effective model. The study also tests whether offering incentives improves the transmission of
    information to farmers.

    The two techniques supported by the project were pit planting and a form of composting. In each of the
    three models, the extension officer received three days of training (including class-based and practical
    training). In the two models with contact farmers, the extension officer then provided training to the LF
    or PFs. Half of communicators (the extension officer, LF, or PF) in each of the three models were given
    incentives based on the knowledge scores and adoption rates of the farmers they were assigned to support.

    Findings:
    Without incentives, the extension officer-only model appears to be the most effective (at both increasing
    farmer knowledge and farmer adoption of new technologies). In that context, PFs do not even effectively
    learn about pit planting and composting, and so are not able to pass on information to other farmers.
    However, when provided with a small incentive (a bag of seeds), peer farmers represent the most effective
    model for passing on information and convincing other farmers to adopt these techniques. With incentives:

      PFs increase their knowledge by              PFs are the communicators most likely to hold
      19-20 percentage points. This                extension activities.
      compares to an increase of just
      7 percentage points for LFs.

      Recipient farmers increase their             Adoption of pit planting increases more in PF villages
      knowledge levels more in PF villages         (10.2 percentage points compared to a mean of 1.7
      (12 percentage points) than in LF            percent), than in LF (6.3) or extension working-only
      (8 percentage points) or extension           (5.5) villages. The same pattern is observed for the
      worker-only (6 percentage points)            on-farm monitoring of adoption: It is estimated that
      villages.                                    the PF model would increase yields by 113 percent.


4   Africa Impact Evaluation Update
The results of the study suggest that peer farmers communicate more effectively with farmers that have
farms of similar size and common input use. Social proximity and status are less important. The authors
estimate a benefit/cost ratio for the PF model of 4.5:1. So, with a shortage of extension staff in Malawi and
with only 18 percent of farmers reporting any kind of extension activity, leveraging the social networks of
peer farmers could prove a cost-effective way of radically expanding extension coverage and effectiveness.

The Government of Ethiopia launched the Rural Capacity Building Project (RCBP) to strengthen
extension services by making them more responsive to the needs of smallholder farmers, with a focus on
economically viable and environmentally sustainable agricultural techniques. The RCBP included support to
various activities related to extension training and equipment.

A World Bank impact evaluation of the project (Buehren et al. forthcoming) assessed the impact of the
training of delivery agents and the upgrading of farmer training systems on productivity. The results showed
that the program significantly expanded the scale of agricultural activities of beneficiary farmers and also
increased the focus on higher value crops and cattle.

LAND TITLING

Lessons from land tenure reform in Rwanda
Land Tenure Reform can encourage greater investment in land, with especially
large benefits for women.

                                                        short term impacts.


   THE RESULTS
   •• The project resulted in no significant decrease in the perceived risk of expropriation: This may
      be because knowledge of the policy is limited

   •• Households benefiting from the program are almost 10 percentage points more likely to
      make or maintain soil conservation investments, which is double the change in investment
      over time for non-beneficiary households.

   •• For female headed households, the program results in a 19 percentage point increase in the
      likelihood of soil conversion investments - twice the increase for male headed households

   •• For cohabiting women who are not legally married there was an 8 percentage point
      reduction in the probability of having documented land ownership, compared to a 17
      percentage point increase for those who are legally married (which is about 70% of couples).

   •• Greater certainty on inheritance benefits children and gender equality: Children are 13
      percentage points more likely to inherit the land, with both sexes benefiting equally.

   •• Contrary to concerns, LTR does not cause households who lack access to credit and insurance
      to panic-sell their land below its market




                                                                     Evidence to inform development operations   7
    THE IMPLICATIONS
    •• LTR can effectively increase investment in land, even before land titles are issued.
    •• Special attention should be paid to improving land rights for women who are not legally married.
    •• Ensuring that beneficiaries are knowledgeable about their rights is critical.

    HOW IT WORKED

      1. SETTING THE PRECONDITIONS                             2. PILOTING THE APPROACH
      •• The legal preconditions for the LTR program           •• The government decided to start with a pilot
         were established by Rwanda’s 1999 inheritance            due to the dearth of previous successful
         law and its 2005 organic land law which                  programs from which to learn lessons and the
         aimed to eliminate gender discrimination in              need to fine-tune the approach to the specific

         system of land tenure to replace the former
         dual customary/formal tenure system.

      3. IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM                              4. EVALUATING THE IMPACT
      •• The program employed local para-surveyors to          •• Using an impact evaluation to generate
         identify land parcel boundaries and to record            rigorous evidence was critical given the lack
         these boundaries with aerial photos and claim-           of previous successful programs from which
         receipts signed by all adjoining neighbors. To           lessons could be drawn. These lessons were

         and all adjoining neighbors.                          •• The impact evaluation compared changes
      •• Parcel details were transferred to a public              in administrative regions that received the

    What Else You Need to Know About Land Titling
    The following section highlights the results of recent impact evaluations. Along with other research (see
    page 20), these studies suggest the following implications for policy-makers:

    •• In mapping land claims, employ a transparent and participatory process – formalization programs can be
       exploited by the strong and politically connected.
    •• Land titling cannot be a complete solution in the absence of other policy features, such as a functioning
       credit market and an enabling regulatory framework for land registration.


8   Africa Impact Evaluation Update
•• Local context matters – formal titling is not always the key and it may sometimes be better and more
   cost-effective to work within the customary framework.
•• Perceived and de facto tenure security may be more important than formal de jure security. However,
   some long-term investments (like letting land lie fallow) may require more formal security.
•• Information technology can be used to reduce the costs of registering transactions (for owners) and
   accessing borrower information (for lenders).
•• Rural land titling:
   –	 Land titling programs may cause an initial increase in perceived insecurity as claims to land parcels
      are publicly discussed and verified.
   –	 While increased rural tenure security may allow greater investment in land, the relationship may also
      run the other way, with farmers making certain investments in order to increase their claims to the
      land.
•• Urban land titling:
   –	 Encourages investment in residential infrastructure.
   –	 Allows owners to engage in more work outside of (and further from) the home by transferring the
      responsibility for protecting their land to the state.
   –	 Can reduce poverty in the long term through increased human and physical capital investment.

The Plan Foncier Rural (PFR) in Benin enabled producers to formalize the security of rights obtained
under customary arrangements in rural areas. The government-implemented program included: (1)
awareness raising; (2) a socio-legal survey of land claims; (3) mapping of rights for each land parcel; (3) a
public review which provided the opportunity for any claims to be contested; (4) final validation of claims
upon no-objection; and (5) the delivery of final land use certificates.

The World Bank conducted an impact evaluation which tested the short-run impact of the program (i.e.,
prior to the final issuance of land use certificates). Key results from the evaluation include:

•• A 4 percentage point increase in perceived tenure insecurity, which is perhaps to be expected in the
   short term with increased attention on potentially competing land claims
•• A significant reduction in land conflicts for land controlled by female-headed households
•• Increased land investments such as a 17 percent increase in the likelihood of a parcel having clear
   borders and a 20 percent increase in overall perennial tree planting, including a 50 percent increase in oil
   palm planting
•• An increase in women’s short-term investment in land, but mixed signs on empowerment:
   –	 A slight shift in male land managers’ inheritance plans away from sons and towards daughters
   –	 An 18 percent increase in women having a say in household land decisions
   –	 A 47 percent increase in the use of fertilizer on female-managed plots
   –	 An 11 percent increase in women reporting no spousal conflict over the past 12 months
   –	 A reduction in the share of female household heads with a position of responsibility in village land
      management, despite an overall 150 percent increase across all households

       Between 1996 and 2003, an urban land titling program implemented by the Peruvian government
       radically reduced the length and cost of the land title acquisition process. Erica Field conducted an impact
       evaluation of the program, finding significant positive impacts on employment hours and employment
       outside of the home, and negative impacts on child labor. These impacts resulted from increased tenure
       security, which allowed households to shift the role of property protection from the household and
       community members to the state.

       Specific highlights of the evaluation results include:
       •• Recent titling beneficiaries reported the same perceived risk of eviction as citizens who had titles before
          the program, which is one third of the risk reported by squatters yet to benefit from titling
       •• An increase of 12.2 hours of employment per week per household 2 years after receiving a formal title,
          increasing to 32 hours after 4 years
       •• The vast majority of additional employment hours are accounted for by men. The increase for women is
          insignificant.
       •• A 40.3 percent drop in the likelihood of working inside the home.
       •• A 4 percentage point increase in the proportion of households that include a worker who commutes
          more than 2 hours each way.
       •• A four-hour per week reduction in child labor for households with fewer than four working-age members.
       •• A cost-benefit analysis suggests that the increase in employment income would far exceed the relatively
          low cost of the intervention: $66 per title (20% of which was recovered from user fees) and minimal
          additional costs to main the property registry.

10     Africa Impact Evaluation Update
A World Bank study in Ethiopia (Deininger, Ali, and Alemu, 2011) found significant short-term
impacts of a government-implemented land registration program on tenure security, land-related
investment, and rental market participation. The Government of Ethiopia officially owns all land, so
the program provided farmers with non-alienable use-right certificates, rather than full titles. The
intervention started with an information campaign, to increase awareness of the program among targeted
beneficiaries. The program then used a participatory community approach to identify land parcels and
displayed mapping decisions in public, providing community members with an opportunity to contest
any decisions before they were officially recorded. The program was innovative in that it provided for joint
land ownership by spouses, thus addressing the issue of gender quality.

Some key results of the program include:

Significantly, the costs of implementing the program - $1 per parcel - were not only low relative to the $20
to $60 per plot incurred by many previous titling projects, but were also lower than the increased output
of $5.80-$9 per hectare. Significantly, over 80% of participating households indicated that they would be
willing to cover these costs, suggesting that the program could be highly sustainable.

The analysis generates some interesting policy implications:
•• Increased tenure security can lead to increased investments that are related to greater productivity
•• Given the significant benefits, low implementation costs, and the willingness of participants to cover
   implementation costs, the program could inform a viable, sustainable approach for some African
   governments.

    •• The most critical factors for improving the likelihood and intensity of fertilizer use are access to
       credit, household size, formal education, and the value-to-cost ratio.
    •• Removing subsidies implies a 24 percent reduction in the demand for fertilizer.
    •• Take away: Government investment in health sector infrastructure could contribute to

    •• Use of fertilizer entails a downside risk: when harvests are low, the high costs of fertilizer result
       in lower returns than if it had not been used.
    •• As a consequence of this risk, poor farmers use less fertilizer than they otherwise would: 16
       percent more fertilizer per hectare is used when predicted consumption is increased by one
       standard deviation.

    •• Small time-limited discounts on fertilizer offer a higher-welfare solution to low fertilizer use
       than laissez faire or heavy subsidies.
    •• The problem of over-use and high fiscal costs of subsidies could be mitigated by limiting the
       quantity of subsidized fertilizer available to each farmer.

    •• Productivity gains are greater for farmers with higher yields, suggesting that extension services
       may enhance unobserved attributes, such as management skills.
    •• Distance to market centers reduced farm yields, with the high transaction costs reducing
       farmers’ ability to buy productive inputs, such as fertilizer.

       different farmers, including those with low yields.

               •• Perception of risk and attitude towards risk both play an important role in determining
                  technology adoption
               •• Take away: Learning plays a critical role in technology adoption by reducing farmers’

               •• The impact on fertilizer and improved seed adoption of learning from neighbors was three
                  times that of additional extension visits.
               •• Between 1999-2009, the impact of additional extension visits on seed adoption shrunk
                  massively: Extension services are mainly useful in the early stages of adoption.
               •• Take away: The focus of the government on targeting extension services more specifically to
                  the context of different farmers and to target farmers’ closest spatial neighbors is appropriate.

               •• Non-beneficiaries of the project with just a few treated information neighbors are more likely
                  to give up the technology after trying it than those with many treated information neighbors.
               •• Treated neighbors relieved information constraints primarily on non-members with above
                  average potential productivity
               •• Offering a new crop to many households in a few communities is preferable to offering it to
                  fewer households in many communities.
               •• Take away: Extension programs will maximize impact if they target households with many
                  neighbors – especially those with high potential OSP productivity.

               •• Highly seasonal labor and income patterns of poorer households reduce their adoption of
                  System of Rice Intensification (a common system for increasing yields), though they benefit
                  from opportunities for employment/lower food costs that result from the use of SRI on larger
                  farms.
               •• The larger the area of land used in the first year of adoption, the more productive the
                  technique and the greater likelihood of continued adoption.
               •• Take away: Learning from others is a significant factor in the likelihood of SRI adoption and
                  disadoption.

               •• The weaker social learning of rice farmers is explained by their greater heterogeneity in
                  growing conditions and the greater sensitivity of rice to unobserved farm characteristics.
               •• Take away: It may be advisable to invest more in concentrated external information programs
                  in a context where social learning is less likely.

     •• Inadequate local supply of seed and agronomic information about the new varieties reduces
        the likelihood of adoption of disease resistant pigeonpea. Participation in informal seed
        networks and the participation of women in farming decisions increase the likelihood of
        adoption.
     •• Take away: To increase adoption of disease-resistant varieties, programs should strengthen rural
        institutions in semi-arid areas to overcome seed market failures, and use awareness campaigns
        to spread information about benefits.

     •• Access to information is a crucial barrier to technological adoption in agriculture
     •• When provided with incentives, peer farmers who are more similar to the average farmer in a
        community are able to more effectively pass on information than lead farmers who may have
        less in common with the average farmer.
     •• Take away: leveraging the social networks of peer farmers could prove a cost-effective way of
        radically expanding extension coverage and effectiveness.

        process of registration was not sustained and only 26 percent of provisional titles were
        converted to absolute titles in the 17 years since the project, suggesting land owners do not

     •• Formal land rights (land titles) have no impact on productivity, but some informal rights are
        important.
     •• ·The role of formal land titles is less important in former French colonies compared to former
        British colonies, which had more success replacing customary systems.
     •• ·Take away: If the formal land tenure system is weak, it may be necessary to focus on first
        improving the legal and policy framework, rather than merely on increasing the use of formal
        land titles.

               •• Land rights are endogenous: certain investments in land increase land tenure security.

                  include income-sharing arrangements are associated with higher productivity.
               •• Take away: In order to maximize productivity, land tenure systems should allow for farms to
                  operate at an efficient scale and should ensure that systems do not provide a disincentive to
                  investment through the sharing of farming proceeds.

               •• Take away: Given the significant benefits, low implementation costs, and the willingness of

11   Credit Access in India”. World Bank Policy Research Paper, No. 5244.
     •• The computerization of land registry systems across Andhra Pradesh reduced the cost to
        owners of registering transactions and the cost to lenders of accessing information.
     •• There was no impact on credit in rural areas but increased credit supply in urban areas.
     •• Take away: Impacts on credit access depend on the quality of the underlying information, and

     •• Vietnam’s 1993 Land Law gave households the right to exchange, transfer, lease, inherit, and
        mortgage their land use rights.
     •• Take away: The law liberalizing land use significantly increased the area of land devoted to
        long-term crops and the amount of labor devoted to non-farm activities, but had no impact on
        access to credit markets or land market participation.

13   and Social Perspectives.” Land Use Policy 15(1): pp. 143–69.
     •• Further research is needed on the equity implications of titling, impacts on land market activity,
        conflict between modern and customary rights, and the costs of alternative land registration
        systems
     •• Take away: Land titling cannot be a complete solution in the absence of other policy features,

     Fenske, J. 2011. “Land tenure and investment incentives: Evidence from West Africa.”
14   Journal of Development Economics 95 (1): pp. 137-56.
     •• A review of data from across West Africa shows that while land rights are often enough to
        encourage investment, the strength of these rights is conditional on use, with land left fallow
        being vulnerable.
     •• Tree planting can enhance tenure security but can be affected by the nature of tenure.
     •• Take away: Short-term investments such as labor and fertilizer are not affected by land rights,
        so if African agriculture becomes more input-intensive, tenure security will be less important.

     Field, E. 2007. “Entitled to work: Urban property rights and labor supply in Peru”. The
15   Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122(4), pp. 1561-1602.
     •• An urban land titling program implemented by the Peruvian government radically reduced the
        length and cost of the land title acquisition process.
     •• Increased tenure security, allowed households to shift the role of property protection from
        household and community members to the state.
     •• Take away: Land titling can be a cost-effective policy in an urban setting, allowing households
        to devote more efforts to productive activities outside of the home.

               •• In urban Argentina, titling resulted in better short-run health for children, but there is no
                  significant impact on longer-term health indicators, such as height-for-age.
               •• Take away: Land titling programs should not replace more direct policies for improving child

               •• Land titling in urban Argentina had, twenty years later, a modest impact on access to mortgage
                  credit and no impact on access to other forms of credit.
               •• Significant positive impacts on household investment and education of children and a
                  negative impact on household size.
               •• Take away: Urban land titling can reduce poverty in the long term through increased human
                  and physical capital investment, but is unlikely to be an effective tool to combat poverty in the
                  short-term through access to credit.

               •• Security of tenure depends on a farmer’s position in the local political hierarchy.
               •• Take away 1: Having more secure land rights allows farmers to take the risk of leaving land
                  fallow for longer periods, which is found to be the most important investment in land quality.
               •• Take away 2: Men’s greater political power and consequently more secure land rights enable
                  them to leave land fallow for longer, making them more profitable than women.

               •• The Chinese system involves local leaders periodically reallocating collectively held land
                  among households in the same village.
               •• This study finds that higher expropriation risk has a significant negative impact on use of
                  organic fertilizer, depriving soil of the lasting benefits from organic fertilizer.
               •• Take away: Risk of expropriation reduces the likelihood of long-term soil conservation.

               •• Land titling had no significant impact on land-related investment and only modest impacts on
                  land productivity and values.
               •• The existing customary tenure system appears to provide sufficient security.
               •• The cost of a title would need to fall by a factor of six for it to make economic sense.
               •• Take away: Formal titling may not be a good option where customary systems provide
                  sufficient security and land plots are small.

21   Deforestation: Cocoa in Cameroon.” Agricultural Economics 35(1): pp. 19–26.
     •• Improved tenure security over cocoa fields with existing traditional varieties of cocoa increases
        farmers’ welfare, but at the cost of additional deforestation. When improved tenure security
        is combined with a new, faster-maturing cocoa variety, the impact is increased welfare and a
        decline in deforestation.
     •• Take away: in addition to looking at land investments and farmer welfare, land tenure programs
        should consider potential ecological impacts.

     •• Insecure property rights in the Dominican Republic reduce land rental market activity and
        increase market segmentation.
     •• Take away: Simulations suggest that more secure property rights could increase the total area
        rented to the poor by 63 percent, with most of this gain coming from reducing land conflicts
        and increasing land protection rather than through formal titling.

     •• Case studies in Kenya show that the formalization of land rights can benefit the powerful
        and socially connected and disadvantage those with less wealth and political power, such as
        women.
     •• Take away: It is critical to understand the local context and to think through the likely winners
        and losers of particular formalization programs.

     •• More secure rights increase the incidence of obesity, thus weight gain impacts may not signal
        positive nutritional impact.
     •• Take away: More secure urban property rights lead to an increase in children’s weight, but not
        in their height which is considered to be an indicator of long-term nutritional impact.
