I.         Introduction


        The current ways of working in fragile states need serious improvement. Despite the significant investment and the
        commitments of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) and the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), results
        and value for money have been modest. Transitioning out of fragility is long, political work that requires country
        leadership and ownership. Processes of political dialogue have often failed due to lack of trust, inclusiveness, and
        leadership. International partners can often bypass national interests and actors, providing aid in overly technocratic
        ways that underestimate the importance of harmonising with the national and local context, and support short-term
        results at the expense of medium- to long-term sustainable results brought about by building capacity and systems.

        A New Deal for engagement in fragile states is necessary.
                                                                    Opening paragraph of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States

The effects of fragility, conflict, and violence have a long-
lasting and deep-rooted ability to undermine a country’s
economic growth and escape from poverty. On average, a
country that experienced major violence over the period
from 1981 to 2005 has a poverty rate 21 percentage points
higher than a country that saw no violence. The cyclical
nature of violence and conflict also has a crippling effect
on growth; countries that have faced civil war require an
average of 14 years of peace to recover to original growth
paths (World Bank, 2011b).

As an increasing number of developing countries sustain
strong economic growth and made good progress towards
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), international
aid agencies must face up to the greatest remaining
challenge in development: the growing share of poverty
prevalent in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and
violence (FCV). Engagement in fragile contexts carries
significant risk, but failing to engage in these contexts
carries far greater consequences.

  Box 2.1: THE ROOTS AND LASTING EFFECTS OF THE CAPACITY CONUNDRUM IN LIBERIA

  Emerging from years of war, the water sector in Liberia was highly fragmented and lacked cohesive planning
  and management systems. Non-state actors provided emergency relief but lacked the overview and reach to
  deliver services equitably across the country, or to put in place management processes to sustain interventions.
  Ineffective government institutions remained on the sidelines. The dearth of investment in the country’s water
  sector institutions was accompanied by, and has contributed to, a deep-seated lack of absorption capacity.

  A sector capacity development plan completed in 2012 reported that central government ministries responsible
  for water, sanitation, and hygiene services struggled with chronic technical and financial capacity gaps. There
  were inadequate staff numbers at the national level to supervise and support subnational staff where there
  were shortages at county, district, municipality, and health facility levels without the skills and facilities to
  carry out basic core duties such as pump monitoring and maintenance (Government of Liberia 2014). An
  institutional audit, in the same year, described Liberia’s national utility as “an organization in crises [sic]”,
  “financially insolvent”, “unable to meet basic service deliverables […] with most of its infrastructure left
  inoperable or in poor condition”, an organization in “firefighting mode with almost all of its limited capacity
  dedicated to dealing with daily emergencies” (GBSI/Government of Liberia 2012).

  Almost a decade after the war the prospect of a transition to a country-led development program for the
  water sector was even more challenging as bypassing sector institutions had left (a) the government with no
  overview of where services had or had not been delivered in rural areas; (b) rural water supply solutions in
  urban areas with poor water quality outcomes competing with the demand for LWCS’s services; and (c) the
  government with little more capacity to deal with this aid fragmentation.

      Box 3.1: DEFINING THE TWO STREAMS OF TA IN LIBERIA BASED ON THE WATER POINT MAPPING
      RESULTS
      During the humanitarian support phase after the 2003 peace agreement, non-state actors mobilized a nationwide
      response and increased the number of improved public water points built per year from around 100 in 2003 to
      a peak of 1,435 in 2007 (World Bank, 2011a).
      The government was still transitional and had little involvement in either directing or implementing service delivery—
      97 percent of water points had been built by non-state actors. There was little attention to building service delivery
      models that would endure. As a result, up to a quarter of water points failed within the first year with barely half
      still fully functional after five years. In urban areas, where at least half of Liberia’s population is concentrated, 80
      percent of households’ access depended on the rapid response handpump driven model of service delivery.
      What could be done to build government capacity to lead a sector dialogue and improve the sustainability or
      rural services? Why was it that a rural solution had become the dominant form of supply in urban Liberia? With
      Monrovia being a hot-spot for cholera, what was the quality of water supplied? These questions led to the two
      separate streams of follow-on TA illustrated below.

     Work-stream 2: Utility reform
     Urban water quality surveys: The water point mapping
     exercise revealed that a large number of public wells
     (1,400) with handpumps were being installed in Liberia’s
     capital Monrovia. A water quality survey of 200 randomly
     selected water points showed high levels (>80 percent) of
     microbiological contamination. This provided empirical
     evidence that handpump solutions were failing in urban
     areas and that there was a need to work with the utility to
     displace wells with piped water supplies. In Port Harcourt,
     Nigeria, a similar survey, carried out in the wet and dry
     seasons, revealed that 99 percent of households were using
     nonutility water sources as their main source of water—a
     strategic problem for the reform of the utility.

     Assessments of recovering utility billing and accounting
     systems: Five assessments of utility accounting and billing
     system functionality were carried out for REGIDESO
     (DRC), Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC),
     Port Harcourt Water Corporation (PHWC, Nigeria),
     Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC, Sierra Leone),
     and HWA (Somaliland). These are all utilities that have
     suffered significant setbacks either due to violent conflict
     or prolonged poor governance. The WSP assessments
     examined the functionality and underlying data of these
     billing systems; identified useful coping strategies and
     innovations; and made recommendations for upgrading
     systems. In four of the cases the utilities self-funded the
     WSP recommendations or worked with development
     partners to secure implementation funding.

     Customer enumeration surveys: In Liberia (Monrovia                             A Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist, WSP-Zimbabwe,

         BOX 4.1: SOMALI REGIONAL STATES: WILLING TO CHARGE AND PARTIALLY ABLE TO DELIVER WATER
         SERVICES
         In Somalia the collapse of the central state in the 1990s led to the emergence of regional states, especially
         in the north. With the destruction of water systems during the war and the collapse of centralized subsidies
         to urban and rural water supply, solving the water supply crisis became a key issue for politicians of regional
         states.4 In Somaliland and Puntland the limited aid available was used to restore basic system functionality.
         With a very limited tax base there was no option for regional states to subsidize the recurrent costs of utilities.
         Cost recovery for operation and maintenance was viewed by politicians as a prerequisite to keep utilities going,
         and client power as a means of keeping the provider in check.
         Different solutions have emerged as a way to delegate this authority to local utilities. In Puntland the municipalities
         of Garowe and Bosaaso have contracted water services to the private sector. In Somaliland there has been
         a mixed approach with service delivery variously under municipal management (the main model both pre-
         and postindependence), public private partnership (PPP) and corporatization. In Borama, the municipality
         transferred responsibility for service delivery to a private operator, the Awdal Utility Company (SHABA), in
         October 2003 through a 10-year PPP lease agreement. Household connections have since risen from 130 in
         2002 to 5,435 by the end of 2009 with a billing efficiency of close to 100 percent (Print, 2010). In Hargeisa,
         where aerial strikes bombed the city and its water transmission lines in the early ’90s, basic system functionality
         for 180,000 people was restored with subsequent donor support. Since then the city has grown to around 1
         million people. Supported only by tariff—US$1.2 a cubic meter in 2016 reflecting the high operational costs of
         pumping water from a well field over 20 km north of the city—the corporatized utility has managed to grow and
         sustain a basic level of service to around half a million people through 25,000 household connections and 402
         water kiosks with a billing efficiency of close to 100 percent.5
         The high cost of alternative water supplies in the northern Somali semi-arid environment—up to US$7 per
         m3 from water trucking in the driest times of year—has certainly been a factor contributing to the urgency
         with which politicians have sought to enable network solutions. Even with relatively high tariffs these deliver
         economies of scale, and so value, for citizens which reflect well on the nascent state authorities by making
         these cities and towns more livable.

        BOX 4.2: SOUTH SUDAN URBAN WATER SUPPLY: WHY DID THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT NOT LEAD TO

        South Sudan has fluctuated between a state at risk and one that is weak but willing since the 2005 signing of
        the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that paved the way for establishment of the independent Republic
        of South Sudan in 2011. This fluctuation in the state’s incentive to invest in and otherwise develop urban
        water supply was a result of the availability of oil revenues to subsidize urban water supply, the inexperience
        of the nascent government in undertaking reform, and the overall security challenges which often disrupted
        government revenue flows and the interest and will of government and development partners alike.
        The post-CPA period offered an opportunity for improved services in Southern Sudan as oil revenues flowed
        into the autonomous region and there was a desire to secure the peace and to buy political advantage in the
        lead up to the referendum for independence. Lack of institutional strength and low human capacity, in particular,
        resulted in the water sector being unable to absorb the wave of donor funding that sought to address the
        overwhelming humanitarian needs following the signing of the CPA. Early donor funds focused on emergency
        water supply, on a protracted basis (Huston, 2014).
        Following the referendum for independence, the urban water sector remained institutionally weak and
        continued to struggle with the ‘capacity conundrum’. Uncertain oil revenues and resulting inconsistent
        subsidizes for urban water services made public water supply at best unreliable, but more often nonexistent
        for urban residents. During this period private sector water providers mushroomed to meet demand in urban
        areas with water bottlers, jerry can vendors and water truck haulers serving customers with both treated and
        untreated water supply, often at very high prices. The expensive, informal, and unregulated private water
        supply was a daily reminder for most urban residents that the new government was unable to provide the
        most basic water services.
        A political crisis at the highest level of the government broke out into open violence in December 2013, pushing
        the country back into conflict. During this period of political crisis and continued low oil revenues, the government
        seemed more focused on improving water services and increasing cost recovery in order to keep limited
        services operational, to maintain some sense of legitimacy, and to avoid systemic collapse of public water
        services. The government was keen to work with donor agencies as international support for the government
        diminished with the expansion of tribal violence. The public water supply continues to serve approximately 10
        percent of urban residents and is a regular reminder of governance and service failures.

     Before reflecting on the progress made by countries, it is                     The measure of cumulative transition progress across
     useful to note that the differential progress across each of                   IOs shows the relatively greater progress made in three
     the six TA IOs reflects the hierarchy of outcomes illustrated                  countries (Liberia, Somalia, and Zimbabwe), moderate
     in Figure 5.1. Sector monitoring, improving cost recovery                      progress made in two (the DRC and Sierra Leone) and
     in utilities, and investment planning (IOs 2, 3, and 4)                        limited or no progress made in the other countries.
     were precursors to reestablishing country leadership in
     sector coordination and policy development (IO 1). In                          To explain the reasons for this differential progress, the
     turn, it was this sector leadership that underpinned the                       way that three process aspects of the TA interacted with

realization, over the TA period, that building government                      compact, compared with Sierra Leone where the WSP
capacity for sector oversight had to be matched with                           did not have a continuous in-country presence.

     must be to strengthen and not abandon these processes.

       BOX 5.3: THE JOINT SECTOR REVIEW PROCESS IN LIBERIA
       In 2014, the Government of Liberia (GoL) published the country’s first Sector Performance Report (SPR) on
       WASH. The SPR collated information from surveys, studies, and reports for stakeholders to use as an evidence
       base to debate and agree priorities for action.
       The report was written by a team of Liberian authors identified from the key WASH ministries and agencies.
       The support team helped find and repackage data from the Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services
       and supported a robust process of peer review, discussion, and refinement.Over 200 attendees spent the two
       days reviewing the SPR, listening to each other’s points of views, and deciding on the best way forward for the
       sector by prioritizing actions.
       The multistakeholder planning and review process has further strengthened sector coordination including
       greater circulation of information among actors and has created a focus for annual reporting on the activities
       in the Sector Strategic Plan. However, key institutional changes such as setting up the Water Supply and
       Sanitation Commission and a National Water Resources and Sanitation Board have been slow, undermining
       momentum on other equally important steps such as consolidating sector monitoring and attracting sector
       investment which were to be done by these institutions. Furthermore, more support will be required to help
       the government maximize the SPR and the joint sector reviews and to use them as a means to assess sector
       performance. Data on the relation between inputs and outputs in the sector is still far too fragmented to enable
       a quantitative analysis of sector performance.
       The principle of mutual accountability, in turn, is not well understood among actors—both by GoL’s water sector
       institutions and by development partners in the water sector. The persistence of highly contractual norms of
       humanitarian aid in Liberia instead of the more collaborative norms of development assistance in low-income
       politically stable countries is likely one of main reasons for this. There are also no internal or external oversight
       mechanisms to hold the GoL and partners in the sector accountable to specific commitments. The ministries of
       finance, planning or the President’s Office, for example, currently play very limited roles in the multistakeholder
       planning and review process. Similarly, there are no obvious external budget support or Peace and State-
       building Goal processes that could be used as accountability mechanisms.

5.3.1	 Cost recovery is best addressed at the point
       of restarting utility operations in the postcrisis
       period when government budgets are still
       constrained
Utility cost recovery of at least operation and maintenance
(O&M) varied greatly across countries, from the PHWC,
in Nigeria that was entirely subsidized from government
revenues, to the HWA, in Somaliland, that was a net
contributor to government revenues. Most municipal
water utilities and departments in Zimbabwe were net
contributors to the government revenues and, in the
DRC, the national utility REGIDESO recovered over 80
percent of its O&M costs.

Once tariff structures were set below a level sufficient to
cover O&M costs it was difficult to raise them to reflect
O&M even where alternative sources were more expensive.
In Freetown, Sierra Leone, for example, the average GVWC
tariff was US$0.17 per m3 while alternative sources were
up to US$6.00 per m3. In Brazzaville, ROC, the national
utility’s (SNDE: Societé Nationale de Distribution d’
Eau) average tariff was US$0.35 per m3 while alternative
                                                                               Collecting data in the field on Fiamah.

       BOX A1: WATER POINT MAPPING IN LIBERIA
       With developments in Information Communications Technology (ICT), a range of mapping methods have
       become available to plug difficult-to-fill data gaps. With basic training teams of enumerators (often young
       unemployed youth) equipped with smartphones and apps such as FLOW, Fulcrum, and DoForms can work
       their way across countries capturing hundreds of data points on services a day and covering whole countries
       in a matter of months.
       The survey covered 10,000 improved water points serving (or not) some 4 million people. The survey generated
       a comprehensive picture of the number, type (for example, protected springs, wells, standposts), the make of
       pumps (for instance, Afridev, India Mark, Kardia, Vergnet, and so on), which organization they were constructed
       by, the age of the installation, the functionality of water points (including reasons for nonfunctionality), adequacy
       of water (throughout the dry season), how they were managed by the community, and whether there were
       regular financial contributions for maintenance.
       Overlaying this data on water points with census data on population, by enumeration areas, relative service
       levels were calculated—in terms of water points per 1,000 people (Figure A1.a). Adding road infrastructure
       provides further insights into bias of past investment or opportunities to increase investment around emerging
       growth points (Figure A1.b). The costs of these surveys were in the order of US$20 to US$30 a water point.

        BOX A2: PROCURING BILLING SYSTEMS FOR UTILITIES IN FRAGILE STATES
        The WSP provided technical assistance to the GVWC for the diagnosis of its existing billing system and procurement
        of a replacement, with financial assistance from the DFID.
        Assisted by ASPA utilities, the WSP visited and studied a number of utilities in fragile states to take stock of the
        sorts of billing systems they had in place, their particular constraints, and gain insight into how (and if) the numerous
        challenges of a weak governance environment were overcome. The WSP also visited a number of small utilities in
        Kenya and Uganda, where various small-scale computerized billing systems had been successfully implemented.
        The first striking finding was that the utilities strongly preferred paying for locally-supported and adapted software
        rather than having donors provide generic applications. The ability to tailor and support the software locally was highly
        valued but this often came at a relatively high cost, was single-sourced, and depended on a single developer.
        The second key finding was that identifying providers of utility billing software is not simple. A search leads one to a
        plethora of small providers who appear to be offering variations on bespoke applications developed for municipalities.
        Drawing on the World Bank and ASPA’s experience with major utilities in both developing and industrialized countries,
        a list of known software brands used by large urban utilities was prepared. Finding the actual providers of the software
        was complicated by the fact that software brands frequently change name, are upgraded, phased out, bought and
        sold between different IT service providers, and are merged into other systems. Also, many utilities either used “in
        house” software (Veolia, Suez), or regional providers (the case of the United Kingdom and Australia), used bespoke
        systems, or used billing modules of highly sophisticated Enterprise Management Systems (EMS) such as SAP. There
        appeared to be few truly international utility billing software providers.
        The lessons from the visits, as well as the diagnosis of the GVWC’s current billing system, were used to develop
        a strategy for procuring the new billing system for the utility. To ensure maximum participation in the procurement
        process, as well as advertising the contract on dgmarket.com, identified potential providers were directly contacted.
        Ten companies expressed interest in the project, of which five were shortlisted.
        A challenge was the scope of the billing system. These can vary enormously between providers, some of whom
        propose simple MS Access-based systems of the sort the GVWC already had in place, or C++ standalone, single
        PC type systems, through to very sophisticated web-enabled EMS. From site visits, it was known that utility billing
        systems often claim to perform a large number of functions, making assessment of quality difficult in a tender
        evaluation where there is a very wide range of prices (from $2,000 to $50 million).
        The GVWC had a specific budget constraint, and it was felt that unless bidders had some idea of the budget,
        such a wide range of prices (and scope) risked that the “quality” weighting of the procurement would be entirely
        outweighed by the price weighting, leading to the cheapest product being selected even if there were misgivings
        about the quality. It was therefore decided to announce the budget, and to some extent remove price competition.
        The terms of reference noted that the budget was a “maximum”, which allowed competitive pricing, and also
        included minimum software, hardware, support, and service requirements, as well as optional items to be priced
        separately. Ongoing costs had to be made explicit, so that some consideration could be given to the effect on the
        GVWC’soperating budget. Services included a training component and three years of support from a local partner
        as well as two visits per year from the international partner, if requested by the GVWC.
        The three tenders submitted were of good quality, although the bidders proposed different hardware scope,
        which necessitated some adjustment to allow a like-for-like price comparison. Bidders also included different tax
        assumptions which needed to be equalized to allow a fair comparison. The company that won the tender worked
        closely with the GVWC and persevered during the very difficult circumstances of the Ebola outbreak. The billing
        system finally went live in March 2015.

keeping or peace-building mission during the past three years. This list includes only IDA eligible countries and nonmember or inactive territories/
countries without CPIA data. IBRD countries with CPIA ratings below 3.2 do not qualify on this list due to nondisclosure of CPIA ratings; IBRD countries
that are included here qualify only by the presence of a peace-keeping, political or peace-building mission—and their CPIA ratings are thus not
disclosed.
