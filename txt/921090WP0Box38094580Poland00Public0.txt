THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Obtain current geodesic map

        Obtaining a current geodesic map is necessary for preparing a building
        project. According to the Building Code, a building project should
        consist of an architectural project; a major planning scheme of the plot;
        declarations of energy, water and sewage, and other suppliers, if
        applicable; a declaration by the administrator of the public road about
        the possibility of connecting the plot to the public road; the results, if
        applicable, of the geological examinations; and a specification of the
        geotechnical conditions of the property.

        One of these documents, the major planning scheme of the plot,
        should be prepared by an expert on a copy of the most recent geodetic
        map. Such a map is collected by the division of the County Office
        (Starostwo) or, as in Warsaw and some other cities, by the relevant
        division of the city administration. This map is valid for only about 6
   1    months, which explains the need for it to be constantly updated. Once        30 days           PLN 60
        obtained, the map need to be updated by a private surveyor or by the
        Geodesic Department of Wasrsaw. The Geodesic Department will take
        at minimum 30 days to issue an updated map. The maps in the archive
        are not up to date. Even if they are, BuildCo still needs a private
        surveyor or someone from the Geodesic Dept. of Warsaw to go on the
        plot of land and confirm that the map is up to date. Even if there is one
        single new tree, the surveyor (or the Geodesic Dept.) needs to update
        the map.

        Obtaining an updated map from the County Office (or the City Office as
        in the case of Warsaw) is subject to an official fee that varies from PLN
        7.00 up to PLN 30.00 per page (depending on the map scale).

      * Receive an approval from the Project Documentation
      Coordination Unit (ZUDP) about the lack of conflicts among utility
      connections

      The Project Documentation Coordination Unit (Zespół Uzgodnień
      Dokumentacji Projektowej, ZUDP) consists of city officials,
      representatives of utility companies, representatives of the army, and
      representatives of any agency that might manage cables, pipes or other
      underground material. ZUDP meets once every 3 weeks to analyze the
      proposed project of connecting to the utilities and check if there is any   30 days       no charge

      conflict among the different networks. The obtaining of this approval
      can be done simultaneously with obtaining other pre-approvals before
      obtaining the building permit. The building permit cannot be issued
      without the positive opinion of ZUDP. The investor- or its
      representatives – are invited to participate when ZUDP meets, but they
      are not required to be there.

      * Request and obtain project approval from administrator of public
      roads

      The building project must be approved with the administrator of the
      public road near which the building is to be constructed, and to which
      the construction site is to be joined. Only the building project must be
      attached to the application for such an adjustment. The approval is
      issued in the form of a written confirmation. Building or rebuilding an
      entrance to the plot requires a permit to locate the driveway. The
8     entrance project should be approved by the administrator of the public      14 days       no charge
      road.

      The ground used for building the entrance is either determined by the
      administrator of the public road or the result of an agreement, such as
      a lease agreement.

      Request and obtain building permit

      Construction work cannot begin before BuildCo has obtained the
      building permit. To acquire the building permit, the investor must send
      the official application form to the appropriate office of architectural
      and building administration at the Municipality.

      The following documents should be attached to the application:
9     • Four copies of the building project, with all opinions, adjustments,      65 days       PLN 588
      permits, and other documents required by the particular legal acts
      • The investor's formal written statement concerning the right to
      dispose of the real estate on which the building is to be built
      • The decision regarding the conditions of building in the area, as
      stated within the framework of a binding special layout plan, if such a
      decision (which is not obligatory) was issued before applying for the
      building permit

                                                                                    Time to

                                                                                   complete
      The opinions, adjustments, and permits mentioned above should be
      acquired by BuildCo or its attorney. In practice, they are obtained by
      the architect who prepares the project.

      The building project should be accompanied by a document certifying
      that the project designer is registered as a building expert. The decision
      on the conditions of building in a certain area is obligatory when the
      area is not covered by a binding special layout plan.

      In 2006, the official fees changed slightly due to the adoption of the
      new Law on Official Payment. As of 2007, these fees amount to PLN
      539.00 for issuance of a building permit (PLN 1.00 per sq. m., but no
      more than PLN 539.00) and PLN 47.00 for approval of the building
      project. PLN 2.50 is added for the cost of wire transfer. Thus, the total
      cost is about PLN 588.50. In case the application is to be signed and
      filed by an authorized representative, an authorization should also be
      attached.

      The legally allowed time for making an administrative decision granting
      a building permit is 30 days (Administrative Code, General
      Administrative Regulations, Art. 35.3), but Article 35 Section 6 of the
      construction law provides 65 days for resolving difficult cases. Even so,
      the administration frequently reviews a case for a few months as it can
      sometimes requests many new documents and an explanation from the
      applicant and can suspend proceeding with the application until these
      documents and explanations are submitted.

      Formally, the time to validate the administrative decision is 14 days
      from the date it was delivered to the parties. In practice, the investor
      should expect that other parties, such as neighbors and ecological
      organizations, will appeal against this decision. Appeal cases may take a
      few years.

      Therefore, making an administrative decision can take from 60 days
      (legally) to 365 days (in practice), while validation takes from 14 days
      (legally, and with no trouble arising) to 4 years (in case of appeals).

      Since February 1, 2013, 100% of the applications are tracked
      electronically by the Office of Architecture and Building Administration
      (the system started operations on January 1, 2013). The system is
      based on officials entering data into the new system based on hard
      copies submitted by investors. With the new system, it is possible to
      track any application. The system has a disciplinary effect because it is
      possible to enforce the penalty of 165 PLN per day after the 65-day
      limit to grant a permit.

      * Conclude agreement with utility provider: water and sewage

      BuildCo incurs the cost of building a connection to a water and sewage
      networks. This cost depends on the technical conditions and may
      amount to approximately PLN 200.00 to PLN 300.00. Initiating the flow

      When the building works are over, BuildCo must inform the authority
      that issued the building permit in writing of its intention to start using
      the building.

      The special exploitation, or occupancy, permit must be obtained before
      beginning exploitation, or occupancy. If such a requirement is
      mentioned in the building permit text, BuildCo must submit an                75 days       PLN 135
18
      application for an occupancy permit. In many cases, this permit must be
      preceded by the obligatory post-executive control inspection carried
      out by the authority that issued the building permit. The application
      should be filed with the County Building Supervision Inspectorate. The
      maximum payment for an occupancy permit amounts to PLN 135.00.

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Poland (table 10.1)?
