This is the first of four snapshot reports presenting preliminary findings from the Early Childhood Education
Study. The ECE Study was initiated to evaluate the Early Childhood Education Project in Lao People's
Democratic Republic (PDR). This snapshot describes demographic information of the 7,520 children in the
baseline sample, including where and how they live.

THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
PROJECT
Lao PDR has sustained robust economic growth and
significant poverty reduction over the past decade.
Despite these achievements, economic disparities
persist across the country’s diverse ethnic groups and
geographical areas. Education, including early childhood
education (ECE), is a priority for the Government of Lao
PDR, however, coverage of ECE remains insufficient,
with services and resources varying considerably across
geographic, socio-economic and ethnic dimensions. This
translates into disparities in child development outcomes
and long-term implications for the human development
of the country. ECE is one of the most cost-effective and
equitable interventions, and is demonstrated to improve
school readiness which in turn leads to decreased dropout
and repetition rates, increase educational attainment and
improve learning outcomes. In the long term this leads
to improved skills, increased labor force productivity
and higher incomes. Based on such evidence, the World
Bank Group has provided funding of USD 28 million
through an International Development Association (IDA)
Grant (USD 14 million) and IDA credit (USD 14 million)          The project has three key components: 1) increase
to the Government of Lao PDR for the Early Childhood            the coverage of ECE through provision of grants and
Education Project. The ECE Project seeks to support the         training for the construction of up to 250 pre-primary
expansion of quality ECE services, with the objective of        classrooms, as well as the establishment of community
improving the overall development and school readiness          child development groups (CCDG) across 71 locations;
of children aged 3-5 years in disadvantaged villages            2) improve the quality of ECE services through training
across the country.

evaluation of the ECE Project. In 2018, the evaluation           2	Multi Age Teaching (MAT), which includes training

the project to improve early childhood developmental               community awareness training with parents in their
outcomes will be evaluated by comparing key outcomes               village

As explained earlier, there are three different components       about the project’s effectiveness (what works and what
