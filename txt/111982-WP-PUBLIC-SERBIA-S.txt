Context: The integration of the Serbian transport network into the core regional transport network is recognized as a key policy
objective for the economic and social development of the country. The Serbian section of Corridor X, with its 792 kilometers of
roads and 760 kilometers of railway lines, forms a part of the South East Europe Transport Observatory (SEETO) regional
“Comprehensive Network” and is also a part of two important Pan-European transport infrastructure networks. One is connecting
Budapest with the Bulgarian capital of Sofia and the other links Greece to the south.

The Government views the development of Corridor X as the country’s key transport priority that will help facilitate sustainable
economic development and ensure that the country capitalizes on its geographical position. The Bank was requested to assist the
Government with the preparation of the entire program for the two southern sections of Corridor X. The Government also
requested that the Bank contribute financing in parallel to the other international financial institutions (IFIs) and the Hellenic Plan
for the Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans (HiPERB*). During project preparation, the Bank led a review of the technical
and economic viability, a review of the preparation of the Resettlement Policy Framework, the Corridor-level environmental impact
assessments, and a review of the proposed engineering design.

The Project Development Objectives are to increase transport efficiency and improve traffic safety on the three project sections
of Corridor X, between Niš and Dimitrovgrad, and between Grabovnica and Donji Neradovac, respectively, and to improve road
management and road safety in Serbia.

The project objectives will be achieved by financing (i) the construction of two sections of the motorway on E-75, totaling 38
kilometers between Grabovnica and Grdelica and between Caričina Dolina and Donji Neradovac; (ii) the construction of 8.67
kilometers of the motorway on an E-80 section of the corridor between Dimitrovgrad and the border with Bulgaria (Dimitrovgrad
Bypass); (iii) technical assistance in the area of road safety; and (iv) implementation assistance and institutional support.
Results achieved to date:
 For the construction of two motorway sections between Grabovnica and Grdelica (5.6 kilometers) and between Caričina
    Dolina and Donji Neradovac (32 kilometers) on the E-75 road to FYR Macedonia: four lots on the E-75 were awarded in
    March 2012, with work commencing in May 2012. Completion is expected by November 2015. The project was recently
    restructured to use savings available under Components 1 and 2 to provide for the construction of a 5.8 kilometer extension
    of the E-75 motorway between Caričina Dolina and Vladičin Han, known as Lot 6. A contract for construction of Lot 6 has
    been awarded, with estimated completion by March 2017.
 For the construction of 8.67 kilometers of the Dimitrovgrad Bypass, a motorway between Niš and the border with Bulgaria,
    close to Dimitrovgrad (E-80): the contractor for Lots 1 and 2 declared bankruptcy in July 2013 and left the site. At the time
    of the bankruptcy, road construction on Lot 1 was at 56 percent completion, on Lot 2, the bridge, at 88 percent. A new
    contract for the remaining works was formed in July 2014, with a 15-month construction period. Construction of the tunnels
    under Lot 3 achieved substantial completion in October 2014.
 A Road Safety Agency has been established under the new Road Safety Law, and a road safety strategy has been prepared and
    is expected to be adopted in 2015. Procurement of the comprehensive road crash database has been initiated.
 The Action Plan for the Reform of the Roads of Serbia (PEPS) has been prepared.

Context: Initially, the project had a broader focus and was aimed at the mitigation of poorly managed legacy sites from mining
operations in Serbia’s Bor region and social impacts of the restructuring of the local RTB Bor mining and metallurgical company.
With partial results from the job creation component and uncertainty about whether some of the project sites earmarked for
environmental remediation could be redeveloped under concessions to private investors, it was decided to comprehensively
restructure the project in early 2013 and (i) refocus the project on the replacement of a collector under one of the mine tailing
disposal facilities, and (ii) discontinue or cancel all other activities.
The Project Development Objective is to support the Government in addressing the structural hazard of the river water
collector under the Veliki Krivelj tailings disposal facility, which is one of the most urgent environmental legacy issues of the
mining sector in the Bor region.
The Project focuses on: The replacement of the Veliki Krivelj collector (a 2.5 kilometer concrete main pipe with a diameter
of 3 meters), which rests at the bottom of the mine tailings facility that has been constructed on top of it, is considered the most
pressing environmental concern of the original project intervention. The collector, carrying much more weight from the material
above than what it was designed for, is in very poor condition, though regular repair works have managed so far to maintain its
integrity. Collapse of the collector would block the river discharge and immediately jeopardize the stability of the massive mine
tailings disposal facilities that have been constructed in the Kriveljska River valley. The full replacement of the collector with a
bypass tunnel in hard-rock around the tailings disposal facility is considered the only viable solution to eliminate this high risk.
Results achieved to date:
Environmental liabilities of the mining sector in the Bor region:
 In February 2015, the Borrower requested cancellation of the project due to a lack of time to complete the works by the
   project closing date.
Fostering new sources of economic growth and job creation in the Bor region (component discontinued):
 Nearly 850 unemployed people benefited from the temporary employment programs (i.e., public works); as of June 2012,
   nine training programs for over 600 unemployed persons were completed.
 The reconstruction works on the future location of the Business Incubator in Majdanpek have been completed. However,
   the registration of the incubator, the selection of tenants, and the procurement of the necessary equipment were not
   finalized.
 Under the microfinance program, the Opportunity Bank of Serbia disbursed 53 loans. Due to the slow disbursements
   resulting from low demand, the credit line has been cancelled.
Key Partners: The Bank team works with (i) the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which is responsible for implementation of the
environmental management and remediation component; (ii) the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development, which
focused on socioeconomic regeneration activities; and (iii) the Project Management Unit housed within the Ministry of Energy
and Mining.
Key Development Partners: Project preparation activities were funded by a Japanese PHRD (Policy and Human Resources
Development) grant, while an EU-EAR grant financed technical assistance for the restructuring and privatization of RTB Bor.

Context: While Serbia has an extensive framework for dealing with problematic banks, the failure of several small banks in 2012 and
2013 led the Government to begin working on a reform program to improve this framework As part of a broader set of reforms, the
Government has requested a World Bank loan to strengthen the financial and institutional capacity of the Deposit Insurance Agency
(DIA). In addition, the resolution of these banks (which was successful, as the stability of the overall system was preserved) has
depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which creates risks to the Serbian financial system. These risks stem from the possibility
of not having adequate resources to cover insured depositors at a time of bank failure. Bank failures, even of a small size bank, have
the potential to shake confidence in the entire banking system, if depositors sense that their deposits are not secure. To strengthen the
DIA, the project has two main goals: (i) financing the DIF with sufficient resources (from external creditors, government budget,
bank premiums, recoveries, and investments) to allow the DIA to meet its deposit insurance and bank resolution obligations and serve
as a core part of the financial sector safety net, and (ii) ensuring that the DIA has the institutional capacity to manage the financial
resources it has available.

The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and institutional capacity of the DIA, so as to enable it to meet
its deposit insurance and bank resolution obligations and serve as a core part of the financial sector safety net.

Project Design: Considering the importance not only of financing the DIF but also strengthening the DIA, the majority of the project
consists of a results-based component that finances the DIF based on the achievement of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs).
This is complemented by a technical assistance component that provides assistance to achieve the DLIs and strengthens the
institutional capacity of the DIA. Thus the project has two Components that aim to accomplish the Project Development Objective:
1) a results-based component of €144.23 million that strengthens the financial capacity of the DIA based on satisfactorily achieving
DLIs that improve its ability to meet its deposit insurance and bank resolution obligations; and 2) a technical assistance component
of €0.71 million that aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the DIA to meet its deposit insurance and bank resolution
obligations and achieve the DLIs.

For component 1, World Bank financing will be disbursed based on evidence of the achievement of six DLIs: DLI 1 – Premiums:
Increase premiums charged to banks to increase the flow of funds to the DIF; DLI 2 – Backup Funding: Ensure that the Government
puts in place a stand-by facility that the DIF can access; DLI 3 – Governance: Improve the independence of the governance bodies
of the DIA; DLI 4 – Information sharing between financial safety net providers: Ensure that the DIA has the appropriate information
to fulfill its mandate; DLI 5 – Recoveries: Improve the performance of the DIA’s mandate to recover assets from bankrupt and
liquidated banks; DLI 6 – Early detection and timely intervention: Improve the information base on state-owned banks to ensure early
detection and timely intervention.
Results achieved to date:
 Project implementation began in December 2014.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank of Serbia, and the Deposit Insurance
Agency, which is responsible for overall project implementation. Key Development Partners include the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), and the European Commission (EC).

*Equivalent to US$ 100 million. ** As of March 2015.
Context: The road network, estimated to have an asset value of US$13 billion, extends 40,800 kilometers, including about
9,500 kilometers of national roads. Despite being a major asset for Serbia, the quality of the road infrastructure appears to
have declined in the past few years. The poor quality of roads manifests itself in high vehicle operating costs and inadequate
road safety and reduces Serbia’s overall trade competitiveness. The Ministry of Construction, Transport, and Infrastructure
(MCTI) has initiated a National Road Network Rehabilitation Program (NRNRP) to improve the quality and safety of priority
national roads, thus improving the connectivity of the entire road network. With the support of the EU, MCTI has developed
a Transport Strategy and a Master Plan that envisage a €4.6–€5.0 billion investment in maintenance and rehabilitation between
2009 and 2027. About 5,000 kilometers of national roads (slightly over 50 percent of the national road network) have been
identified as high priority, and financial support from several international financial institutions (IFIs) is being sought to
implement the rehabilitation works. In the first phase, about 1,125 kilometers will be rehabilitated, incorporating safety
considerations into the design.

Serbian authorities are improving road safety, but the social cost of traffic accidents remains high. The level of injuries and
fatalities caused by traffic accidents is a growing social and economic cost for the country. Between 2001 and 2010, there were
about 9,000 fatalities and 190,000 injuries resulting from road traffic crashes in Serbia. While there is no official estimate of
the socioeconomic costs of road accidents in Serbia, some estimates suggest a cost as high as 2.0 percent of GDP. During the
past few years, the Government of Serbia has been earnest in road safety institutional and policy reforms. The Road Safety
Law (RSL), adopted on May 29, 2009, represents the first major update in legislation since the 1980s and addresses many
aspects of the EU Transport acquis communautaire and the recommendations given in the Road Safety Capacity Review funded
by the World bank Global Road Safety Facility. In 2009, the Republic of Serbia passed legislation mandating the incorporation
of an independent safety audit by an accredited road safety auditor in road design.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the condition and safety of the national road network for road users by
supporting the Republic of Serbia in the implementation of the first phase of its National Road Network Rehabilitation
Program (NRNRP).

The objectives will be assessed based on: (i) improvements in road conditions measured by a reduction in the International
Roughness Index (IRI) for the roads covered in the first phase of NRNRP from 5.42 to 2.5; and (ii) improvements in road
safety measured by a 10 percent reduction in fatal road traffic accidents on the roads covered in the first phase of NRNRP.
The project objectives will be achieved by financing (i) road rehabilitation and safety investments (€264 million) and (ii)
institutional strengthening (€3.10 million).
Results achieved to date:
 Six contracts for emergency works, triggered after severe floods in May 2014, have been awarded and signed. The works
     are expected to start in April 2015, as soon as weather conditions improve and contractors mobilize.
 The selection of the supervision consultant for emergency works is in its final stage, and the tender for technical

Context at Project Design: Total health spending in Serbia accounts for about 10.4 percent of GDP, or twice as
much per capita as in comparable countries, yet health outcomes in Serbia are similar to those countries. It is critical
that Serbia increase the productivity of its health spending, particularly given the fiscal constraints, the increasing
demand for health care from an aging population, and the disease burden leaning toward noncommunicable
diseases (heart disease, stroke, and cancer, in particular). To address these issues, the Second Serbia Health Project
will support reforms toward productivity-based health care financing, the efficient purchasing of pharmaceuticals
and medical products, and the continuous improvement of the efficiency and quality of health care.

The Project Development Objective is to contribute to improving the efficiency and quality of the public health
system of the Republic of Serbia through the strengthening of: (i) health financing, purchasing, and maintenance
systems; and (ii) the quality improvement systems and management of selected priority noncommunicable diseases.

The range of sector issues addressed by the project include: (1) strengthening primary health financing and
supporting hospital financing reforms; (2) establishing efficient centralized procurement in health while
strengthening health technology assessment capacity and the maintenance of medical equipment; (3) improving
cancer management and strengthening the quality of health care; and (4) supporting project implementation.
Results achieved to date:
 The project is not yet effective. However, the centralized (pooled) procurement of pharmaceuticals has
    already proved to improve the efficiency of the Serbian health care system. Centralized procurement was
    piloted during the preparation of the project for one-third of the drugs used in the public health care system
    and resulted in reducing the cost by €25 million for 2014. Lower-income groups will in particular benefit
    from an increased efficiency as they are directed toward the public health care system. Cost savings will
    contribute to ensuring that public funds deliver a maximum level of service for everyone.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with (i) the Ministry of Health, Health Insurance Fund, Institute for
Public Health, and Agency for Accreditation, as beneficiary agencies; and (ii) the Public Procurement Office,
Committee for the Protection of Bidder’s Rights, Committee for Protection of Competition, and the Agency for
the Fight Against Corruption, as the key national partners in reform toward the centralized procurement of
pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
Key Development Partners include the European Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Context: Unprecedented rainfall in May 2014 caused massive floods, resulting in the declaration of a national state of
emergency in Serbia. The heavy rainfall led to a rapid and substantial increase in water levels in eight of the main rivers in
western, southwestern, central, and eastern Serbia. Flash floods destroyed houses, bridges, and sections of roads, while rising
water levels resulted in flooding in both urban and rural areas. The disaster resulted in 51 deaths, with approximately 32,000
people evacuated from their homes and around 110,000 households cut off from an electricity supply. Overall, the floods
affected some 1.6 million people in Serbia, or about one-fifth of the total population living in 49 municipalities.

The recent natural disaster has exacerbated significant fiscal challenges that the country faces. The Government of Serbia
conducted a Recovery Needs Assessment (RNA) that revealed that the total value of the disaster’s impact is roughly €1.7
billion, or over 4 percent of GDP.

The Project Development Objective is to: (i) help restore power system capability to reliably meet domestic demand; (ii)
protect the livelihoods of farmers in flood-affected areas; (iii) protect people and assets from floods; and (iv) improve Serbia’s
capacity to respond effectively to disasters.

The Floods Emergency Recovery Project focuses on the priority sectors identified in the RNA and addresses immediate to
short-term needs arising from the crisis. The project will help close the financing gap and ensure the continued provision of
power services during the upcoming 2014/2015 winter and recover critical energy infrastructure. In the agriculture sector, the
project will forestall a likely decline in direct support to farmers in affected areas at a time when the fiscal accounts are under
severe stress. In addition, the project will also help improve resilience to disasters by financing investments in critical flood
prevention infrastructure.

Results achieved to date:
The project became effective on March 6, 2015. Under the overall coordination of the Office for Reconstruction and Flood
Relief, the project implementation is progressing well.

       Power import purchases helped avoid any power supply interruptions during the 2014/2015 winter season.
       Dewatering of the Tamnava mine field is progressing well and is expected to be finalized in the second quarter of
        2015.
       It is estimated that around 122,000 farmers living in the flood affected areas have received support under the Farm
        Incentives Program.

Context:
Despite significant achievements in the early years of the transition to a market economy (over 2,700 enterprises privatized), the
role of the state in the enterprise sector remains pervasive, with about 1,200 state-owned enterprises (SOEs), employing more
than 250,000 people. While this is a very heterogeneous group of enterprises, overall they perform poorly, have weak governance
mechanisms, and remain prone to political interference. Overall, public sector enterprises make significant net losses, which in
2013 amounted to about €1 billion, and require significant state support to remain afloat. Many of these enterprises receive
significant direct budget subsidies and soft loans, as well as indirect support in various forms, including unpaid taxes and
contributions, state guarantees for loans, and arrears to other state entities and public utilities. This has fiscal implications and
creates significant distortions and misallocations of production factors, deterring private sector investments.
The reform of SOEs is critical to the success of the Government’s economic program, contributing to medium-term fiscal
consolidation efforts as well as economic recovery through improved economic efficiency. The absence of SOE reform for the
past decade has allowed Serbia to fall behind its neighbors in the economic transition, preventing the country from realizing its
potential and contributing to stalled growth and job creation in recent years. This is the first in a series of two programmatic
DPLs designed to support Serbia’s structural reform program of the SOE sector.
The Project Development Objectives are to reduce state participation and the level of direct and indirect support to the real
sector; enhance SOE performance, governance, and accountability; and mitigate the short-term social and labor impacts of the
SOE restructuring and disposition plans. These objectives will be achieved through supporting reforms carried out by the
Government of Serbia, revolving around three policy areas: (i) accelerating the restructuring and divestiture program of the
Privatization Agency portfolio and selected SOEs operating in the commercial sector; (ii) strengthening the governance,
regulatory, and institutional framework and monitoring and transparency arrangements for SOEs; and (iii) mitigating the social
and labor market impact of the SOE reform program.
Expected Results:
 Reduction of direct and indirect support to companies in the Privatization Agency portfolio:

Context:
Despite persistent problems in the broader economy, Serbia’s real estate sector has seen considerable improvement over the
past decade. Ten years ago, the cost and time required to register property rights were excessive, only 20 percent of the country
was covered in “land books” (legal registers maintained by municipal courts), and there was a mismatch between these books
and the records of the Republic Geodetic Authority (RGA). With the help of an earlier Bank-financed project, the time
required to register transactions has been reduced, cadastral offices have been renovated, important geodetic infrastructures
have been built, and customer satisfaction has improved.
Although these improvements are significant, Serbia’s real property registration services remain below European standards.
The Real Estate Cadastre is not interoperable with other key government registries, and online services are limited. Over 30
percent of RGA’s analog cadastral maps have yet to be digitized. The data held by RGA on land, ownership, buildings, etc.
are vital information for most government services and need to be made complete and more easily available. Investments in
geodetic infrastructure are needed and RGA services need to be made more readily accessible to individuals, including
members of vulnerable groups. Property valuation and taxation is another area where Serbia has made limited progress, as it
lacks the complete and accurate data necessary to establish the tax base. RGA still needs to record all buildings in the cadastre
to ensure that all properties are included in the property tax and that the legalization of buildings that are currently built
informally can proceed smoothly.
The Project Development Objective is to improve the efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and reliability of the Republic
of Serbia’s real property management systems.

This project supports the Serbian Government’s economic reform agenda in several important ways: a) property valuation
and taxation activities will enable fiscal consolidation and reduce the fiscal deficit; b) e-governance for enabling access to real
estate information will improve the business climate, attract investors, and reduce transaction cost and time; c) the
development of real estate markets will boost small and medium-sized enterprises that use real estate as collateral; and d) the
development of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) will advance European integration.
Results:
 The project is not yet effective.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure; the Ministry of
Finance; and the Republic Geodetic Authority.

Context: Since its political transformation in 2000, Serbia has accelerated its justice sector reforms, recognizing their importance for EU
accession. The reform efforts were focused on strengthening governance, improving the business climate, combating corruption, and
improving state accountability and effectiveness. However, the overall reform impact so far has been less than anticipated; public trust and
confidence in the judiciary remain low, institutional capacity constraints affect reform coordination, and the implementation of fragmented
donor-financed projects and programs have overtaxed the already low capacity of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), whose overall ability to
coordinate, prioritize, sequence, resource, and implement a multiyear sectoral strategy remains weak.
The Project Development Objective is to facilitate the acceleration of Serbia’s EU integration pertaining to the justice sector by
providing an appropriate financing vehicle, the necessary tools, focused short-term analytical and policy advice, and capacity-building
technical assistance to Serbia’s MOJ and judiciary.
This “hybrid” trust fund consists of five components, where the second component is executed by the Client and other components are
executed by the Bank. Component 1 provides advisory services to strengthen justice sector reform in the areas of: (i) Institutional Capacity
Building of MOJ, the judiciary, and the Ministry of Finance (MoF); (ii) Resource Management and Aid Coordination; (iii) Legal and
Institutional Environment; (iv) Judicial Facilities and Infrastructure; and v) Outreach, Monitoring, and Evaluation. Component 2 provides
technical assistance in the same five areas, as well as in the area of access to justice. Components 3, 4, and 5 cover supervision,
administration, and program management of the trust fund.
Results Achieved:

Context: Building on the institutional capacity developed under the Serbia Innovation Project (SIP), the new Serbia Research,
Innovation and Technology Transfer Project (SRITTP) aims to design and pilot programs to facilitate the commercialization
of public sector research and development (R&D), support collaborative research between public sector R&D organizations
and private industry, and facilitate strategic planning to enhance Serbia’s competitive positioning in the European research
community.
In order to stimulate the transfer of public research, this project will support efforts to enhance the technology transfer
capacity and effectiveness of local institutions. Joint research-industry projects are crucial to improving the competitiveness
of Serbia’s enterprises, as well as to establishing the enhanced capacity of both RDIs and enterprises to participate in the EU’s
next framework program for innovation, Horizon 2020. Aimed at facilitating further strategic planning, the project will
support the design of the new Research and Innovation Strategy, which will focus on systematically improving research
excellence as well as the economic impact of R&D and innovation support programs.
The Project Development Objective is to facilitate the reorientation of the public research sector toward the needs of the
private sector. The project will support a framework for increasing the efficiency of future investments in research and
innovation in Serbia and will consist of the following parts: (1) Establishment of a technology transfer facility (recipient
executed); (2) Technical assistance for the design and implementation oversight of a collaborative R&D grant scheme by the
Innovation Fund (Bank executed); and (3) Technical assistance for the development of a Research and Innovation Strategy
and an R&D Infrastructure Roadmap and corresponding Action Plan(s) (Bank executed).
Expected Results:
 Establishment of a Technology Transfer Facility. In order to take advantage of the economies of scale, a centralized
  Technology Transfer Facility (TTF) will be established at the Innovation Fund (IF), which will provide support services
  to local Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) and R&D and innovation support organizations to enhance their capacity
  and effectiveness to consummate deals.
 Design and implementation of a collaborative R&D grant scheme by IF. Under SRITTP, a Collaborative R&D Grant
  Scheme is proposed to foster pre-competitive, industry-driven research. The objective of the Collaborative R&D Grant
  Scheme is to encourage stakeholders to increase collaborative activities, foster closer links between research and industry,
  and utilize existing infrastructure in public sector R&D institutions. The Collaborative R&D Grant Scheme will provide
  financial assistance (grants of up to €300,000) to third parties with the aim of bringing together ideas/projects with the
  best potential from the private and research sector to implement activities that will, on the one hand, explore the research
  and technological potential, and on the other, provide clear prospects for commercial use and exploration.
  Development of a Research and Innovation Strategy and an R&D Infrastructure Roadmap and corresponding Action
   Plan(s). The project will provide support to the MoESTD in the design of the new Research and Innovation Strategy 2016–
   2020.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with (i) the MoESTD, which is leading the science, technology, and innovation

Context at Project Design: The Government has been considering decentralizing service delivery and reforming the intergovernmental public
finance system, which are both critical to improving health, education, and welfare outcomes in Serbia. In these social sectors, decentralization
was seen as a key feature of the sector strategies adopted by the line ministries toward achieving the desired improvements.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase the capacity of institutional actors and beneficiaries in order to improve access to,
and the efficiency, equity, and quality of, the local delivery of health, education, and social protection services in a decentralizing environment.
Project restructuring took place in July 2012, when the project description and the results framework were refined.
The range of sector issues addressed by the project included: (1) transforming financing models through the development of a public
financing framework that increases efficiency while compensating for inequities across municipalities and promoting rationalization of the service
networks at the local level; (2) improving access and equity through the use of new approaches and models for delivering services to excluded
groups; (3) improving accountability and quality by supporting sector ministries, local authorities, and other local service providers to assume
their new roles and responsibilities, including regulation, oversight, quality assurance, management, planning, budgeting, and service delivery; and
(4) supporting project implementation.
Results Achieved to date:
Education
 Financing: National per student funding formula for pre-university education (primary and secondary schools) has been developed, and local
    formulas are being developed through the pilots. The first pilot took place in 16 (10 percent) of Serbia’s municipalities in the school year
    2011–12. Piloting continued in 2013 in order to make further progress on adjustments to the local formulas. By project closure, this activity
    had been partially completed.
 Access and equity: School and municipal grants were used in support of capacity building for the inclusive education of children with learning
    difficulties, disabilities, and/or socioeconomic disadvantages (including Roma), where schools and preschools benefit from teacher training
    (21,000 participants), small civil works, and the purchase of various teaching tools and equipment.
 Accountability and quality: Student learning outcomes were monitored through Serbia’s participation in the Program for International Student
    Assessment (PISA) 2009 and 2011, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011, and the Teaching and Learning
    International Survey (TALIS) 2013, as well as through the strengthening of the school external evaluation system.
Health
 Financing: With amended health legislation, current laws and bylaws allow the use of capitation- and output-based formulas; and a framework
    with methodology and criteria for the allocation of equalization funds has been developed (both PDOs met).
 Access and equity: Nearly 2,000 medical staff and associates have been trained to recognize the needs of vulnerable groups; 15 Roma health
    mediators were financed from the loan funds, resulting in 19,818 vaccinated children, over 2,500 registered with a primary health care (PHC)
    physician, 600 pregnant and new mothers receiving health checks, and more than 1,200 women able to choose a gynecologist. In 2012, the
    Government institutionalized Roma health mediators by funding their salaries from the Republic of Serbia national budget.
 Accountability and quality: 51 percent of PHC centers have completed the quality accreditation process; all of the targeted 50 PHC centers have
    adopted clinical pathways, and 86 percent of PHCs use the fully operational health management information system (HMIS) platform.
Social Protection
 Access and equity: Internal operating procedures of the Disability Fund of the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Policy (MoLESP)
    reformed to enable funding of the results-oriented projects; and innovative services have been developed, piloted, and scaled up across the
    country (sign language interpretation services for the deaf and escort services for the blind and people with impaired vision).
 Accountability and quality: The development of the management information system (MIS) in the MoLESP is completed. Funds for the MIS to
    finance infrastructure and communication costs have been secured by the MoLESP for 2014 to complete MIS implementation, which
    reflects MoLESP’s commitment to this important intervention.
Key Partners: The Bank team worked closely with (i) the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, as
beneficiary agencies; and (ii) the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities, as the key national partner in contact with local authorities.
Key Development Partners included the European Commission, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund

Victoria is a leading agro-industrial group in Serbia, with a primary focus on processing soybean and sunflower
oilseeds and grain trading. The Group employs over 1,800 people. IFC’s loan of €57 million (US$74.13 million
equivalent) will be used to finance the Group’s permanent working capital financing needs and restructure its
debt financing toward a longer-term, more stable structure that is suitable for the nature of the Group’s
operations. The long-term facility will be used partially to provide the input financing to farmers needed to
produce oilseeds for processing on the Group’s plants. Thereby, IFC’s investment is expected to strengthen the
support to farmers and increase the sustainability of the Group’s operations.
The Project Development Objective. IFC provided Victoria Group with long-term financing that is currently
not possible to secure from commercial banks or capital markets locally. By providing a loan to Victoria Group,
IFC is supporting the development of the private sector in Serbia, where revitalizing agribusiness is essential for
creating jobs and lowering a 20 percent unemployment rate.


The development impact of the project is expected to include:
      Strengthening agribusiness linkages and support to farmers: given the strong linkages of Victoria
       Group with farmers, provision of longer-term permanent working capital will help ensure the stable
       access of pre-harvest financing to farmers.
    Preserving jobs: the Group employs about 1,800 people across its operation and collaborates with
        about 400 partners, which in turn supply the Group from over 25,000 farmers.
    Increasing tax revenues: IFC’s investment will contribute to the growth of government revenues from
       taxation.
    Addressing food security concerns: IFC’s investment will contribute to food security and to meeting
       the challenges of increasing demand and the food crisis.
IFC’s expected additionality includes:
      Crisis response and countercyclical support: In light of the fluid economic situation in Serbia in the
       context of the Eurozone crisis, the local banking sector has cut liquidity on the domestic market.
       Through the project, IFC is stepping up its presence on the local market, helping to restore confidence
       and increase investment in Serbia.
    Diversified funding base: At a time of financial strain for local banks, IFC is starting its relationship
       with Victoria, a new partner that will benefit from a further diversified funding base as a result of IFC’s
       presence.

In the context of the Joint IFI Action Plan for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Société Générale (SocGen), which is
the French bank with the largest exposure in the CEE region, has approached IFC to provide an investment package to
eight subsidiaries, including Serbia, for an aggregate investment amount of up to €270 million (equivalent US$365 million).
IFC provided Société Générale Srbija with a €70 million (US$94.5 million equivalent) loan to increase access to finance
for Serbian agribusinesses, supporting economic growth, employment, and exports. In 2010, IFC also approved a €40
million agribusiness loan to Société Générale in Serbia.

The Project Development Objective. The loan is part of IFC’s strategy to strengthen the region’s banking sector and
support the country’s economic recovery by boosting lending to the agribusiness sector. In Serbia, about 45 percent of
the population lives in rural areas and about one-third rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture is a key part of
Serbia’s economy, accounting for about 20 percent of GDP. In 2011, Serbia’s total agricultural exports increased by 20
percent year-on-year, reaching US$2.8 billion (€2.2 billion).

The development impact of the project is expected to include:
       Strengthening financial institutions in Serbia
       Supporting agribusiness projects in Serbia in partnership with SocGen subisidiaries
       Contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction

IFC’s expected additionality includes:
       Enhancing the capacity of SocGen subsidiaries in Serbia to provide funding to agribusinesses whose access to
        finance has been curtailed by the global financial crisis
       Providing financing under the Joint IFI Action Plan

IFC provided a €20 million loan to PMC Automotive Serbia, a new metal-stamping factory near Kragujevac, to
strengthen Serbia’s car industry and boost the overall economy. PMC Automotive Serbia is a joint venture between
CLN Group and PROMA Group, two Italian automotive suppliers. The PMC factory will supply parts to FIAT’s plant
in Kragujevac. The FIAT plant will manufacture the new FIAT 500L, a subcompact car with improved fuel efficiency.
The current production capacity of the FIAT plant, 20,000 cars per year, is expected to grow to 140,000 cars per year
in 2013, and possibly more than double that number by 2015.

The Project Development Objective. The PMC factory, located in a supplier park less than a kilometer from FIAT’s
plant, is expected to generate 370 jobs. The total cost of the project is estimated at €37 million. The project will
strengthen Serbia’s car industry and generate new exports.

The development impact of the project is expected to include:
       Sustainable employment creation: The project is expected to create at least 367 skilled jobs in Sumadija
        District, a frontier region of Serbia.
       Support for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia: Channeling FDI is a priority for Serbia. The project
        will contribute to balancing Serbia’s large current account deficit.
       Support for export-oriented industry: The project will sell its products to FIAT’s assembly plant in
        Kragujevac, which will export 90 percent of its production.
      Technology transfer: CLN and PROMA are FIAT-trusted suppliers and have state-of-the-art technologies
       and efficient processes. Local staff will be trained to new, highly competitive standards.
IFC’s expected additionality includes:
    Crisis response and countercyclical role: Current market conditions in Europe magnify IFC’s countercyclical
       role, as most of the European banks, especially the Italian banks that are active in Eastern Europe, have
       been limiting their exposure to emerging markets due to funding and capital constraints. By providing long-
       term financing that matches the cash flow of the project, IFC is sending a signal to the market that it is
       willing to finance sound projects and companies.
    Risk mitigation: CLN and PROMA are still in the early stages of their expansion to emerging markets and
       the project is their first investment in Serbia. Partnering with IFC, especially in frontier regions, provides
       comfort to CLN and PROMA in terms of country knowledge and contacts in the public and private sectors.

Based in Belgrade and Novi Sad but with operations across Serbia and Ukraine, the MK Group is involved in
(i) agricultural crop production; (ii) sugar production; (iii) storage, transportation, and trading of agricultural
commodities, and (iv) other miscellaneous activities. Established in 1983, the MK Group is a privately owned
company and a market leader in all of its key lines of business. MK Group has embarked on a €87 million
investment plan that consists of: (i) the acquisition of Carnex AD Meat Industry (“Carnex”), the Serbian brand
leader in processed meat products; (ii) the upgrade and expansion of Carnex’s vertically integrated operations;
and (iii) the expansion and modernization of the Group’s primary agriculture operations. IFC’s support to this
project entails two loans: €45 million (US$55.82 million equivalent) and €25 million (US$33.5 million
equivalent).
The Project Development Objective. IFC provided MK Group with long-term financing that is currently
not possible to secure from commercial banks or capital markets locally. By providing a loan to MK Group,
IFC is supporting the development of the private sector in Serbia, where revitalizing agribusiness is essential to
creating jobs and lowering a 20 percent unemployment rate. IFC’s loan will enable the Group to further
diversify and expand its operations in sectors where it already operates as well as adjacent industries, namely
livestock and meat production.
The development impact of the project is expected to include:
       Operational turnaround and efficiency improvements at Carnex, a large employer and former
        regional leader
       Support to an agricultural company involved in value-added production in a sector important to
        Serbia’s economy
       Extension of the MK Group’s reach to farmers and improvements in the agricultural infrastructure
       Demonstration effect by encouraging other companies to invest in the region
    Increased tax revenues
IFC’s expected additionality includes:
    enabling the company to conservatively leverage its growth through acquisition and investment
       upgrades by providing financing at reasonable rates as well as longer tenors appropriate for the type
       of investment and not otherwise available in the country
    diversifying the Group’s funding base
    sharing its global and industry knowledge as the Group enters new product segments

portfolio, mainly to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including retailers, and general commerce and
food-related enterprises. HVB-SAM’s additional loans will be provided predominantly to SMEs, which will
increase SMEs’ access to financing and support economically sound projects.

MIGA issued a guarantee for US$11.7 million to Bank Austria Creditanstalt (BACA) AG covering its guaranty
for a loan made by the German Development Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW) to BACA’s
subsidiary, HVB Banka Serbia and Montenegro a.d. (HVB-SAM), in Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. The
guarantee is for 10 years, and covers the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil
disturbance.

MIGA issued two guarantees to the investor covering an €8 million investment in the project in fiscal 2004.
The project is expected to increase longer-term financing and generate competitive pricing for retail and
corporate clients. The funds will be dedicated almost exclusively to SMEs, including in the retail and food
sectors. HVB-SAM is expected to play an important role in the ongoing restructuring of Serbia and
Montenegro’s financial sector by providing knowledge, technical solutions, and new products. HVB-SAM
employs 146 staff in seven branches and expects to add more local employees over the next five years. HVB-
SAM’s staff will benefit from on- and off-site training.

The project is part of an overall World Bank Group effort to help Serbia and Montenegro stimulate short-term
growth and build effective institutions.

MIGA has issued a guarantee of up to US$40.1 million covering Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG’s (RZB)
€30 million shareholder loan to its subsidiary, Raiffeisen Leasing d.o.o. (RLRS) in Serbia. The coverage is for a
period of up to six years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.

The Serbian financial sector is currently feeling the effects of the financial crisis and experiencing a flattening
of customer demand. At the same time, leasing products as a financing vehicle for SMEs are vital. Therefore
RZB plans to extend this €30 million loan to allow RLRS to continue to serve its existing clients, as well as
generate new business. This would be MIGA’s fifth guarantee in support of this project.

This project is expected to contribute to the development of the financial sector in Serbia by improving access
to finance, particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved. The project will meet the
increasing demand for leasing as a form of asset financing.

One of the main objectives of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Serbia, which is
broadly structured around the Serbian Government’s development strategy, is encouraging dynamic private
sector–led growth. The project is consistent with this objective, as it will support investment flows into Serbia
at a time when investor appetite has largely disappeared due to the ongoing global financial crisis.

MIGA has issued a guarantee of up to €95 million covering UniCredit Bank Austria AG’s (UBA) €100 million
shareholder loan to its subsidiary, UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC (UBSR). The coverage is for a period of up to
five years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.

The loan will provide UBSR with long-term liquidity and improve UBSR’s asset-liability management by
matching assets and funding of similar maturities. The loan is part of a broader funding strategy of the UniCredit
Group to finance its subsidiaries and is particularly important in view of the current turmoil in financial markets
worldwide, including Serbia.

MIGA supports this project in conjunction with the Financial Sector Initiative framework recently presented
to MIGA’s Board of Directors as part of a coordinated international response to the ongoing global financial
crisis. Serbia, like many other countries in the Europe and Central Asia region, is currently facing difficult fiscal
adjustments along with the need for external financing. MIGA’s support to the project will supplement the
International Monetary Fund’s program for Serbia by injecting liquidity into the UBSR, boosting confidence in
Serbia’s financial sector, and contributing to the improvement of the country’s financial stability.

One of the main objectives of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Serbia is to encourage
dynamic private sector–led growth. The proposed project is fully consistent with this objective.

MIGA has issued a guarantee of up to US$13.8 million covering Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG’s (RZB)
€10 million shareholder loan to its leasing subsidiary, Raiffeisen Rent d.o.o. (RRRS) in Serbia. The coverage is
for a period of up to six years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.

The Serbian leasing market is currently feeling the effects of the financial crisis, with most leasing entities
experiencing a decrease in liquidity. At the same time, the demand for operating leases as an asset financing
option continues to increase for SMEs. RZB plans to extend this €10 million loan to allow RRRS to maintain
its business by servicing its existing clients and to expand its operations by attracting new clients. This is MIGA’s
sixth guarantee in support of RZB’s leasing subsidiaries in Serbia.

This project is expected to contribute to the development of the financial sector in Serbia by improving access
to finance, particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved. The project will also help
meet the increasing demand for leasing as a form of asset financing. The project is consistent with the World
Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Serbia. The strategy supports the encouragement of private
sector–led growth and also provides opportunities and broadens participation in growth.

On December 22, 2010, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$4.4 million to ProCredit Holding (PCH) covering its
investment in its subsidiary in Serbia. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of
expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the
parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some 750,000
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and
Africa. Throughout the world, banks are required to maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of
their respective jurisdictions. The ProCredit group’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according to the
German Banking Act. Under this act, at a consolidated level, reserves deposited at the various central banks
can attract a risk weighting of 100 or even 150 percent, depending on the country. This risk weighting
determines the amount of equity required to maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the German Banking
Act.

The guarantee issued by MIGA will help PCH obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining
MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at
the central bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting will allow PCH to free up equity currently tied up for
CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn
will allow PCH’s emerging market subsidiary banks across its network to increase their lending activities.

MIGA’s support will help PCH optimize its capital management across its 21 banks, allowing PCH to direct
equity to subsidiaries with the greatest need. These banks will be able to offer additional financial services to
MSMEs at a time of macroeconomic challenges. Supporting productive small businesses will help stimulate
growth, generate employment, and reduce poverty.

MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s microfinance strategy, which includes
improving the supply of microfinance in large but underserved markets; enhancing deposit capacity by assisting
microfinance institutions in savings mobilization; promoting capacity building; creating and shaping markets;
and fostering innovation.

On July 28, 2011, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$80.6 million to ProCredit Holding (PCH) covering its
investment in its subsidiary in Serbia. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of
expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.

MIGA was previously covering a total of US$4.4 million under the project. The additional coverage of US$80.6
million complies with ProCredit’s request to convert outstanding capacity to current coverage in order to
consolidate all of its political risk insurance requirements under the MIGA framework.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the
parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some 750,000
MSMEs in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and Africa. Throughout the world, banks are required
to maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of their respective jurisdictions. Currently, the ProCredit
group’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according to Basel II, but in the future it will also be calculated
according to the German Banking Act. Under this act, at a consolidated level, reserves deposited at the various
central banks can attract a risk weighting of 100 or even 150 percent depending on the country. This risk
weighting determines the amount of equity required to maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the
German Banking Act.

PCH has approached MIGA to obtain capital relief from the capital adequacy ratio requirements. By obtaining
MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at
the central bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting would allow PCH to free up equity currently tied up
for CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in
turn will allow PCH’s emerging market subsidiary banks across its network to increase their lending activities.

MIGA’s support will allow PCH to direct equity to subsidiaries with the greatest need. The additional services

On July 15, 2011 MIGA issued a guarantee of US$12.8 million for reinsurance of the SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana
coverage to the Mercator retail group (Mercator) in Serbia. MIGA’s reinsurance for the investment results in a
gross exposure of US$277.4 million. MIGA is reinsuring the investment for a period of up to six years, against
the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.

MIGA’s support to SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana is in accordance with MIGA’s mandate to cooperate with national
entities of its member countries, as stated in MIGA’s Convention. By providing facultative reinsurance, MIGA
is allowing SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana to reduce its net exposure to Mercator and to free up capacity for other
investment insurance projects.

Mercator is helping to stimulate exports among Balkan countries by carrying goods from the other countries in
each of its retail locations. As a result, Mercator is expanding the venue for suppliers to sell not only in their
respective countries but also in neighboring countries where Mercator has an established presence. In addition,
Mercator’s further expansion in the Balkans, supported by SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana and MIGA, will provide
employment and retail training opportunities in these countries.

MIGA is also helping to establish best practices with respect to corporate governance, as well as environmental
and social policies in the host countries.

On March 1, 2013, MIGA issued a guarantee totaling €190.0 million (approximately $250.1 million) covering
an investment by Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (Eurobank) of Greece in its Serbian subsidiary, Eurobank AD
Beograd. The coverage is for a period of three years against the risk of expropriation of funds for mandatory
reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.

Eurobank is a universal banking group with a significant network of retail banks across Central, Eastern, and
Southeastern Europe. The group’s subsidiary banks are required to maintain mandatory reserves at the central
banks of their respective jurisdictions, generally based on the volume of customer deposits that these
subsidiaries hold. The banks are thereby exposed to the risk of expropriation of funds by the respective central
bank. This exposure leads to higher risk weights on these assets at the consolidated level, resulting in increased
capital allocation for country risk exposure. At the consolidated group level, the risk weighting determines the
amount of equity required to maintain a specified capital adequacy ratio (CAR) in accordance with Greek
banking law.

MIGA’s guarantee will help Eurobank obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining MIGA’s
insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at the central
bank can be reduced. This will free up equity tied up for country risk purposes, which can be deployed to
support its subsidiary’s franchise in Serbia. Eurobank Beograd’s role in supporting productive businesses,
including SMEs, through credit extension helps stimulate growth, employment generation, and—ultimately—
poverty reduction in Serbia.

As a participant of the European Bank Coordination Initiative (also known as the Vienna Initiative), Eurobank
pledged to support its Serbian subsidiary, keeping it well capitalized. Eurobank’s continuing support for its
systemically important subsidiary contributed to supporting the Serbian economy in the aftermath of the
financial crisis. Capital adequacy well in excess of the regulatory requirement provides Eurobank Beograd in
Serbia with a cushion to withstand potential shocks and helps position the bank for future growth.

MIGA’s coverage to Eurobank is consistent with the goals of the crisis response initiative for the ECA region
launched by the World Bank Group in January 2012. As part of the initiative, MIGA seeks to support capital-
constrained banks active in the region. The project is also aligned with the World Bank Group’s strategy for
Serbia as it seeks to address the spillover from the financial crisis.
