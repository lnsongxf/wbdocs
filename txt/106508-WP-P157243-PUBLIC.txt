                      DEVELOPMENTS


A. REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
The external environment confronting Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain difficult in the near
term. Commodity prices are expected to remain low, and in 2016, growth in the region is forecast
to drop to 2.5% from 3.0% in 2015. There is considerable variation in economic performance across
countries, with the slowdown concentrated among the region’s largest commodity exporters. Grow-
ing economic vulnerabilities, amid weakened policy buffers, continue to pose challenges for policy
makers.
                       The World Bank’s Africa’s Pulse (April 2016) highlighted a sluggish global economic
                       environment facing SSA1. The region weakened significantly in 2015, with commodity
                       prices falling sharply and global growth remaining amemic, slipping to 2.4%, from 2.6%
                       in 2014. In this context, economic activity in SSA slowed in 2015, with GDP growth aver-

in SSA slowed in
2015, with GDP         The deceleration in growth was driven by low commodity prices, weak growth in ma-
growth averaging       jor trading partners, rising borrowing costs, and adverse domestic developments in
3.0%.                  many countries. This low pace of growth was last experienced by SSA in 2009, following
                       the global financial crisis, and contrasts sharply with the robust 6.8% average annual
                       growth in GDP that the region enjoyed in 2003-08. The slowdown in growth implies that
                       GDP per capita increased by less than 0.5% in 2015, further complicating the challenge
                       of accelerating poverty reduction in the region.

                       The fall in commodity prices in 2015 (figure 1) represented a significant shock for SSA
                       because of the large share of commodities in exports: fuels, ore, and metals account
                       for more than 60% of the region’s exports compared with 16% for manufactured goods
                       and 10% for agricultural products.

                       Oil prices have declined markedly, falling by about 57%, from US$112 per barrel in June
Metal prices
                       2014 (Brent Crude) to US$47 per barrel at end-May 2016 (albeit above a low of US$31

                       per barrel in January 2016)3. Prices of agricultural commodities and metals declined in
drop, due in large

part to weak global
demand.                metal prices sustained a steeper drop, driven by large declines in the prices of iron ore,
                       platinum and copper, due in large part to weak global demand, especially from China
                       and other large emerging market economies.

                       Going beyond the regional aggregate, there was considerable variation in growth per-
                       formance across countries. Activity also weakened in non-energy mineral exporting
                       countries, including Botswana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Zambia.
                       These countries benefited less from lower oil prices due to sharp declines in the price
                       of metals, including copper, diamonds, iron ore and platinum, their main commodity
                       exports.

B. THE STATE OF THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY
Since mid-2015, the economy has come under strain as external headwinds and domestic pressures
have intensified. Zambia is facing its toughest economic challenges in at least a decade as growth
slowed to an estimated 3.2% in 2015. The external headwinds include slower regional and global
growth (crucially in China) and lower copper prices. Domestic pressures include a power crisis im-

                                          creased marginally from 708,259 metric tons (mt) in 2014 to 710,560 mt in 2015. Nev-

                                          global prices. Despite a Q1 rally, copper prices have remained soft and production de-

                                          and domestic constraints (most notably power outages).

                                          The agricultural sector declined by 7.7% in 2015 compared to a growth of 8.0% in 2014,
                                          harming rural households’ income. This was on account of low and poorly distributed
                                          rains during the 2014-15 season. Maize production fell by 21.9% in 2015, contribut-
                                          ing to increased food inflation of 26.5% in April 2016 (year-on-year), up from 8.1% in
                                          September 2015. The situation is expected to improve in 2016 as early government
                                          forecasts for the harvest suggest an increase of 10%, relative to 2015, given better levels
                                          and distribution of rainfall during the 2015-16 season (box 1).

                                          Preliminary national accounts data from the government for 2015 suggests that the
                                          secondary sector (non-mining industry, construction and manufacturing) grew by 10.8%

as 18.9% in 2015,                         to 4.4% in 2015 from 4.0% in 2014, on the back of a strong performance in ‘chemical,

public sector                             management’. Growth of the services sector dropped from 5.2% in 2014 to 3.0% in
infrastructure                            2015. Slower expansion occurred across the sector, with the exception of financial ser-

                                          Firms across the country suffered higher costs of production in 2015, linked to the
                                          onset of the power crisis and higher costs of imported inputs associated with the de-
                                          preciation of the kwacha. In July 2015, ZESCO increased the extent of rolling black-outs
                                          (load-shedding) to at least 8 hours per day on a rotational basis for the majority of its
                                          household, commercial and industrial customers. Although it is not subject to load-
                                          shedding, ZESCO also requested the mining industry to curtail its load by up to 30%.
                                          This was in order to manage a power deficit that, as at March 2016, was estimated
                                          at 1,000MW, representing close to 50% of Zambia’s peak demand. On June 07, 2016,
                                          ZESCO announced that it intended to reduce load-shedding to 4 hours per day due to

  Box    Late but not less rainfall
  	1     The 2014-15 agricultural (October-March) season was characterized by rainfall deficits resulting in
  markedly below average end-of-season vegetation (World Food Program8). This reduced 2015 agricultural
  production and has increased the prices of food items. The drier weather patterns have been strongly in-
  fluenced by El Niño, active in the region for the past two rainy seasons. Furthermore, climate change has
  increased the frequency of floods and droughts over the past three decades and will continue to have an
  impact on climate-sensitive sectors such as rain-fed agriculture, fishing, and forestry.

  El Niño-induced weather patterns in the 2015-16 season have resulted in poor rains and a maize deficit else-
  where in Southern Africa (particularly in Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe). There were similar concerns
  for Zambia as rains started late and national rainfall was below average from November to December 2015.  
  However, rainfall improved and was above average from February to April 2016. A recent crop survey, car-
  ried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, forecasts that this season’s maize production in Zambia might be
  about 10% higher than what was recorded from the previous season9. Similar forecasts are made for rice,
  ground nuts, millet, cotton, sweet potatoes and beans.


                           The kwacha
                           Global headwinds have combined with domestic pressures and ebbing confidence in
                           the economy, resulting in huge shifts and foreign exchange market turbulence, raising
                           many questions about the performance of the kwacha (box 2). There have been five

                                 depreciated by 60% to ZMW 12.5 per US$. By November 10, 2015, the exchange
                                 rate reached ZMW 14.1 per US$, but by the end of that month it had recovered
                                 to ZMW 10.3 per US$, an appreciation of 27% in 19 days.

                           iii. Between December 2015 and end-March 2016, the exchange rate was more
                                 stable, fluctuating between ZMW 10.3 and ZMW 11.4 per US$. This period
                                followed an aggressive tightening of monetary policy in November 2015.

                           iv. The kwacha then appreciated by 18% between end-March and mid-April 2016, as
                               the demand for the US$ eased as firms made their annual tax payments.

                           v.    By mid-April 2016, this trend reversed and the kwacha began to depreciate
                                 against the US$ again and reached ZMW 10.4 per US$ at the end of May 2016. An

                           In 2016, businesses have reported increased difficulties in sourcing foreign exchange,

                           from mining companies). According to the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the net supply of

  Box      The kwacha
  	2       There are five important factors to understand when making an assessment of the kwacha. The first
           is global and concerns global copper prices. As copper prices fall, the kwacha typically depreciates
  and as copper prices rise, it typically appreciates. The second is also global and reflects the relative strength
  of the US$ against other currencies. The US$ has strengthened against other currencies since early 2014,
  following the expectation that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates (a move they made in De-
  cember 2015). Third is a domestic factor and concerns Zambia’s foreign exchange markets being ‘thin’ (i.e.
  there are often times of low demand), and so relatively small purchases of foreign currency can move the
  exchange rate considerably. The fourth factor relates to government regulation and control of the market
  via the central bank. The BoZ intervenes in the market and also closely monitors the trading of foreign cur-
  rency. The market can also move when the government makes large payments (for example when capital
  project payments are due). Lastly, seasonal factors can impact on the rate. A good example is when monthly
  and annual tax payments are due: firms will need to move from US$ positions to kwacha in order to meet
  their tax obligations.

  Furthermore, when thinking about the kwacha, it is also important to note that a weak kwacha does not
  necessarily mean a weak economy and vice-versa. For example, an appreciating kwacha makes Zambian ex-
  ports more expensive and imports relatively cheaper. Since many inputs for producing domestic goods are
  imported, when the currency depreciates production costs rise for many firms. What is important however,
  is the stability of the exchange rate which helps with making sound investment and business decisions.


                                           Tight monetary policy is taming inflation
                                           Between January 2012 and September 2015, inflation remained stable at an average
Inflation reached                          rate of 7.2%. In 2015, inflation fell consecutively during Q1 and Q2. However, since mid-
21% in December
                                           2015, inflationary pressures began building up due to the depreciating kwacha and the
and has remained
                                           electricity shortages. In October 2015, inflation rose sharply and year-on-year inflation
above 20% as of
May 2016.
                                           jumped to 14.3% in October, breached 20% in December, and has remained above
                                           21% between December and May 2016 (figure 8).

                                           The high inflation is linked to the depreciation of the kwacha and an increase in food
                                           inflation (box 3). Zambia experiences a relatively high rate of pass-through from the de-
                                           preciation to inflation, as many food products are imported and firms producing goods
                                           for the domestic market often import many of their inputs. For example, the price of
                                           secondhand cars increased by 54% in year to April 2016 and refrigerators by 38%11.
                                           Production costs have also risen as a result of the power outages, while a reduced sup-
                                           ply of selected food items and an increase in customs duty on cigarettes and motor
                                           vehicles have also played a role.

                           Inflation has started to decelerate in 2016. The recent monthly report by the CSO
                           suggests year-on-year inflation declined to 21.3% in May 2016 from 21.8% in April
                           and 22.2% in March12. This was on the back of slowing non-food inflation, which fell to
                           16.5% from 17.9% in March 2016, driven by a decline in vehicle imports.

                           While fiscal policy has been expansionary since 2014, monetary policy has shouldered
                           the burden of moderating inflation. Several monetary policy measures have been tak-
                           en to tighten liquidity. In Q1 2015, the BoZ increased the statutory reserve ratio to

                           (at least between December 2015 and March 2016) and subsequent lower monthly
                           inflation, the central bank kept rates on hold at its February and May 2016 quarterly
                           Monetary Policy Committee meetings. In May 2016, the BoZ forecast that inflation had
                           peaked and would decelerate in 2016 towards single digits13.

                           Tight monetary policy has helped moderate inflation, but at a cost. Commercial bank
                           liquidity has tightened leading to a sharp increase in the interbank rate to 27.3% in
                           April 2016 from 14.6% in October 2015. Low liquidity combined with the higher inter-
                           est have increased the cost of borrowing at a time when the growth of the economy is
                           slowing and firms are being hit hard by the power crisis. It is currently more expensive
                           and harder to access credit than in 2015. For example, credit extension has declined
                           from ZMW 47.6 billion in Q4 2015 to ZMW 45.8 billion in Q1 2016.



 Box     The price of food
   3     Food inflation has been the key driver of the sharp increase in overall inflation since October 2015.
 Before then, average food prices had been below non-food prices from January 2013 to September 2015.
 This is despite a 4.0% contraction of the agriculture sector in 2013. However, in October 2015, food inflation
 doubled to 16.2% from 8.1% in September 2015, and further to 25.0% in December 2015. Food inflation has
 continued to rise and has averaged 26.2% during the first 5 months of 2016.

 There are multiple factors impacting on prices. First are the weather conditions which impact crop produc-
 tion and the supply of food, especially maize meal (the staple food). Second, and applicable to maize, are

 increase). Fourth, many food products are imported and the exchange rate influences their price. Further,
 many major food retail outlets’ costs have increased and been passed on to the consumer. Costs have in-
 creased due to the use of generators during the power crisis and often their rent is indexed to the US$, which
 has therefore increased as the kwacha has lost value.

 There have also been large shifts in the prices of particular food items and goods. The CSO reports that be-
 tween April 2015 and April 2016, national average prices for the following goods have increased by over 30%:
 Roller mealie meal (30%); maize grain (35%); tomatoes (114%); onions (38%); dried beans (30%); sugar (35%);
 table salt (37%); and hammer mill charges (45%)14.

Over the past                              Over the past five years, public expenditure has increased at an annual average rate
five years, public                         of 13.8% (in real terms). Expenditure reached 28.1% of GDP in 2015, up from 19.3% in

terms).                                    from a low of 1.8% in 201115. External borrowing has plugged most of the gap between
                                           what was spent and what was earned in tax. External financing was increased to 7.7%
                                           of GDP in 2015 from 4.7% in 2014, following the issuance of Eurobonds in each of the

                                           The increased expenditure in 2015 was driven by large increases in three areas. First
                                           are the increasing costs of debt servicing, as a result of the non-concessional borrowing
                                           at high interest rates (including the third Eurobond) and the depreciation of the kwacha
                                           (external debt is serviced in foreign currency). Debt interest payments increased by

                                           inputs aimed at improving yields. Third is capital spending, which increased by 30% in
of the annual
budget.                                    real terms to ZMW 12,773 billion in 2015 for the completion of infrastructure projects.

                                           Preliminary data suggests that public expenditure in Q1 2016 was ZMW 11.8 billion,
                                           equivalent to 23% of the 2016 annual budget16. Of this, 36% has been spent on public
                                           sector salaries, 31% on intergovernmental grants (which includes subsidies), 18% on
                                           interest payments, and 9% on goods and services. Intergovernmental grants and in-
                                           terest rate payments received 60% and 30% respectively of their entire 2016 budget
                                           allocation in Q1, reflecting payments for electricity importation, agriculture subsidies
                                           and debt service costs. During Q1 2015, the government spent ZMW 3.3 billion and
                                           ZMW 717 million servicing domestic and foreign debt respectively. The increased cost
                                           of domestic debt service resulted from lower auction sizes in Q1 2016, which meant
                                           that many bonds and bills were not rolled over and had to be repaid.

                       Public debt levels have increased
The repeat fiscal      The repeat fiscal deficits of the past four years have been financed by external non-con-

four years have        (with an average tenor of 11 years) at a considerably higher cost than previous issues
been financed          (the yield at issue was 9.375%). The Eurobond issues now total US$3 billion and have
by external non-       sharply increased overall debt levels. The Eurobonds are associated with repayment
concessional           risks, given the bullet structure of the first two bonds (they each need to be replayed in
borrowing.             one single year) and foreign currency risks17.

                       Large exchange rate depreciations carry the risk of balance sheet effects, especially
                       where there is substantial offshore foreign currency borrowing by the government and
                       corporations. Foreign currency risks have become a reality in Zambia, as a weaker kwa-
                       cha has increased the cost of servicing external borrowing.

                       The depreciating currency has pushed the kwacha cost of repaying and servicing this
                       external debt much higher. At the end of 2015, total public sector debt had risen to
                       52.7% of GDP (based on estimates of 2015 GDP), driven by an increase in external debt
                       to 38.7% of GDP in 2015 from just 17.9% in 2014.

                       900 million to ZMW 450 million in January 2016. However, non-bank financial institu-

                                           and cobalt) declined by 36% in 2014, before declining by a further 23% in 2015 to reach
                                           US$1,865 million. In Q1 2016, non-copper exports declined by 3.3% compared to Q4
                                           2015. Non-copper exports include maize, tobacco, sulphuric acid and precious stones.
                                           The recent decline follows poor crop production in the 2014-15 agricultural season and
                                           uncertainty about the availability of permits to export maize. Key non-copper export
                                           destinations are the Democratic Republic of Congo (7.7% of exports and mainly sulphu-

                                           of imports declined by 12% to US$8,433 million in 2015 from US$9,530 million in 2014.
                                           Higher prices for imported goods in kwacha terms have led to substitution effects and
                                           in Q1 2016, the volume of imports has continued to fall further and decreased faster
                                           than exports. Consequently, the trade deficit has started narrowing.

                                           Prosperity has not been shared equally
                                           The benefits of recent GDP growth have accrued mainly to the richer segments of the
                                           population in urban areas and poverty remains largely concentrated in rural areas. In
                                           April 2016, the CSO launched preliminary results from the LCMS 201519. Their survey
                                           provides estimates of living conditions for Zambia’s 3 million households. Consumption
                                           is chosen as the preferred welfare indicator and is assessed via four main components:
                                           food, nonfood, durable goods and housing.

                                           The LCMS finds that despite a GDP growth averaging 7.4% between 2004 and 2014,
                                           there has only been a marginal reduction in poverty. The CSO reports that in 2015,
                                           54.4% of the population were defined as poor and 40.8% of the population were expe-

                                           day (2011 PPP terms) measure for international comparison, poverty is estimated at
                                           61.3% in 201520. The poverty measured is largely a rural phenomenon with 77% of the
                                           poorest households located in rural areas.

C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, RISKS AND POLICY CHALLENGES
GDP growth is forecast to remain close to 3.0% in 2016, before improving in 2017 (4.2%) and again in
2018 (5%). For 2016, this assumes new power generation capacity comes on stream and a better har-
vest is achieved. For the medium-term, it assumes copper prices remain low, suggesting that if global
copper supply better matches demand, and prices recover once again, improved growth might be
achieved. Despite the current slowdown, long-term investment in mineral and non-mineral sectors
in Zambia remains attractive.


                        Medium-term outlook
                        Reflecting the external headwinds and domestic pressures, the expectation is that GDP
                        growth will remain close to 3.0% in 2016, before improving in 2017 (4.2%) and again
                        in 2018 (5.0%). The outlook for the Zambian economy is underpinned by five main as-

                           prices are likely to stay soft throughout 2016 and 201721. However, if global copper
                           supply better matches demand, and prices recover once again, improved growth
                           could be achieved.

                        ii. Persistent and growing fiscal deficits are, by clear and credible budget policies, geared
                            toward a more sustainable fiscal stance supporting medium-term growth.

                        iii. Confidence in the economy is improved via an agreement with the IMF on a program
                             of support. An IMF program would help in restoring investor confidence and give
                             other cooperating partners greater confidence to provide budget support.

                        The outlook is subject to both domestic and external downside risks. Externally, lower
                        than predicted output growth in China would weigh on the demand for Zambia’s ex-
                        ports, further reducing copper prices, and would severely affect Zambia’s prospects.
                        Furthermore, the strengthening of the US$ in the event of an increase in interest rates
                        by the Federal Reserve, would also likely lead to further volatility of the kwacha and de-
                        preciation pressures. Tighter global financing conditions would also increase the cost
                        of tapping international debt markets in 2016 and 2017.

                                           stated intentions for meeting the cost of supply with tariffs were realized, then fiscal
                                           pressures would ease considerably. Better and pro-poor cushioning can be achieved
                                           via investment projects targeted to regions, and via targeted cash transfers, than with
                                           fuel subsidies. Making Every Kwacha Count is the focus of Part II.

                                           should be targeted. A key step includes the timely publication of a debt strategy and

D. RELOCATING UNDER-UTILIZED EXPENDITURE

Uncertainty about whether persistent and growing fiscal deficits can be reined in need to be met
with clear and credible budget policies toward a more sustainable fiscal stance. Efforts are needed
to ensure that any under-utilized resources are reallocated to where they can have a greater impact,
and greater focus is needed on protecting and supporting the poorest households via better public
expenditure.

                        Over the past five years, public expenditure has increased at an annual average of
                        13.8% (in real terms) and a thorough review of the quality of this expenditure is re-
                        quired. There is need to identify and reallocate under-utilized resources to ensure that
                        every kwacha spent is contributing towards each sector’s objectives. Furthermore, the
                        preliminary results from the LCMS 2015 suggest that the economic expansion since
                        the early 2000s has not sufficiently benefited the poor. The growth has been exclusive

                        per month, a combined total of US$576 million, putting huge pressure on the budget.
                        The respective subsidies are explored below in turn.

                        Fuel subsidies have reemerged
                        When asked about fuel subsidies, many people respond that prices are cost-reflective
                        and there are no subsidies in place in Zambia. However, a consequence of the rapidly
                        depreciating kwacha has been a mismatch between revenues from pump prices (paid
                        in kwacha) and the cost of supply of fuel (paid in US$). This leaves the Ministry of Fi-
                        nance having to pay the difference and the reemergence of subsidy.

                        Petroleum products (fuel) play a crucial role in Zambia’s economy, particularly in the ag-
                        riculture, transport, and mining sectors. What a reasonable price for fuel is has always
                        been a hotly debated topic. Zambia shifted from having some of the highest fuel prices
                        in Africa (and globally) in the mid-2000s to lower prices in 2008, supported by direct
                        government subsidies and reduced taxation23. Subsidies were used to pay feedstock
                        import bills and cover refinery and pipeline charges. Frequently, substantial arrears
                        built up, posing a threat to the reliability of future fuel supplies. To remedy this, the gov-
                        ernment committed to the principle of cost-plus pricing on a cargo-by-cargo basis (i.e.
                        all the costs in the supply value chain are fully recovered by the pump price).

                                            The Energy Regulation board (ERB) regulates the energy sector including the supply
                                            of petroleum products. The ERB determines wholesale and pump prices based on the
                                            cost of each feedstock cargo received. The cost of each feedstock cargo is mainly af-
                                            fected by global crude oil prices and the US$ to kwacha exchange rate (box 4).

  Box     Parts of the Petroleum Sector
  	4      TAZAMA pipeline: The procurement of the petroleum feedstock is done through an international
  competitive bidding process. The imported feedstock is in the form of spiked crude oil, transported through
  the 1,705 Km pipeline (jointly owned by the Governments of Zambia (67%) and Tanzania (33%)).

  Indeni Oil Refinery: The feedstock is processed to meet the petroleum product requirements of the market
  at the Zambian government-owned Indeni Petroleum Refinery in Ndola (in the Copperbelt Province), that
  was constructed in 1973. The refinery was last refurbished in 2000 after a fire that brought operations to
  a standstill. The refinery consists of a large reforming unit (214,000 MTS per year), a Hydro-treater for des-
  ulphurization of kerosene and lighter fractions, and a Vacuum Distillation Unit (VDU) for specific technical
  conditions. This facilitates spike crude processing with the aim of minimizing heavy fuel production. The
  current capacity of the refinery is estimated at 850,000 mt per year.

  Ndola Fuel Terminal: Finished products are transferred from the oil refinery via pipelines into storage facili-
  ties at the Ndola Fuel Terminal, for loading and transportation (by rail or trucks).

  Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs): Refined products are imported directly or collected from the Ndola fuel
  terminal and distributed to petrol stations and commercial customers for sale. There are 21 registered
  OMCs in Zambia and currently, a legal requirement mandates that all OMCs operating in Zambia keep an
  equivalent of 15 days of their working petroleum in stock.


                                            Since December 2014, there have been four price adjustments in pump prices (table
                                            2). An increase in December 2014 was followed by two decreases in January and May
                                            2015, and then by an increase in July 2015. The main justification has been changes to

                                            is bought in large batches, there can be a lag between the adjustment of pump prices
                                            and the costs incurred of importing the fuel. Between July 2015 and May 2016, the

                      As well as tackling the issue of subsidy, there are three underlying challenges associ-
                      ated with the supply of fuel in Zambia that need to be resolved.

                      First is the use of the Indeni Refinery, which increases the cost of the fuel for the govern-

                      needs (there is no low-sulphur output for example). In addition, any new refinery that
                      may be built, based on Zambia’s needs, might be too small to compete with the massive
                      new refineries coming on-line around the world. In light of the worldwide transition to-

                      is not engaged in the pricing, thereby increasing the likelihood of budget pressures and
                      arrears accumulation.

                      Thirdly, there remains a need to increase transparency in national fuel procurement.
                      Increasing the availability and transparency of energy subsidy data is essential in over-
                      coming some of the challenges related to reform. This can encourage an informed
                      discussion and debate regarding the subsidies and government policies toward them.

                      Electricity costs have escalated with emergency power
                      To reduce the power deficit, the government began to import expensive emergency

                      tered on setting tariffs at a level that ensures that costs incurred in supplying electricity
                      to different consumer categories are recovered. However, tariffs should also enable
                      investment into the sector, and allow for capacity expansion and the renewal of power
                      plants. Since 2010, there have been four upward tariff revisions approved by the ERB.
                      The most recent was a significant upward tariff adjustment in December 2015 that
                      brought ZESCO’s average tariff to approximately USc10/kWh. This tariff decision was

                      helped replenish reservoirs, it is likely that power will need to be imported into 2017.

                      Although tariffs that ensure the recovery of the costs incurred in electricity service pro-

                      reforms. These include enhancing efficiency in the power sector; increasing access to
                      electricity, especially in rural areas which remain largely unconnected to the grid; and
                      implementing demand side management measures to optimize the use of electricity.

 Box       South Africa’s cash transfers
 	5        South Africa boasts the largest cash transfer program in Sub-Saharan Africa. It includes several types
 of means-tested grants targeted to the elderly, poor families with children, foster families, people with disa-
 bilities, and war veterans. Roughly 15 million people receive a social grant (about 30%of the national popula-
 tion). The child sup¬port grant (CSG) reaches about 10 million people, while the old age grant, which applies
 to poor people over 60 years of age, reaches about 2 million people. According to household survey data,
 social grants make up over 60% of the income of the poorest 20%of recipient households, with child grants
 being the largest contributor. Children who were enrolled in the CSG at birth completed significantly more
 grades of schooling and achieved higher scores on a math test than children who were enrolled at the age
 of six. These effects were particularly significant for girls. Enrollment in the CSG reduced the likelihood of
 illness among children by 9%. The main effects on adolescents were reduced sexual activity and teen preg-
 nancies and less drug and alcohol use26.




E. REVIEWING EDUCATION EXPENDITURE

The government of Zambia has shown a strong commitment to educational development by allocating a large
proportion of the budget to the education sector. However, a recent Education Public Expenditure Review (PER)
finds that with effort, the allocation and execution of the budget within the education sector could become
more efficient27.

                                           Education in Zambia has steadily developed and has been continuously expanding.
                                           Zambia’s population is growing fast and many more students will require an education.
                                           Government expenditure in the sector is guided by an education strategy. The first pri-

students.                                  Since 2006, public education expenditure has grown steadily in real terms. The ratio of
                                           government expenditure in education to GDP has ranged between 3.7% and 4.4% dur-
                                           ing the period 2006–13, and exceeded 5% in 2014 and 2015. Government expenditure
                                           on education grew from ZMW 1.5 billion in 2006 to ZMW 5.2 billion in 2013, with its
                                           proportion of total expenditure ranging between 15.3% and 20.5%. While tuition fees
                                           have been officially abolished, schools continue to collect various fees from students, in
                                           addition to receiving transfers from the government.

                                           The PER highlights key areas in which the efficiency and effectiveness of public expendi-
                                           ture can be improved28. It suggests that expenditure in the sector had opportunities
                                           for meeting improved educational outcomes, but this link – between resources and
                                           results – has been weak. This is evidenced by the finding that, despite the growth in
                                           funding, the quality of education has not improved. For example, primary education
                                           (measured by student learning assessments at Grade 5 level) has remained fairly flat
                                           and regressed slightly in recent years (figure 11).

                                           The PER highlights that the quality of education is weakest for the poor. This is driven
                                           in part by schools with more students from higher income families receiving higher rev-
                                           enues from fees, and in part due to weaknesses in the school grant system that result
                                           in a failure to ensure rural schools have sufficient non-wage funding (figure 14).

                                           The PER finds that most primary schools do not receive their budgeted amount from
                                           the school grant system, to the extent that 28% of primary schools have not been re-

                                           ment of school grants should also be published.

                                           When it comes to higher levels of education, the PER finds an inadequate amount is
                                           spent on technical education and vocational and entrepreneurship training (TEVET).
                                           While the TEVET subsector produces a high-quality labor force, for which the demand is
                                           increasing, it receives the smallest share of the government’s total education expendi-
                                           ture, which is also low in comparison to the shares that other African countries spend
                                           on TEVET. A better balance of funding is required for higher education and in favor of
                                           TEVET.

F. IDEAS FOR BEATING THE SLOWDOWN
To beat the slowdown, there is a need to make every kwacha of government expenditure count. Any
fiscal adjustment should be accompanied by a shift in spending priorities that supports both the ef-
ficiency of public expenditures and long-term inclusive growth. While in many areas this is difficult
to achieve, there are obvious areas for attention including the growing cost of fuel and electricity
subsides.
                        The following ideas are aimed to ensure that while the government finds a path to im-
                        proved fiscal sustainability, the quality of expenditure improves.

                        i. Eliminate fuel subsidies: Fuel pump prices could be adjusted to better reflect the
                        cost of supply and to help reduce budget pressures in 2016 and beyond. As economic
                        growth has slowed in 2015 and 2016, the trade balance worsens and substantial funds
                        are required for short-term alleviation of the power crisis, the reduction of fuel subsi-
Efforts are
                        dies provides one of few quick options for relieving budget pressures. A review of the
needed to ensure
                        current price setting mechanism is also a priority, as are efforts to fix underlying prob-
that while the

finds a path to         ii. Improve financial sustainability of the power sector: The power crisis has
improved fiscal         revealed the importance of ensuring that the power sector has sufficient funds for elec-
sustainability,         tricity service provision. Inadequate electricity tariffs limit the extent to which the exist-
the quality of          ing generation and grid network is maintained, and the extent to which investments in
expenditure             new generation capacity and network expansion by either ZESCO or private parties can

                        electricity and enabling new investment only benefit those with existing electricity con-
                        nections in the short-term, and in the long-term compromise the quality and reliability
                        of supply. Furthermore, the cost of subsidizing the sector creates significant fiscal pres-
                        sures.
                        iii. Protect the poor during the transition by scaling up the Social Cash Trans-
                        fer system: The government’s Social Cash Transfer system should be scaled up to ac-
                        company any subsidy removal and provide better support to the poorest households.
                        iv. Carry out a review of public expenditure in key sectors: A full review of what
                        is being spent in key sectors will help ensure that every kwacha is put to productive use.
                        By comparing objectives and past spending patterns, the allocation of expenditure can
                        be improved and lessons to boost the efficiency of spending can be found.
