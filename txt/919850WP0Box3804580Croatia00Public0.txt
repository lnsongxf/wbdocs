THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        fund that the person will register in. All persons employed for the first
        time and between ages 40 and 50 can, if they desire, register with the

      location permit. However, the excerpt from the Land Registry would still
      be required for the building permit application as evidence of the legal
      interest to build.

      Land Registry Department of the Municipal Court in Zagreb has
      transferred a significant portion of Land Registry data into electronic
      form, as a result, excerpts can be obtained immediately upon request
      or in a shorter term. Also, as the backlog of cases has reduced due to

      Obtain decision from the Municipal Authority regarding utilities

      BuildCo must obtain a decision from the Municipal Authority on utility
      fees, based on the construction permit. The amount of the fee depends
      on the building size (in cubic meters) and on the location. Zagreb is
      divided into four zones for the purposes of communal fee calculations.
      The communal fee is set from HRK 56 to HRK 118 per cubic meter of a
      building, depending on the zone. The Doing Business case study
      warehouse would be located in Zagreb zone III, with the communal fee
      set at HRK 75 per cubic meter. The fee can be paid in full or in
10    installments.                                                                  22 days     HRK 292,635

      According to Regulation on Procedure of Determining Volume of
      Buildings for Communal Fee Calculation currently in force, the volume
      of the buliding is used, and as for the warehouse used in the Doing
      Buisness case study, the volume of the warehouse is 3901.5 cubic

      the following:
      (i) The zone the new construction is in. Zone A is Zagreb and the
      protected coastal area, Zone B is the rest of the country, and Zone C
      are areas subject to special Government care.

      • Photocopy of the building permit or a copy of the main design for
      construction work
      • Information on the participants in the construction (investor, designer,
      performer of construction works, supervisory engineer)
      • Written statement of the contractor on works completed and the
      requirements for the maintenance of the construction
      • Final report of the supervisory engineer
      • Statement of the geodetic engineer that the construction work was
      built in accordance with the surveying design
      • Surveying study for entering the construction work in the cadastre or
      for change of information on buildings and other construction works, if
      the construction work is not subject to developing the surveying
      design, but is to be entered in the cadastre
      • Statement of the authorized geodetic engineer that the construction
      work is located on the building plot

      The Municipality forms an evaluation committee within 30 days after
      the submission of the application for the issuance of the occupancy
      permit, and determines the date of the on-site inspection. The investor
      submits various documents which substantiate that the construction
      has been conducted in accordance with the regulations (e.g.,
      construction diary, licenses of the construction firm which executed the
      works, technical certificates for the material used in the construction,
      etc.) to the evaluation committee not later than on the day after the site
      inspection. If any of the members of the evaluation committee find that
      the building does not comply with a specific requirement, the investor
      may be given an additional 90 days to make the necessary corrections
      (if the error is, in fact, able to be corrected). If all requirements have
      been met, the Municipality should issue the occupancy permit within 30
      days after the inspection.

       Obtain the land registry extract from the competent land register
       court

       Obtaining a land registry extract has become a crucial part during the
       preparation process for the purchase of a real estate, since the land
       registry extract enjoys public faith.



       Due diligence requires that the buyer knows the status of the land
       registry. Not knowing it can also result in conflicts on the property.

       The extract must be stamped by the Land Register Court in order to be
       verified. This usually does not take more than one day.

       Croatia has been in the process of computerizing the Registry. This
       process is still in its early stages. As the process of computerizing the
       registry is progressing, the number of properties for which data are          1 day

       notably increasing.



       Parties can obtain an electronic Land Registry Extract for a property that
       has been entered in the database. However, electronic extracts are not
       considered official extracts when it comes to using them for collateral
       purposes. Only Extracts obtained in paper directly in the Land Registry,
       have the legal power; the same applies for the cadastre extracts.

      The sale contract contains a clausula intabulandi (i.e. the declaration by
      the seller that the purchaser may be entered in the land register) and is
      prepared by parties or by the lawyer. Pursuant to the Croatian law on
      Ownership and Other Property Rights and Land Registry Act (OG 55/13)
      it is defined that for the transfer of the property there is only a signature
      by the person whose rights have been restricted, encumbered,

      contract, the lawyer is entitled to the remuneration calculated according

      longer. It should be highlighted that only the final decision, the one
      allowing the registration, produces the legal effect. However, regardless
      of the time when the final decision is rendered, the date of applying for
      registration will be the date marked in the Registry as the moment of
      transferring the ownership title. From that moment the party is protected
      towards all applications submitted afterwards. This rule is called the rule
      of priority: the buyer has the legal right to dispose of the property (to
      sell, lease, bequeath, transfer by gift, and mortgage the property). From
      that moment until the final registration the buyer has "quasi ownership".
      Therefore, even before the registration is completed, the first buyer -
      quasi owner can sell the property to another, second buyer. However
      there is a risk if the final registration of the first buyer - quasi owner is
      not allowed. In that case he will be liable for damage towards the second
      buyer. In practice the other contractual party will probably not be willing
      to enter into the legal transactions with the person who is not the legal
      owner of the real-estate in question (or take the risk). From 2004 the
      Court no longer accepts incomplete applications. If the registration form
      contains certain deficiencies, the court will not invite the applicant to
      correct the request but will immediately dismiss the application. The
      applicant may submit a new request, which will then have a lower rank.
      This has resulted in some reduction of backlog at the Courts and has also
      led to higher demand for professional assistance with the application
      process. Furthermore, changes in 2005 entrust the Land Registry clerks
      with the authority to decide on applications, with judges deciding on
      appeals. With registration moving from a judicial process to a more
      administrative process, this is a welcome change that indicates potential
      for decreasing the amount of time for registration. Recent internal
      reorganization of the Land Books also indicates future potential for
      increased efficiency. The documentation shall include: (i) Notarized sale

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

        economy’s largest business city. For the 11

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Croatia (table 10.1)?
