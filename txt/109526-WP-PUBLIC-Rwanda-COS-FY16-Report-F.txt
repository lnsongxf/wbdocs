I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Rwanda perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Rwanda
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Rwanda
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From December 2015 to February 2016, 254 stakeholders of the WBG in Rwanda were invited
to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; CSOs/NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 400 stakeholders
participated in the survey (64% response rate).
Respondents completed the questionnaire with a representative from the fielding agency.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Rwanda; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Rwanda; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 96%, N=770). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 86).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from SPIUs and consultants working on WBG-
       supported projects were combined with employees of ministries; respondents from the
       financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
       organizations; respondents from CSOs/NGOs/community based organizations, trade
       unions, youth groups, and faith-based groups were combined in the “CSO” category; and
       the small number of respondents from the office of parliamentarian and independent
       government institutions were included in the “Other” category. There were no
       respondents from the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the previous FY’13 Survey (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 4.8; weighted mean in FY’13 = 5.5)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Rwanda, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Rwanda, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey most often

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the media had the highest mean ratings for the
       aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions, whereas respondents
       from the private sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower mean
       ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by stakeholder groups can be found
       in Appendix B (page 56).

Greatest Value

Greatest Weakness
     Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey indicated that

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Rwanda, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty three specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Rwanda. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural and agricultural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Rwanda, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural and agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Rwanda? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 746  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 231

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
