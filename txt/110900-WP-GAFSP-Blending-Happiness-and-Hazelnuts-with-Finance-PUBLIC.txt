Bhutan: Blending Happiness and
Hazelnuts with Finance
June 2016
ABOUT IFC
International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution
focused exclusively on leveraging the power of the private sector to tackle the world’s most pressing development
challenges. Working with private enterprises in more than 100 countries, IFC uses its capital, expertise and influence
to help eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.

ABOUT GAFSP
The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) invests in agriculture to reduce poverty and improve
food and nutrition security in low-income countries. GAFSP targets the entire value chain in agriculture and related
sectors through its complimentary Public and Private Sector Windows, recognizing that investments from both
public and private sectors are critical to a well-developed, resilient food system, improved agricultural productivity,
increased incomes, and the highest development impact. Our donors – Australia, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
Canada, Republic of Korea, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States – work
in partnership with recipients, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to improve the lives of smallholder
farmers and their families. Millions of poor and vulnerable people around the world will directly benefit from
GAFSP’s continued commitment and support.

ABOUT THE CASE STUDY
Expanding access to markets, financing and storage, inputs and technology for smallholder farmers is a central
element to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. This case study highlights the
developmental impact of an unusual IFC and GAFSP led investment in a semi-greenfield company in the agribusiness
sector in Bhutan.

Bhutan: Blending Happiness and Hazelnuts
with Finance


In 2015, IFC, ADB and GAFSP together invested US$12 million in Mountain Hazelnuts, a project to promote hazelnut production
by smallholder farmers across Bhutan, the land of Gross National Happiness. This unusual investment in a semi-greenfield
company with significant execution risks was IFC’s first ever in the agribusiness sector in Bhutan and was made possible with
concessional finance from the Private Sector Window of GAFSP. The project has the potential to improve the lives of 15 percent
of Bhutan’s entire population: a mountainous return on a US$6 million GAFSP investment.




BACKGROUND
On the mountains of Bhutan, where happiness is akin to holiness, a quiet agricultural
revolution is taking place. Dotted along the vertiginous Himalayan slopes are millions
of young hazelnut trees, the vision of an entrepreneurial couple, Daniel Spitzer and
Teresa Law, who dared bring commercial hazelnut production to Bhutan.

In 2010, Spitzer established Mountain Hazelnuts, a smallholder farmer-based
company designed to take advantage of the growing demand for hazelnuts from

European confectionery and snack producers in Asia. Spitzer initially planned to
build his hazelnut business in western China – where he had a proven track record
of developing large scale projects – but the devastating Sichuan earthquake of May
2008 prompted many farmers there to abandon their land to move to the cities to
work on reconstruction. At about the same time, Bhutan announced it would consider
foreign investments. Spitzer did some research and discovered that the tiny kingdom,
cradled by the Himalayas and wedged between India and China, had climate and
soil characteristics perfect for growing commercial crops of hazelnuts. Bhutanese
farmers, despite a high rate of urban migration, were well used to tending the steep               For many outside observers, the humble

of western consumers anxious to capitalize on the nut’s antioxidant qualities. Currently
Turkey and Italy grow most of the world’s hazelnut crop, used most notably in the
popular ‘Nutella’ spread. However, in recent years Turkey’s market has become
extremely volatile and a new market has opened up in Bhutan’s backyard where the
growing middle classes in China are rapidly increasing their tastes for exotic snacks.
With proximity to these two new neighbors, Mountain Hazelnuts is well positioned to
supply to this burgeoning export market.

in the company. Spitzer was well known to IFC from a previously
successful investment in one of his companies in China in the late
1990s. However a detailed appraisal and investment review meeting
that year did not materialize in an investment due to disagreements
on potential valuation and terms. At the time, Mountain Hazelnuts
had less than 3,000 farmers registered for the program and had just
begun nursery operations. However, IFC maintained contact with             The unusual partnership between a

of GAFSP. As world leaders come together to help meet the
Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty and achieve food

model to mobilize capital to meet these ambitious development
challenges. As investments like Mountain Hazelnut show, GAFSP
projects are difficult and risky but they offer a way to achieve
real impact and reach small farmers in some of the world’s most
challenging areas.

About GAFSP
The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) is a global effort that pools donor
resources to fund programs focused on increasing agricultural productivity as a way to reduce
poverty and increase food and nutrition security. GAFSP targets countries with the highest rates
of poverty and hunger. The public sector window helps governments with national agriculture
and food security plans. The private sector window, managed by IFC, and supported by the
governments of Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United
States, provides long- and short-term loans, credit guarantees, and equity to private sector
companies to improve productivity growth, deep farmers’ links to markets, and increase capacity
and technical skills.

GAFSP is also committed to helping meet the United Nations sustainable development goals
(SDGs) to end poverty and achieve food security in every corner of the globe by 2030. GAFSP
focuses exclusively on the regions and sectors where significant progress will be required to meet
several of the SDGs including: positively impacting poverty reduction (SDG-1) and meeting the
hunger and food security targets (SDG-2), gender equality (SDG-5), and climate change (SDG-
13) goals.
