2.	 Limited to financial structure: The analysis focuses only on
    evaluating the opportunity cost of alternative disaster risk
    finance strategies to finance a well-defined contingent
    liability. The analysis does not consider whether or not an
    investment should be made in the first place (that is, there
    may be wider political considerations such that a country
    is content to avoid planning and instead rely on aid from
    donors following any disaster; this is not considered in this
    report).

3.	 Financial considerations only: The focus is on the
    monetary comparisons only and does not consider other
    considerations that are more difficult to quantify, such as
    the degree to which the instrument supports or requires
    strong public financial management (for example, if a
    country holds a sizable reserve fund to cover the most
    extreme potential disasters, it may be at risk of being fully
    spent on a small disaster due to political considerations).

4.	 Source of finance: There is no discrimination on the source
    of the finance as this might come from the regional
    government, national government, or development
    partners. Only the total overall opportunity cost
    is considered.

Sensitivity Results: Varying Maximum Funding
by Finance Instrument

4.4.	 The results shown in the base case scenario are
      dependent on the amount of funding assumed to be
      available by each finance instrument. Sensitivity to
      the size of the reserve layer is demonstrated through
      examination of the total cost analysis. The results (see
      Annex X4 for details) vary intuitively as the reserve is
      adjusted, with the following key results:

     •	 Decreasing the size of the reserve fund increases the
        costs of all strategies as fewer losses are met by the
        reserves which is the most cost-effective strategy at
        lower return periods.

     •	 Increasing the size of the reserve fund decreases
        the costs of all strategies as more losses are met by
        the reserves, and is the most cost-effective strategy
        at lower return periods. If the reserve is increased
        to US$30m then Strategy A becomes the cheapest
        strategy at lower return periods.



5. Country X –
Concluding Remarks
5.1.	 The most cost-effective strategy will depend on the
      risk tolerance of policy makers. The analysis shows that
      when considering maize losses due to multiple perils,
      losses which are of a lower impact and occur more
      frequently are likely to be most cost-effectively financed
      by holding reserves.

5.2.	 Budget reallocation is assumed to have the lowest
      marginal cost at the higher loss events. However, there
      may be a limit on the extent to which government
      budgets can be reallocated. As a result, strategies
      involving insurance are likely to be attractive,
      particularly at the higher return periods when losses are
      ceded to the insurer.

      in the base case scenario, where on average it is cheaper
      to finance the cost of the relevant payouts through a
      reserve fund (with no charge applied) than to pay a pricing
      premium (through a pricing multiple) for insurance
      placement. However, when a spread is introduced such

      becomes more expensive than Strategy B.

5. Country Y –
Concluding Remarks
5.1.	 Strategy C, which includes a portion of risk retention, is
      cheapest on average due to the low or non-existent cost
      charge on the reserves required to fund the retained
      level of payout (compared to the pricing premium
      charge of placing insurance coverage).

5.2.	 The greater the diversification benefit that can be
      achieved in Strategy B and the greater the charge
      (spread) on the reserves held for Strategy C, the lower
      the payouts at which Strategy B will become the most
      cost-effective strategy. This likely happens at some
      point between payouts at the 1 in 3 year and the 1 in 5
      year return period.

5.3.	 The most cost-effective strategy will depend on the
      risk tolerance of policy makers. If the focus is on losses
      at lower return periods, or a long-term average cost,
      retaining a layer of payouts as in Strategy C may be the
      optimal choice. For increasingly greater payouts and
      when considering catastrophic tail risk, Strategy B is
      likely the most cost-effective strategy beyond the 1 in 5
      year payout.

      dependent on the amount of funding assumed to be
      available by each financial instrument. Sensitivity to the
      size of the layers is demonstrated through examination
      of the total cost analysis. The results (see Annex Z4
      for details) vary intuitively as the amounts available
      from each financial instrument are adjusted, with the
      following key results:

     •	 Increasing the amount of financing available from
        reserve and budget instruments reduces the cost at
        higher return periods because fewer finance costs
        are met by budget reallocation and post-disaster
        debt, which are typically more expensive.

     •	 Decreasing the exhaustion point (maximum loss
        covered) of insurance demonstrates that at higher
        return periods, post-disaster debt is now required,
        hence increasing the total cost.

In some circumstances it may be appropriate to make
different assumptions depending on the source of funds, for
example, if some parts of government or some development
partners are able to offer budget reallocations at lower
opportunity cost than others. However, typically it may
be reasonable to set assumptions that are neutral to the
source of the funding – that is, such that they could apply to
funding from the government or from external development
partners.

Figure AV1.1 demonstrates the cumulative distribution function of the costs associated with supporting food insecure
households in districts across the country affected by drought. This cumulative distribution function of the contingent
liability demonstrates a long tail of extreme potential losses.

The sensitivity of the assumed loss distribution is considered further in Annex V4 and the alternative loss distributions
considered are also shown in Figure V1.1.

Annex V2 – Assumptions
Reserve fund assumptions (all strategies)

Under all strategies, initial losses are retained through a reserve fund. The base case assumes that the reserve fund is
assumed to be equal to US$50m, which is equal to a 1 in 1.3 year event.

The cost of reserve funds reflects the assumption that Country V has to borrow to fund the reserves and has to pay interest
on the amount borrowed. While this is offset by the investment returns achieved on the reserves, the investment returns are
typically assumed to be lower than the borrowing rate. The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of reserve
fund are therefore:
44        EVALUATING SOVEREIGN DISASTER RISK FINANCE STRATEGIES: CASE STUDIES AND GUIDANCE




•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed to fund reserve fund

•	 Investment return earned on reserve funds not used to finance costs.

The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed to fund the reserve fund is assumed to be 6.625 percent.

The reserve fund is assumed to be invested in low risk assets, hence it is assumed that the investment return earned is equal
to the borrowing rate, minus a spread of 3 percent.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate – varying this assumption does not have
a material effect on any conclusions drawn in this case study.

Post-disaster debt assumptions (all strategies)

Delay factor for post-disaster debt response: This is the impact on benefit costs due to a delay in providing response (for
example, due to reliance on slow finance instruments such as post-disaster debt). Currently this is assumed to be equivalent
to a factor of 3, such that US$1 early (immediate financing of drought losses) is equivalent to US$3 late (post-disaster debt-
financed), based on a review of literature on this topic for this country.

Insurance assumptions (Strategy B)

Strategy B assumes that insurance will start to payout once the reserve fund has been exhausted. The base case insurance
contract structure is defined as follows:

•	 Insurance Coverage: The attachment point is 1 in 1.3 year losses when the reserve fund is exhausted. The insurance layer
   is assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30 year event (equivalent to US$433.4m).

•	 Insurance Premium: The annual premium payable is US$105m for drought cover. The assumed premium was set using
   a pricing multiple of 1.35, which is representative of the drought peril insured at the time of writing this paper. Fees and
   expenses associated with insurance mechanisms are assumed to be included within the premium.

Budget reallocation assumptions (Strategy C)

Strategy C assumes that once the reserve fund has been exhausted, Country V will reallocate existing budgets to fund the
finance costs. The base case assumes that Country V is able to reallocate budgets equal to US$100m, such that, together with
the reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance costs is US$150m (equivalent to a 1 in 3.6 year event).

It is assumed that the cost of reallocating budgets is a hurdle rate of 10 percent.



Annex V3 – Sensitivity Analysis: Economic and Financial Assumptions
Marginal cost – base case scenario

Figure AV3.1 compares the marginal cost (as a multiple of expected loss in layer) for the various finance sources under the
base case assumptions. The marginal cost represents the additional cost of each risk finance instrument per unit of annual
average loss in layer, for a specific return period.

•	 The reserve fund has a marginal cost increasing in the return period due to the difference between the cost of borrowing
   funds (the interest rate) and the investment return earned on unspent reserves, which is lower. At losses at higher return
   periods, the reserve fund is less likely to be called on and therefore more likely to incur a cost of holding funds.

•	 Post-disaster debt has a cost of exactly 3 times the loss at all return periods by definition of the delay factor of 3. It is
   assumed that US$1 of aid provided early costs US$3 when the response is provided late.

•	 Insurance has a cost of 1.35, reflecting the constant assumed 1.35 insurance pricing multiple.

•	 Budget reallocation has a constant marginal cost of 1.03 under the base case scenario, representing the spread between the
   hurdle rate (10 percent) and the discount rate (6.625 percent).

The marginal cost does not reflect the limitations and budgetary constraints of various finance sources – most notably
funds available through some instruments are cost-effective but very limited. The graph implies that theoretically, budget
reallocation is most cost-effective for high finance cost return periods. However, this ignores the fact that there might be a
limit on the extent to which government budgets can be reallocated.

Where the different lines of marginal cost intersect is where one finance strategy becomes marginally more cost-effective
than another:

•	 Reserve funds are the cheapest finance instrument up the 1 in 2.1 year return period.

•	 For losses greater than the 1 in 2.1 year loss, budget reallocation is always marginally the cheapest finance instrument.

•	 Reserve funds remain the second cheapest between the 1 in 2.1 year and the 1 in 13.4 year loss, after that insurance is the
   second cheapest.

•	 Increasing the spread between the interest rate and investment return of the reserve fund increases the slope of the
   marginal cost line, such that the reserve fund becomes less cost-effective.

•	 Similarly, increasing the insurance pricing multiple increases the point at which insurance becomes marginally the least
   cost-effective strategy compared to reserve fund.

•	 Reducing the post-disaster finance delay factor shifts down the horizontal line showing the post-disaster finance cost, such
   that it is significantly cheaper.

•	 Increasing the budget reallocation hurdle rate reduces the cost-effectiveness of budget reallocation and increases the
   period over which contingency funds are the most cost-effective strategy.

Finance Instrument
Increased reserve fund coverage

Figures AV4.1 and AV4.2 show the cost of the three strategies over different return periods, assuming that the reserve fund is
increased to US$132.1m (the average loss). For the alternative finance strategies considered:

•	 For Strategy B, it is assumed that insurance still attaches after the reserve fund and is assumed to cover losses up to the
   1 in 30 year event.

•	 For Strategy C, it is assumed that the government is still able to reallocate budgets equal to US$100m, such that, together
   with the reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance losses is US$232.1m (equivalent to a 1 in 7.4 year event).

•	 Increasing the reserve fund decreases the average costs for all three strategies as there are more losses met from the
   reserve fund, which is the most cost-effective strategy.

•	 Strategy B is still the cheapest, both on average and at the return periods considered. Increasing the reserve fund decreases
   the cost savings of Strategy B relative to Strategy A as there are additional losses covered by the reserve fund in both
   strategies; hence the costs under both strategies are closer.

•	 Strategy C is still cheaper than Strategy A, but the relative savings at the higher return periods are increased. This is
   because there is the same absolute cost saving (in US$ terms) between Strategies A and C.

Increased underlying contingent liability

Figures AV4.3 and AV4.4 show the cost of the three strategies over different return periods, assuming that contingent losses
are 25 percent higher. For the alternative finance strategies considered:

•	 In all strategies it is assumed that the level of reserve fund is unchanged at US$50m (note that this is exhausted in all
   simulations as the minimum loss is US$128m).

•	 Strategy B assumes that insurance still attaches after the reserve fund and is assumed to cover finance costs up to the
   higher 1 in 30 year event (which is now US$634m).

•	 Strategy C assumes that the government is still able to reallocate budgets equal to US$100m, such that, together with the
   reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance costs is US$150m (equivalent to a 1 in 1.2 year event).

•	 Increasing the contingent liabilities increases the average costs for all strategies and the costs at all return periods
   considered.

•	 The cost savings of Strategy C relative to Strategy A is reduced, particularly at higher return periods because the size of the
   layers is unchanged and hence more losses are covered by post-disaster debt.

Decreased underlying contingent liability

Figures AV4.5 and AV4.6 show the cost of the three strategies over different return periods, assuming that contingent losses
are 25 percent lower. For the alternative finance strategies considered:

•	 In all strategies it is assumed that the size of the reserve fund is unchanged at US$50m (equivalent to a 1 in 5.2 year event).

•	 Strategy B assumes that insurance still attaches after the reserve fund and is assumed to cover finance costs up to the
   lower 1 in 30 year event (which is now US$233m).

•	 Strategy C assumes that the government is still able to reallocate budgets equal to US$100m, such that, together with the
   reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance costs is US$150m (equivalent to a 1 in 14.5 year event).

•	 Decreasing the contingent liabilities decreases the average costs for all strategies at all return periods considered.

•	 Strategy B is still the most cost-effective strategy on average and at higher return periods.

•	 At lower return periods, Strategy B is more expensive than Strategy A. This is because at these low return periods, losses
   are met from the reserve fund. However the insurance premium is still payable.

•	 The cost savings of Strategy C relative to Strategy A is reduced at lower return periods and on average. This is because at
   these low return periods, losses are met from the reserve fund and hence the costs are identical under Strategies A and
   C. At higher return periods, the cost savings of Strategy C is more pronounced as a higher share of the loss is met from
   budget reallocation.

Annex W2 – Assumptions
Reserve fund assumptions (all strategies)

Under all strategies, initial intial losses are retained through a reserve fund. The base case assumes that the reserve fund is
assumed to be equal to US$100m, which is equal to a 1 in 2.3 year event.

The cost of reserve funds reflects the assumption that Country W has to borrow to fund the reserves and has to pay interest
on the amount borrowed. While this is offset by the investment returns achieved on the reserves, the investment returns are
typically assumed to be lower than the borrowing rate. The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of reserve
fund are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed to fund reserves
EVALUATING SOVEREIGN DISASTER RISK FINANCE STRATEGIES: CASE STUDIES AND GUIDANCE
                                                                                                                           53
•	 Investment return earned on reserve not used to fund the losses.

The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed to fund the reserves is assumed to be 13 percent.

The fund is assumed to be invested in low risks assets, hence it is assumed that the investment return earned is equal to the
borrowing rate, minus a spread of 10 percent.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate – varying this assumption does not have
a material effect on any conclusions drawn in this case study.

Post-disaster debt assumptions (all strategies)

Delay factor for post-disaster debt response: This is the impact on benefit costs due to a delay in providing response (for
example, due to reliance on slow finance instruments such as post-disaster debt). Currently this is assumed to be equivalent
to a factor of 3, such that US$1 early (immediate financing of response costs) is equivalent to US$3 late (post-disaster debt-
financed). A factor of 3 is assumed in line with recent World Bank research.

Insurance assumptions (Strategy B)

Strategy B assumes that insurance will start to pay out once the reserve fund has been exhausted. The base case insurance
contract structure is defined as follows:

•	 Insurance Coverage: The attachment point is the 1 in 2.3 year losses when the reserve fund is exhausted. The insurance
   layer is assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30 year event.

•	 Insurance Premium: The annual premium payable is US$101.7m for flood cover. The assumed premium was set using
   a pricing multiple of 1.5, which is representative of the flood perils insured at the time of writing this paper. Fees and
   expenses associated with insurance mechanisms are assumed to be included within the premium.

Contingent credit assumptions (Strategy C)

Strategy C assumes that Country W has contingent credit arrangements to provide immediate liquidity in the aftermath of a
flood event.

It is assumed that Country W can secure contingent credit of up to a maximum of US$100m, set equal to the reserve fund
maximum for easier comparison.

To derive the opportunity cost of contingent credit, it is assumed that Country W would otherwise have to borrow the
amount of the line of contingent credit from the commercial market (at the government’s ex-ante borrowing rate) in order to
finance the same portfolio of expenditures.

As a result, the opportunity cost of contingent credit depends not only on the assumed contingent credit interest rate but
also the spread between the interest rate on amounts borrowed and the contingent credit interest rate.

The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of contingent credit are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed (the ex-ante borrowing rate)

•	 The interest rate charged on contingent credit.

Contingent credit interest rates, such as catastrophe risk deferred drawdown options, are set based on a spread over LIBOR.
Based on current US$ LIBOR rates and IBRD lending rates, a contingent credit interest rate of 2.5 percent is assumed.

In addition to the contingent credit interest rate, contingent credit arrangements such as catastrophe risk deferred
drawdown options charge fees for establishing these lines of credit. For simplicity, it is assumed that there is a single front-
end fee of 0.5 percent of the maximum loan amount.



Annex W3 – Sensitivity Analysis: Economic and Financial Assumptions
Marginal cost – base case scenario

Figure AW3.1 compares the marginal cost (as a multiple of expected loss in layer) for the various finance sources under the
base case assumptions. The marginal cost represents the additional cost of each risk finance instrument per unit of annual
average loss in layer, for a specific return period.

•	 The reserve fund has an increasing marginal cost due to the difference between the cost of borrowing funds (the interest
   rate) and the investment return earned on funds held in reserves, which is lower. At higher return periods, the reserve
   fund is less likely to be called on and therefore more likely to incur a cost of holding funds.

•	 Contingent credit similarly has an increasing marginal cost due to the difference between the cost of borrowing funds
   (interest/discount rate) and the investment return earned on the amount of contingent credit unused, which is lower. This
   spread (10.5 percent being the difference between 13.0 percent and 2.5 percent) is greater than for the reserve fund and so the
   marginal cost increases more sharply.

                                                                                                                                                       55
•	 Post-disaster debt has a cost of exactly 3 times the loss at all return periods by definition of the delay factor of 3. It is
   assumed that US$1 of aid provided early costs US$3 when the response is provided late.

•	 Insurance has a cost of 1.5, reflecting the constant assumed 1.5 insurance pricing multiple.

The marginal cost does not reflect the limitations and budgetary constraints of various finance sources – most notably funds
available through some instruments are cost-effective but very limited. The graph implies insurance is most cost-effective at
high return periods.

Where the different lines of marginal cost intersect is where one finance strategy becomes marginally more cost-effective
than another:

•	 Reserves are the cheapest finance instrument up the 1 in 7 year return period.

•	 For losses greater than the 1 in 7 year loss, insurance is always marginally the cheapest financing instrument.

•	 Reserves remain the second cheapest between the 1 in 7 year and the 1 in 24 year loss, after that post-disaster debt is the
   second cheapest.

Marginal cost - sensitivities

Figure AW3.2 and AW3.3 consider the impact on the marginal cost of adjusting the following economic and
financial assumptions:

•	 Increasing (decreasing) the spread between the interest rate and investment return of the reserve increases (decreases)
   the slope of the marginal cost line, such that the reserve becomes less (more) cost-effective.

•	 Similarly, increasing the interest earned on contingent credit facilities not used to fund losses reduces the “spread” of this
   instrument, reducing the slope of this line and making contingent credit more cost-effective.

•	 Increasing the insurance pricing multiple increases the point at which insurance becomes marginally the least cost-
   effective strategy compared to reserves and contingent credit financing.

•	 Decreasing the post-disaster finance delay factor shifts down the vertical line showing the post-disaster finance cost, such
   that it becomes a more cost-effective option – if the delay factor is lower than the insurance pricing multiple, then post-
   disaster debt becomes the cheapest strategy beyond a certain return period.

Reduced insurance coverage

FIgures AW4.1 and AW4.2 show the cost of the three strategies over different return periods, assuming that the insurance
layer covers only 50 percent of the losses between the reserve fund (1 in 2.3 year return period) and the 1 in 30 year return
period loss. The remaining 50 percent is assumed to be funded by post-disaster debt.

•	 On average and at lower return periods, the total cost of Strategy B is now higher compared to Strategy C. This is because
   fewer losses are covered by insurance and more losses are covered by the more expensive post-disaster debt. On average,
   however, Strategy B is still cheaper than Strategy A.

•	 Decreasing the insurance layer shows that at higher return periods, post-disaster debt is now required, hence increasing
   the total cost of Strategy B. While it is still cheaper than the other strategies at the 1 in 30 year return period, the saving is
   not as great due to the requirement for post-disaster debt.

•	 In this sensitivity scenario, the reserve covers losses up to the 1 in 3.1 year return period and contingent credit covers
   losses between the 3.1 year and 7.2 year return period.

•	 Strategy B is still the cheapest on average and at the 1 in 5 and 1 in 30 year return periods, because the layer of losses
   financed by contingent credit (up to the 7.2 year loss) is still significantly lower than the layer of losses financed by
   insurance (up to the 30 year loss), with the remainder financed by the more expensive post-disaster debt.

•	 However, compared to the base scenario, the savings offered by Strategy B compared to Strategy A are decreased, because
   there is not as much post-disaster debt required in Strategy A (which drove up the overall cost in the base scenario).

•	 Similarly, the savings offered by Strategy C compared to Strategy A are decreased compared to the base scenario, due to
   the lower level of post-disaster debt required.

Annex X2 – Assumptions
Reserve fund assumptions (all strategies)

Under all strategies, initial losses are retained through a reserve fund. The base case assumes that the reserve fund is
assumed to be equal to US$20m, which is equal to a 1 in 2.5 year event.

The cost of reserve funds reflects the assumption that Country X has to borrow to fund the reserves and has to pay interest
on the amount borrowed. While this is offset by the investment returns achieved on the reserves, the investment returns are
typically assumed to be lower than the borrowing rate. The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of reserve
fund are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed to fund reserves
EVALUATING SOVEREIGN DISASTER RISK FINANCE STRATEGIES: CASE STUDIES AND GUIDANCE
                                                                                                                         61
•	 Investment return earned on reserve not used to fund losses.

The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed to fund the reserves is assumed to be 5 percent.

The fund is assumed to be invested in low risks assets, hence it is assumed that the investment return earned is equal to the
borrowing rate, minus a spread of 2 percent.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate – varying this assumption does not have
a material effect on any conclusions drawn in this case study.

Post-disaster debt assumptions (all strategies)

Delay factor for post-disaster debt response: This is the impact on costs due to a delay in providing response (for example,
due to reliance on slow finance instruments such as post-disaster debt). Currently this is assumed to be equivalent to a factor
of 3, such that US$1 early (immediate financing of flood losses) is equivalent to US$3 late (post-disaster debt-financed). A
factor of 3 is assumed in line with recent World Bank research.

Insurance assumptions (Strategy B)

Strategy B assumes that insurance will start to pay out once the reserve fund has been exhausted. The base case insurance
contract structure is defined as follows:

•	 Insurance Coverage: The attachment point is 1 in 2.5 year loss when the reserve fund is exhausted. The insurance layer is
   assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30 year event (equivalent to US$52.4m).

•	 Insurance Premium: The annual premium payable is US$6.7m for all perils cover. The assumed premium was set using a
   pricing multiple of 1.35, which is representative of the perils insured at the time of writing this paper. Fees and expenses
   associated with insurance mechanisms are assumed to be included within the premium.

Budget reallocation assumptions (Strategy C)

Strategy C assumes that once the reserve fund has been exhausted, Country X will reallocate existing budgets to fund the
losses. The base case assumes that Country X is able to reallocate budgets equal to US$20m, such that, together with the
reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance losses is US$40m (equivalent to a 1 in 10.7 year event).

It is assumed that the cost of reallocating budgets is 20 percent.

Marginal cost – base case scenario

Figure AX3.1 compares the marginal cost (as a multiple of expected loss in layer) for the various finance sources under the
base case assumptions. The marginal cost represents the additional cost of each risk finance instrument per unit of annual
average loss in layer, for a specific return period.

•	 The reserve fund has an increasing marginal cost due to the difference between the cost of borrowing funds (the interest
   rate) and the investment return earned on funds held in reserves, which is lower. At losses at higher return periods, the
   reserve fund is less likely to be called on and therefore more likely to incur a cost of holding funds.

•	 Post-disaster debt has a cost of exactly 3 times the loss at all return periods by definition of the delay factor of 3. It is
   assumed that US$1 of aid provided early costs US$3 when the response is provided late.

•	 Insurance has a cost of 1.35, reflecting the constant assumed 1.35 insurance pricing multiple.

•	 Budget reallocation has a constant marginal cost of 1.14 under the base case scenario, representing the spread between the
   hurdle rate (20 percent) and the discount rate (5 percent).

The marginal cost does not reflect the limitations and budgetary constraints of various finance sources – most notably
funds available through some instruments are cost-effective but very limited. The graph implies that theoretically, budget
reallocation is most cost-effective for high finance cost return periods. However, this ignores the fact that there might be a
limit on the extent to which government budgets can be reallocated.

Where the different lines of marginal cost intersect is where one finance strategy becomes marginally more cost-effective
than another:

•	 Reserves are the cheapest finance instrument up the 1 in 8.5 year return period.

•	 For losses greater than the 1 in 8.5 year loss, budget reallocation is always marginally the cheapest finance instrument.

•	 Reserves remain the second cheapest between the 1 in 8.5 year and the 1 in 19.4 year loss, after that insurance is the second
   cheapest.

•	 Increasing the spread between the interest rate and investment return of the reserve increases the slope of the marginal
   cost line, such that the reserve becomes less cost-effective.

•	 Similarly, increasing (decreasing) the budget reallocation hurdle rate increases (decreases) the marginal cost of budget
   reallocation and increases (decreases) the point to which the reserves remain the cheapest instrument.

•	 Increasing the insurance pricing multiple increases the point at which insurance becomes marginally the least cost-
   effective strategy compared to reserves and budget reallocation. In fact, increasing the multiple to 2 means that the reserve
   fund and budget reallocation always has a lower marginal opportunity cost than insurance.

•	 Increasing the post-disaster finance delay factor shifts up the horizontal line showing the post-disaster finance cost, such
   that it is now significantly more expensive than the other strategies.

Finance Instrument
Reduced reserve fund coverage

Figure AX4.1 and AX4.2 show the cost of the three strategies above over different return periods, assuming the reserve fund is
reduced to US$10m (1 in 1.4 year return period). For the alternative finance strategies considered:

•	 Strategy B assumes that insurance still attaches after the reserve fund and is assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30
   year event.

•	 Strategy B assumes that the government is still able to reallocate budgets equal to US$20m, such that, together with the
   reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance losses is US$30m (equivalent to a 1 in 5.1 year event).

•	 Decreasing the reserve fund increases the average costs for all three strategies as there are more losses met from post-
   disaster debt in Strategies A and C (which is the least cost-effective strategy) and there is an increase in the premium in
   Strategy B.

•	 Strategy B is still the cheapest, both on average and at the return periods considered. Decreasing the reserve fund increases
   the cost savings of Strategy B relative to Strategy A as the additional losses previously covered by the reserve fund are
   ceded to the insurer (at the marginal cost of the assumed insurance price multiple of 1.35), which is cheaper than the
   additional losses covered by post-disaster debt (at a marginal cost of the assumed delay factor of 3).

•	 Strategy C is still cheaper than Strategy A, but the relative savings at the higher return periods are reduced as post-disaster
   debt begins to dominate the total cost of both strategies.

Increased reserve fund coverage

Figure AX4.3 and AX4.4 show the cost of the three strategies above over different return periods, assuming that the reserve
fund is increased to US$30m (1 in 1.4 year return period). For the alternative finance strategies considered:

•	 Strategy B assumes that insurance still attaches after the reserve fund and is assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30
   year event.

•	 Strategy C assumes that the government is still able to reallocate budgets equal to US$20m, such that, together with the
   reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance losses is US$50m (equivalent to a 1 in 24.7 year event).

•	 Increasing the reserve reduces the average costs for all three strategies as there are more losses met from the reserve in all
   strategies, which is the most cost-effective strategy at lower return periods.

•	 While Strategy B is still the cheapest on average, at the 1 in 5 return period Strategy A is now more cost-effective. This is
   because the reserve is sufficient to meet 1 in 5 year events and hence the insurance is not called on but the premium is still
   payable.

•	 As in the baseline assumptions, costs at the 1 in 5 year period are higher than the average costs for all strategies. This is
   because the average loss under the assumed distribution is smaller than the 1 in 5 year loss (see Annex 1 for the assumed
   distribution of losses).

•	 At the 1 in 5 return period, the cost of Strategy A and C are identical because there is no need for budget reallocation.

•	 At higher return periods, Strategy B is still the cheapest strategy.

Annex Y1 – Underlying Contingent Liability
Figure AY1.1 represents the undiversified total payout/cost function in Strategy A. There is a discrete increase at
approximately 90 percent to a multiple of 4 times the premium. This is consistent with the fact the initial payout is triggered
at the 1 in 10 return period, which corresponds to a 90th percentile (slightly greater for some regions due to multiple events
occurring in one year). There is a plateau at payouts of 10 times the premium after approximately the 96.7th percentile
(corresponding to 1 in 30), with a step in between of 8 times the premium for years with multiple events.

Figure AY1.2 demonstrates the diversified individual distributions, summed by simulated year. Some correlation exists
between neighbouring regions, as expected, but there is an overall diversification benefit.

The pooled portfolio demonstrates an overall smoother loss function profile, with sharp increase to a total aggregate 10 times
the premium loss; that is, even the 1 in 200 loss at the 99.5th percentile is significantly lower than the maximum loss (unlike
in Figure AY1.1, where the 1 in 200 loss is also the maximum loss).

Annex Y2 – Base Case Scenario Assumptions
Economic assumptions

Initial payouts (in Strategy C) are retained through a reserve fund.

The cost of reserve funds reflects the assumption that Country Y has to borrow to fund the reserves and has to pay interest
on the amount borrowed. While this is offset by the investment returns achieved on the reserves, the investment returns are
typically assumed to be lower than the borrowing rate. The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of reserve
fund are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed to fund reserves

•	 Investment return earned on reserve not used to fund payouts.

The retained payouts are assumed to be fully capitalised; that is, the pooled facility is assumed to hold capital reserves at a
level equal to the maximum expected payout in the retained layer. For simplicity and because the focus of this case study
is on different insurance strategies, the discount rate, interest rate, and investment return are assumed to all be equal. The
simplifying result of this combination of assumptions is that the cost of financing the retained payouts is equal to the costs
occurred in the retained layer, with no cost charged on the capital reserves held in excess of the loss incurred.

Risk transfer assumptions

Under Strategy A the average insurance pricing multiple based on the individual insurance contracts is 1.64 (determined
based on the premium divided by the average annual loss).
70        EVALUATING SOVEREIGN DISASTER RISK FINANCE STRATEGIES: CASE STUDIES AND GUIDANCE




Two key assumptions were made in comparing the insurance price of Strategies B and C:

•	 Diversification benefit (Strategy B): The diversification benefit that can be achieved by moving from Strategy A to Strategy
   B and pooling the risks of all regions

•	 Reinsurance pricing (Strategy C): The (re)insurance pricing multiple applied to excess losses in Strategy C.

Strategy B diversification benefit

Based on a pool of the cumulative underlying risk, the resulting cumulative distribution function (CDF) follows a smoother
distribution (than the individual risks) and there is a diversification benefit arising from the pooling of all risks. This is
demonstrated in Figure AY1.2 in Annex Y1.

With the evidence that a diversification benefit exists, assumptions were made about the size of this benefit (that is, the
discount on premiums charged) through consideration of the following metrics:

•	 The insurance pricing multiple (premium divided by average annual loss)

•	 The implied risk volatility loading to demonstrate the premium charged to compensate for the level of volatility in the
   underlying losses (see Glossary).

Strategy A assumes a summation of all CDFs across all regions and perils with no diversification benefit (see Figure AY1.1 in
Annex Y). Strategy B has an inherent diversification benefit incorporated, as it is summing across 13 regions by simulated
year rather than by CDF ranked from best scenario (no losses) to worst scenario (maximum payout for each region). Some
correlation exists between neighbouring regions, as expected, but there is an overall diversification benefit (see Figure AY1.2
in Annex Y1). Therefore, as a starting point, comparing Strategy B with Strategy A, it is intuitively expected that:

•	 The risk volatility loading to be higher: This is because Strategy A would have a relatively high standard deviation value
   due to the nature of the defined payouts being a step function with a more extreme maximum than any pooled loss
   distributions in Strategies B. A relatively greater standard deviation value would result in a relatively lower risk volatility
   loading base amount.

•	 The pricing multiple to be lower, due to the diversification benefit achieved in Strategy B.


The initial parameter for the diversification benefit from Strategy B was set as 10 percent:

•	 It is evident that there should be some level of diversification, but without real-time market pricing insight it is difficult to
   set an initial parameter. Ten percent was chosen for simplicity and to demonstrate the difference in cost between Strategy
   A and B.

•	 It is intuitive that any diversification benefit greater than 2.5 percent (which is the additional fee charged for pooling) will
   result in Strategy B being more cost-effective.

•	 While this approach may not be robust enough for market pricing purposes, it is sufficient for the purposes of the
   evaluation of the finance strategies in this case study and will allow us to reach a reasonable conclusion, keeping the
   limitation on parameter robustness in mind.

Strategy C pricing multiple

The resulting assumption for the pricing multiple in Strategy C was set based on a reasonable level of the risk volatility
loading compared to Strategy B. The pricing multiple is expected to be greater in Strategy C than Strategy B due to the higher
layer of risk being written and the greater volatility in the layer.

A summary of the base case scenario assumptions and diagnostics are outlined in Table AY2.2.

Market and administration fees

There are fees assumed to be placed on the risk transfer mechanisms:

•	 Strategy B and C both have a 2.5 percent market fee charged on the premium for the layer placed in the insurance market.

•	 Strategy C has a 5 percent administrative fee charged on the retained layer.




Annex Y3 – Sensitivity Analysis
The analysis considered sensitivities to key assumptions as follows:

•	 Strategy B diversification benefit: increase from 10 percent to 20 percent

•	 Strategy C insurance pricing multiple: reduce from 2.0 to 1.47

•	 Strategy C economic assumptions relevant to the risk retention: increase the spread (between the interest rate and
   investment return) from 0 percent to 5 percent.

For the first two sensitivities, the insurance pricing assumptions are considered, in Table AY3.1 were considered which
decrease the cost of insurance premiums in both Strategy B and C, as outlined by the resulting pricing multiples in Table
AY3.1.

For the third sensitivity, the following dynamics with the economic assumptions apply:

•	 Increasing the discount rate and/or decreasing the investment rate (that is, increasing the spread between the investment
   rate and the discount rate) will increase the cost. To demonstrate this, a spread of 5 percent (such that the discount rate is
   5 percent higher than the investment rate) is assumed.

Additional parameters and sensitivities that have not been considered are outlined in Table AY3.2.

Annex Z1 – Contingent Liability
Figure AZ1.1 demonstrates the cumulative distribution function of the public capital losses relating to tropical cyclone
damage. This cumulative distribution function of the contingent liability demonstrates a long tail of extreme potential losses,
which is the nature of catastrophic tropical cyclone exposure. It is the same shape as the underlying total tropical cyclone
losses (the losses are just a 30 percent proportion of total tropical cyclone losses).

Public capital losses have been capped at the 1 in 50 year return period (approximately US$300m or 2.5 percent of GDP).
Losses beyond this magnitude are assumed to require significant donor support in any finance strategy – the cost of this
donor support would be consistent for all strategies and is excluded from this analysis.

Annex Z2 – Assumptions
Reserve fund assumptions (all strategies)

Under all strategies, initial losses are retained through a reserve fund. The base case assumes that the reserve fund is
assumed to be equal to 0.2 percent of GDP, which is broadly equivalent to a 1 in 6 year event.

The cost of reserve funds reflects the assumption that Country Z has to borrow to fund the reserves and has to pay interest
on the amount borrowed. While this is offset by the investment returns achieved on the reserves, the investment returns are
typically assumed to be lower than the borrowing rate. The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of reserve
fund are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed to fund reserves

•	 Investment return earned on reserve not used to fund finance costs.

The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed to fund the reserves is assumed to be 6.75 percent, which is the yield on long-
term bonds issued by Country Z in US$.

The fund is assumed to be invested in low risk assets, hence it is assumed that the investment return earned is equal to the
borrowing rate, minus a spread of 3 percent.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate – varying this assumption does not have
a material effect on any conclusions drawn in this case study.

Post-disaster debt assumptions (all strategies)

All strategies assume that large losses (that is, those that exhaust the additional financial instruments described below)
are met by post-disaster debt issued by Country Z. A post-disaster debt delay factor of 18.44 percent is assumed based on
assumptions that:

•	 Emergency public losses account for 23 percent of losses.

•	 The internal rate of return for emergency public losses is 40 percent.

•	 The internal rate of return for non-emergency public losses is 12 percent.

•	 There is a one-year delay in building both emergency and non-emergency reconstruction.

Insurance assumptions (Strategy B)

Strategy B assumes that insurance will start to pay out once the reserve fund has been exhausted. The base case insurance
contract structure is defined as follows:

•	 Insurance Coverage: The attachment point is 1 in 6 year loss when the reserve fund is exhausted. The insurance layer is
   assumed to cover losses up to the 1 in 30 year event.
EVALUATING SOVEREIGN DISASTER RISK FINANCE STRATEGIES: CASE STUDIES AND GUIDANCE
                                                                                                                           75
•	 Insurance Premium: The annual premium payable is US$23.5m for tropical cyclone cover. The assumed premium was set
   with consideration of the following metrics:

     •	 The pricing multiple (premium divided by annual average loss)

     •	 The implied risk volatility loading to demonstrate the premium charged to compensate for the level of volatility in
        the underlying losses (see Glossary).

The base case assumes a constant risk volatility loading of 25 percent. For the assumed attachment point and layer, this is
equivalent to a pricing multiple of 1.85. It should be noted that if the risk volatility loading is assumed to be constant then the
equivalent pricing multiple increases (decreases) as the assumed attachment point increases (decreases) and the assumed
layer decreases (increases). This is because the volatility of insured losses increases as the attachment point increases, and
hence insurers charge a higher premium for the extra volatility.

Fees and expenses associated with insurance mechanisms are assumed to be included within the premium.

Budget reallocation assumptions (Strategy C)

Strategy C assumes that once the reserve fund has been exhausted, Country Z will reallocate existing budgets to fund the
losses. The base case assumes that Country Z is able to reallocate budgets equating to 0.8 percent of GDP, such that, together
with the reserve fund, the maximum budget available to finance losses is 1 percent of GDP (roughly equivalent to a 1 in 17
year event).

It is assumed that the cost of reallocating budgets is 37 percent, based on economic modelling.

Contingent credit assumptions (Strategy D)

Strategy D assumes that Country Z has contingent credit arrangements to provide immediate liquidity in the aftermath of a
tropical cyclone event.

It is assumed that Country Z can secure contingent credit of up to a maximum of US$30m, which is approximately 0.25
percent of GDP, consistent with current World Bank arrangements.1

To derive the cost of contingent credit, it is assumed that Country Z would otherwise have to borrow the amount of the line
of contingent credit from the commercial market (at the government’s ex-ante borrowing rate) in order to finance the same
portfolio of expenditures.

As a result, the cost of contingent credit depends not only on the assumed contingent credit interest rate but also the spread
between the interest rate on amounts borrowed and the contingent credit interest rate.

The economic assumptions required for calculating the cost of contingent credit are therefore:

•	 Discount rate used to discount costs incurred in the future into present day terms

•	 Interest rate on amounts that are borrowed (the ex-ante borrowing rate)

•	 The interest rate charged on contingent credit.

Contingent credit interest rates, such as catastrophe risk deferred drawdown options are set based on a spread over LIBOR.
Based on current US$ LIBOR rates and IBRD lending rates, a contingent credit interest rate of 2.5 percent is assumed.

In addition to the contingent credit interest rate, contingent credit arrangements such as catastrophe risk deferred
drawdown options charge fees for establishing these lines of credit. For simplicity, a single front-end fee of 0.5 percent of the
maximum loan amount is assumed.



Annex Z3 – Sensitivity Analysis: Economic and Financial Assumptions
Marginal cost – base case scenario

Figure AZ3.1 compares the marginal cost (as a multiple of expected loss in layer) for the various financial instruments under
the base case assumptions. The marginal cost represents the additional cost of each risk finance instrument per unit of
annual average loss in layer, for a specific return period.

•	 The reserve fund has an increasing marginal cost due to the difference between the cost of borrowing funds (the interest
   rate) and the investment return earned on funds held in reserves, which is lower. For losses at higher return periods, the
   reserve fund is less likely to be called on and therefore more likely to incur a cost of holding funds.

•	 Contingent credit similarly has an increasing marginal cost due to the difference between the cost of borrowing funds
   (interest/discount rate) and the investment return earned on the amount of contingent credit unused, which is lower. This
   spread (4.25 percent being the difference between 6.75 percent and 2.5 percent) is greater than for the reserve fund and so
   the marginal cost increases more sharply.

                                                                                                                          77
•	 Post-disaster debt has a cost of 1.18 times the loss at all return periods.

•	 Budget reallocation has a constant marginal cost of approximately 1.30 under the base case scenario, with 30 percent being
   approximately the spread between the hurdle rate (37 percent) and the discount rate (6.75 percent).

•	 The marginal cost for insurance is derived from the change in insurance premium that results from insurance attaching
   US$1 higher. Attaching insurance at a higher return period increases the marginal cost of insurance (note that the
   unsmooth curve of the insurance marginal cost is a result of the number of simulations used). This is because a constant
   risk volatility loading is assumed and as the attachment point increases, the uncertainty in the loss increases. When
   expressed relative to the loss amount, it is therefore cheaper for insurance to attach at a lower level.

The marginal cost does not reflect the limitations and budgetary constraints of various financial instruments – most notably
funds available through some instruments (for example, contingent credit) are cost-effective but very limited. The graph
implies post-disaster debt is most cost-effective for high loss return periods.

Where the different lines of marginal cost intersect is where one finance strategy becomes marginally more cost-effective
than another:

•	 Reserves are the cheapest finance instrument up the 1 in 7.6 year return period.

•	 For losses greater than the 1 in 7.6 year loss, post-disaster debt financing is always marginally the cheapest
   finance instrument.

•	 Reserves remain the second cheapest between the 1 in 7.6 year and the 1 in 11.1 year loss, after that budget reallocation is
   the second cheapest.

•	 Beyond the 1 in 5 year, insurance and contingent credit are marginally the most expensive finance instruments (assuming
   that insurance attaches at these higher return periods).

Note that the last bullet may at first sight appear inconsistent with Figure Z3.4, which shows that at higher return periods,
Strategy B (insurance) is the cheapest strategy. This is because the marginal cost presented in Figure AZ3.1 assumes that
insurance attaches at the return period shown on the x-axis.

In our baseline assumptions, Strategy B assumes that insurance attaches at the 1 in 6 year loss. As a result, Strategy B ‘locks
in’ the marginal cost of insurance at the 1 in 6 year level, which is much lower. Or alternatively, Figure AZ3.1 demonstrates
that it is much more cost-effective for insurance to attach at lower return periods.

Marginal cost - sensitivities

Figures AZ3.2, AZ3.3 and AZ3.4 consider the impact on the marginal cost of adjusting the following economic and
financial assumptions:

•	 Increasing (decreasing) the risk volatility loading decreases (increases) the point at which insurance becomes marginally
   the least cost-effective strategy.

•	 Increasing the post-disaster finance delay factor shifts up the horizontal line showing the post-disaster finance cost, such
   that it becomes a less cost-effective option.

•	 Reducing the interest rate charged on contingent credit investment return increases the slope of the marginal cost line,
   such that contingent credit becomes less cost-effective.

•	 Increasing the fee to 2 percent of the contingent credit maximum, increases the marginal cost slightly, such that
   contingent credit becomes less cost-effective.

•	 Decreasing the insurance layer shows that at higher return periods, post-disaster debt is now required, hence increasing
   the total cost of Strategy B. While it is still cheaper than the other strategies at higher return periods, consistent with the
   base case scenario results, the saving is not as great due to the requirement for post-disaster debt.

•	 On average and at lower levels of losses, the total cost of Strategy B is now lower compared to the base case scenario as the
   premium has reduced. On average, Strategy B is still the most expensive (consistent with the base case scenario).

•	 At the 1 in 10 year return period Strategy B becomes more cost-effective strategy (contrary to the base case scenario where
   Strategy D was cheapest at this level of loss) since losses are fully covered up to the 1 in 10 year loss, but the premium is
   lower than the base case scenario premium (due to the overall reduced coverage).

•	 In this sensitivity scenario, the average costs of Strategies A, C, and D increase slightly. This is because losses up to the 1
   in 11 year return period are met by reserve funds which become marginally more expensive than post-disaster debt beyond
   the 1 in 7.6 year loss (see Figure AZ3.1).

•	 The average cost of strategy B reduces slightly, because there is a reduction in the premium payable, due to the higher
   attachment point (though this is partially offset by the higher equivalent pricing multiple that results from the assumed
   constant risk volatility loading).

•	 At the 1 in 10 year return period, the cost of Strategies A and C are identical because losses are met by reserve funds
   in both strategies. Although losses are also met by reserve funds in Strategies B and D, the cost is higher due to the
   contingent credit arrangement fee and insurance premium. For Strategy D, the difference is small; however, for Strategy B,
   the insurance premium means the cost is 42 percent higher than Strategy A.

•	 At the higher return periods, Strategy B continues to be the most cost-effective; however the cost savings of Strategy B
   relative to Strategy A are reduced. This is because losses up to the 1 in 11 year return period are met by reserve funds,
   which become marginally more expensive, and because it is less cost-effective to attach insurance at a higher level.

Glossary
Average                A number expressing the central or typical value in a set of data. In this report, average refers to
                       the mean, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the values in the set by the number of values
                       (data points) in the set.
Average Annual         The average (mean) annual loss to a layer, calculated by summing all losses above the layer
Loss                   minimum and below the layer maximum in the relevant simulations and dividing by the total
                       number of simulations.
Budget                 The release of resources originally designated for a different purpose to cover costs associated
reallocation           with financing losses due to disasters considered.
Capital reserves       The funds held in respect of a potential contingent liability, typically held by insurers or any party
                       taking on an element of risk.
Contingent credit      Financing credit available from a source to a recipient which is contingent on a trigger (for
                       example, a natural disaster occurring), and for which the recipient pays a set-up fee as a
                       percentage of the total credit available.
Contingent liability   A potential payment obligation that may be incurred depending on the outcome of a future event.
Cost / Opportunity     The cost of an alternative use of the finance that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain
cost                   strategy. Throughout this report, references to cost imply opportunity cost.
Delay factor           The assumed cost increase due to delayed response. A delay factor of 1.5 corresponds to a
                       situation where delayed response of US$1.50 has the same impact as US$1 of fast response cost.
                       This delay factor is applied to financial or budgetary instruments assumed to be slow in situations
                       where slow response is less cost-effective than fast response.
Ex-ante                Before an event – based on forecast results rather than actual results. For example, the ex-ante
                       investment return is the expected return on an investment portfolio.
Ex-post                Subsequently to an event – based on actual results rather than forecast results. For example, the
                       ex-post investment return is the known investment return that was achieved on an investment
                       portfolio.
Hurdle rate            Rate of return on foregone investments, specifically considered in the context of budget
                       reallocation. This rate is also used to calculate the (opportunity) cost of the insurance premiums
                       that will need to be paid by government or development partners.
Insurance (risk        An arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for
transfer product)      specified loss in return for payment of a specified premium.
Insurance              The trigger point at which insurance will start to pay, for example an insurance attachment of
attachment             US$5m, means that losses that are smaller than US$5m would not trigger a payout from the
                       insurance contract.
Insurance              The maximum point to which insurance will cover losses, for example, phrased as up to the 1 in 30
exhaustion             year loss or up to a loss of US$100m.

Marginal cost       The additional average opportunity cost of each risk finance instrument (such as, insurance) per
                    unit of annual average loss, for losses at a specific return period.
Opportunity cost    The cost of an alternative use of the finance that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain strategy.
Parametric          A type of insurance that does not indemnify the pure loss (that is, the pure response costs
insurance           incurred), but ex ante agrees to make a payment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. This is
                    common for natural disaster insurance where the trigger might be the severity of a windstorm or
                    the magnitude of an earthquake on a Richter scale.
Pricing multiple                                 Premium

                                         Average Annual Loss
                    A factor applied to expected losses by an insurance company to determine the premium required
                    for the insured risk. This factor would reflect the cost of capital and expense costs of the insurance
                    company.
Return period (of   An indication of the likelihood of an event occurring; a recurrence interval demonstrating how
loss)               frequently an event is expected to occur.

                    For example, an event or a loss with a return period of 5 years is statistically expected to recur
                    every 5 years on average over an extended period of time (or has a 20 percent probability of
                    occurrence).
Risk finance        A set of finance instruments combined to provide funds to cover the financial effect of potential
strategy            losses.
Risk volatility                                 Premium charged - Average Annual Loss
loading             Risk volatility loading =
                                                      Standard deviation of loss

                    The factor applied to the chosen measure of risk (in this case the standard deviation) by the party
                    accepting the risk (in this case insurers), in a set of simulated losses.
