A. Summary of Proposed Changes
This restructuring paper seeks the approval from the Country Director to introduce the following changes
in the Ethiopia Promotion of Basic Services Program 3, P128891 and associated MDTF, as well as any
accompanying amendments to the project’s legal documents. The proposed changes seek to: (i)
Reallocate funds under the Mutli Donor Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TF013952) and to change overall
grant allocation (ii) Extend the current closing date by for IDA 51620 from 07 January 2018 to 07 January
2019 and for TF 13952 from 31 Dec 2017 to 31 December 2018.

As a result of the project extension the Multi Donor Trust Fund (TF013592) end disbursement date will be
changed to 30 June 2019. This will be reflected in the revised Administrative Agreements with DFID and
the EU.

The reallocation of funds under the MDTF takes into account DFID reductions for Sub-program A, as well
as a need to update overall grant financing for Sub-program B in line with original commitments under the
Project Appraisal Document. A summary of the revised Grant Schedule for the MDTF is outlined in
Section C.

A twelve month closing date extension for IDA 51620 and TF 13952 is required to enable the PBS III
operation run side by side with the proposed new Program for Results on Equitable Access to Basic
Services (P151432). This proposed P for R will replace IDA’s support for sub- component A under PBS
3. The closing date extension is devised as a zero cost extension for Development Partners and will enable
the Program for Results operation to benefit from the technical and system strengthening support granted
through subcomponent B of the PBS III program. It also enables continuity of the PBS Secretariat, which
is expected to play an important role in verification of Disbursement Linked Indicators and ongoing
technical support to the client.

At this time of project restructuring it is noted Sub-program C, the Results Enhancement Fund, is dropped
from the overall program. This does not affect the overall Financing or Grant agreement, as provisions for
this component were on a pilot basis by DFID and not reflected in financing or grant agreements, not in the
project Results Framework.

It is further noted that for both IDA 51620 and TF 13592 there are no overdue audit reports or interim

B. Project Status
PBS 3 contributes to the higher-level objective of expanding access and improving the quality of basic
services by funding block grants that ensure adequate staffing and operations, and by strengthening the
capacity, transparency, accountability and financial management of governments at the regional and local
authorities levels. The program defines basic services as education, health, agriculture, water supply and
sanitation and rural roads A nationwide program, PBS supports through the block grants woreda-level
recurrent expenditures for basic services across the country, excluding Addis Ababa, which does not
receive a federal block grant. In addition, the capacity building efforts of the program benefit the quality
of local government services for Addis Ababa as well. As such, its beneficiaries include the population of
Ethiopia. Thus, the program beneficiaries number 84 million of which 42.6 million (50.4 percent) are
males and 41.8 million are females (49.6 percent).



                                                                                                Page 6 of 12
The third Joint Review of Implementation and Support (JRIS) mission of PBS III took place from May
12-15, 2014, and reported an overall satisfactory outcome and resulted in an IDA disbursement of $92
million (DA) and $35 Million (Trust Fund). During PBS 3 the Government’s strong commitment to
decentralized service delivery has been maintained, with sustained progress in basic service spending
rising to 69 percent at sub-national levels.

PBS 3 maintains a particular focus on enhanced results, especially to ensure access and quality of basic
services. Examples of progress against the High-Level Indicators between 2011/12 to 2012/13 are as
follows:

• Primary school completion rates (Grade 8) show ongoing improvement, reaching 52.8 percent in
2013, showing a marginal improvement over last year (52.1 percent). Male completion rates have reached
53.3 percent while females are at 52.2 percent.
• Net primary enrolment (Grades 1-8) remained high at 85.7 percent (virtually unchanged over the last
two years), with a gap between girls’ vs. boys’ enrolment of 3.6 percent.
• The percentage of children vaccinated against DPT3 reached 87.6 percent in 2013, up from almost 85
percent the previous year.
• Ante-natal service (ANC 1) coverage has improved, with the number of pregnant women receiving
antenatal care during their first visit to a health provider rising from 89 percent last year to 97.4 percent in
2013.
• Based on revised data from the National Wash Inventory, national water supply coverage increased
from 58 percent to just 68.4 percent in the same period, reflecting an increase in both rural and urban
coverage.
• Agricultural productivity (major cereal crops) rose from 17 quintal/hectare last year to 17.8.
• The average travel time to an all-weather road has declined from 2.9 to 2.1 hours.

Examples of progress against PDO Level Results Indicators between 2011/12 to 2012/13 include:

• the national student-teacher ratio improved from 50:1 to 49:1;
• the share of qualified primary school teachers increased from 60.6 to 64.7 percent, with women
slightly outpacing men;
• the ratio of health extension workers to population deteriorated slightly from 1:2170 to 1:2334
(during which time the estimated national population grew from approximately 82.7 to 84.8 million);
• agricultural extension beneficiaries grew from 10.51 to 11.66 million households;
• the share of malfunctioning water points fell from 24 to 17.2 percent;
• the percentage of rural roads in fair and/or good condition grew from 86 to 90 percent;
• the number of woreda road desks with qualified/appropriate staff has remained unchanged since last
year at 500;
• the number of Development Agents deployed grew to 3201 in 2012/13, up from 2669 the previous
year. While promising, this is well below the government’s target of 9000 for 2012/13.
The project enjoys solid implementation , with a number of ongoing priorities and achievements currently
being pursued including :
 in an effort to improve budget utilization within Sub-program B, project procurement has shown
    remarkable progress in the last few months in which about 85% of the procurement activities were
    initiated and the majority reached contract signing and implementation stage.
 The Managing for Results sub-component (B3) is under active attention to enhance its performance
    and outputs, with a number of initiatives underway including enhanced supervision, workplan
    reviews, consultation workshops and engagement with sectors.
 work is on progress in the PBS Secretariat to develop communication strategy around PBS III

The team has finalized PCN review for Program for Result operation (Equitable Basic Services) which
will build on the successes of the PBS program. The PforR operation replaces IDA’s support for
Sub-component A (Block Grant) which will run out in FY15 while IDA’s support for sub component B
and DP’s support for the program will continue till the end of the program period.
PBS III is almost two years under implementation, and entering a Mid Term Review.




C. Proposed Changes:
Reallocation of Grant Funds and Change to Overall Grant Amount:

The reallocation of funds under the MDTF takes into account DFID reductions for Sub-program A, as well
as a need to update overall grant financing for Sub-program B in line with original commitments under the
Project Appraisal Document.

On July 14, 2014 DFID communicated to the World Bank Group its decision to reduce its support to PBS
3. This reduction of support included £71.5 million for Sub Program A (Basic Service Block Grants),
which directly affects the grant agreement. The reduction of DFID support represents a small - albeit
significant - share of overall program financing. During project preparation, PBS III was estimated to cost
$6.385 billion, with approximately 97% devoted towards Sub-program A (Basic Services Block Grant)
which finances recurrent expenditure in the basic services at local level. The reduction of support for
Sub-program A will be in a tapered fashion, so as to minimize negative impacts and enable Government to
fill the financing gap. It is important to note the Government maintains a stead-fast commitment to filling
this financing gap. This is reflected under Constitutional provisions for basic service delivery. Article
90.1 of the constitution reads as “To the extent the country’s resource permit, policies shall aim to provide
all Ethiopians access to public health and education, clean water, housing, food and social security.”
while article 94.1 states the responsibility on the government in bearing the financial expenditure
necessary to carry out its responsibilities and functions.

The reduction of funds for Sub-program A in the Grant Schedule is just £10.5 million. This reflects the
large exchange rate buffer that was factored into the original MDTF.

Fund allocations to Sub-program B are adjusted in line with the original Project Appraisal Document.
This readjustment is again possible owing to the large exchange rate buffer that was factored into the
original MDTF. Accordingly, the overall grant allocation is increased to $615,743,000. The consequent
changes to the Grant Schedule of the MDTF Grant Agreement are outlined in Table 1.

Annex 1 provides an update of the overall Project Financing and Costs taking into account the
Governments overall program, as well as IDA and MDTF support. The overall cost of the program is
reduced from $6.385 bto $6. 305 billion, reflecting the cancelled Results Enhancement Fund. The
financing gap for Program A is increased from $1483 to $1597 million, reflecting the reduction of support
to the Basic Services Block Grant. Overall Donor Partner commitments to PBS 3 are also reduced from
$984to 869 million
Closing Date: The team proposes extension of the closing date for IDA 51620 from 07 January2018 to 07
January 2019 and for TF 13952 from 31 Dec 2017 to 31 Dec 2018 to enable PBS III run side by side with
the proposed new project on Equitable Access to Basic Services (P151432). The new PforR operation is
designed to replace IDA’s support for PBS III sub component A (Block Grant) while it continues to
benefit from the technical assistance and system strengthening support granted through sub component B
of the PBS III program. Hence, it is important to extend the PBS III program to correspond with the life of
the PforR operation. Moreover, the proposed extension enables continuity of the PBS Secretariat during
the lifecycle of the P for R. The secretariat will play a critical role in verifying the achievement of
Disbursement Linked Indicators. This is the first project closing date extension.

In conclusion, the restructuring will have no impact on the Project development objective which remains
relevant and achievable.


Cancellation of Sub program C – Result Enhancement Fund- During PBS 3 project preparation, the
REF was initiated by DFID as an affiliated sub component to the PBS program. During PBS III
negotiation and agreement, the implementation arrangement and activities of the REF were deferred for
finalization it the course of PBS III implementation. In the course of implementation some design work
was carried out but the REF did not advance well and has now been cancelled. This was due to a reduction
in DFID’s budget to the PBS programme and a design challenge as to the complementarity of the project’s
focus to reward higher performing regions with the Government equity provisions. This sub-component
will no longer continue. The cancellation of the REF has no implications for the Grant Agreement.


Original PDO
PBS 3 will contribute to the higher-level objective of expanding access and improving the quality of basic
services by funding block grants that ensure adequate staffing and operations, and by strengthening the
capacity, transparency, accountability and financial management of sub-national governments. The
program defines basic services as education, health, agriculture, water supply and sanitation and rural
roads.
