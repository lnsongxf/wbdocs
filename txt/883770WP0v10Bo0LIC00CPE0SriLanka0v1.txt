CHAPTER 1. Main Conclusions and Recommendations
1.1 Background

The Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) conducts Country Portfolio
Evaluations (CPEs) each year with the aim of providing the GEF Council and the national
governments with an assessment of results and performance of GEF supported activities at the
country level, and of how these activities fit into the national strategies and priorities as well as
within the global environmental mandate of the GEF.CPEs enable knowledge sharing about country
level results to the benefit of the GEF Council, the participating country, and the agencies and
organizations that plan and implement GEF funded activities. CPEs are consolidated to the Annual
Country Portfolio Evaluation Report (ACPER) that the GEF Evaluation Office presents to the GEF
Council.

In line with the overall purpose of Country Portfolio Evaluations, the Joint GEF/Sri Lanka Country
Portfolio Evaluation had these objectives:
 Evaluate the effectiveness and results of completed and ongoing projects in each relevant focal
     area.
 Evaluate the relevance and efficiency of GEF support in Sri Lanka from several points of view:
     national environmental frameworks and decision-making processes, the GEF mandate and the
     achievement of global environmental benefits, and GEF policies and procedures.
 Provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its decision making process to
     allocate resources and to develop policies and strategies, (2) Sri Lanka on its participation in the
     GEF, and (3) the different agencies and organizations involved in the preparation and
     implementation of GEF support

A distinctive feature of the Joint GEF-Sri Lanka CPE was that it was jointly managed by the Sri
Lankan Ministry of Finance and Planning and the GEF Evaluation Office, through a Joint Steering
Committee (JSC). Further independent national quality assurance support was provided by the Sri
Lanka Evaluation Association, through a Peer Review Panel (PRP). A team of national consultants
supported the GEF Evaluation Office to conduct the evaluation.

GEF support to Sri Lanka was initiated during the GEF pilot phase in 1992, with the preparation of
the Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management project (GEF ID 352),
implemented by the United National Development Programme (UNDP). Up to December 2012, 14
national projects have been completed, 6 projects are being implemented while 2 more projects are
at approval stage, and 1 is at proposal stage. The national portfolio consists of 23 national projects
and 330 small grants. The total financial investment in the national projects is $396 million with GEF
funding amounting to 15% (US$60 million) and co-financing from various sources including donors
and the government amounting 85% (US$ 336 million) (Table 1.1). An equal number of projects
(nine each) have been invested in biodiversity and climate change, but in terms of financial
investment, climate change related projects have received 80% of the total budgetary allocations
largely on account of renewable energy initiatives. The national portfolio consists of 14 Full Size
Projects (FSPs), 3 Medium Size Projects (MSPs) and 6 Enabling Activities (EAs).

                                                                                                       5

In addition, Sri Lanka was involved in implementing three regional GEF FSPs (two Biodiversity and
one International Waters) and nine global projects that included one enabling activity on National
Bio-safety Framework Development, two FSPs in Biodiversity, two projects in climate change (FSP
and MSP), and one Land Degradation FSP. The available documentation does not clearly provide
details of the amount of funding for national level activities from these regional and global
initiatives.

GEF has also provided funds directly to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) under the Small Grants Programme (SGP) since 1994. The SGP has provided 330
grants amounting to US$ 9.8 million, of which GEF funding accounted for 66% (US$ 6.5 million), and
the balance 34% (US$ 3.3 million) through co-financing by the grantees. When considering the
spread of SGP projects in GEF focal areas, it is evident that the majority were Biodiversity (176), with
Multi Focal Area (57), Land Degradation (43), and Climate Change (39) projects showing the next
highest percentages. In addition to funding projects in these focal areas, GEF-SGP had funded one
capacity building project. Another 49 projects were administered by the GEF-Small Grants Programme
(SGP) office in the UNDP Country Office under special allocations from non-GEF resources: The
Community Water initiative; Climate Change Adaptation fund and UNDP additional funding for
tsunamis. The total financing of these projects amounted to US$ 1.07 million.

Eight GEF Agencies were responsible for project development and implementation at national level.
The World Bank was dominant during the first two phases, whilst the UNDP has assumed greater
prominence in GEF 5. GEF 4 had the greatest number of GEF Agencies including the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). With the conclusion of the civil war in 2009, the geographical coverage of GEF
projects extended to the Northern and Eastern parts of the country.


1.2 Objectives, scope and methodology

The methodology used in the Joint GEF-Sri Lanka CPE included several qualitative and quantitative data
collection methods and standardized analytical tools that were adapted to the Sri Lankan context.
Several sources of information from different levels (project, focal area, country and global) and from
different stakeholders (government, civil society, GEF Agencies, communities etc.) were the basis for the
evaluation.

The main scope of the CPE was the 23 national projects implemented within the boundaries of Sri Lanka.
The evaluation comprised of a desk review of all the national projects together with interviews with

                                                                                                       6
partners involved in the implementation of GEF projects in Sri Lanka, including those implementing and
receiving funds from the SGP. Although emphasis was given as per the evaluation Terms of Reference
(TORs) to the national projects, efforts have been made to gather and incorporate findings from the
regional and global projects. Specific inputs to the evaluation were the country environmental legal
framework review, the global environmental benefits assessment, the GEF – Sri Lanka portfolio
database analysis, and the Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) field studies. These documents are
provided separately in Volume 2. The ROtI analysis was carried out for three projects based on the
criteria that they were FSP or MSP projects completed at least 2 years ago covering the two main focal
areas of biodiversity and climate change and involved the two major implementing agencies – the World
Bank (WB) and the UNDP.

The evaluation was led by the GEF Evaluation Office and carried out by a national team lead by the
Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA). Based on the initial findings of the evaluation an Aide Mémoire
was developed and was distributed to stakeholders for comments. The Aide Mémoire was
presented at the national consultation workshop where it was validated. Participants to this
workshop included government representatives and other national stakeholders, including project
staff, donors and GEF Agencies.


1.3 Conclusions

1.3.1   Effectiveness and results

Conclusion 1: GEF projects in biodiversity have effectively supported actions identified by the Sri Lanka
Ministry of Environment and related Departments

Sri Lanka’s rich and unique biodiversity forms the basis for the country’s natural heritage that is linked
to its cultural legacy and economic advancement. High ecosystem diversity in the island has given rise
to a large number of indigenous species, including a remarkably high percentage of endemics among
both fauna and flora. Sri Lanka, together with the Western Ghats of India is one of the 34 global
biodiversity hotspots, recognized for high flowering plant endemism and 70% loss of its original
habitat. This indicates the globally significant nature of the biodiversity and the urgency to protect it.
As per the IUCN Red list, 571 globally threatened species are found in Sri Lanka; the majority are
plants (286), others being invertebrates (130), amphibians (56) and fish (43). Additionally, 30
mammals, 15 birds, and 11 reptiles also fall under this category.

Responding to the need for conserving the biological wealth of Sri Lanka, GEF support from the
inception has focused on biodiversity. Biodiversity projects have been linked to both the development
of action plans, as the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan prepared under the Medicinal Plants
Project (GEF ID 95) and an addendum to the action plan prepared through the Protected Area
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) as well as to overall protected
area/forest/coast management plans identified by line agencies. Several examples can be made,
including the Wildlife and Protected Areas Management Project (GEF ID 352) and the Protected Area
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) for improved protected area
management; the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) for participatory forest conservation with
communities; the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) for special area management with
community participation. GEF support has enabled attention to emerging subjects such as sustainable
use of bioresources (Medicinal Plants Project -GEF ID 95), genetic resources (Indigenous Livestock and

                                                                                                        7
Wild Relatives Project - GEF ID 1902) control of alien invasive species (Alien Invasive Species Project –
GEF ID 2472), biosafety (Biosafety Framework Project –GEF ID 875), Agro-biodiversity (Agro-
biodiversity and Climate Change Project – GEF ID 4150), and wild crops (Crop Wild Relatives Project –
GEF ID 1259). With the exception of the biosafety enabling activity, all these projects provided hands-
on experience on the topics mentioned and assisted Sri Lanka in developing national capacities.

Conclusion 2: In climate change, GEF supported activities have created an enabling environment for
renewable energy through removal of barriers and establishment of transparent tariff mechanisms,
enabling market transformation and uptake beyond GEF support

Sri Lanka is a negligible contributor to global warming. However, the island state is highly vulnerable
to the impacts of climate change, which include: increases in the frequency and intensity of disasters;
variability and unpredictability of rainfall patterns; increase in temperature; and inundation due to
rising sea levels. The degree of severity and actual impacts are being debated but there is overall
agreement that climate change – if not acted upon, can undermine the economic and social
development potential. Biomass remains the most widely used cooking fuel, while thermal power
generated through oil and coal is the largest source of electricity. The increase in fossil fuel based
energy is one of the largest climate change and development related issues for Sri Lanka.

Climate change interventions supported by GEF have largely responded to Sri Lanka’s desire to
expand electricity coverage to areas the grid could not reach. Two consecutive GEF projects, the
Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID 104) and the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic
Development Project (GEF ID 1545), which had considerable co-financing, supported an enabling
environment for renewable energy uptake through a multi-pronged approach that focused on issues
such as long-term finance, policy and tariff issues, technology and capacity, especially for solar and
small hydro schemes. The continuum between these two projects and the continued support through
the years (1997-2011) through several other projects contributed to sustaining results achieved over
time. The commercial orientation of these projects and the community organizations created have
enabled both the renewable energy policy development process and the development of further
project initiatives to continue independently after the GEF support was over. Further barriers to sell
the grid for other renewable technologies such as biomass have emerged and a new GEF initiative, the
Biomass Energy Project (GEF ID 4096) aiming to address these barriers is now in the approval stage.
Lobby groups continue to work with the authorities to improve the uptake of renewable energy
sources.

Conclusion 3: The use and incorporation of lessons from previous projects has been at best ad-hoc in the
early GEF phases; recent projects (GEF4 and later) refer to previous lessons in their design and include
budget lines for disseminating lessons both locally and internationally

Some of the project documents belonging to the earlier GEF phases refer to lessons from prior GEF
and other projects being used for the proposed concepts, approaches and management practices.
However, when looking at the use of lessons in successive project design in GEF4 and GEF5 the results
are mixed. Some positive examples include energy projects, including the Energy Services Delivery
Project (GEF ID 104); the Renewable Energy Capacity Building Project (GEF ID 425) and the Renewable
Energy for Rural Economic Development Project (GEF ID 1545), which had similar objectives and
operational continuation that built on past projects. In biodiversity, the participatory forest
management model implemented by the Department of Forest Conservation in the Rainforest Project
(GEF ID 818) was used to successfully redesign and implement the community participation

                                                                                                       8
component of the Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878), but
this was done more as a results of the transfer of knowledge via forest department staff operating in
both projects rather than having it been built into project design. The two coastal projects managed
by the Coast Conservation Department, the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) and the East
Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753) tested the Special Area Management (SAM) concept for coastal
resource management, yet taking forward the district coordinating committees had been less
successful.

The National Capacity Self-Assessment (NCSA) enabling activity (GEF ID 2417) was designed to identify
capacity needs and recommendations for the GEF focal areas of biodiversity, climate change and land
degradation, yet these recommendations were not systematically incorporated into institutional
programmes or project designs. In general, the transfer of lessons has been ad hoc and the main
reasons for this is the lack of a central repository of information for the projects, and the lack of
regular sharing of project information among executing agencies, implementing agencies as well as
with the SGP projects.

Recent projects (GEF4 and later) such as the Alien Invasive Species Project (GEF ID 2472), the Biomass
Energy Project (GEF ID 4096) and the Mainstreaming Agro-biodiversity and Climate Change Project
(GEF ID 4150) have specific activities/budgets allocated for the dissemination of lessons. They also
show cross sectoral topics (i.e. combining agriculture, land use, climate change, and energy with
biodiversity) and institutional links that may lead to greater sharing of lessons in the future.

Conclusion 4: Results are mixed in relation to the effectiveness of GEF support to Sri Lanka in producing
results that last in time and continue after project completion

Only some components of the biodiversity projects have been taken forward through other projects
and regular programmes after the completion of GEF support. Examples include the use of
participatory management approaches to manage protected areas, the continuation of training
programmes, the boundary marking and setting up of electric fences, establishing medicinal plant
nurseries outside of protected areas, and the institutionalization of the national red list activities.
Biodiversity projects facilitated a greater acceptance by government field officers of participatory
management approaches to protected areas as opposed to the standard command and control
practices previously applied. This led to a corresponding improvement in the relationships between
the field officers/rangers/wardens and the community level. The Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) was a
example.

A number of projects have contributed to building technical capacity through in-country and
international training, and development of training modules for national initiatives, as for example the
Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878). This has been seen to be
an important driver in improving management capacity of organizations and more importantly of
individuals. Regular training is continued by the respective organizations and training programmes
continue to feature modules developed through the GEF supported projects (i.e. community
participation, ecotourism). However, the continuous rotation of government staff, including those
trained for specific duties such as on ecotourism to parks with no such facilities or the fact that
trained mobilisers were not retained by the department to work with the community has led to
discontinuity of some activities introduced with this project. In the case of the East Coast Tsunami
Project (GEF ID 2753) the lack of in-house technical capacity for ecosystems restoration activities
within the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) has caused a slow-down in the activities related to

                                                                                                       9
this particular component. However the project is taking steps to improve this activity by providing
training, and also using the Technical Coordinating Committee for advice.

The main outcome lasting beyond completion in climate change projects has been the focus on
renewable energy as a viable energy source for electricity generation in Sri Lanka, in particular
through the Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID 104), the Renewable Energy and Capacity
Building Project(GEF ID 425) and the Rural Renewable Energy Project(GEF ID 1545).According to the
project management unit in the Development Finance Corporation (DFCC) Bank, the Energy Service
Delivery Project (GEF ID 104) and later the Rural Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) installed
solar home schemes in 131,528 households and off-grid micro hydro systems for 7913 households,
exceeding the project targets.1 The project also supported initiatives to promote private investment
into on-grid power project, and financed 77 on-grid mini hydro systems (generating 182MWs of
power) and one wind power system (for 10 MWs of power) that are privately operated and are now
selling energy to the grid. The on-grid mini hydro and the wind plants are accepted as financially
viable by the private sector and continue to attract investments. However, a long term financing
scheme for renewable energy as operated under these two projects has not continued in any of the
commercial banks.

The renewable energy projects have contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions. The DFCC
estimates that the Rural Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) alone has reduced 2.15 million tons
of CO2 emissions. Some of the mini-hydro schemes projects are also registered in the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) indicating a contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. In terms of
reduction of emissions at the household level in off-grid energy projects (both solar and micro hydro
schemes), the contribution has been time bound. Once the households connect to the national grid
there is a tendency to move away from the renewable energy systems, largely due to the limited
power supply and maintenance issues. However, users are moving into using a more efficient energy
supply through the new grid connected electricity and not moving back to using inefficient sources
such as kerosene. Hence, this also has been a permanent change.

In terms of the micro hydro schemes, no mechanism was in place at the end of the project to continue
the use of these systems once the households were connected to the grid. These schemes were
connected post project to the grid as was done for the mini hydro schemes. The Federation of
Electricity Consumer Societies (FECS)2set up under the Rural Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545)
has been able to remove technical, social, financial and administrative barriers for grid
interconnection so that micro hydro schemes too can sell electricity to the Ceylon Electricity Board
(CEB). So far, two schemes have been connected to the main grid. Despite the project removing
market barriers and improving the transparency on the power purchase agreement, there has been a
dearth of long-term funds required to finance off-grid systems while emerging barriers are
experienced for the biomass energy projects.

   There are two hydro schemes that are mentioned throughout this report: they are mini hydro that generates
between 100KWs to 10MWof power, and micro hydro that generates less than 100 KWs of power. The mini hydro was
done on a commercial basis by the private sector, while rural homes were provided through the smaller micro hydro
systems – that are also at times referred to as village hydro systems.

  FECS is the umbrella organization for the electricity consumer societies set up under the rural renewable energy
project to manage the micro hydro systems at village level. The federation brings together 200 of these societies and
it continues to be active in the energy sector.

                                                                                                                  10
GEF SGP grants have helped to build capacity at community level and many organizations were
interested to continue with the activities initiated beyond SGP support, although finances were
scarce. The knowledge accumulated by the civil society network with SGP support has been important
in lobbying for issues related to environment at the local level. Further, some NGOs and CBOs are
being consulted by the Sri Lanka Government in relation to environmental policies and programmes
such as the Climate Change Adaptation Policy and the management of Alien Invasive Species.
However, these consultations do not take place on a regular/structured basis and reduce the
possibilities of creating better vertical linkages from policy to practice that can aid scaling up the
results achieved at local level.

Conclusion 5: GEF supported projects have not followed a gradual progression from foundational
activities to demonstration and then investment, leading to less progress toward impact after project
closure

The first GEF projects in Sri Lanka were FSPs and MSPs. Yet some of these projects such as the
Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95), the Wildlife and Protected Areas Management Project (GEF ID
352) and Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878), included
activities such as the preparation of biodiversity action plans, technical staff capacity building,
institutional development, biodiversity baseline studies, and protected area gap analysis, that are of a
foundational nature.

Later, enabling activities for Climate Change, Land Degradation, Biosafety and Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs) have been used for the preparation of policies and action plans, yet follow-up
projects and investment have not materialized. Some proposals developed in this regard – and
especially regional projects –have been dropped from GEF support. Examples include the Production
and Promotion of Neem-derived Bio-pesticides as a Viable Eco-friendly/biodegradable alternative to
POPs Pesticides in Asia and the Pacific Region Project(GEF ID 1390); the Reducing Greenhouse Gas
Emissions by Promoting Bio energy Technologies for Heat Applications Project (GEF ID 1891); the
Energy and Environmental Efficiency Improvement of Urban Transport System in Selected Asian
Countries Project(GEF ID 1997); the Development and Application of Decision-support Tools to
Conserve and Sustainably Use Genetic Diversity in Indigenous Livestock and Wild Relatives
Project(GEF ID 2125); and the Sub-regional Action Plan (Asia) for PBDEs Management and Reduction
Project(GEF ID 4879).

Several GEF projects have built on or addressed gaps in previous projects and resulted in funding
being available over a longer period of time. Examples include the Protected Area Management
Projects (GEF ID 878 and GEF ID 352); the Renewable Energy Projects (GEF ID 104and GEF ID 1545)
and a project in the pipeline, the Biomass Energy Project (GEF ID 4096). Some GEF projects linked to
other projects funded through other sources/donors, which increased continuity. An example of this
continuation is in the integrated management of coastal resources practice area, with the support of
local people through SAM planning, initiated by the CCD at Rekawa and Hikkaduwa in 1991 via the
USAID-funded Coastal Resources Management Project (CRMP). This approach was formalized in the
document “Coastal 2000: Recommendations for a Resource Management Strategy for Sri Lanka's
Coastal Region". In 2000 the GEF supported Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) looked to
implement the SAM programme for the Rekawa, Ussangoda, and Kalametiya Coastal Ecosystems (GEF
ID 802) with participation of local people, placing an emphasis on conservation of wetlands and
marine turtles. This project was then linked to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Government of
Netherlands (GON) funded CRMP that spanned from 2002 to 2005, expanding on the work done in

                                                                                                     11
SAM sites. A lot of emphasis has been given to seek external funds to support management of SAM
sites rather than providing regular government funding, which has negative implications for the
sustainability of the work carried out in these sites.

In biodiversity projects, the continuation of activities that involve communities in conservation and
help them maintaining livelihoods/environment links have had mixed results. The Forest Department
shows greater buy-in and applications of community approaches through other projects carried out
with State funds and external support. The community mobilisers recruited under the Protected Areas
Management Project and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) have been retained as education
officers and they continue to carry out activities with the communities with some earmarked public
funds for awareness and training. The same model has been applied for the AusAid funded projects
(under the Sri Lanka Australia Natural Resources Management Project - SLANRMP). Some new
initiatives have been undertaken by the Forest Department in other areas to enable community
participation in forest conservation, including the Knuckles Conservation Project through the
establishment of CBOs. In the case of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC), these types of
community activities have not spread to any other parks based on the pilot sites under the Protected
Areas Management Project and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878). Even in the pilot sites
many do not have outreach officers to continue the links with the communities on the same lines as
during the project. Links are maintained by other park officials along with their other duties. Further,
categories of project staff (i.e. the community mobilisers) trained to carry out these activities were
not absorbed into permanent cadres and this has reduced the staff strength to continue these types
of participatory approaches elsewhere. In the coastal restoration projects as well social mobilisers are
not made part of the regular work force and were only hired to execute project funded activities.

The continuation of the activities introduced by the renewable energy projects over a long time
period has enabled the strengthening of community-based organizations. Today, they are able to
lobby for policy changes and for obtaining further support, as seen with the FECS lobbying for the
connection of mini hydro to the grid. Renewable energy projects also provided training to individuals
on the topic of “demand side management of energy”, which led to the formation of several Energy
Service Companies (ESCOs) that continue providing these services and work with the Sri Lanka
Sustainable Energy Authority.

While the usual SGP grant implementation period is one year, there have been instances where
consecutive grants were provided for some initiatives to move from developing a technology or
sustainable intervention, to demonstrating it in different areas and to enhance or add value to it. One
such example was the development of a cleaner and more efficient stove and the use of subsequent
grants to work on marketing the stove and then to offer a whole kitchen unit to combat indoor
pollution. Subsequent grant funding is acceptable in the case of grants having tried to revive rush and
reed species and improve wetlands, or grants having worked on growing and marketing traditional
rice varieties, as in such cases observable changes in the environment tend to occur over a long time
period.

Conclusion 6: GEF support to Sri Lanka has had a demonstration effect in linking environmental
conservation measures with compatible sustainable livelihood and development activities

Livelihoods options have been factored into projects at different levels. In the majority of biodiversity
projects there has been at least one component for livelihoods patterns that contribute to reducing
stress on wild species and ecosystems. This was achieved by creating new jobs such as sewing, driving,

                                                                                                      12
SMEs, tourism, or improving income from existing jobs. Examples include: improving tea cultivation
techniques under the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818);setting up electric fences to prevent damages to
crops under the Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878);
establishing medicinal plant nurseries for extraction under the Medicinal Plants Project(GEF ID 95); or
creating alternative employment opportunities for egg collectors to protect marine turtles under the
Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802). Many of the livelihoods options selected by the communities
are not directly connected to the use of natural resources in the protected areas, which has had a
positive impact on the parks/reserves in terms of reduced encroachment and extraction. Promotion
of eco-tourism associated with natural resource based livelihoods has increased, but has benefitted a
small segment of the buffer zone communities living close to park/reserve entrances. These
communities can set up accommodation options for tourists more easily, or can afford a larger
investment into safari jeeps, and/or are employed as tourist guides. A negative aspect of the
livelihood activities introduced was the provision of individual loans, many of which were not
reimbursed, and have resulted in some of the CBOs having disbursed them becoming non-active after
some time. In the case of the Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID
878) some of the loans granted to individuals were particularly large.

Communities have also received benefits from group activities through the Protected Area
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) and Rainforests Project (GEF ID 818).
These activities include construction of roads or irrigation canals, or the setup of electric fences to
control wild elephant attacks, among others. Overall, the livelihood component of biodiversity
projects has helped to build relationships with the forest/park officials and can be seen as a driver in
community participation in conservation activities such as reducing encroachment, illegal activities,
involvement in maintenance of fences, clearing invasive species and reporting illegal activities
(vigilance). The relationship with the forest/park officials and vigilance is continuing today, although
not uniformly in all projects. The staff of executing agencies and community groups felt that there is a
need for introducing livelihood activities periodically in order to spread the benefits to more people,
especially among the younger generations, and to get their support for conservation.

The SGP projects have particularly focused on joining the livelihood options with sustainable
management of natural resources and as a result have contributed to conserve natural resources on a
local level. Some grants have resulted in marketable products (rush and reed products, vegetables and
treacle) while others have gained income through a change in practices (ecotourism, land use
planning and home gardens). Some of the projects have been recognized locally and internationally as
best practices (i.e. the rush and reed project and the traditional yams project). Interviewed SGP
officers in UNDP stated that around 60% of the grants can be considered as successful and lasting
beyond GEF funding, but recognized that scaling up has not yet occurred.

In the renewable energy projects the contribution to livelihoods may not be as strong as in
biodiversity ones, but nevertheless contributed to fulfill a basic need for rural communities. Impact on
livelihoods for family owned enterprises was that they were able to extend their working hours and
hence productivity. However, the impact on enhancing employment in the area is not significant. The
capacity building activities conducted by the GEF renewable energy projects led to the setup of about
fifteen ESCOs that continue to operate today, and the model has been replicated in Africa and other
South Asian countries.

1.3.2    Relevance

Conclusion 7: Although limited in spread of activities and project ideas, GEF support has helped Sri Lanka
meet its international commitments as well as a number of key national concerns

As seen in the description of the country environmental legal framework analysis (see Chapter 3 and
Technical Document A, Volume 2 of this report) Sri Lanka has adequate legal, policy and institutional
structures to address its environmental protection and conservation concerns. GEF support was
aligned to legal and sectoral plans such as the National Environmental Action Plan, the National
Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan, the Coastal Zone Management Plan and the Special Area
Management Plan. Furthermore, GEF supported national projects have assisted Sri Lanka to meet its
obligations to the various international environmental conventions the country is party to, and to
amend national laws and/or develop new plans. Some examples of the above are evidence in the
timeline diagram in Chapter 3, and are summarized here below:

       The preparation of the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (BCAP) lead to Sri Lanka meeting
        the requirements of Article 6a of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) as well as
        providing a comprehensive approach for biodiversity conservation in the country.
       The preparation of first and second communication on United Nations Framework Convention
        on Climate Change (UNFCCC) were undertaken under GEF enabling activities and these
        documents have been used to develop national strategies.
       The POPs enabling activity (GEF ID 1777) helped Sri Lanka to prepare the Nation
        Implementation Plan and also to ratify the Stockholm Convention in 2005.
       The Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) was
        responsible for the 2009 amendment of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, which made
        it mandatory for the preparation of management plans for all wildlife reserves in the country.
       The National Capacity Self-Assessment (GEF ID 2417) directly served to identify the need for a
        functional Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing (ABS) regime in Sri Lanka.
       One year after the startup of the Biosafety enabling activity (GEF ID 875) Sri Lanka became Party
        to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Sri Lanka also developed a biosafety policy in 2011.
       The renewable energy projects assisted the country in the increase of use of renewable sources of
        energy and making renewables a part in the energy mix in the country. These pilots that included
        setting of the tariff for selling energy to the grid have contributed to push the policy that non-
        conventional renewable sources would account for 10 percent of the energy generation by 2020.
GEF support has mainly focused on biodiversity and climate change. GEF support to biodiversity has
tended to focus on protected area management, contributing to the protection of globally threatened
species and critical habitat management, while support climate change focused on renewable energy
promotion, contributing to reduction in use of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions from the generation of
electricity from renewable sources. GEF support has not extended to include other important sectors
such as transport under climate change. Very few activities addressing land degradation (which was
done mainly through MFAs) have been supported and only one project was designed and
implemented in international waters.




                                                                                                       14
Conclusion 8: GEF support is aligned to Sri Lanka’s environmental and sustainable development
objectives in terms of laws, plans and policies, but weaknesses in the implementation of such laws and
policies reduce the full integration of environmental concerns into sectoral agendas

Sri Lanka’s vision for Sustainable Development, as stated in the 10years national development
framework Mahinda Chinthana, envisions an economy with a green environment and rapid
development. The vision is taken forward by the Haritha Lanka (Green Lanka), a Programme headed
by the President himself, which promotes coordination of sectoral and cross sectoral environmental
activities. However, in practice, integration of environmental considerations into sectoral plans and
implementation of the laws and policies that would allow for greater protection of natural resources
in Sri Lanka do not follow (DoNP and MoFP, 2010).

Participatory processes are used to put in place sustainable benchmarks and activities (such as the
Haritha Lanka Programme, the National Biodiversity Action Plan and the Climate Change Adaptation
Strategy). However, while these processes rely on each sector/department/institution to decide ways
of incorporating environmental aspects into their work, with the Ministry of Environment (MOE)
providing guidance and legislative coverage, there is no separate financing mechanism to support
these activities. The expectations are that these activities are incorporated in the annual budgets of
those state institutions.

The lack of technical skills on environmental subjects in government institutions and the lack of a
good coordinating mechanism are highlighted in the NCSA (GEF ID 2417) as an area that needs to be
addressed for better integration of environmental concerns into the various sectors. The final
stakeholder consultation workshop held in April 2013 as a part of this evaluation identified the lack of
understanding and technical competencies to tackle sustainability of environmental interventions
such as the GEF supported ones as barriers. Attention and interest to develop synergies in content
and resources was also seen as not adequate. The experience shared by the Ministry of Environment
on efforts to develop collaborative planning as part of the Protected Area Management and Wildlife
Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) was that even amongst departments with similar interests, this was
not an easy task to accomplish. The overall tendency is to lean towards one’s own agendas and plans.

Several laws and regulatory processes exist, for example to control industrial discharges, pollution and
air and water quality. Responsibilities for their enactment are shared amongst many institutions, and
as the capacity for monitoring pollution levels once the licenses are given on for adhering to the
emission limits permitted is weak, enforcement does not happen as it should. The way in which the
laws are interpreted and used can also cause divergence and inconsistencies in their enactment. Some
areas such as domestic and industrial solid waste are less regulated than others. The situation changes
in different parts of the country as environmental protection is managed by the local authorities.

Conclusion 9: Ownership of projects and their performance is linked to who carried out the design, what
sort of process was used and how they are able to align them to their own sectoral priorities and
availability of funds

The level of country ownership in the development of GEF projects differs in each focal area according
to national priorities at that point of time. For climate change, both the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Power and Energy were keen to develop renewable energy sources in the early 1990s as
the national electricity grid’s penetration reached only 40 percent of the households. Therefore the
support extended by the Government to assist in overcoming issues related to tariffs and power

                                                                                                     15
purchase agreements was strong. The Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project
(GEF ID 878) was designed by external consultants, which caused suspicion about the real intentions
of the project and resistance from within government institutions as well as the public (i.e. staff of the
DWLC as well as a few NGOs). A legal case was filed against the implementation of certain
components of this project, and these activities were modified as a result to incorporate the ideas of
the DWLC staff as well as civil society. While it is acknowledged that at the time the expertise to
develop the proposals was not there within the DWLC and external support was needed,
consideration of the work previously done and a more comprehensive consultative process during
project design could have engendered ownership while reducing delays and avoiding legal action. In
the case of the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818), a more participatory process was used to design the
project that then generated ownership within the Forest Department. According to the completion
report of the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) expectations of who will participate in project
activities as per the roles described in the project design stage did not materialize during
implementation, which has reduced buy-in and ownership.

The quality of Government ownership of GEF support is evidenced by its co-financing contributions to
approved projects, mainly in kind rather than in monetary terms. Overall Sri Lankan Government’s
contribution is around 19%in terms of commitments at project approval. The staff time contribution
of government officials to the project activities does not sufficiently materialize, due to commitments
to their regular work, as was the case in the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) and the East
Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753).

Conclusion 10: Although the GEF Sri Lanka portfolio is strongly relevant to global environmental benefits
in biodiversity, it is not so well aligned to other GEF focal areas, including land degradation and
international waters

Given that Sri Lanka with high endemism and diversity in its biological wealth, the GEF projects are
contributing positively to the protection of these globally valuable species and habitats. Support in climate
change mitigation through renewable energy projects have contributed to reducing emissions. However,
the more pressing national need as far as climate change is concerned is adaptation, being Sri Lanka an
island State which is prone to variability in rainfall and climate change impacts, including natural disasters.
However, Sri Lanka has focused on climate change adaptation through a biodiversity project in GEF 4 that
combines agriculture and climate change adaptation (GEF ID 4150 - Agro-biodiversity and Climate Change
Project). Other funding sources such as the climate change adaptation fund have been accessed, for
example a project on Addressing Climate Change Impacts on Marginalized Agricultural Communities Living
in the Mahaweli River Basin of Sri Lanka Project (a World Food Programme project approved in 2011).

Sri Lanka is mainly an agricultural country. One of the pressing national problems with regard to POPs is the
use of chemical fertilizers. Again GEF support was not used to address this national need. With regard to
land degradation, the main problems for Sri Lanka revolve around soil erosion and soil fertility loss, the two
major contributors to land degradation in the country. Expanding populations and the need for land for
human activities are serious factors that complicate land issues in a small island like Sri Lanka. Land
management is identified in the Haritha Lanka action Plan as an important area, and although a few
projects were identified in both the RAF and STAR programming exercises, no land degradation
projects materialized. Links to land management under the biodiversity focal area are observed in
some cases, as in the Mainstreaming Agro biodiversity Conservation and Use in Sri Lankan Agro-
ecosystems for Livelihoods and Adaptation to Climate Change (GEF ID 4150). Similarly, Sri Lanka is involved


                                                                                                            16
in only one regional international waters project, the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem Project (GEF
ID 1252) showing that Sri Lanka has not prioritized activities related to its oceans for GEF support.

1.3.3    Efficiency

Conclusion 11: The time taken for project approval has increased over time

The time taken for the approval process has increased over the time, especially for FSPs to progress
from Council approval to GEF CEO’s approval. In comparison to FSPs in Brazil which take 3.6 years to
go from entry in the pipeline to project start-up, Sri Lankan FSPs take an average of 4 years.

With the introduction of the RAF in 2006 projects under GEF4 experienced long delays due to the new
procedure according to which project ideas and potential executing agencies were to be identified in
consultation with stakeholders at the RAF development stage and it was expected that these projects
would then be submitted to the GEF OFP for endorsement. This did not happen and GEF Agencies got
involved in the process to assist in finalizing project proposals. In addition, delays were experienced at
the approval stages due to the procedures and paperwork required by the National Planning
Department (NPD) within the Ministry of Finance. Delays in approval by the GEF Secretariat added to
it, which were seen by national stakeholders to be linked to a shortage of funds due to the
international financial crisis. All these factors made such that GEF4projects began registering in the
GEF system only in 2009. Delays have been reduced in GEF5. Stakeholders, including from the SGP,
stated that delays and lack of proposals were due to proponents’ unclear understanding of the GEF
approval process and the complexities of the paperwork required by GEF Agencies in submitting
proposals.

Conclusion 12: Extension of project implementation has happened mostly in biodiversity projects

Eleven GEF supported projects have been completed by 2012 with an average implementation period
of five years. Climate change projects have been implemented on time, except for the first enabling
activity, the 1st communication to UNFCCC (GEF ID 309) that took ten years to complete, whilst most
of the biodiversity projects have been extended beyond the completion date. In comparison to other
GEF countries, the extension time experienced by GEF projects in Sri Lanka is low. The reasons for
extension of GEF projects in Sri Lanka are numerous and include issues related to design,
management, staffing, funding issues and other external factors, as described below:

       The time for involving the community in conservation activities had been underestimated in the
        project design for the Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95) and the Protected Areas
        Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 352) causing delays in the early
        implementation phase of these projects.
       Project design did not factor adequate time for changes to national laws. The Protected Area
        Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) estimated that the changes to the
        Fauna and Flora Ordinance could be made within the first year of the project, but it ultimately
        took seven years. Also in the case of the Sustainable Use of Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95)
        the progress of enacting the Intellectual Property Rights Act was significantly delayed.
       Lack of technical staff within the DWLC and the opposition to recruitment of qualified external
        staff had an impact on the progress of the Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected
        Areas Management Project (GEF ID 352) and the subsequent Protected Area Management and

                                                                                                       17
      Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878). The recruitment of staff was also hampered due to a
      moratorium in recruitment to permanent government positions in 2001. The centralized nature
      of decision making and in particular the limits on spending by field level staff had a negative
      impact on the activities designed to improve protected areas.
      The constant changes of the parent Ministry in the case of the Sustainable Use of Medicinal
      Plants Project (GEF ID 95) resulted in the project having to convince of its usefulness to diverse
      teams of officials, which resulted in several start-stops that impacted the continuity of the
      project activities.
     The East Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753) currently under implementation faced a 3 year
      delay primarily due to shifting the Lead Project Agency among three different Ministries.
      Changes in timelines and milestones translated into an inability to link with a larger project that
      was expected to provide administrative support as well as to link in for related activities.

Conclusion 13: Monitoring and Evaluation in GEF projects in Sri Lanka is not fully operationalized

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) for GEF projects in Sri Lanka includes the usual tools and reports,
starting from the initial project logical framework matrix to quarterly progress and financial reports,
annual reports, project implementation reviews, mid-term reviews, terminal reports, implementation
completion reports and independent evaluations. In many cases the various M & E reporting steps
have not been followed and information has not been recorded adequately. Many projects do not
have Project Implementation Reviews (PIR).In the case of some completed projects the evaluation
reports indicate that the poor quality of the logical framework matrix has had an impact on the quality
of project monitoring. GEF Agencies, including the WB and UNDP, use different M&E systems,
implying differences in how project outcomes are assessed. The GEF Project Management Information
System (PMIS) does not have up-to-date information on the status of the projects and often project
monitoring documentation is not uploaded.

The use of project steering committees has been mixed. The Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95) and
the Rural Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) report positive association with the regular use of
the respective steering committees. The Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) and the Rainforest
Project (GEF ID 818) report negative association with the frequency and quality of the steering
committees.

Both the GEF OFP and the GEF Agencies are seen as not being pro-active enough in their role to
ensure that M&E systems are followed, reporting is up-to-date and actions are taken to rectify issues
during implementation. The GEFOFP at present does not follow up on projects outside the
Environment Ministry’s line agencies and does not actively pursue status reports.

SGP stakeholders have also mentioned inadequacies in the way their M&E system is setup. The use of
national NGOs as service providers and/or individual experts to conduct monitoring activities is
considered by many national stakeholders as biased. In addition, the huge number of projects as
opposed by the limited number of SGP staff and the scarce resources allocated for M&E restrict the
direct engagement of the UNDP/SGP staff in regular monitoring visits to all sites.

The completion report on the first phase of the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development
(GEF ID 1545) done in 2011 is the only report that provides information on the level of environmental
stress reduction, i.e. the estimation of the reduction of emissions due to the use of renewable energy.

                                                                                                      18
Arrangements or institutions in place to monitor stress reduction or improvement in the environment
and/or socio-economic conditions at the systemic level after project completion are weak.

Conclusion 14: GEF Projects have applied adaptive management to steer project implementation

Mid-term reviews are the only exception to the overall weakness in M&E. All the completed projects
have used the mid-term evaluations/reviews as a means of taking stock and making adaptive
management changes to the project where appropriate. Examples include: excluding international
NGOs from carrying out biodiversity monitoring due to protests by the public and national NGOs and
agreeing on alternative arrangements, as in the Protected Area Management and Wildlife
Conservation Project (GEF ID 878); institutionalizing a participatory village model to promote
sustainable use of medicinal plants in the Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95); increasing and/or
continuing the training on productivity of tea land as this reduced the pressure on the forest in the
Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818); allowing the micro-finance institutions to act as project credit
institutions, which caused a reduction of interest costs for borrowing by households for solar systems
and its expanded use in the Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID 104).

Conclusion 15: Different project implementation modalities have shown mixed levels of synergy and
stakeholder coordination

There have been few projects that involved multiple GEF Agencies, but the most recent projects,
designed during GEF4 and GEF5 are showing involvement of diverse GEF Agencies, each of whom
brings in a different set of expertise. It is too early to conclude on the actual efficiency of the newly
introduced multi-agency execution modality.

Projects have also been varied in terms of the executing structures that have been put in place that
have involved different numbers of national executing agencies and other types of national
stakeholders and/or service providers. Different project implementation modalities have been
adopted based on the specific design features and technical needs of the different projects. In the
case of the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) the Forest Department was the only responsible executing
agency; but it brought in specialized institutions for particular activities such as training communities
in businesses. In the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) unclear roles amongst the implementers
and differences in opinions concerning conservation strategies among the stakeholders involved has
affected efficiency and ultimately the eventual achievement of expected results. In the Rural
Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) the clear definition of roles for each stakeholder institution
and the holding of regular coordination meetings that also included communities have been efficient
and contributed positively to project results.

Conclusion 16: Different budget cycles of the Sri Lankan Government and the GEF project cycle result in
longer time taken for project approval

The Sri Lankan Government budget planning cycle occurs on an annual basis. If the national budget
cycle is missed national approval of a project proposal can be delayed by a year. In turn, delays the
submission of the proposal to the GEF Secretariat can also take place, and the approval process can go
beyond one year, depending on requests for modification or further information. Both the Sri Lankan
Government – through the National Planning Department in the Ministry of Finance – and the GEF
require a different set of paperwork that adds to delays. In order to speed up the project proposals
submission process, the GEF OFP introduced the practice of sending the endorsed proposals at the

                                                                                                      19
same time both to the National Planning Department and to the GEF Secretariat. At the final
stakeholder workshop the following reasons for delays in getting approval by the National Planning
Department for the proposals submitted were mentioned: a) lack of linkages with larger national
goals and consequent inability of proving its relevance to national development and b)a
corresponding difficulty to obtain government’s co-financing for environmental projects.


1.3.4   Recommendations

To the GEF Council

Recommendation 1: In compliance with the 4th minimum requirement of the GEF M&E Policy, GEF
Agencies should ensure that M&E reports are made available to the GEF OFP and relevant national
stakeholders

The available evidence has shown gaps in the way M&E is performed. Project M&E systems are in
place, but besides MTRs the information they produced is not used for learning. Progress reports are
either not available in the GEF PMIS or not distributed to all concerned stakeholders. Terminal
evaluations have not been completed for all closed projects. Environmental stress monitoring and
improvement in environmental status was done only in one project. As a consequence, limited M&E
information is readily available to stakeholders to refer to for project design and proposal
preparation, as well as for the creation of synergies among stakeholders, both at the initial stages and
during project implementation, to build on activities already carried out and more importantly to
share lessons for scaling up.

GEF Agencies should ensure that regular monitoring takes place using the tools that are in place and
more importantly that basic M&E information is regularly transmitted to the GEF OFP and other
concerned national stakeholders, in full compliance with the 4th minimum requirement of the GEF
M&E Policy.

Gaps in M&E have been acknowledged by the GEF OFP. During the final stakeholder workshop the
OFP announced that the Ministry of Environment is planning to set up a monitoring unit and a project
management information system for the entire portfolio of its environmental projects, including those
funded by international institutions like the GEF. The project M&E information transmitted by GEF
Agencies would be uploaded in the Ministry’s newly established management information system and
through it made available to the relevant national stakeholders.

To the Government of Sri Lanka

Recommendation 2: The GEF OFP should steer the national portfolio formulation for GEF6 in a way that
all the crucial environmental challenges Sri Lanka faces are addressed, including land degradation and
international waters

From its inception the focus of GEF support to Sri Lanka has been on biodiversity and climate change.
GEF projects in these two focal areas have shown to be in line with national priorities as well as with
the strategic objectives of the various operational programs of these two focal areas, especially for
what concerns protected area management in biodiversity and renewable energy in climate change.
However, there is room for the country and its institutions to expand on other types of projects in

                                                                                                     20
these focal areas. One example is transport in climate change. The portfolio shows that few projects
have addressed land degradation and international waters, while it is recognized that land
management and marine area conservation are crucial measures to facing some of the country’s key
environmental challenges.

Sri Lanka went through two comprehensive national portfolio formulation exercises, the first one for
programming GEF4 resources under the RAF and the second one for GEF5 under the STAR resource
allocation system through the voluntary National Portfolio Formulation Exercise (NPFE) support
modality. In GEF4 project ideas in land degradation and international waters were shortlisted by the
stakeholders at the portfolio programming stage, which later did not materialize into concrete project
proposals. Some land degradation projects were proposed in GEF5, but none on international waters.
Both land degradation and marine ecosystem health are priority areas for Sri Lanka in the Haritha
Lanka Action Plan. The GEF OFP, with support from the GEF Agencies, should liaise with the national
institutions responsible for these subjects and develop proposals for future GEF funding to be
included in the next portfolio formulation exercise for GEF6.

Recommendation 3: The Ministry of Environment should play a stronger role in systematically
coordinating the GEF portfolio for greater impact and sharing of lessons, including across sectors

Sharing of lessons has been weak and sporadic. GEF projects have a tendency to work in isolation or
link or share lessons only within the Ministry of Environment or its departments. At times, lessons are
taken forward through ad hoc circumstances as in the case of renewable energy were more recent
projects were follow up phases of earlier projects. In other cases, lessons were transferred through
staff transfers from one department to another. No structured links exist to build on the results
achieved by the SGP programme and bridge to the policy level work as well as to larger projects for
scaling up.

The Ministry of Environment is entrusted with the coordination of activities in the environmental
sector and the GEF OFP is expected to play a more proactive and systematic coordination role in
ensuring that the GEF portfolio is mainstreamed horizontally across sectors. GEF projects should be
made aware of the activities being carried out by each other so that synergies and links are
established across project activities. The first step for doing this will be through the next national
programming exercise for GEF6, which preparations should start in early 2014, and anyway before the
end of GEF5, to prevent delays. The GEF OFP can also seek support from the GEF Agencies in
promoting concrete linkages between GEF projects, and other projects they are responsible for.

Recommendation 4: The GEF OFP should ensure that project proposals have a clear link to national
priorities prior to submission through the national as well as the GEF approval process

GEF support has contributed considerably to advancements of the environmental agenda in Sri Lanka.
GEF effectiveness can be further advanced if the links to national priorities are more clearly
envisioned and used to leverage funds, build partnerships and mobilize stakeholders, as was done in
the renewable energy projects. Besides, the National Planning Department has delayed co-financing
approval for project proposal as their alignment to national priorities was not clear. The GEF OFP
should ensure that national project proposals submitted for endorsement are aligned with national
priorities and explain how the benefits of the environmental component link to the national
sustainable development agenda and related national plans (such as the Haritha Lanka, the Mahinda
Chintana or the BCAP). At the final stakeholder workshop several participants suggested that a

                                                                                                    21
committee be established with relevant stakeholders including from the National Planning
Department, where project ideas can be discussed from the onset and the links and sectoral buy-in
can be discussed and negotiated upfront. The GEF OFP should lead this process.




                                                                                              22
CHAPTER 2. Evaluation framework
2.1 Background

CPEs are one of the main evaluation streams of work of the GEF Evaluation Office. By capturing
aggregate portfolio results and performance of GEF support at the country level they provide useful
information for both the GEF Council and the countries. CPEs’ relevance and utility has increased in
GEF-5 with the increased emphasis on country ownership and country-driven portfolio development.
Annex C provides the full Terms of Reference, which the methodology and process of the evaluation is
based on.
The evaluation aims to answer the following questions that are based on the standardized CPE
questions as well as several additional questions that were raised during the scoping mission by the
Sri Lankan stakeholders.

Effectiveness, results and sustainability
    a) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results (outcomes and impacts) by focal area
       at the project and aggregate level?
    b) What is the likelihood that objectives will be achieved for those projects that are still under
       implementation in Sri Lanka?
    c) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results related to the dissemination of
       lessons learned in GEF projects and with partners?
    d) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results which last in time and continue after
       project completion?
    e) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in moving from foundational activities and production of
       information and databases to demonstration and investment activities with concrete tangible
       results?
    f) Is the GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in linking environmental conservation measures with
       compatible sustainable livelihood and development activities?
    g) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in replicating/up-scaling the successful results it has
       demonstrated in its projects?
Relevance
    a) Is the GEF support relevant to Sri Lanka national environmental priorities and sustainable
       development needs and challenges?
    b) Are GEF and its Agencies supporting the environmental and sustainable development
       prioritization, country ownership and decision-making processes of Sri Lanka?
    c) Is the GEF support to Sri Lanka relevant to the objectives linked to the different Global
       Environmental Benefits in biodiversity, greenhouse gases, international waters, land
       degradation, and chemicals focal areas?
    d) Is Sri Lanka supporting the GEF mandate and focal areas programs and strategies with its own
       resources and/or with the support from other donors?
    e) Is the relevance of the GEF support to Sri Lanka's national priorities coinciding or clashing with
       the relevance to the GEF international mandate of achieving Global Environmental Benefits?
Efficiency

                                                                                                      23
     a) How much time, effort and financial resources does it take to formulate and implement
        projects, by type of GEF support modality in Sri Lanka?
     b) What role does Monitoring and Evaluation play in increasing project adaptive management
        and overall efficiency in Sri Lanka?
     c) What are the roles, types of engagement and coordination among different stakeholders in
        project implementation in Sri Lanka?
     d) What are the synergies for GEF project programming and implementation among: GEF
        Agencies; national institutions; GEF projects; and other donor-supported projects and
        activities in Sri Lanka?
     e) How do the national budget procedures in Sri Lanka affect GEF project proposals preparation
        and funding?

2.2 Objectives and scope

The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE covers all types of GEF supported activities in Sri Lanka at different stages
of the project cycle (pipeline, on-going and completed) and implemented by all GEF Agencies in all
focal areas, including applicable GEF corporate activities such as the Small Grants Programme (SGP)
and a selection of regional and global programs that are of special importance to the country.
However, the main focus of the evaluation has been the national projects implemented in Sri Lanka
that include full-size, medium-size or enabling activities and has concentrated on aggregated results.
Wherever possible the assessment has included regional and global projects. The stage of the project
has determined the expected focus of the analysis (see Table 2).

2.3 Methodology

Chapter 5, 6, and 7 address the three main areas of the evaluation – the results, relevance, and
efficiency of GEF support respectively. Each chapter addresses the key evaluation questions that
guided the CPE. These questions are contained in the terms of reference (Annex C) and the evaluation
matrix (Annex D), which contains a list of indicators, potential sources of information, and
methodology components to be used to answer the key evaluation questions. The indicators were
derived from project documents and other GEF documentation, including the STAR, and any
appropriate national sustainable development and environmental indicators.
The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE was conducted from December 2012 to September 2013 by staff of the
GEF Evaluation Office and a team of national experts provided by a national institution, CEPA, i.e. the
Evaluation Team. The team’s expertise includes environment management and sustainable
development in Sri Lanka, evaluation methodologies, and the GEF. The methodology included
multiple components using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques
and tools. The evaluation used the following information sources:


                                                                                                        24
     At the project level: project documents, project implementation reports, terminal evaluations,
      terminal evaluation reviews, reports from monitoring visits, and any other technical
      documents produced by projects;
     At the country level: national sustainable development agendas, environmental priorities and
      strategies, GEF-wide, focal area strategies and action plans, global and national environmental
      indicators;
     At the GEF agency levels: country assistance strategies and frameworks, evaluations and
      reviews;
     Evaluative evidence at the country level from other evaluations implemented either by the
      Office, by the independent evaluation offices of GEF Agencies, or by other national or
      international evaluation departments;
     Interviews with GEF stakeholders, including: the GEF OFP and all other relevant Government
      departments; bilateral and multilateral donors; civil society organizations and academia
      (including both local and international NGOs with a presence in the country); GEF Agencies
      including the WB, UNDP, etc.; SGP and the national UN conventions’ Focal Points;
     Interviews with GEF beneficiaries and supported institutions, municipal governments and
      associations, and local communities and authorities;
     Field visits to selected project sites;
     Information from a national consultation workshop held on April 29, 2013 to enable
      comments and discussion on findings.
Annex E provides details of the interviews conducted and Annex F provides the sites visited.
The quantitative analysis used indicators to assess the relevance and efficiency of GEF support using
projects as the unit of analysis (that is, linkages with national priorities, time and cost of preparing and
implementing projects, etc.) and to measure GEF results (that is, progress towards achieving global
environmental impacts) and the performance of projects (such as implementation and completion
ratings). Available statistics and scientific sources, especially for national environmental indicators,
were also used.
The Evaluation Team used standard tools and protocols for the CPEs and adapted these to the specific
context in Sri Lanka. These tools include a project review protocol to conduct the desk and field
reviews of GEF projects and interview guides to conduct interviews with different stakeholders.
The evaluation analysis and triangulation of collected information and evidence from various sources,
tools and methods was undertaken by comparing the response to key evaluation questions on
relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness. Project sites were selected based on the requirements for the
ROtI field studies. Three projects were selected for ROtI analysis based on whether they had been
completed sufficiently long ago to analyze their progress from outcome to impact and on their
coverage of two important focal areas for Sri Lanka: biodiversity and climate change. The Evaluation
Team decided on specific sites to visit based on the initial review of documentation and balancing
needs of representation as well as cost-effectiveness.
Quality assurance was performed at key stages of the process by a Peer Review Panel composed by
three independent experts from the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association (SLEvA). The expertise provided
covered the relevant scientific and technical aspects of the peer review function related to the GEF
focal areas as well as to evaluation.


                                                                                                         25
The specific inputs generated with the information were the:

       GEF Sri Lanka Portfolio Database that compiled basic information (GEF Agency, focal area,
        implementation status), project cycle information, GEF and co-financing financial information,
        major objectives and expected (or actual) results, key project partners, etc.
       Country Environmental Legal Framework (CELF) provided an overview of the context in which
        the GEF projects have been developed and implemented in Sri Lanka. This document has
        information on national environmental legislation and policies, action plans and international
        conventions that are analyzed with regards to specific GEF support.
       Global Environmental Benefits Assessment (GEBA) looked at Sri Lanka’s contribution to the
        GEF mandate and its focal areas based on appropriate indicators as identified on the GEF
        website and others used in projects documents.
       Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) provides 3 extensive descriptions of 3 national projects
        to provide an indication of impact. The projects were selected based on being completed
        since at least two years, representing results in key focal areas and different GEF Agencies.
        Projects were also selected to represent potential for change.
The Country Environmental Legal Framework, the Global Environmental Benefits Assessment and the
three ROtI studies are presented in Volume 2. These inputs were used to carry out a triangulation
exercise that formed the basis of the evaluative analysis to which the entire evaluation team including
the GEF Team Leader contributed. Analysis and data gaps were highlighted in this exercise and the
results were summarized into the Aide Mémoire, which captured the key preliminary findings of the
evaluation. The Aide Mémoire was distributed to stakeholders and was presented at the final
consultation workshop where it was validated. Some information gaps were also filled at this meeting
and some areas for potential recommendations were also discussed. Workshop participants included
government representatives and other national stakeholders, including project staff, donors and GEF
Agencies (see Annex G).
Given the late start to the evaluation it was not possible to finalize the final report for the GEF Council
meeting in June; hence the Aide Memoire was fine-tuned into a key findings document. The final step
was to prepare the Final Draft report, which is to be circulated to all the stakeholders and finalized
into the Final report with their comments.


2.4 Limitations

Whilst conducting the evaluation, the following limitations were taken into account and addressed
wherever possible:
       Only three of the seven projects had evaluation reports, hence understanding project impacts
        using documents was constrained. In addition, shortcomings in the filling of the monitoring and
        evaluation documentation and the adoption of their own reporting formats by GEF Agencies
        also made the understanding of outcomes difficult. The team adopted a number of measures in
        this regard. In addition to the field visits for the three ROtI studies, these measures included
        triangulation through interviews with relevant stakeholders and analyzing the obligatory
        reporting that the country makes for biodiversity and climate change.



                                                                                                        26
   In this context of insufficient information as well as GEF support being linked to other projects in
    some cases, establishing direct attribution was not always possible and hence the assessment
    was largely on the outcomes and/or the contribution of GEF support to the observed overall
    environmental achievements.
   When reporting impacts, the assessment is based on performance beyond the life of the project
    and is a time bound to the achievements at the point the evaluation was conducted. Hence it
    cannot be concluded that this is final or lasting impact. This is also the basis with which the ROTI
    assessment was carried out.
   The short time available to conduct the evaluation resulted in more reliance on the secondary
    data and an inability to cover all the projects through interviews. The consultant team took
    advantage of various stakeholder meetings to verify and increase project coverage.

A 30 year armed conflict that divided
the country geographically, ethnically and politically, was brought to an end in May 2009. The end of
war saw a new revival and vitality of the Sri Lankan economy with greater opportunities for
businesses such as tourism that remained constrained and stunted over 3.5 decades. Even throughout
the time of war, terrorist attacks, and unrest, the consistent policy of an open economy, with the
private sector at the helm resulted in an average 5% growth rate per annum. The ambition is now is to
move up to 8.5% per year (CB, 2011). In order to achieve this objective, the Government envisions a
strategy of infrastructure development especially to combat the regional disparities of growth and
development and attract investment for business ventures. In “Sri Lanka, the Emerging Wonder of
Asia” the Government spells out its development policy framework for the period from 2010to 2016
and it highlights the President’s mission of transforming the island state into a strategically important
economic centre of the world (DoNP and MoFP 2010).

Sri Lanka has now moved up in its economic ranks to become a low middle income country with a per
capita income of USD 2836 in 2011 (CB, 2011). The expansion of the economy has enabled the
progressive reduction of unemployment as well as poverty. However the economic wealth has not
spread equitably – spatially or among its citizens. Much of the growth and wealth is accumulated in
the western province that generates 45% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).The Northern
Province, after years of armed conflict and conditions of restricted access, has the lowest percentage
(3.4%) of GDP while the Uva Province where poverty has persisted and economic opportunities are
restricted very much to primary agriculture products also has a low contribution to the GDP (4.5%)
(ibid.). Sri Lanka’s main economic drivers for 2011 have been the service and industrial sectors, while


                                                                                                        28
the highest foreign exchange earners are tourism, remittances and tea. This shows a gradual change
over time from an agriculture and plantation industry-based economy to a more diversified economy.

In terms of population, the poverty head count index has reduced from 15.2% in 2006/7 to 8.9% in
2009/10 but the income inequality measured by the Gini Coefficient is 0.49 indicating a very high
income inequality between the poor and the rich (DCS, 2011). In fact in the period of 2002 – 2009 the
lowest and highest income deciles have shown negative growth rate that underscores the income
inequality issue. The poor tend to rely on agriculture and fisheries related income that is not a
growing sector in terms of its contribution to the GDP.

Sri Lanka is used as a beacon for the way social and welfare policies, used consecutively over a long
period of time can bring about remarkable achievements in health and education, despite its being a
low income country. The high levels of social development are reflected in the millennium
development goal targets that the country is on track to achieving. This is largely a result of past
investments, particularly the free education and health provision, which, despite its cost to the state
provided equitable access and opportunities for social mobility and moving out of poverty. Sri Lanka
has achieved high levels of reducing infant and maternal mortality and combating communicable
diseases. However, these national level indicators mask regional disparities and challenges in the
delivery of services and quality of services. At present the state investments into these sectors are
well below the globally accepted levels (1.4% as opposed to the global standard of 4.5% of GDP on
education and 1.9% as opposed to 5% of GDP on health) (CB, 2011 and WB data online). This raises
issues of the ability to provide and maintain quality health and education services across the country.

As a result of the improved social conditions, Sri Lanka’s population is living longer. At the same time
Sri Lanka also has a low population growth rate, resulting in a population comprising of more people
over 60 years of age and less children under 15. The number of people over 60 is predicted to double
by 2031 and to become 1/4th of the population by 2041. This demographic is on par with developed
countries, but has not been followed up with stable economic growth and support structures to care
for the elderly. From an economic perspective, it will lead to greater dependency, with the current
child dependency being overtaken by old age dependency reaching over 50% by 2051 (De Silva, 2007).
It can also mean a labour shortage that can impact the economic growth potential. From a social
perspective, it puts pressure on the ability to care for the elderly – both in the homes and through the
health services. The health care system has to adjust to cater to the elderly while also having to deal
with changing disease profile, with Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) emerging as the biggest
health care challenge.

The reconstruction and resettlement of the North and the East is one of the central focuses of the
government for the next few years. Revitalizing of Sri Lanka’s economy to attract investments
increasing businesses (such as tourism) in Sri Lanka is another. Both will be mobilized by large scale
infrastructure development and upgrading. The similarities they share are that both will result in land
use changes and resettlement of affected people. These are taking place in different ways across the
country causing disputes over resources and what they should be used for and disparities in how
different affected people’s entitlements are provided for.

Sri Lanka is a democratic, socialist, republic. It has an elected President with executive powers and a
parliament. The number of Ministries and Portfolios are re-shuffled quite frequently and the most
recent change was in January 2013. The cabinet now has 10 senior ministers, 54 cabinet ministers and
29 deputy ministers and two project ministers. There is a central government with an administrative

                                                                                                     29
structure that reaches all the way to village level (District to Divisional secretariats to Grama Niladhari
at village level). Parallel to this there are 9 Provincial Councils (PC), and a range Local Authorities (LAs)
(Municipal and Urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas) that have elected bodies and some devolved
powers and responsibilities – such as health and education, social infrastructure for the PCs,
maintenance of public utilities for LAs etc. The central government retains control of major portfolios
such as defense, finance, economic development, and security. In the last couple of years two
powerful ministries the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Defense and Urban
Development have been created to spearhead development activities. In addition a new Act “Divi
Neguma” was passed in January 2013, amalgamating national and regional poverty alleviation
programmes and centralizing the administration of these development activities. The bill raised
concern among legal professionals on its constitutionality, governance and transparency.

Capital expenditure of the government largely comes from loans and grants from donors. There has
been a shift in the funding partners to the government projects and programmes in the recent past.
Traditionally Japan, ADB and the WB provided the largest share of loans and grants to Sri Lanka. Since
2009, China and India have started providing increasing amounts of loans and grants to the
government. These new donors are supporting infrastructure projects and their commitment to
community and environmental safeguards are not clear.

While development speeds ahead in Sri Lanka, there is concern that this will come at a cost to its
environment. Currently Sri Lanka does have a depleting and degraded resource base and it cannot
keep pace with the demands of increasing populations and consumerists lifestyles. Table 3.2
summarizes the significant environmental issues for Sri Lanka. Climate change is an emerging threat
with ecological, economic and social consequences.

    3.2.1 Biodiversity
Sri Lanka’s rich and unique biodiversity forms the basis for the country’s natural heritage that is linked
to its cultural legacy and economic advancement. Despite its relatively small size, the island exhibits
an exceptional array of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, with high diversity and
endemism, which can be attributed to the presence of a wide range of topographic and climatic
variations. Another contributing factor is the country’s isolation from the neighboring Indian

subcontinent since the late Pleistocene, leading to a reduced influence of the subcontinent on the
evolutionary history of Sri Lanka’s biodiversity after that geological period (MTE &WA, 1995).

Sri Lanka, together with the Western Ghats of India is recognized as one of the world’s 34 biodiversity
hotspots, recognized for high endemism and 70% loss of its original habitat (Conservation
International, 2012). This indicates the globally significant nature of the biodiversity as well as the
urgency to protect it. With respect to comprehensive global analyses of specific taxonomic groups, Sri
Lanka is recognized as one of 234 centres of plant diversity in the world (Davis, Heywood and
Hamilton, 1995) and as one of the 218 endemic bird areas, defined by BirdLife International
(Stattersfield et al., 1998). Further various documents indicates that the marine waters around Sri
Lanka contain high species richness and thus priority should be placed on conserving the marine
biodiversity (Ausubel, 2010; Cheung et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2002).

Sri Lanka also has globally recognized biologically rich areas such as 2 UNESCO World heritage sites
(Sinharaja and Central Highlands), 4 UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserves (Hurulu, Sinharaja,
Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya(KDN)Forest Complex and Bundala), and 6 Ramsar sites (Bundala,
Madu Ganga, Anawilundawa, Vankalei, Kumana wetland cluster, and Wilpattu wetland cluster).

The rich biological wealth of the country is a result of a combination of factors such as distinct climatic
zones and different soil conditions. Topographically, the island consists of a south-central
mountainous region which rises to an elevation of 2500m, surrounded by broad lowland plains at an
elevation of 0 - 75m above sea level. The climate is tropical overall, but it shows variations across the
island mainly due to differences in rainfall and elevation. Generally three broad climatic regions are
recognized: the wet zone, dry zone and intermediate zone. Whereas the dry zone is all lowland, the
other two zones are further subdivided on the basis of altitude. Sri Lanka, despite its small size, has a
rich diversity of soils. Fourteen of the Great Soil Groups are recognized within the country. These
variations have resulted in several forest categories with their own characteristics (Table 6).

threatened and charismatic species such as the elephant and leopard, however greater species
diversity is found in the wet zone (low land rainforests, moist monsoon forests). The wet zone is
heavily populated and forest land here has been converted for agriculture, homesteads, infrastructure
etc. This has resulted in fragmented forest areas that put pressure on the integrity of these
ecosystems (FD, 2012). The national budget and plans for 2013 had stated that forest cover will be

Sri Lanka’s wetlands are diverse, comprising 103 major rivers and associated marshes and about
12,000 man-made irrigation tanks that harbour a multitude of wetland species. Being an island, the
country has a rich marine and coastal biodiversity along its 1620 km coastline and the Exclusive
Economic Zone with a sea bed and water column spanning over an area of 517,000 km (CCD, 2006).

The various geo-evolutionary and geological processes in Sri Lanka, coupled with spatial variations in
climate and topography, have also promoted isolation of species resulting in a large number of
‘geographically relict species’. Several endemic relict genera are recorded among the land snails and
herpetic fauna. The high elevation cloud forests contain a significant complement of geographically
relict endemic species. The high elevation features coupled with anthropogenic pressures has led to a
higher portion of endemic species becoming globally and nationally threatened (Bambaradeniya,
2006).

globally threatened species recorded from Sri Lanka, 286 are plants. Out of the 285 threatened fauna
there are 130 other invertebrates, 56 amphibians, 43 fishes, 30 mammals, 15 birds, and 11 reptiles
(IUCN, 2013). This indicates that 50% of the amphibians are threatened. Given the high endemism
among amphibians it highlights a particularly sensitive status.

With 46 agro-climatic regions in Sri Lanka based on soil variation, annual rainfall and altitude, the
country supports a wide range of traditional crop varieties. With a long history of agriculture and a
unique hydraulic civilization, agro-biodiversity (crops and livestock) in the country has been enhanced.
Despite a process of selection through the ages, introduction to new areas and climatic conditions,
some varieties still show close genetic links to their wild relatives (i.e. rice varieties) (MOE 2011). Sri
Lanka is also a valuable repository of crop germplasm, especially of rice. There are varieties of rice
which are resistant to pests and adverse climatic and soil conditions, exhibit variations in grain size
and quality, and show differences in rate of maturing (MoENR, 2009). With the threats of climate
change looming more effort has been put into identifying drought and flood resistant rice varieties.
The uptake remains limited due to preference given to conventional high yielding varieties and
methods, as well as the lack of knowledge, financial resources and external support (CEPA, 2011).
There is also significant crop genetic diversity among spices of commercial importance. Among these
are 500 selections of pepper and about seven wild species, 10 wild races of cardamom, and several
indigenous varieties of betel and chili. Grain legumes and root and tuber crops also show a rich
genetic variability, as do fruit crops such as banana, mango and citrus. Among domesticated animals
of economic value are wild species of buffalo, cattle and fowl. The local cattle show high resistance to
disease and tolerance of internal parasites. Likewise, the local breeds of poultry are resistant to
tropical diseases (MOE, 1999).

    3.2.2 Climate Change
Sri Lanka is a negligible contributor to global warming. However, the island is highly vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change, which include: increases in the frequency and intensity of disasters such as
droughts, floods and landslides; variability and unpredictability of rainfall patterns; increase in
temperature; and inundation due to sea level rise (MOE, 2010e).

                                                                                                         33
The degree of severity and actual impacts are being debated but there is overall agreement that
climate change, if not acted upon, can undermine the economic and social development potential. It
is likely to affect livelihoods such as tourism, agriculture and fisheries, and especially those in the
informal sector, small scale businesses/farmers/fishermen, labourers, and wage workers that are less
able to cope with external shocks. It will also affect communities living in close proximity to the ocean,
putting the biggest risk on families in makeshift houses and in environmentally sensitive areas (e.g.
buffer zones, flood plains). Climate change also affects health, especially the health of young children
and older people who are less able to adapt or respond quickly to change (MOE, 2012 and 2010e).

In 2011, a vulnerability mapping exercise carried out by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) as part of
the Climate change adaptation strategy formulation process gives a sense of the scale and spatial
distribution of potential climate change vulnerabilities in the country. The analysis of climate data for
Sri Lanka clearly indicates changes in rainfall and temperature patterns throughout the country (MOE,
2011). Some other key sectors and areas that are seen to be vulnerable are given below:

       Vulnerability of human settlements to the expected increase in floods appears to be
        concentrated in the Western region of the country, although smaller pockets of high
        vulnerability are also seen elsewhere. High intensity rainfall will affect harvesting and soil
        erosion in tea lands and reduce the days suitable for rubber tapping. While increases in
        rainfall variability will affect crops and food security and increase the vulnerability of farming
        communities especially those reliant on rain-fed agriculture.

       The incidence of landslides caused by heavy and continuous rain is on the rise, especially in
        the central hill region and the resultant loss/ damage to housing, livelihoods and lives.

       Prolonged droughts will worsen the drinking water availability and increase evapo-
        transpiration from the soil and plants in the Dry Zone and the coastal areas.

       Sea level rise in the long term will have impacts on land, coastal infrastructure including
        housing, roads and tourism establishments and agriculture. Salt water intrusion will reduce
        the availability of fresh water for both drinking and irrigation especially in the north-west and
        the southern coastal belt. This will lead to substantial loss/damage of assets, disruption of
        economic opportunities and threats to the physical and social wellbeing of coastal
        communities, especially since the coastal zone accounts for about 43% of the nation’s GDP.

       Increase in temperatures will have significant implications on coastal habitats, such as coral
        reefs, sea-grass beds and mangroves, which in turn will affect the distribution and
        composition of marine and coastal species affecting fish stocks.

       Climate change impacts are expected to be significant in the areas of vector borne diseases
        (essentially mosquito borne), rodent borne diseases (e.g. leptospirosis, which is the second
        major communicable disease in the country), food and water borne diseases, nutritional
        status, and other environment related disorders.

Sri Lanka’s Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are low, with the per capita GHG emissions being
0.6tons/year while the global standard is 4.29tons/year. It is also the lowest for South Asia (WB data
online). This is mainly due to the lower levels of industrialization (Table 3.6). The highest source of

                                                                                                       34
GHG comes from Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as a result of the use of biomass mainly as the source of
household cooking fuel as well as for industrial thermal energy. Fossil fuel combustion for energy
mainly from transport (49%) and power generation (29%) are the other large contributors to CO 2
emissions. The largest methane (CH4) emissions are from agriculture (mainly rice cultivation) and
waste (agriculture and municipal). The largest source of Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is also from agriculture.

Table 3.7 presents the aggregate emissions, calculated using global warming potential values
applicable in a 100 year time horizon as used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) calculations. In this format all emission values are converted to CO2 equivalents. This shows
that the inclusion of land use change and forestry (LUCF) has contributed to the removal of around
30% of the total emissions (MOE, 2011). Biomass has not been included into this calculation.

In post-conflict Sri Lanka, with its increased economic growth, greater mobility, greater reliance on
coal and thermal energy, it can be assumed that the emissions have increased, however a more
recent emission’s inventory has not been carried out. The electricity demand in Sri Lanka is growing at
a rate of about 7-8% per annum and number of new vehicles added is 300,000 per annum. Industries
and the commercial sectors are also expanding and this indicates a greater level of emissions can be
expected (MOE, 2011).

Sri Lanka’s energy mix shows the dependency        Table 3.8: Sri Lanka’s Energy Mix

potential has been fully tapped, and the future

plan is to increase coal fired power plants to
1000MWs. In 2011, Sri Lanka commissioned its             Source: SLSEA, 2011. Sri Lanka Energy Balance
first coal power plant (300MW).

Non-conventional renewable energy (such as mini hydro, solar, wind) use is increasing, but at present
levels it makes up a very small portion of the energy balance. Sri Lanka has also put in place tariff
structures and power purchasing policies that allow private households and businesses to sell
renewable energy to the grid. Private mini hydro schemes are well established with over 180Mw of
installed capacity connected to the grid. Some of the mini hydro projects are also registered for
carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Since 2010, the private sector has
been involved in wind power generation and more recently with biomass (dendro) power projects. As
per the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) website there are 11 private wind generation
units listed with 111.5 MW of power and 6 biomass projects are listed with 23.5MW. Wind and
Biomass are identified as two main sources that can increase the non-conventional power supply. In
2011 the first grid connected commercial solar plant (1.2MW) was also commissioned.

Overall Sri Lanka has provided 100% fuel accessibility to all communities and will shortly reach 100%
electrification, thereby fulfilling the goal of providing access to modern energy services to all the
citizens. Interestingly, the largest users of energy are households with transport and industries
following behind with a wide gap (Table 3.9). This indicates that a bulk of the energy generated is not
being used for productivity and growth.

As a low middle income country, with high social development indicators, Sri Lanka has a per capita
energy consumption (0.4 tons of oil equivalent (toe) that is far below the lower middle income
country average of 1.02 toe. This indicates a more positive picture in terms of low carbon
development while also having the space to increase its energy consumption levels (Chart 1.1).

   3.2.3 International waters
As an island state situated in the Northern Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka’s marine environment comes under
the International Waters Category as it lays in the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem (BOBLME).
Other than Sri Lanka, BOBLME is bordered by Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives,
Myanmar, and Thailand. The BOBLME covers an area of about 3,660,130 km2 and contains 3.63% and
0.12% of the world’s coral reefs and sea mounts, respectively. It is influenced by the second largest
hydrologic region in the world, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basin, which spreads over five
countries. The BOBLME and its natural resources are of considerable social and economic importance
to the bordering countries. Activities such as fishing, marine farming, tourism and shipping contribute
to foodsecurity, employment and national economies. Marine living resources are extremely
important to the coastal poor, particularly as a source of food (BOBLME Project, 2012).

The maritime boundaries of Sri Lanka are established under the Maritime Zones Law, No. 22 of 1976
(MZL) that follows the framework provided by the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS), to which Sri Lanka became signatory in December 1982 and ratified in 1994. Under the
MZL, different maritime zones have been declared by a Presidential Proclamation gazetted in January
1977. The Sovereignty of the Republic extends to the territorial sea and to the airspace over the
territorial sea. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the country extends to a distance of 200 nautical
miles from the baseline. The area enclosed by the EEZ is reported as 517,000 sq. km, which is 7.8
times the total land area of the country. Within this zone the country has sovereign rights to explore,
exploit, conserve and manage natural resources, both living and non-living and exclusive rights to
authorize regulate and control scientific research (UN, 1993 and Joseph, 2003). Sri Lanka and India
agreed on June 1974 to the delimitation of a boundary through the "historic waters" of Palk Bay. This
agreement came into force in July 1974. Another agreement between the two countries in 1976

                                                                                                    38
determines the maritime boundary in the areas of Gulf of Mannar, Palk Straight and Bay of Bengal
(DoD/USA, 2005).

Under the provisions of UNCLOS, Sri Lanka is entitled to lodge a claim for an extended area of seabed
where the thickness of the sediment layer is over 1km and once this claim is accepted, the country
could gain an additional seabed area which would be 23 times the island's land area. In addition to the
living resources, the EEZ and the extended area, which will come under Sri Lanka’s jurisdiction, also
contain valuable non-living resources such as hydrocarbon sources and a variety of economically
important minerals including manganese nodules (MF&AR, 2007).

Sri Lanka has a coastline of approximately 1,620 km, which includes the shoreline of bays and inlets,
but excludes the lagoons (CCD, 2006).The main economic activities associated with marine waters are
fishery, maritime transport and tourism. Sri Lanka is exploiting the coastal fisheries resources close to
its Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), while the deep sea resources which were largely untapped or
being exploited by foreign vessels illegally, which is now become a huge political issue (CB, 2008).
More recently there have been several incidences of illegal fishing of foreign boats in Sri Lankan
waters that have been reported in the media. In the post war era the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources(MF&AR) aims to expand and promote off-shore fishing. While dolphin and whale watching
have become new attractions for the tourism sector.

The strategic location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean close to the east west shipping route and the
increased shipping activity projected within next decade has given vision to enhance capacity of Sri
Lankan commercial ports at Colombo, Hambantota, Trincomalee. According to the “Mahinda
Chinthana” development policy framework, rapid development in tourism and marine related
industries is expected. In the light of these developments Sri Lanka faces a greater risk of marine
pollution due to oil/chemical spill or due to dumping of ship generated waste and needs to enhance
and strengthen awareness, preparedness and capacity to counter possible threats caused to the
marine environment.

    3.2.4 Persistent Organic Pollutants
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) can be categorized into three groups: pesticides, industrial
chemicals and unintentional by-products. The Pesticides are Aldrin, Chlordane, Dieldrin, Endrin,
Heptachlor, Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), Mirex and Toxaphene that are no longer used in Sri Lanka. The
industrial chemical Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are widely used in Sri Lanka. The two
unintentional by products are Dioxins (Polychlorinated Dibenzo Dioxin - PCDD) and Furans
(Polychlorinated Dibenzo Furan (PCDF) that are also present due to incomplete combustion in various
anthropogenic activities (MOE, 2005). As a country where agriculture is a main livelihood, the major
use of POPs in Sri Lanka is as agricultural pesticides. However POPs pesticides are not manufactured in
Sri Lanka but imported as ready-to-use products or technical materials for local formulation.

Sri Lanka has been fortunate that the detrimental effects of POPs have been noted and substantial
measures have taken place even decades before the Stockholm Convention came into force. With the
implementation of the Control of Pesticides Act No 33 of 1980, all POPs pesticides were banned. The
prohibition of use of POPs pesticides was initiated in the early 1970s and was completed in 1996 with
the ban of chlordane, which was the last POPs pesticide used in Sri Lanka (Table table 3.10). Prior to
completing the ban, the last remaining use of chlordane was termite control in a building construction
sites (CEJ, 2006; MOE, 2005).

The problems related to POPs pesticides are due to the possibility of illegal imports through false
declarations, lack of resources for systematic screening of imports as well as for identification and
analysis, and inadequate data on environmental impact baselines and health issues. One of the main
concerns associated presently with POPs pesticides is the possibility of exposure through
contaminated sites resulting from historical uses. However, there is very little information available on
safe environmental levels, which seriously incapacitates arriving at reasonable predictions on
potential human and environmental adverse effects arising from POPs pesticide use in Sri Lanka.
Some data is available concerning the concentration of a limited number of pesticides in surface
waters, river waters, while isolated incidences of pesticide related deaths of fish populations, snakes,
etc. have been reported in surface waters following heavy application of mostly organophosphate and
carbammate type of pesticides in agricultural fields without possible long-term environmental
damages (CEJ, 2006; MOE, 2005).

As reported in the National Implementation Plan (NIP): “PCB was used extensively as a dielectric in
transformers until international production ceased in 1986. Of the estimated 18,500 transformers in
the electricity and industrial sector, a very few pure PCB transformers have been identified. Initially it
was assumed that only transformers manufactured before 1986 had high probability of containing
PCB. However, sampling across different era of manufacture using field test kits and laboratory
analysis indicates that there is a very high degree of cross contamination of even non-PCB
transformers during routine maintenance even among relatively new transformers”.

The danger with PCBs is that PCB oils can cause contamination of ground and surface waters, soil and
air. Contamination can take place during maintenance and through recyclers, scrapping yards or
repair yards. The recyclers use a considerable quantity of used transformer oil in their daily
operations. They use sawdust to absorb the oil during draining of transformers. The sawdust soaked
with transformer oil is then handed over to the local authorities for disposal. Therefore, there is a
possibility of dumping and burning of sawdust used for cleaning spilled oil, which might contain PCBs.
Three experiments of burning PCB oil have been tried in a cement kiln and could be an alternative to
manage PCBs (MOE, 2005, CEJ, 2006).

Some of the issues related to the control and elimination of PCBs as identified in the NIP:
• Long life span of PCBs containing equipment – 30 – 35 years
• High cost of replacement of PCBs containing equipment

                                                                                                       40
•   Lack of legislation to prevent import of PCB containing equipment – no legislation dedicated to
    prevent imports and use
•   Lack of facilities in testing for PCBs;
•   Recycling of transformers without testing for presence of PCBs that can lead to more
    contamination;
•   Closed systems using dielectric oils can be a future source of PCB contamination;

In terms of unintended POPs produced in Sri Lanka, estimations were made using a toolkit developed
by UNEP. The main sources of releases of PCDD and PCDF (Dioxins and Furans) were identified in the
NIP as:
• The uncontrolled combustion of wastes, primarily in dumps and in the open;
• The processing of metals, in particular scrap copper where a significant amount of PCDD/F is likely
     to be associated with the residues from gas cleaning systems;
• The incineration of medical wastes carried out under very poorly controlled conditions;
• Burning of biomass in homes for cooking, industry and for disposal of agricultural residues.

There are implications for health from short term issues like irritation to more long term effects such
as cancer, immunological and neurological issues. There are also effects on the health of ecosystems
and wildlife.

3.2.5 Land Degradation
Sri Lanka consists of 6.5 million ha of land, where only about 50% is arable due to unsuitable terrain,
inland water bodies and forest reservations. At present with an estimated population of about 20.2
million, the per capita arable land area is less than 1.5ha indicating heavy pressure on land resources.
The present land use pattern of the country stems from the legacy of a land policy from the colonial
times where export based commercial agriculture was superimposed on traditional farming systems
(DLUPP, 2011). As Table 3.11 indicates agricultural activities – including the plantation crops and land
set aside for conservation are the highest percentages.

Land is considered as the most important and heavily threatened natural resource in the country. Sri
Lanka is a predominantly agricultural nation, while land ownership is considered as a social and
economic status. The agriculture sector is important in the local economy of the country, and is
directly linked to the systematic management of the land under cultivation. At present about 37% of
the people in the country are dependent on land-centered activities, for their sustenance (MOE,

                                                                                                     41
2002). New trends to develop infrastructure and urban centers coupled with migration into city areas
will impact this land use pattern.

The island is not a desertification prone country, yet falls within the context of land degradation and
drought mitigation aspects of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, (UNCCD). It is widely
accepted that land degradation is one of the most critical problems affecting the future economic
development in Sri Lanka. According to the Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (GLASOD), about
50% of land in Sri Lanka is degraded. The area affected by soil fertility decline is 61% of the total
agricultural land. The major contributors to land degradation are soil erosion and soil fertility
degradation. This in turn affects productivity. Over exploitation of ground water, salinization, water
logging and water pollution are also becoming important contributors to land degradation. The
demands of a rapidly expanding population has set up pressures on the island’s natural resources and
these in turn have resulted in a high level of environmental degradation. The more important
manifestations are heavy soil losses; high sediment yields; soil fertility decline and reduction in crop
yields; marginalization of agricultural land; salinization; landslides and deforestation and forest
degradation (MOE, 2000; MOE, 2003: MOE, 2006 and 2007).

Soil erosion is a common problem in the entire country and it has been estimated that nearly one
third of the land in Sri Lanka is subjected to soil erosion, the erodible proportion ranging from less
than 10.0% in some districts to over 50.0% in others. Severe erosion takes place in the hill country on
sloping lands under market gardens (vegetables and potatoes) tobacco, poorly managed seedling tea
and chena cultivation. Soil erosion is also considered a threat to agricultural production in the rain-fed
farming areas in the Dry Zone (MOE, 2000; 2006).

According to the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), about 125,000 ha of land in the hill
country are vulnerable to landslides. Although landslides occur due to various reasons, soil erosion is
one of the main reasons for the occurrence of landslides in the hill country. Landslides frequently
occur during the rainy season in areas with steep slopes and high rainfall. Human activities such as
deforestation and poor land uses have contributed to the increased incidence of landslides (MOE,
2002).

There are a few important ground water sources in Sri Lanka. The Karstic ground water resource
found in the lime stone belt in the Jaffna Peninsula has been exploited for agriculture for over 100
years. In this aquifer, a shallow lens of fresh water is found to float over the saline water. Over
exploitation has led to increased salinity. Intensive agricultural developments in the North western
Province over the last few decades have also caused several problems due to over-exploitation of
ground water and over use of agro chemicals (MOE, 2003; MOE, 2006).

The existence of large number of decision making institutions with complicated legal systems and
overlapping policies had lead limited government interventions to conserve and improve the
productivity of land. Insecure tenure systems, extreme weather conditions including droughts and
floods and haphazard development initiatives are further contributing to land degradation.
Implementation of land conservation activities is generally confined to a few small donor funded
projects. Often, the process initiated by the projects could not be extended to other areas after the
project period due to the non-availability of funds and the discontinuation of incentives offered to the
extension staff and the farmers (MOE, 2000; MOE, 2006).

3.3 The Environmental Legal and Policy Framework in Sri Lanka3

Protecting the environment has been specifically mentioned in Sri Lanka’s constitution. Chapter IV of
the constitution declares State Policy to “protect, preserve and improve the environment for the
benefit of the community” (Guneratne, 2005). Hence guardianship of Sri Lanka’s natural heritage for
its people is vested in the legislative power through elected representatives, the executive powers
through the President and judicial power through courts and other institutions. Article 28 in Chapter
IV also states “that it is the duty of every person in Sri Lanka to protect nature and conserve its riches”
(ibid.). It gives sovereignty of natural resources to the State but the state cannot contravene in the
interests of citizens and does not confer legal rights to either State or citizen. However, it does
provide the foundation to take action when environmental protection has been contravened (ibid.).

    3.3.1 Incorporating environment into the development agenda
Since the 1990s, Sri Lanka has worked to improve the environmental policy and legal frameworks in
the country. Recognition of the need to incorporate environmental safeguards into the plans and
policies governing Sri Lanka’s national development can be seen in the Mahinda Chinthana: A 10 Year
Horizon Development Framework envisions “an economy with a green environment and rapid
development”(DoNP and MoFP, 2010)4.The vision for ‘Environment’ conservation in this document is
to promote sustainable development in close liaison with the land, fauna and flora and to bestow this
natural heritage to future generations - to be achieved through administration based on policies
aimed at conserving the environment, both nationally and internationally. The environmentally
sensitive concepts in the Mahinda Chintana, are reflected in the National Physical Planning Policy and
Plan, which provide a broad framework for economic growth to secure Sri Lanka's place in the global
economy by 2030. The underlying theme is of preserving equilibrium between conservation and
production, such as encouraging urban centre development while protecting areas of environmental
and archaeological significance. Notably, the Plan concurs with the fact that preservation of fragile
areas and the natural environment is important for the sustainable development of the country
(ibid.).

The policy vision in other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, tourism,
urban development, and housing, have taken into account environmental considerations. The overall
policy for science and technology addresses the need to entrench sustainability principles in all
spheres of scientific activities, and to ensure environmental sustainability in all areas of such work.
While seeking to establish regionally equitable economic development, the Mahinda Chintana
envisages a healthy nation that contributes to its economic, social, mental and spiritual well-being.

The current initiative to incorporate environmental integration into other sectors is the “Haritha
Lanka” programme5. This is chaired by the President and provides high-level support to coordinate
sectoral and cross-sectoral environmental activities in keeping with the Mahinda Chintana (NCSD and
PS, 2009). A National Council for Sustainable Development has been established under this
Programme (within the Sustainable Development Division of the Ministry of Environment and

  This type of cross sectoral integration was also tried earlier through the Committees on Environment Policy and
Management (CEPOMs) established as per the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) of 1998-2001. The Haritha
Lanka programme replaces both the NEAP and CEPOMS structure.

                                                                                                               43
Renewable Energy - MoE&RE). This Council is responsible for policy integration, overseeing and
guiding the implementation of the Haritha Lanka Programme to ensure sustainability of socio-
economic development programmes. A large number of state institutions are engaged in a
participatory process to develop the framework and the specific sectoral activities that are the
backbone of the Haritha Lanka programme.

    3.3.2 Environmental Legislative Framework
Sri Lanka’s legal framework was shaped by years of foreign rule, with use of the Roman Dutch Law
influenced by elements of English Law and systems of indigenous laws. Overall, there are over 50 laws
that facilitate management and monitoring of Sri Lanka’s environment for sustainable development
and the main enactments that influence environmental conservation in terms of the five mainGEF
focal areas are given in Table 3.12.

The most important overall legal enactment for environmental protection is the National
Environmental Act (NEA) No. 47 of 1980 and its subsequent amendment in 1988. The NEA provides
the protection, management and enhancement of the environment and for the prevention,
abatement and regulatory control of pollution. It includes a declaration of environmentally sensitive
areas as Environmental Protection Areas (EPAs) where only some types of development are permitted
(MOENR, 2007a,b). Eight EPAs, important either for their biodiversity or wetland value, have been
declared to date (MOENR, 2009). In addition, the NEA has empowered the Central Environment
Authority (CEA) to control environmental pollution and to mitigate the adverse impacts of
development activities through the legally binding Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
procedures for certain prescribed projects and Environmental Protection Licenses (EPL) for pollution
control in industries. It sets standards on ambient water, air quality, mobile source emissions,
industrial emissions, and stationery sound emission which are gazetted by the MOENR (Guneratne,
2005).

The Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (FFPO) implemented by the DWC, the Forest Ordinance
(FO) implemented by the FD, the Coast Conservation Act (CCA) implemented by the Coast
Conservation Department (CCD), the Soil Conservation Act and Plant Protection Act implemented by
the Department of Agriculture (DOA), and the Marine Environment Protection Act implemented by
the Marine Environment Protection Agency (MEPA) are some of main legal instruments that govern
terrestrial, coastal and marine biodiversity conservation and also address genetic resources (MOENR,
2007a). Sri Lanka has also enacted legislation on Intellectual Property Rights (MOE, 2010b).


The FFPO protects animal and plant life within six categories of national reserves managed by the
DWLC. It lists “Protected Species” to be protected wherever they are found. The FO provides
protection for forests areas managed by the FD and has set aside 65 forests (including 15 mangrove
forests) as strict conservation areas (FD, 2012). Recent amendments to both the FO and FFPO have
made preparation of management plans mandatory for all forest and wildlife reserves as well as
providing measures to control the export of wild biodiversity. The FFPO Amendment Act No. 49 of
1993 also addresses “protection against commercial exploitation” which covers commercial access to
indigenous genetic resources. Several other acts enacted for fisheries management, plant protection
and animal husbandry are of relevance for conservation of indigenous fish, crop and livestock
diversity as well as indigenous genetic resources (MOENR, 2007a).



                                                                                                  44
The Coast Conservation Act legislates the governance and management of the coastal zone and
development within it. The Coastal Zone Management Plan (gazetted in 2006) is an important legal
instrument within this Act that provides guidance for habitat and species protection and
management, and pollution control. The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 deals with
ownership, protection and sustainable use of fish and other aquatic resources in marine and inland
areas. The Marine Pollution Prevention Act No.59 of 1981 provides for the prevention, reduction and
control of pollution in Sri Lankan waters, and is instrumental in giving effect to related international
conventions which Sri Lanka is a signatory to (MOENR, 2007a).

The Soil Conservation Act No. 25 of 1951 and its amendments help address land degradation through
improving soil capacity, restoring degraded land, prevention of soil erosion, and protection of land
from damages by floods, droughts, salinity, etc.(MOENR, 2007b.). Under this Act land can be acquired
for conservation purposes under the LAA. Other important laws in this regard are the NEA (Section
22) Flood Protection Ordinance, Irrigation Ordinance and State Lands Ordinance.

Given the context of increasing focus on developing urban spaces in Sri Lanka, it is important to
mention that the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41of 1978 and its amendments promotes the
integrated planning and implementation of social, economic and physical development of areas
declared as “Urban Development Areas (UDAs)”. It provides for development of environmental
standards and schemes for environmental improvement in UDA areas that should be adhered to
(MOENR, 2007a).

* Amendments specified here are not the only amendments to these Acts but are key to conservation

Overall, the existing legal framework offered through periodic revision of laws is adequate for the
conservation of biodiversity, and addressing land degradation and climate change and pollution.
While some laws do overlap, there are no serious contradictions. However, there are serious lapses in
the interpretation of laws leading to considerable divergence of opinion and inconsistent
interpretation. Further, weak law enforcement and the need for institutional and individual capacity
building to meet is a major gap that needs to be addressed with the renewed drive for development
and a heavily infrastructure-oriented vision for Sri Lanka’s future direction.

   3.3.3 International Environmental Commitments
Ensuing political commitment to environmental conservation in Sri Lanka is also reflected in the
ratification of more than 40 Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). The principal MEAs and
the respective National Focal Points are listed in Table 3.13. Among the key environment-related
treaties are the three Rio Conventions: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), and the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) which were ratified by Sri Lanka in 1993, 1994 and

                                                                                                       46
1998 respectively. The Government of Sri Lanka has prioritized implementation of these conventions
and has designated national focal points to meet the requirements at the national level (MOE, 2012).

Several other conventions ratified by Sri Lanka too have a strong bearing on national and global
biodiversity. They include: the Bonn Convention to protect species of wild animals that migrate across
or outside national boundaries; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),
which aims to protect certain endangered species from over-exploitation through trade by a system
of import/export permits; the World Heritage Convention, which establishes an effective system for
collective protection of the cultural and natural heritage of outstanding universal value; the Ramsar
Convention, which seeks to stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of global wetlands; and
the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (stemming from Article 19 of the CBD) to ensure the safe
handling, transport and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology
that may have adverse effects on biological diversity and human health (MoENR, 2007b, MOENR
2009).

Sri Lanka’s commitment to contribute towards the control of global pollution is demonstrate d by its
ratification of the Basel Convention on Control of Trans-boundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes
and for sound in-country management of such wastes, and the Stockholm Convention to eliminate or
restrict the production and use of POPs. Sri Lanka is also a Party to the Vienna Convention to help
protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting from modification of the
Ozone layer, and the Montreal Protocol (as well as the London, Copenhagen and Montreal
amendments) to protect the Ozone layer by taking precautionary measures to control global
emissions from Ozone Depleting Substances. Since Sri Lanka is a “non-Annex 1” developing nation,
there is no direct commitment under the Kyoto protocol to the UNFCCC, but Sri Lanka acceded to it
and volunteered to participate in several CDM projects, especially through the renewable energy
sector (MOENR, 2007b).

Being an island nation, Sri Lanka is also a Party to the UNCLOS which helps set up a comprehensive
legal regime for the sea and oceans and to establish material rules concerning environmental
standards and enforcement provisions dealing with pollution of the marine environment. Sri Lanka
also ratified the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from the ships (1973/78) –
(MARPOL) Convention to preserve the marine environment by eliminating international pollution by
oil and other harmful substances and to minimize the accidental discharge of such substances.

The country is also a party to regional agreements such as the Dhaka Declaration and South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Action Plan on Climate Change, Male Declaration on
trans-boundary air pollution, the South Asian Seas Action Plan. A SAARC Convention on Cooperation
on Environment was also signed by Sri Lanka during the 16th SAARC Summit in Thimphu, April 20106
but has not yet been ratified by all Member States.

As Table16 indicates, Sri Lanka is party to many different types of conventions that address terrestrial,
aquatic and marine biodiversity through conservation, management, trade, etc., as well as addressing
degradation, pollution and emissions from human activities and preservation of heritage. The focal
points clearly show that a majority of the main conventions are handled by the MOE and therefore
the onus is on them to carry out a vast range of activities.

3.3.4 Policies and Actions
The main environmental policy framework is given in Table 3.14. Among them, the NEP of 2003
responds to the constitutional responsibility of providing sound environmental management within a

                                                                                                            48
framework of sustainable development (MOENR, 2003). It addresses environmental dimensions for
conservation and management of four basic groupings of natural resources: land, water, atmosphere
and biological diversity.

The Cleaner Production Policy supports the control of environmental pollution and mitigation of
adverse impacts of development activities through legally binding EPL and EIA procedures respectively
(MOENR, 2007a). Further, standards for effluent discharge into inland surface waters (Gazette
Extraordinary No. 559/16 of February 2nd 1990), standards for ambient air quality (Gazette notification
No. 850/4 of December 20 of 1994) and standards for mobile air emissions (Gazette Extraordinary No.
1137/35 of June 23 2000), (Gunaratne, 2005), and the Solid Waste Management Strategy of 2000,
(MOFE, 2000) serve to enable a cleaner and healthier environment.

Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in Asia to prepare a National Conservation Strategy (NCS) in
1988, as a response to the World Conservation Strategy of 1980. The NCS identified priority areas for
action to deal with environmental degradation in the country. To follow-up on the NCS, the
government prepared the first NEAP of 1991 for the five-year period 1992–1996 (MoENR, 2002). Since
then, there have been several revisions of the NEAP (MOFE, n.d.; MOENR, 2003). The 2008 NEAP,
termed “Caring for the Environment Path to Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2012”, has
separate chapters on biodiversity, forests, wildlife; climate change; coastal and marine resources; land
resources; waste management, and water resources with mechanisms for implementation and
monitoring (MOENR, 2008). This is now replaced with the Haritha Lanka Action Plan launched in
2008.

The Haritha Lanka Action Plan focuses on addressing critical environmental issues which, if left
unattended, would jeopardize the nation’s economic development programme under 10 missions: 1.
Clean air – everywhere, 2. Saving the fauna, flora and ecosystems, 3. Meeting the challenges of
climate change, 4. Wise use of the coastal belt and the sea around, 5. Responsible use of the land
resource, 6. Doing away with dumps, 7. Water for all and always, 8. Green cities for health and
prosperity, 9. Greening the industries, and 10. Knowledge for right choices (NCSD & PS, 2009). The
Haritha Lanka programme is expected to be implemented through the National Sustainable Council
and the Coordinating Committees established for the 10 missions. It includes short term, medium
term, and long term targets spanning 2009 to 2016, with comprehensive list of 82 strategies and 375
actions that are distributed among different agencies.

3.3.5 Institutional Framework
The creation of a separate Cabinet Ministry for environmental affairs in 1990 was a landmark
achievement and currently it is titled as the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy7
(MOE&RE). The MoE&RE is mandated with preparing, monitoring and reporting progress of the NEAP
and its periodic revision to facilitate sustainable development, ensure sound environmental
management, and formulate policies at the national level for environmental protection, management
and monitoring. This ministry also services the large number of international conventions related to
the environment as seen in the above section.

Overall, there are about 50 state institutions involved with some aspect of management and
protection of the environment and natural resources in Sri Lanka (Table 3.15).Chief among them are
the CEA, FD and Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) that function under the MoE&RE;
the DWLC located under the Ministry of Wildlife Resources Conservation; the CCD located under the
Ministry of Ports and Aviation; and the UDA which is under the Ministry of Defence and Urban
Development. The Ministry dealing with Fisheries, the DFAR, the Department of Agriculture (DA), the
Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) and the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) also
have major roles to play in environmental/biodiversity conservation and management.

The Land Use Policy Planning Department and the Land Commissioner General’s Department play a
key role in land management planning. Land management falls within the purview of about 30
institutions, such as the Land Commissioners Department, The Hadabima Authority, The Mahaweli

  Over time the Ministry responsible for the environment has been integrated with other areas such as transport,
women as well as being the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Most recently – in 2013 with the cabinet
shuffle, renewable energy that was under the Ministry or Power and Energy was incorporated into the Ministry
purview.

                                                                                                               50
Authority, and the DA. This highlights some of the complexities entailing land-use planning and land
management. The MOFP, which deals with policy planning and implementation, is the key agency
responsible for formulation of national development policies.

Within the Provinces, there is a decentralized administrative system to accommodate the devolution
of powers vested by the Constitution. This comprises District Secretariats, and under them Divisional
Secretariats which reach out to communities via Grama Niladharis or “village officers”. At the local
level, coordination of all activities is addressed through the District Coordinating Committees chaired
by the District Secretaries and attended by representatives from a range of departments. Many state
departments such as CEA, DWLC and FD also have decentralized their activities for greater
effectiveness and have stationed staff in the Divisional Secretariats. Devolution of environmental
management is also achieved through LAs and they comprise Municipal Councils and Urban Councils
in urban areas, and Pradeshiya Sabhas in rural areas. LAs have a key role to play in management and
improvement of the environment, especially in relation to the built environment, public health, waste
collection and disposal. This also shows the many horizontal and vertical divisions of responsibilities
that exist when addressing environmental management.

Many non-state actor groups also positively influence Sri Lanka’s environment, such as media
institutions (press, TV, radio) and personnel, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), national and regional
environmental NGOs and CBOs. Several private sector business organizations also support
environmental and biodiversity conservation activities under their Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) projects and programmes. These civil society and private sector groups operate at very local
levels as well as in national and international spheres. Some groups are involved in policy formulation
exercises and monitoring committees. The civil society groups are also directly targeted by the GEF
through the SGP.

3.3.6 Coordination and Monitoring
Formerly, the Ministry dealing with environment monitored and coordinated the implementation of
the NEAP through Committees on Environment Policy and Management (CEPOMs). The CEPOMs were
linked to an apex Committee on Integrating Environment and Development (CIEDP) and the decisions
of the CEPOMS were conveyed to the sectoral agencies, a National Environmental Legislation
Enforcement Committee, the PCs and LAs.

The CEPOM system had mixed success. Under the Haritha Lanka programme that replaces the NEAP,
a different structure is proposed. This relies on each sector / department / institution deciding how to
incorporate environmental aspects into their work, while the MOE&RE provides guidance. The Plan is
to be implemented by 36 Ministries and 70 governmental and non-governmental institutions.
Coordinating Committees have been established to cooperate in activities identified. A revision has
been suggested as the activities in the line agencies have changed over time (MOE, 2012). There is no

                                                                                                          53
separate financing mechanism for the implementation of this programme and activities are intended
to be incorporated in the annual budgets of the respective state institutions.

The National Physical Policy and Plan provides the policy framework for integrated physical planning
in the country. As its principles and strategies are implemented by a number of line ministries and
specialist authorities, the National Physical Planning Department has to ensure that any new or
amended policy or plan of Government takes account of, and is consistent with, the National Physical
Policy and Plan (NPPD & MUDSAD, 2007). Inconsistency between policies and laws, and the National
Physical Policy and Plan are required to be amended in consultation with the National Physical
Planning Department, and issues that may arise must be resolved by the National Physical Planning
Council (ibid.).

While it is a positive factor that many institutions are mandated for environmental management and
conservation, this requires a very efficient and effective coordination mechanism for environmental
policy and plan formulation and implementation of activities and projects. However, much of the
inter-institutional coordination relied (and continues to rely) on membership of advisory, expert
committees and/or steering Committees for environment related projects, programmes and activities.
Gaps in capacity and ownership and differences in terms of sectoral and environmental agendas also
limit integrated activities. The GEF funded National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment (NCSA) (GEF ID
2417)clearly showed the need for capacity building to effectively coordinate and integrate actions
pertaining to environmental conservation.

3.3.7 Timeline analysis
The timeline showing Sri Lanka’s commitment to global conventions, formulation of national
environment related laws, policies and plans, and GEF-funded projects reveals noteworthy links.

•   The GEF/WB project for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Medicinal Plants (GEF ID 95)
    followed Sri Lanka’s ratification of the CBD in 1994. It directly enabled meeting obligations under
    Article 6a of the CBD. More importantly, the ensuing consultations and other wide ranging
    activities conducted by the Ministry for Environment during preparation of the Biodiversity
    Conservation Action Plan (BCAP) catalyzed:
    o The establishment of a dedicated Biodiversity Secretariat within the Environment Ministry.
    o Addressing sustainable use of terrestrial biological resources and coastal and marine
         resources in the third National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) of 1998-2001, and
         biodiversity conservation (as per the BCAP) in later NEAPs (MoENR, 2003; MoENR, 2008).
    o Attention on conservation of traditional varieties of crops was introduced into the Agriculture
         Research Plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands 2000-2008 (DoA/DEA/SLCARP, 1999),
         that is now part of the National Agricultural Policy of 2007 (MoAAS, 2007).
•   The GEF/UNDP funded Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) spanning 2000-2006 was instrumental in
    pioneering a model for participatory forest conservation in the Wet Zone. Other influences of the
    rainforest conservation project are as follows:
    o The 2009 amendment to the Forest Ordinance to empower the Conservator General of
        Forests to engage with stakeholders in carrying out community participatory programmes for
        forest development could have been influenced by this project.
    o Attitudinal change in the FD to move away from strict protection and policing to adaptive
        management and participatory conservation for long-term protection of the reserves.



                                                                                                    54
•   The GEF/WB funded Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management
    Project (GEF ID 352) carried out by the DWLC from 1992-1998 is likely to have influenced (a) the
    Fauna and Flora Protection (amendment) Act of 1993, which ensured better coverage of species
    to be protected by law, and (b) the first National Wildlife Policy of 2000.

•   Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) implemented from
    2001-2008 was directly responsible for:
    o The 2009 amendment to the FFPO which made it mandatory for preparation of management
        plans for all wildlife reserves.
    o Preparation of the 2007 Addendum to the BCAP, which focused on issues that had emerged
        as significant national and global issues since the 1999 BCAP. These include threats from alien
        invasive species and biosafety with some follow up actions funded by GEF (GEF ID 2472 -
        Strengthening Capacity to Control the Introduction and Spread of Alien Invasive Species and -
        Development of National Biosafety Frameworks - GEF ID 875).
    o Institutionalizing the Red Listing of nationally threatened species within the Ministry of
        Environment and the National Herbarium of the National Botanic Gardens at Peradeniya
        (IUCN and MoENR, 2007; MoE & DNBG,2012 b).

•   It is noteworthy that one year after the commencement of the Biosafety GEF enabling activity
    (Biosafety framework Project- GEF ID 875), Sri Lanka became Party to the Cartagena Protocol on
    Biosafety. Sri Lanka also developed a biosafety policy in 2011.

•   GEF enabling activities such as the National Capacity Self Needs Assessment Project of 2005/06
    (GEF ID 2417) directly served to identify the need for a functional (ABS) regime in Sri Lanka which
    led to it being prioritized for national GEF-4 and GEF-5 cycles (MoENR, 2006c; MoE, 2012).

•   During the GEF-funded POPs enabling activity to develop a national implementation plan 2002 –
    2006 (GEF - ID 1777), Sri Lanka ratified the Stockholm Convention in 2005. This put POPs on the
    environmental agenda in Sri Lanka and led to the formation of a POPs unit in the Ministry of
    Environment.

•   Sri Lanka ratified the UNCCD in 1998, and this probably led to the commencement of preparation
    of a Land Use Policy in 2002; however it was only finalized in 2007.

•   The GEF enabling activities under UNFCCC have resulted in a stock taking exercise (in 2000), and
    the identification of priority areas under climate change. However, the climate policies and
    adaptation strategies were formulated much later (in 2010) – without GEF support. Climate
    change activities were initially handled by the global affairs/air resources management unit in the
    Ministry of Environment, but with increasing importance awarded to this issue, a separate
    Climate Change Secretariat and a Sri Lanka Carbon Fund was created in 2008 within the MoE.

•   The projects addressing Renewable Energy (GEF ID 104, 425 and 1545) have assisted with
    increasing the use of renewables and thereby contributing to reducing emissions. In 2004, the
    government established a procedure for tariff setting to facilitate selling of energy to the grid
    (used mainly for Mini hydro) and a regulatory mechanism to manage off-grid renewable energy
    systems. On the back of these projects the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority was established
    in 2010 and has taken over the promotion and management of Renewable energy in Sri Lanka.

3.4 The Global Environmental Facility: General Description

The Global Environment Facility was established in October 1991 as a pilot program in the World Bank
to specifically address environmental conservation and sustainable development. In 1994 it was
restructured into a separate institution with the World Bank as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund. The
type of funding GEF provides is new and additional grants and concessional funding that covers
"incremental" or additional costs that are intended to transform a project with national benefits into
one with global environmental benefits.

The GEF provides funding to achieve global environmental benefits in the focal areas of biodiversity,
climate change, international waters, depletion of the ozone layer, POPs, and land degradation, in
accordance to the respective international agreements and conventions. Hence it provides assistance
for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to meet its obligations to several
conventions: the (CBD), the (UNFCCC) and the Stockholm Convention on (POPs), the (UNCCD) and the
Kyoto Protocol.

The GEF Secretariat coordinates the overall implementation of GEF activities. Within each country GEF
activities are managed through 8 GEF Agencies. The World Bank, UNDP, UNEP were the original
Implementing agencies. Over the years it has expanded to include the African Development Bank
(ADB), International Finance Corporation (IFC), GEF Secretariat, the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), the IFAD, and the UNIDO. These agencies provide guidance for project preparation, project
management and monitoring.

Each participating country nominates a GEF Operational Focal Point to coordinate and monitor
projects at the State level, and a GEF political focal point for policy matters. In Sri Lanka, both the GEF
political and the operational focal point sit in the Ministry of Environment and are the Minister and
the Under-Secretary respectively.

Since GEF support is incremental - meaning it is expected to catalyze funding from many sources for
the achievement of global environmental benefits - a co-financing model is used where GEF support is
leveraged with other financing for achieving national objectives. Co-financing can come from other
donors, state and non-state actors. GEF support modalities include the following:

   Full-size projects (FSP) have funding of more than $1 million and can be accessed by government
    agencies and NGOs with demonstrated capacity. Partnerships between Government and other
    groups can also apply.
   Medium-size projects (MSP) have a maximum funding of $1 million and can be accessed by
    government agencies, NGOs, academics, research institutions etc.
   Small grants are less than $50,000, and are directed to NGOs and local Organizations.
   Enabling activities (EA) provide up to $500,000 to help countries meet their obligations under the
    various conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism. This includes support for
    developing environmental policies, strategies, action plans and capacity assessments.
   Project preparation grants (PPGs; formerly known as project development facility [PDF] grants),
    provide funding for the preparation and development of projects

The GEF officially began with a two-year pilot phase from 1992 to 1994. This was followed by three
regular four-year replenishment periods: GEF-1 (1995–98), GEF-2 (1999–2002), GEF-3 (2003–06), and

                                                                                                        57
GEF-4 (2006–10). In July 2010, GEF-5 was initiated; it continues through June 2014. GEF-6 is supposed
to be initiated in July 2014 and will continue through June 2018. Country allocation systems were
introduced from the GEF-4 phase (RAF, replaced by the STAR in GEF-5); before that eligible GEF
member countries submitted their requests to the various windows through the different GEF
Agencies on a demand basis.

CHAPTER 4. The GEF portfolio in Sri Lanka
4.1 Defining the GEF Portfolio

The GEF portfolio commenced in Sri Lanka in 1992 with the pilot phase and as of end of December
2012, the portfolio consists of 23 national projects, 330 small grants, 3 regional and 9 global projects.
The total financial investment in the national projects is $396 million with GEF funding amounting to
15% (US$60 million) and co-financing from various sources including donors and the government
amounting 85% (US$ 336 million) (table 4.1). Additional to this the SGP has provided grants
amounting to US$ 9.8 million, of which GEF support accounted for 66% (US$ 6.5 million) and 34% (US$
3.3 million) from co-financing by the grantees. In terms of regional and global projects the percentage
allocated to Sri Lanka cannot be extracted. GEF Agency fees are not included in these figures.

4.2 Projects in the GEF Portfolio

4.2.1 National Projects
The GEF supported national projects in Sri Lanka consists of very small investments for enabling
activities to large scale full-size projects. In the 23 national projects in the system up until 2012, 14
have been completed, 4 are implementation, 4 at approval and 1 at proposal stage. The project details
on its identification, Implementing Agency, focal area, the type of the project, stage are shown in table
4.2.More details are given in Annex H. The older projects show a level of homogeneity in terms of the
biodiversity projects addressing protected area/forest area management and the climate change
projects addressing renewable energy. GEF 4 expands the national biodiversity projects’ focus to
address Alien Invasive Species and Agro Biodiversity (Strengthening Capacity to Control the
Introduction and Spread of Alien Invasive Species GEF ID 2472 and Mainstreaming Agro-biodiversity
Conservation and Use in Sri Lankan Agro-ecosystems for Livelihoods and Adaptation to Climate
Change (GEF ID 4150). While the energy focus under Climate change has extends to bio-
energy/biomass related projects: Promoting Sustainable Biomass Energy Production and Modern Bio-
Energy Technologies (GEF ID 4096), Bamboo Processing for Sri Lanka (GEF ID 4114).

The national portfolio also shows a skewed distribution of the type of projects with 13FSPs, 3 MSP and
7 enabling activities. There has not been a transition from enabling activities to Medium to Full Scale
projects over time. Yet some of these large Projects such as on the Conservation and Sustainable Use
of Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95) and both the Wildlife Conservation and Protected Area
Management projects (GEF ID 352, GEF ID 878) included development of action plans, capacity
building, baseline studies, etc. that are generally undertaken as enabling activities.

4.2.2 Regional Projects
Sri Lanka is part of three regional projects in the areas of biodiversity and International waters (details
given in Table 4.3). The information available does not provide an analysis of the allocation for
investments made only for Sri Lanka. The project on Conservation of Crop Wild Relatives (GEF ID 1259)
has been completed, whilst the other two projects are under implementation. These projects show
linkages with other important sectors such as agriculture and livestock management as well as new
area of work such as conservation genetic material. It also includes the only International waters
project for Sri Lanka. However there are many projects that have been dropped. Interestingly the
dropped projects show considerable variation and widening of the scope of project topics and
interventions.

4.2.3 Global Projects
Sri Lanka has been part of eight global projects in biodiversity, climate change, land degradation and
multi focal, with none under implementation and 6 projects in GEF-4 and GEF-5 still at the approval
stages (Table 4.4). The last two rounds of global projects also include the allocations for SGP. The
global projects show expansion or linkages to the national level renewable energy projects with
project promoting solar and wind (- Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment- GEF ID 1281).
Projects in the pipeline increase the focus on the marine ecosystem with a project that is aimed at
conserving the dugong that is rated as a species vulnerable to extinction (- Enhancing the
Conservation Effectiveness of Sea-grass Ecosystems Supporting Globally Significant Populations of
Dugong across the Indian and Pacific Oceans Basins - GEF ID 4930). The global projects also show
wider scope into connecting conservation, sustainable use and human wellbeing by tackling issues
such as nutrition (- Mainstreaming Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use for Improved
Human Nutrition and Well-being -GEF ID 3808).

4.2.4 Small Grants Programme
The GEF SGP in Sri Lanka commenced in 1994. Since then it has developed into a fully operational
programme and is now in its fifth operational phase and there was a delay in receiving the funds for
2013 (round three under GEF 5)8. During the eighteen year period from 1994 to 2012, 330 GEF
projects have been implemented in Sri Lanka amounting to US$ 9,767,815 of which US$ 6,458,815 is
GEF support and US$ 3,309,000 is co-financing either in cash of in kind by the grantees. There was also
a special allocation for capacity building in GEF-5. In addition although there was no financial
allocation by GEF, the GEF-SGP office administered the following small grants schemes:

      Community Water initiative (CWI): Sri Lanka was one of the ten countries to receive funds from
       CWI, towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals related to water supply.

      Mekong Asia Pacific/Community Based Adaptation (MAP/CBA): this initiative provided assistance
       for implementing community level climate change adaptation activities.

      Tsunami reconstruction: for rehabilitation and reconstruction of destroyed habitats and
       infrastructure in the aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami.

According to the GEF-SGP the grants have reached approximately 300 NGOs both national and local,
old established organizations and new organizations that work around the island except in Vavuniya,
Mullativu, Killinochchi and Mannarareas affected by conflict and inaccessible until 2009. Hence there
were no well-functioning environmental focused civil society groups in the area. However this
situation is changing and GEF SGP is looking to engage civil society groups in these areas in the new
funding rounds.

4.3 Evolution of GEF Support by Focal Area

Overall at the national level there have been an equal number of Biodiversity and Climate Change
projects but the whole portfolio shows a stronger support for biodiversity projects at least in terms of
the number of projects. The graphs (Chart 4.1) below also show that MFAs have been an important

                                                                                                               63
part of the portfolio while projects on Land degradation, POPs and International water are very few.
The focus on land degradation has benefitted from the GEF SGP coverage and shows its importance at
a local level.

Note: The percentages are based on the number of projects.

Chart 5 shows the status of projects in the portfolio. There are quite a few projects at implementation
stage in the national projects while at the regional and global level there are more projects in the
approval stage. The projects in implementation and approval stage include projects from both GEF 4
and GEF 5 and show an overlap of these implementation cycles. Dropped projects are mainly regional
projects.

Chart 4.2: Stages of the GEF projects– 1991 – 2012




Note: The percentages are based on the number of projects.

In terms of resources tied to different stages of the cycle in the national portfolio it can be seen that
there is a large amount of climate change funds at approval stage, while a very small amount for
Biodiversity Projects (Table 24). During the final stages of this evaluation it has been indicated that the
biomass project (GEF ID 4096) has been approved. Other Focal areas show that there are no projects
in the pipeline for GEF 4 and 5.

The financial allocations shown in table 4.6 indicate that both climate change and bio-diversity
projects have been provided nearly equivalent amounts of funds, whilst projects related to Persisting
Organic Pollutants being provided the least amount of funding and for an Enabling Activity.

Chart 4.3 shows the GEF 2 stage has a major spike in funding in both climate change and biodiversity.
This is largely due to two projects. The Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project
(GEF ID 878) in Biodiversity and the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project (GEF
ID 1545) under Climate Change. The graph also shows the transition in focus from biodiversity to
climate change through the phases.

CHAPTER 5. Results of GEF Support to Sri Lanka
5.1 Overview

GEF support has contributed to fulfilling some requirements under the international conventions such
as reporting, assessments and preparation of action plans through enabling activities. The completed
MSPs and FSPs have focused on implementing changes that would contribute to the objectives of the
conventions on achieving Global Environmental Benefits (GEBs). Enabling activities for climate change,
land degradation, biosafety, POPS have also happened as separate projects and have been geared
towards meeting obligations under the various conventions. Table 5.1 provides input from each of the
completed projects and its contribution to fulfilling international requirements and aiding global
benefits. Overall the focus has been on two focal areas – biodiversity and climate change.

In terms of biodiversity, the main contribution has been to improve the management of protected
areas that span terrestrial and coastal protected areas in both the wet and the dry zones, which have
contributed to the protection of globally valuable species and habitats. This has been aided by resource
mapping (baselines, inventories, national red listing, etc.), preparation of action plans (BCAP and its
addendum, gap analysis) and direct implementation of institutional and management processes such as
restructuring institutions, skills development, infrastructure development, enhancing management tools
and styles.

In terms of climate change, while there have been efforts towards improving the information base for
planning climate change mitigation through enabling activities, the most significant result has been
the increase in the use of renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind) that has contributed to greenhouse
gas reduction. However, GEF support has not extended to transport, agriculture or waste related
emissions that are also significant contributors to Sri Lanka’s greenhouse gases. While emissions from
biomass, mainly due to domestic use, has also not been addressed at a national level, it has been
addressed in a number of SGP projects that have addressed better stove and kitchen designs.

With regards to the enabling activities, the national capacity self-assessment (GEF ID 2417) process
was a critical step to identify the priority capacity development needs and synergies across sectors to
assist with the implementation of three conventions, namely the UNCBD, the UNFCCC and the UNCCD.
This country-led process concluded that, while capacity was indeed a shortfall, weak law enforcement,
lack of coordination and communication among institutions/agencies, and poor private sector
involvement were all impeding the achievement of better results under these focal areas. However,
the remedial measures identified through wide consultation during the NSCA have not been
adequately addressed so far, mainly due to funding constraints and lack of a coordination mechanism
to track and push these activities.

5.2 Results by Theme

5.2.1 Participatory Management of Protected Areas
Under the biodiversity projects one of the key features of the GEF supported projects has been to pilot
test and develop participatory models for improved management of protected areas with community
participation. This concept was applied in several projects addressing forests, wildlife and coastal
protected areas. Essentially, the key components of this model are setting up of CBOs to provide
livelihood support through micro-finance and training, supported by awareness creation on biodiversity
and conservation. These have clearly demonstrated potential for better cooperation and support for
biodiversity conservation from communities that will result in better protection of natural resources. It
was also expected that the agencies responsible for conservation and protection (in this case the FD,
DWLC and CCD) would apply this model in their future management approaches.

The model implemented by the Forest Department in the Conservation of Globally Threatened Species
in the Rainforests of Southwest Sri Lanka (GEFID 818) was rated by the stakeholders as being successful
in achieving the desired change of reducing illegal activities and over extraction within the protected
area. It is accepted as a successful management approach by the department and now applied to other
projects and programmes. Furthermore, this model was also used to successfully redesign and
implement the community activities (referred in the project as Component D) of the Protected Area
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878). The initial design of this component had
an independent NGO undertaking these activities, which was not successful. Therefore, the forestry
model used mobilisers which were trained to work in the project under the management of the
department/project was applied successfully. This change in approach was aided by the transfer of
knowledge via staff common to both projects. Both the coastal projects Coastal Biodiversity Project
(GEF ID 802) and the East Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753) have also applied a similar participatory
management component as a part of the SAM projects undertaken by the CCD.

The results of the ROtI studies of the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) and the Protected Area
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) and additional data from the MAB review9
show that the three components – the awareness raised, the livelihood support, and the change in
attitude towards participatory management of the Department Officials –supported the achievement
of improved results in relation to the participatory management approach. The community based
activities and links developed with the departmental officials have led to communities continuing to
keep vigilance on the forests/protected areas. Illegal activities such as logging and encroachment have
reduced to a great extent in both the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) and Protected Areas Management
and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878). The reduction of illegal activities is also aided by
boundary marking and electric fences. Such physical activities are regular operational activities of
these Departments. However, poaching in some Protected Areas (under Protected Areas and Wildlife
Conservation Project - GEF ID 878) is reported to have increased as compared to the status at the end
of the project. This is seen to be a consequence of the reduced interaction between the community
and the wildlife officials.

 This evaluation incorporated information from parallel field work done under the periodic MAB (Man and Biosphere)
review commissioned by the National Science Foundation. The MAB review used some of the ROtI data gathering and
analysis tools.

                                                                                                               69
Replication of this participatory management approach has had mixed results. While all projects
acknowledge that this type of management has some benefits for the community resulting in better
protection, it is not a concept that has been integrated into all departments equally. The FD shows the
greatest buy-in. The concept of community based management was one that the FD was interested in
and the model had been proposed in several management plans as a response to the 1995 Forest
Policy and Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP). The drive for this project thus came from within the FD.
It was administered and managed closely by department staff and this helped to create ownership of
the project. This also necessitated an attitudinal change for the officials of the department – moving
from a policing model to a more collaborative one. This aspect is seen as a highly satisfactory
achievement of the project. The need to maintain relationships, provide some benefits to the
community and involve the communities in the conservation effort has been absorbed into the
operational style of the FD. The community mobilisers recruited for the project have been retained as
Education Officers. Their job role is to maintain links and carry out activities with the communities, with
some ear-marked funds for awareness and training. The same model has been applied by AusAid
funded projects on community forestry (under the SLANRMP) and some new initiatives have been
undertaken by the FD in the Knuckles range and Hambantota.

Although the Coast Conservation Department has adopted a participatory approach in all the Special
Area Management Sites (SAM sites) these activities are dependent on external funding. Hence
mobilisers are hired when needed for a project and it not a regular post in the CCD. In the Wildlife
Department, the replication of this model in other protected areas has not happened, although general
awareness programmes are conducted. While some regular field staff at project sites are making an
effort to maintain links with the CBOs and communities involved in the Protected Areas Management
and Wildlife Conservation Project (Project ID 878), the outreach officers from the department that
worked with the project staff are no longer in these parks. Further, the project staff who were trained
in social mobilization and who worked closely with the CBOs were not recruited into the permanent
staff cadre after the project ceased, suggesting a lower commitment to this type of management
approach.

5.2.2 Linking environmental conservation to livelihoods
Another aspect of the participatory management model worth exploring is the livelihood component.
The aim of community level interventions was to engage the community in conservation while also
improving their livelihoods and offering them an alternative to livelihood practices that endanger
Protected Areas. The projects tried out have shown that the ability to offer loan schemes, training, and
viable alternatives can lead to conservation benefits. In the Rainforest Project (GEF ID 818) the villagers
who were cultivating tea on the boundaries of the forest were given training to improve their
productivity within the available land without expanding the extent of their cultivation. In addition,
they were given advice on the use of fertilizers and newly improved tea varieties to improve
productivity. Financial support was given through the revolving funds, offered to CBOs as credits, to
enhance cultivation or establish tea nurseries. Communities and officials of the FD state that these
interventions did result in greater income from tea and has resulted in minimizing encroachment in the
project areas. The community members state that similar training on livelihoods should continue
periodically to ensure the continuation of benefits to the next generation and to recruit new members
to the CBOs.

Other popular livelihood options were those that were not connected to natural resources such as
driving, setting up small businesses, sewing etc. but reduced dependency on forest resources. It also
indicates a change in the relationship with the forests and changes in society. Interestingly, livelihoods

                                                                                                        70
that are linked to more non-destructive natural resource use, such as tourism, have had limited
benefits. A few community members living close to the entrances tend to benefit from this in the form
of guiding or providing accommodation, handicrafts, food items etc. In the case of the Wildlife
protected areas where services are mainly in the form of jeep drivers, the community states that this
has mainly benefitted outsiders due to the investment needed to hire and maintain the vehicles. Hence
this aspect of livelihoods development is rated as less successful. In the Coastal Biodiversity Project(GEF
ID 802) similar issues with the lack of widespread benefits to the community was noted. A few
community members who were engaged in collection of turtle eggs were influenced to become guides
in the turtle conservation beach areas, but it has limited capacity. Another downside of the livelihood
activities highlighted has been the giving of individual loans leaving room for misuse and non-payment
of the loans. This is also one of the reasons for the CBOs to stop functioning especially if there is no
state officer to monitor the progress of the CBO activities.

SGP projects have particularly focused on combining the livelihood option with natural resources for
sustainable management. By definition, the livelihood components had indeed contributed to conserve
natural resources on a local level. Some have resulted in marketable products (energy efficient stoves,
traditional rice, rush and reed products, vegetables, other food products) while others have gained
income through a change in practices (ecotourism, land use planning and home gardens). Some of the
projects have been recognized locally and internationally as good models (i.e. the rush and reed project
and the traditional yams project). The UNDP SGP office stated that around 60% can be seen as
successful and lasting beyond GEF funding. They also state that scaling up and increasing benefits have
been problematic.

In the energy projects, the contribution to livelihoods and increased local economic development and
employment was an objective but it was not well achieved. The completion report of the Rural
Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) indicates that the benefit to the enterprises that connected to
the grid was that they could operate for a longer period of time, but since they were largely family
owned enterprises, did not have an impact on enhancing employment in the area as expected.
Nevertheless, the project made a contribution to increased wellbeing of the households.

5.2.3 Building on past experiences
A number of projects have built on previous projects, resulting in funding being available over a longer
period of time. These include the Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF
ID 878) and the Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management Project (GEF ID 352); the Rural
Renewable Energy Project (GEF ID 1545) that followed on Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID 104),
that has also been followed by the newer project still in the pipeline on Promoting Sustainable Biomass
Energy Production and Modern Bio-Energy Technologies (GEF ID – 4096). Some projects have also
linked to other projects (past and on-going) or follow-up projects for greater continuity and resource
pooling such as the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) that was continued by the Coastal
Resources Management Project (CRMP) funded by the Netherlands. Another example is the East Coast
Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753) which was linked with an on-going project the “Post Tsunami Coastal
Rehabilitation and Resources Management Programme” (PTCRRMP) funded by IFAD. In this instance,
the PTCRRMP project was supposed to provide administrative support to the East Coast Tsunami
project. However, due to the three consecutive changes of the Line Ministry for the Lead Project
Agency this was not possible and a small project implementation unit with a part time manager
administering the East Coast Project was set up as a result. Mid way into the implementation this
situation has been rectified and since January 2013 a full time Project Manager has been assigned.


                                                                                                        71
The most successful of the follow-on projects have been the renewable energy projects with results
lasting beyond the life of the project. The ESD and RERED projects were two of the largest projects in
the renewable energy sector – involving both the WB and private sector. The acceptance of renewable
energy as a viable energy source and one that is a part of Sri Lanka’s energy mix has been established
and was aided by the investment models, tariff structures, and capacity building that was carried out by
this project. Committed groups – in terms of energy professionals, associations, community societies,
private sector along with the State (SLSEA) – continue lobbying for renewable energy in the country.

In the SGP there are many instances where consecutive grants have been provided to the same
beneficiary group for some initiatives to move from developing a technology or sustainable
intervention, to demonstrating it in different areas, and to enhancing or adding value to it10.One such
example was the development of a cleaner and more efficient cooking stove and the use of subsequent
grants to work on marketing the stove and then to offer a whole kitchen unit to combat indoor
pollution. Other similar examples have been done for conservation and marketing of rush and reeds
products and another project that addressed tuber varieties. The SGP national staff raised the issue of
the limitations imposed by one year funding cycles that do not provide adequate time to develop
systems and products, make an impact on environmental systems and show adequate change.

5.2.4 Ad-hoc Sharing of Lessons
One of the reasons for the ad-hoc sharing of lessons is seen to be the lack of a central repository of
information of the projects and lack of regular sharing of project information among national executing
agencies and GEF Agencies. The same phenomenon is observed with SGP projects. This is seen as a
reason for the lack of collaboration (vertically and horizontally) and lack of familiarity with the projects
among the executing agencies. Hence, the impact and spread of activities is seen to be affected.

The new projects such as the Strengthening Capacity to Control the Introduction and Spread of Alien
Invasive Species (GEF ID 2472), Promoting Sustainable Biomass Energy Production and Modern Bio-
Energy Technologies (GEF ID 4096) and Mainstreaming Agro-biodiversity Conservation and Use in Sri
Lankan Agro-ecosystems for Livelihoods and Adaptation to Climate Change (GEF ID 3808) have specific
activities/budgets allocated for the dissemination of lessons learnt. They also show cross-sectoral
topics (i.e. combining agriculture, land use, climate change, and energy with biodiversity) and
institutional links that also could mean greater sharing of lessons. It is too early to say what the impact
of this greater attention to lessons learnt and dissemination will be, as these projects are still in the
early stages of implementation.


5.3 Institutional Sustainability and Capacity Building

Most projects have had capacity building components for executing agencies as well as other
stakeholders involved in the implementation. The types of capacity building have ranged from
sponsoring formal university education (Masters and PhDs), improving training curriculums, hands-on
training through work with consultants and the project, technical training (demand side management,
ecotourism, medicinal herb processing), and administrative training. Training has also been given for
mobilization and managing community initiatives. Communities have been given training on
conservation/energy issues, managing CBOs, and improving and starting new livelihoods.

10
 Out of the 26 grantees who attended the information gathering workshop, 21 have received GEF grants more than
once and the grants had been used for similar projects but also for new activities.

                                                                                                           72
Lasting impacts of the capacity building initiatives can be seen in the renewable energy sector. The
targeted training demand side management strategies have been established and energy audit skills
and DSM monitoring and evaluation skills are actively used by the Energy Service Companies (ESCOs).
There have been instances when they have taken this expertise to Asia and Africa. These companies are
registered under the SLSEA and continue to be involved in the energy sector. In addition, there are
local technicians involved in the production and installation of micro- and mini- hydro schemes within
the country. The electricity consumer societies mobilized and strengthened under the GEF-supported
energy projects also continue to function and lobby for renewable energy.

In the Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) one of the main
objectives was institutional strengthening of the DWLC. There was a shortage of qualified staff for most
staff positions and this project focused largely on this issue, as enhancing capacity was considered a
critical need to enable better management of wildlife reserves and the species they contain.

The project expected to strengthen human resources, financial and administrative capacity (including
infrastructure such as a building, communication equipment and a MIS), and transparent management
system of DWLC in order to improve its credibility and effectiveness in managing wildlife. One of the
key components was to include a decentralized system with regional offices that could make decisions
about work objectives, resource needs, and work programmes with decentralized budgets to increase
the efficiency of PA operations. The project also looked to improve the fauna and flora protection
ordinance to enhance protected area management. The ultimate aim of this was to improve the
management structure and style to increase efficiency in a relatively new institution.

The restructuring created a range of new units and Deputy Directors at the head office. However as
there was internal resistance to new recruits to fill many of the newly created posts, they were filled by
existing staff on an acting basis as a temporary measure to enable successful project implementation.
In mid-2013, some of these positions are still vacant (i.e. Director Protected Area Management) and
some are still on acting basis (i.e. Deputy Director Outreach). While the appointment of Regional
Deputy Directors (RDD) was a main feature of the restructuring effort, and took place at the latter
stages of the project, this too was done without adequate funds from the project to set up staff in
these offices. At the time of writing this report, the DWLC stated that the RDDs appointed have been
promoted and moved to head office and the positions are now vacant. Hence, there are only assistant
directors at regional level, so that approvals have to revert back to the head office, which reduces the
impact of decentralization. No indication was given if new RDDs will be appointed. Some stakeholders
feel that there was no commitment to the decentralized structure. It has to be noted that, during the
time of the project and since then, the DWLC was transferred under the purview of several Ministries;
this too was stated as one of the reasons for the disruption in the smooth flow of operations.

With a delayed start, annual work plans were formulated and accounting procedures were established.
The borrower’s project completion report states that the accounting has been very good. A
communication network was established to increase efficiency of management, but field work
indicated that some are not functioning in some parks and the equipment is not maintained. The
computerizing of budgets and tourism figures has helped to improve efficiency.

Overall the training did improve the professional workforce. It was also a motivator that provided
personal growth opportunities. Stakeholders acknowledge that some individuals continue to use the
skills and training to improve the parks at both headquarters and local level. The development of

                                                                                                       73
management plans was done by officers in the respective parks and this developed their capacity to
develop plans which was seen in their ability to prepare similar plans for other projects – as reported
by the WB. As the attrition of trained staff from state agencies is low, it can be presumed that the
knowledge remains within the organization and can be mobilized to enhance implementation of future
projects. However, the continuous rotation of staff can result in discontinuity of the activities in the
pilot parks. Trained VSEs have been transferred out to places where there are no such facilities. While
the capacity developed cadre of community mobilisers was not absorbed into the DWLC and the
training benefits have been lost to the department. However, overall the training component is seen to
have been a driver in improving the DWLC’s ability to manage Protected Areas. Training remains part of
the regular activities of the department and it has absorbed some of the training modules developed
under this project.

The SGP national coordinator indicated that the GEF funding has helped to build capacity at community
level for the concepts related to the focal points as well as on writing funding proposals and speaking
on conservation issues at local and foreign forums. The SGP grantees acknowledge the support of the
UNDP GEF secretariat to help build skills and provide guidance to improve projects. The SGP projects
have also helped to build a body of knowledge and a civil society network that is able to lobby for
issues related to the environment. Some are being consulted in relation to environmental policies and
programmes such as the Climate Change Adaptation Policy and for the management of Alien Invasive
Species. This knowledge is also spread across most parts of the country within local organizations.
Programmes in the North and East regions were markedly less and therefore the capacity has not
spread to these areas due to the lack of organizations in those areas following the war. The project
acknowledges that this is an area where improvements are needed.

The East Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753) needed to invest in capacity building as coastal
restoration was a new area of work for the various project stakeholders. The lack of in-house technical
capacity in the CCD has hindered work in this area. However attention is being given under this project
to increase this capacity by providing for training and setting up technical coordinating committee with
the view to set up an Ecosystem Restoration and Adaptation Unit in the CCD Progress at the time of the
monitoring mission (November 2012) carried out by IFAD, for all activities under components 1 and 2
related to ecosystem restoration and climate adaptation states that this aspect of the work is
moderately unsatisfactory.


5.4 Results by GEF Focal Area

5.4.1 Biodiversity
Responding to the need for conserving the biological wealth of Sri Lanka, GEF support from the
inception has focused on biodiversity. Biodiversity projects have been linked to both the development
of Action Plans (Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan prepared under the Medicinal Plants Project –
GEF ID 95 and an addendum to the Action Plan prepared through the Protected Area Management and
Wildlife Conservation Project – GEF ID 878) as well as to overall protected area/forest/coast
management plans identified by the line agencies (Wildlife and Protected Areas Management Project –
GEF ID 352 and Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project – GEF ID 878 for
improved protected area management; the Rainforest Project – GEF ID 818 for participatory forest
conservation with communities; and Coastal Biodiversity Project– GEF ID 802 for special area
management with community participation). Over the time period the support has enabled attention
to emerging subjects such as sustainable use of bio resources (Medicinal Plants Project -GEF ID 95),

                                                                                                     74
genetic resources (Indigenous Livestock and Wild Relatives Project - GEF ID 1902) control of alien
invasive species (Alien Invasive Species Project – GEF ID 2472), Bio-safety (Biosafety Framework Project
– GEF ID 875), Agro-biodiversity (Agro-biodiversity and Climate Change Project – GEF ID 4150), and wild
crops (Crop Wild Relatives Project – GEF ID 1259). These projects, excluding the one addressing
biosafety, have all been demonstration projects thereby providing hands-on experience on the topics
and assisting in developing national capacities.

In the biodiversity projects, the continuation of the changes and processes put in place once the project
has been completed is dependent on internal budgets and ownership as well as additional project
funding. New investment has not been regular and activities have continued in a scaled down manner,
due to scarce budgetary allocations. However, some activities are being continued such as the
participatory forest management by the FD, the continued strengthening of boundary marking and the
establishment of electric fences by both the FD and DWLC. Some activities such as the maintenance of
park infrastructure show variations amongst the parks. Some sites are maintaining the infrastructure to
a fair degree while other sites show a deterioration in the facilities – both the visitor centres and living
quarters and in many cases the communication equipment and vehicles are also not in a useable state.

GEF SGP – Contribution to Biodiversity and livelihoods
When asked to describe the contribution of the SGP programme to environmental management the
stakeholders attending the focus group discussion categorized three types of activities: 1) Conservation
and sustainable use of species, 2) Conservation and restoration of environmental systems, and 3)
Education and awareness. Under the conservation and sustainable use of species, they identified
numerous plants and animals species selected for projects due to the food or other income generating
value these species have (i.e. traditional potatoes and yams, juggery palm (fishtail palm), traditional
rice varieties, vegetables, fruits, reeds and medicinal plants and even some species (i.e. marine turtles,
fresh water fish). The SGP community based projects have also been involved in the conservation of
numerous ecosystems, including working within or surrounding national protected areas such as the
KDN complex, Knuckles conservation zone, Bundala PA and Rekawa SAM sites. It has also supported
smaller forest areas such as Gallena Kande. Projects have also supported restoration of coral reefs,
wetlands, and mangroves and other riparian ecosystems. These projects have looked to manage Alien
invasive species, reduce illegal use of the forests products, reforest or restore areas etc. There have
also been projects that have a tendency to support agriculture. Overall, the focus has to develop
models that combine conservation, community participation in local resource management along with
income generating activities. The livelihood component is seen to be the most visible impact, while
actual benefits to conservation have not yet been studied.

Additionally, the SGP projects have increased understanding about the environment among local
organizations and community members. There have been a range of educational programmes,
exhibitions and the like, while some of the SGP members have even shared their experience
internationally (i.e. in India). Some products have also been developed to meet international standards
(i.e. products based on kithul, a traditional rice variety) while others have been nominated for awards
such as the equator award for a project that combined the protection of local rush and reeds, wetlands
and livelihoods through the sustainable use of rush and reeds.

Some of the areas that need improvement are in terms of scaling up and connecting the different
interventions with larger projects/schemes. NGO networks have been involved in policy level processes
but this is not happening in a structured manner. Better linkages between the SGP interventions and
national projects are needed for greater impact of these initiatives – in terms of the types of activities

                                                                                                         75
that are being carried out and also the NGOs/CBOs as a resource to guide such activities and mobilize
communities.

5.4.2 Climate Change
The climate change interventions have largely responded to the energy shortfalls experienced by Sri
Lanka and its desire to expand electricity coverage to areas the grid could not reach. The climate
change projects have been dominated by projects addressing renewable energy and continuity in the
focus that have yielded positive results. The two main projects – the Energy Services Delivery (GEF ID
104) was extended as the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project – (GEF ID 1545),
and these were supported by other projects in the portfolio (Renewable Energy and Capacity Building
(GEF ID 425), Development of a Strategic Market Intervention Approach for Grid-Connected Solar
Energy Technologies (EMPower) (GEF ID 1599) (global) and Solar and Wind Energy Resource
Assessment (GEF ID 1281) (global).

The main issue addressed by the two largest energy projects was the lack of access to long-term
financing for the private sector investors/commercial banks to invest in the renewable energy sector.
The projects demonstrated that the risks are manageable and that lending would be profitable for the
private sector to invest. As a consequence, the private sector renewable energy developers developed
projects using the lending provided by commercial banks with some risk absorption by the project and
the renewable energy developers. Seventy-seven mini-hydro projects with 181.6 MW have been
commissioned and are selling to the grid (DFCC, 2012).Discussions with the DFCC stakeholders revealed
that at the level of commercial banks long term financing for renewable energies has not continued.
Such a long term mechanism for grid connected renewable energies was not planned for by the project
and this was a shortcoming in the exit strategy.

The projects also concentrated on advancing the different actors within the renewable energy industry
such as developers, manufacturers and financiers. As a result, Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) have
extended their credit facilities to rural households that did not have access to clean energy. When
combined the implementation completion reports show that targets were exceeded in terms of solar
home systems (SHSs). The ESD project provided 20,953 SHSs against the target of 15,000, and the
RERED project provided 110,575 SHSs against the target of 85,000. Additionally 7,913 households were
provided with mini hydro systems11. There is a tendency to stop using the micro hydro units and solar
home schemes once the grid is available. Problems with the solar systems mentioned were
maintenance of the batteries and the lack of technical support, which are preventing the use – even
when they act as a way to reduce the energy consumption from the grid. It was seen as valuable for the
period before getting the grid connection. Some households are selling the units to households that are
still not connected to the main grid. In the case of the micro hydro, the cost and labour of maintaining
the systems, machinery breakdowns the limited power capacity per households were some deterring
facts that have reduced it usage once the grid is available(FGD, Household interviews; energy forum,
2013). By 2011, the reach of the grid has expanded to cover more than 90% of the households leaving
only some isolated pockets, amounting to 1072 villages (approximately 40,0000 households) which



11
  There are two hydro schemes mentioned - mini hydro that is few 100KWs to 10MW and micro hydro that are less
than 100 kW. The Mini hydro was done on a commercial basis by the private sector, while rural homes were provided
through the smaller micro hydro systems – that are also at times referred to as village hydro systems. The Electricity
Consumer Societies were set up to manage these micro hydro units. The Federation of Electricity Consumer Societies is
the umbrella organization of the societies.

                                                                                                                   76
were identified by the CEB (as per Energy Forum, 2013).Therefore, some lending and possibly a grant
mechanism may be required, as per the ESD/RERED model.

There was no mechanism in place in the project to address the issue of these systems once the grid is
extended. However, since project completion a procedure has been put in place to allow the selling of
power from the micro hydro schemes to the grid through an interconnection.12 This is being
spearheaded by the Federation of Electricity Consumers’ Societies (FECS)13; a community umbrella
organization set up and strengthened under the RERED project. At the time of the review two of the
micro hydro sites at Athuraliya and Owala in Ratnapura District had been connected with the use of the
SPPA (Energy Forum (Guarantee) Limited, 2013). This process is continuing after project completion
due to the interest and efforts of some stakeholders.

The commercial use of mini-hydro has had a positive impact on Green House Gas Emission reductions
in Sri Lanka. While on a time bound scale the off grid solar and micro hydro projects have also
contributed to the reduction in use of kerosene (a fossil fuel) for lighting.

The private sector continues to invest in mini hydro and have also started to invest in the wind power
projects, driven by the Tariff structures and a Power Purchasing Agreement. The commercial
orientation of the projects and the community organizations that were created enabled the policy and
project initiatives to be taken forward independently after the GEF/WB support was over. The focus is
also now shifting to other types of renewables such as biomass to replace fossil fuel and sell the power
to the grid or use as off grid for industrial purposes (Promoting Sustainable Biomass Energy Production
and Modern Bio-Energy Technologies- GEF ID 4096). Further barriers to sale to the grid, for biomass
etc., have emerged and there are new GEF projects coming on board, albeit delayed. Strong lobby
groups continue to work with the authorities to improve the uptake of renewables in the country.

The public-private-civil society partnership and the collaborative approach used throughout the project
was a key factor behind the project’s success. There were specific roles carried out based on the
stakeholder expertise. Financial issues were handled by the Participatory Credit Institutions (PCIs) and
the MFIs. While the MFIs were also central in reaching the communities, government agencies such as
the CEB were involved as executing agencies with a key responsibility for implementing components of
the project such as the power purchasing agreements, demand side management and the pilot wind
project, while the Ministry of Planning and Provincial Councils provided backing for smooth
implementation of approvals and necessary government support. The energy developers provided the
technical support to develop the products and also manage the maintenance. The village consumer
societies were also a part of this collaboration, where they were involved in the project planning and
monitoring and could provide direct feedback, while civil society organizations were involved for
capacity building and mobilization purposes. The ability to gain the collaboration of a range of
stakeholders was a noteworthy driver of this project.

From the perspective of the Project Administration Unit (AU) (the DFCC Bank and the CEB) their
proactive roles were also a key factor to the success of this project. The AU has acted as the facilitator
and the mediator of various stakeholders such as beneficiary households, renewable energy

  The Power purchase agreements were being used by the commercial mini hydro plants but this was not being used by
the smaller community operated micro hydro units.

  FECS is the umbrella organisation for the electricity consumer societies set up to manage the micro hydro systems at
village level. The federation brings together 200 of these societies.

consultation process with all of them throughout the project period. These implementation
arrangements have helped to overcome obstructions and to address emerging problems and have
ultimately contributed to the success of the project.

The work carried out to put in place the attractive feed-in tariff structures and power purchase
agreements are also a key factor to keeping the private sector interested. The overall support and buy
in from the government was also a key driver of these projects.

CHAPTER 6. Relevance of GEF support to Sri Lanka

6.1 Relevance of GEF support to the Sri Lankan environmental priorities and sustainable
    development needs and challenges

As described in Section 3.3, Sri Lanka has good policy and institutional structures to address sustainable
development as well as environmental protection. The projects supported by GEF were aligned to law
and sectoral plans such as the National Environmental Action plan, National Biodiversity Conservation
Action Plan, Coastal Zone Management Plan and Special Area Management Plan. These are discussed in
more detail in section 6.2. However, in terms of sustainable development, in practice the need to
collaborate and integrate activities with numerous ministries and departments, their agendas, priorities
budgets and plans results in less than favorable uptake of sustainable initiatives.

While participatory processes are used to

them, lack of understanding and technical
abilities impedes continuation of activities
after project closure. Attention and interest to develop synergies in content and resources was also
seen as inadequate. The experience shared by the MOE in relation to efforts to develop collaborative
planning (as part of the Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project– GEF ID 878)



                                                                                                           79
was that even amongst departments with similar interests this was not easy to accomplish. The
tendency is to lean towards their own agendas and plans.

Whilst, there are many laws and regulatory processes that control, for example, industrial discharges,
pollution, and air and water quality, there are enforcement weaknesses that reduce effectiveness. The
ways in which the laws are interpreted and used are seen to cause divergence and inconsistencies
(MOENR, 2007a). Additionally, some areas such as domestic and industrial solid waste are less
regulated. It also varies in different parts of the country as this is managed by the local authorities. The
experiences of different local level organizations also do not have structured mechanisms that can
share these lessons/experiences from local to national level, which hinders scaling up.

Ownership and buy-in is also seen as important for gathering the needed support for environmental
and sustainable development initiatives. In relation to the GEF-funded projects the level of ownership
has differed and has led to different results. The MOF as well as the MOPE were keen on developing
renewable energy sources in the early 1990s, as power generation was inadequate and the electricity
grid’s penetration was only 40 percent. Given this commitment, the support extended by the
government to overcome issues related to tariffs and power purchase agreements was very high. This
led to better ownership and results on completed renewable energy projects.

Ownership is also linked to people consulted at design stage being involved in the project at the
implementation stage (Coastal biodiversity Project - GEF ID 802). In the case of the Rainforest Project
(GEFID818), a participatory process from within the FD was used to design the project that then
generated more ownership. On the other hand the Protected Areas Management and Wildlife
Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) were largely designed by external consultants. This led to resistance
from within (i.e. staff of the DWLC) and also by concerned members of civil society that filed legal cases
against the implementation of certain components of this project. Consequent amendments to the
project – that incorporated the ideas of the project staff – overcame these concerns and led to a
satisfactory completion of the project. Further, component C of this project was to prepare an already
existing National Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (prepared under a previous GEF project) to be
amended as an addendum. The collaborative planning envisioned under this component did not reap
the necessary results. It is acknowledged that at times the expertise to develop the proposals is not
found within the departments and external support is needed. However, the manner in which the
design and implementation incorporates the ideas of the executing agencies plays a role in better buy-
in.

The ownership by the government in the implementation of the project is apparent in its contribution
in kind and in funds to all GEF projects except the Enabling Activities. Analyzing the funding
commitments at the point of project approval (as the GEF portfolio has projects at all stages:
completed, being implemented and approval) the Sri Lankan Government’s contribution is around 19
percent. In the evaluation of the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID – 802), the evaluators comment
that staff time of government officials to be contributed to the project does not sufficiently materialize,
as they continue to have commitments to their parent Organization(s). This issue on adequate staff
time is being raised in relation to the East Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID 2753), while staff time,
commitment to projects, staff stability to handle the work were also raised at the final national
workshop as issues that affect ownership and impacts of a project.

Whilst the commitment of people and money is there during the implementation of the project the
same level of commitment intensity is not there once the project is completed. It is to be expected

                                                                                                         80
that the quantum of money and intensity of activities will reduce once project financing is over.
However, when coupled with the reduction in budgets in terms of the allocations received, there is no
interest to continue the activities if they will not be absorbed into the regular mode of work. The
discontinuing of community based livelihood activities that were seen in several of the Coastal
biodiversity Project (GEF ID 802) and the Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID
878) are a case in point.


6.2 Relevance of GEF support to national action plans within GEF focal areas

This section looks at the important national actions for environment management put in place by the
State and the alignment and contributions of the GEF funded projects to the set goals and objectives. It
also reflects the alignment or impact of the international conventions.

6.2.1 Biodiversity
Upon ratification of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 1994, Sri Lanka prepared a strategy for
preparation of a BAP in 1994. This was followed by the preparation of the BCAP termed “Biodiversity
Conservation in Sri Lanka: a framework for action” through the Conservation and Sustainable Use of
Medicinal Plants Project (GEF ID 95). The BCAP was accepted by the government in 1998 and published
in 1999 (MOFE, 1999a). Completion of the BCAP was reported to the CBD in 1998 via Sri Lanka’s first
National Report to COP 1 (MOENR, 2009). The BCAP was updated with the Addendum of 2007
(MOENR and BDS, 2007) under Component C of the GEF supported Protected Areas Management and
Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) to cover new issues that had emerged both nationally and
internationally. Both the BCAP and the Addendum used participatory processes to develop the action
plans. In addition, this project funded seven Provincial Biodiversity Conservation Profiles for
implementation by Provincial Councils. The recommendations of the BCAP and Addendum are meant
to guide national implementation of the CBD, but assessments have showed the need for BCAP
implementation to be carried out holistically (MOE, 2003; MOENR, 2007a; 2009). The BCAP is now due
for revision and should be part of the proposal submitted to GEF on National Biodiversity Planning to
Support the Implementation of the CBD 2011-2020 Strategic Plan (GEF ID 4997).

Other important events included: the upgrading of the Biodiversity Unit in the MOE to a Biodiversity
Secretariat (BDS) in 1999; establishing a National Experts’ Committee on Biodiversity ; and initiating
several globally and nationally important projects to support biodiversity conservation in Sri Lanka
(MOENR, 2006c; MOENR, 2009). The Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878)
enhanced capacity for the National Red Listing Process which led to its institutionalization within the
MOE (IUCN and MOENR, 2007; MOE, 2012). Sri Lanka enhanced capacity for biosafety through the
UNDP/GEF funded Biosafety Framework Project (GEF ID 875), which led to ratifying the Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety in 2004 and participating in the UNEP/GEF regional project for Building Capacity
for Effective Participation in the Biosafety Clearing House (BCH) mechanism. Hence, GEF support has
resulted in putting in place broader overall frameworks and action plans to assist the periodic review of
biodiversity. However, greater attention to move these plans into action is needed.

Forestry and wildlife systems
Policies, plans and programmes in the forestry and wildlife sub-sectors reflect concern for biodiversity
conservation, and significant steps have been taken to better manage natural resources and
biodiversity. Biodiversity considerations were incorporated into plans and policies prepared after
ratification of the CBD in 1994: the National Forest Policy of 1995 (MALF, 1995) has the specific

                                                                                                      81
objective of conserving forests for posterity, with particular regard to biodiversity and the Forestry
Sector Master Plan of 1995 (MALF, 1995) devotes an entire chapter to forest biodiversity. They also
followed a landmark moratorium on state-mediated logging in all natural forests of Sri Lanka in 1990,
and the Environmental Management in Forestry Development (EMFD) Project initiated in 1991,
through which the Accelerated Conservation Review (ACR) of Wet Zone forests by the Forest
Department was conducted (IUCN, 1994). The identification of 33 Wet Zone forests for strict
conservation (FD, 2012), followed by the comprehensive assessment of biodiversity in natural forests of
the country through the National Conservation Review (NCR) were carried out. All these led to an
amendment of the Forest Ordinance in 1995 to recognize “Conservation Forests” set aside for strict
conservation. At present 65 forests (including 15 mangrove forests) are declared as Conservation
Forests (FD, 2012).

Likewise, the National Wildlife Policy of 2000 addresses biodiversity conservation (DWLC, 2000), and
was developed after the Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Area Management
Projects (GEF ID 352) carried out by the DWLC (1992-1998). Both Forest and Wildlife Policies oriented
the FD and DWLC to make a shift in management policy towards a participatory approach involving
local communities in lieu of the former policing approach. This was promoted in management plans
prepared for 9 wet zone forests (IUCN 1994), and the proposed model was pilot tested for wet zone
forests via the Rainforest project (GEF ID 818).

Both the FD and DWLC have invested heavily in institutional capacity building for better management
and conservation of forests under their purview. This has been mainly though the ADB funded Forestry
Resources Management Project (FRMP) for the FD, and the GEF supported Protected Areas
Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) for the DWLC. The latter project has led to
the recent (2009) amendments to the FFPO to make mandatory the preparation of management plans
for all forest and wildlife reserves managed by the FD and DWLC (MOENR, 2009). This project also
facilitated the preparation of a Portfolio of Strategic Conservation Sites/Protected Areas in the country
through a Gap Analysis of the national protected area system (MOENR, 2006b). This provides the
necessary information to assist with designating and managing new protected areas.

Coastal and marine systems and fisheries resources
Coastal resource management in Sri Lanka goes back to the early 1980s with the setting up of the CCD
and the enactment of the Coast Conservation Act of 1981. Integrated management of coastal resources
with the support of local people through SAM planning was initiated by the CCD at Rekawa and
Hikkaduwa in 1991 via the USAID funded Coastal Resources Management Project (CRMP). This
approach was formalized by “Coastal 2000: Recommendations for a Resource Management Strategy
for Sri Lanka's Coastal Region" published in 1992 (CCD & MOFAR, 1992). In 2000, the GEF supported
project on the Conservation of Biodiversity through Integrated Collaborative Management in Rekawa,
Ussangoda, and Kalametiya Coastal Ecosystems (GEF ID 802) in the period of 2000 –2006 also sought to
assist management of coastal biodiversity with the participation of local people and with emphasis on
the conservation of wetlands and marine turtles. The multi-focal East Coast Tsunami Project (GEF ID
2753) also uses the participatory management style for coastal zone restoration and sustainable
management.

The current Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) identifies 57 SAM sites and Areas of Species
Concern (APC) sites. The SAM approach is not, however, adequately incorporated into coastal zone
management, despite wide stakeholder consultation for preparation of policies, plans and actions. The
funds and resources to continue activities in the SAM sites once a funded project is completed have not

                                                                                                      82
been forthcoming. This is attributed to problems of institutional coordination that preclude effective
implementation of the CZMP (MOENR, 2007a) despite the support offered by laws, plans, programmes
and projects (MOENR, 2007a; MOENR, 2009).

Concerns for sustainable use of the fishery resources have been incorporated into laws, policies and
plans of the fishery sector. These include provisions in the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of
1996, and its amendments, to deal comprehensively with conservation of the fishery resource (both
marine and inland), declare fishery reserves where needed, and ensure sustainable development of the
industry. The National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy of 2006 deals with environmentally friendly
management of fisheries (MOFAR, 2006). The ADB and Government of Netherlands (GON) funded
Coastal Resources Management Project (CRMP), spanning 2002-2005, played a major role in
institutional strengthening for managing coastal resources and for conduct of a sustainable marine and
coastal fishery. The only fisheries related project carried out by with GEF support is the Regional
BOBLME Project under the focal area of International waters.

Agricultural and livestock biodiversity
Agricultural policy has moved away from the sole aim of increasing productivity to reach self-sufficiency
in essential food items, to one that takes into account sustainable agriculture and biodiversity
considerations. The 2007 National Agricultural Policy promotes integrated pest management, land
management, adapting to climate change, and sustainable use of genetic resources in compliance with
Article 15 of the CBD (MOAD&AS, 2007e).This change was probably influenced by the comprehensive
National Agricultural Research Plan (NARP) developed in 1999 by CARP which took into account some
of the needs identified in the BCAP of 1999 for conservation of agro-biodiversity (MOENR,2007a;
DOA/DEA/SLCARP (1999). The National Livestock Development Policy Statement mentions
conservation of native livestock genetic diversity (MOL&RCD, 2010).

There have been several joint projects between the MOE (Biodiversity Division) and the DOA, which
include the ‘in-situ conservation of Crop Wild Relatives Project for information management and
enhanced field application in 2004-2009 (GEF ID 1259) (MOENR, 2009, MOE, 2010b), ‘Strengthening
capacity to control the introduction and spread of invasive alien species in Sri Lanka’ (GEF ID 2472), and
Mainstreaming Agro-biodiversity Conservation and Use in Sri Lankan Agro-ecosystems for Livelihoods
and Adaptation to Climate Change(GEF ID 4150). These are relatively new projects and are yet to reveal
results. The process used for development of the proposal for a Regional UNEP/GEF PDF B Full Size
Project for “Development & Application of Decision-support Tools to Conserve & Sustainably Use
Genetic Diversity in Indigenous Livestock & Wild Relatives” helped identify country status and needs in
this sphere (GEF ID 1902).

6.2.2 Climate change
Sri Lanka was a party to the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Amendment before ratifying the
UNFCCC in 1993. Although being a developing non-Annex 1 nation with no direct commitment for
reduction of emissions, Sri Lanka acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in September 2002 in view of the
potentially serious impacts of climate change on the island (MOENR, 2006c). Sri Lanka has voluntarily
participated in CDM projects, so that the country can sell carbon credits to Annex 1 countries and has
shown progress in increasing the use of renewable energy through wind, solar and dendro-thermal
power. Sri Lanka is not obligated to reduce emissions under the UNFCCC. However, emissions
reductions were targeted through the GEF supported projects. In 2007, Sri Lanka also established the
Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority that took on the promotion of Renewable Energy under the
MOPE. It was moved into the MOE in 2013.

                                                                                                       83
A significant move to address climate change was the establishment of a Climate Change Secretariat
(CCS) in 2010 within the MOE to better facilitate, formulate and implement projects and programmes
at national level with regard to climate change. Ratification of the UNFCCC also led to several enabling
projects that were of significant value. The first enabling activity to prepare initial National
Communication on Climate Change in 1997 was the UNFCCC enabling activity - GEF ID 309. Significant
components in this activity were the updated inventory of greenhouse gases in Sri Lanka, the
identification of key areas of focus, potential measures to abate the increase of greenhouse gases, and
the national action plan to address Climate Change. The 2nd national communication (UNFCCC enabling
activity- capacity building project- GEF ID 1008) updates the status and action plan and also identifies
capacity needs to address climate change in each of the identified areas. In parallel, the ADB assistance
was provided to prepare a NCCASSL: 2011-2016. By 2012, Sri Lanka had also developed a Climate
Change Policy and a process to operationalize the CDM was established in 2010.

At the institutional level, A Centre for Climate Change Studies (CCCS) was established in 2000 under the
Department of Meteorology to conduct research, monitor climate change, and provide the general
public with current information on climate change and related issues. Several institutions including the
Department of Agriculture, the rice, tea, coconut and rubber research institutes, institutes dealing with
water resources and the UDA have examined vulnerability to climate change and initiated adaptation
measures through institutional programmes (MOENR, 2010 a, b, c, d); the CZMP of 2004 has taken into
account sea level rise in their set back standards (CCD, 2006).

6.2.3 International waters
In Sri Lanka the focus in this area by the State has been on marine pollution. The Marine Pollution
Prevention Act No. 59 of 1981 established the Marine Pollution Prevention Authority (MPPA) to
address the problem of marine pollution in Sri Lankan territorial waters. The amended Act of 2008
(Effective from Jan 2009) changed the name of the MPPA to Marine Environment Protection Authority
(MEPA) and widened its regulation making capacity. As the focal point for UNCLOSS (ratified in 1994),
and MARPOL (ratified in 1997), MEPA is working to enforce the Marine Pollution Protection Act and
enhance surveillance and response activities. Several projects with regional focus have addressed the
contingency planning for oil and chemical spills, protection of the Marine Environment from land based
activities, as well as on cooperation on fisheries. Other areas addressed are Ballast water management
including alien species.

However, few activities are done on the protection of marine ecosystems and species. Baseline
information is also lacking for protecting shared waters in the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar;
critical habitats shared by Sri Lanka and India. Under the Regional BOBLME (GEF ID 1252) efforts are
made to address information gaps, over exploitation of resources, land based pollution, critical habitat
degradation and livelihoods. The main goal is to set up regional institutional arrangements to facilitate
a coordinated approach among the BOBLME countries. Additionally illegal fishing and poaching;
sustainable utilization of migratory species; protection of shared non-targeted species such as turtles,
dugongs and sea birds; and safety at sea issues are also priority issues within BOBLME (BOBLME
Project, 2012). This project brings in adifferent dimension to Sri Lanka’s efforts in managing its marine
environment.

6.2.4 Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
While there are no special laws for pollution control, the NEA amendment of 1988 addresses this by its
provisions for EPL and EIA procedures, and some aspects that are covered under the Nuisances

                                                                                                      84
Ordinance, Police Ordinance and laws applicable to LAs (Guneratne, 2005). The Control of Pesticides
Act No 33 of 1980 and its Amendment Act No. 6 of 1994 deals with controlling the import, use,
transport, storage and disposal of pesticides in the country. This Act banned almost all of the POP
pesticides in Sri Lanka and this paved the way for implementation of the Stockholm Convention
(UNEP/GEF/MOE). Other significant policies that have had a bearing on POPs is the Solid Waste
Management Strategy of 2000, and measures to manage hazardous wastes.

While there are measures in place to control POPs, two areas that required further action were in the
management polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and unintentionally produced Dioxins and Furans. The
enabling activity on POPs spanning 2002-2006 (GEF ID 1777) led to the establishment of the POPs unit
at the MOE in 2002. Through this enabling activity they have carried out awareness creation among the
general public on POPs, prepared the National Implementation Plan (NIP), a preliminary inventory of all
PCB containing equipment in the country and three separate national inventories for POPs, pesticides,
PCBs and unintentionally produced Dioxins and Furans. The POPs project prepared the groundwork
required to implement the Stockholm Convention in Sri Lanka. Due to institutional reorganization, POPs
activities are now carried out by the Air Resources Management & International Relations Division.

6.2.5 Land Degradation
Land degradation has been a major environmental problem in Sri Lanka since colonial times, and more
than 39 laws address various aspects of land degradation (MOENR, 2006c). Recognizing the seriousness
of this problem and the threat of salinization in the Dry Zone, Sri Lanka signed and ratified the UNCCD
in 1995 and 1998 respectively. Since then, the Natural Resources Division of the MOE is responsible for
supervising obligations under UNCCD. As a Party to the UNCCD, Sri Lanka prepared the National Action
Programme (NAP) of 2002 with support from GEF (GEF ID 4829) to address land degradation in Sri
Lanka. This plan identified the development programmes, activities and projects required to meet the
commitments under the UNCCD. This could not be implemented holistically due to funding constraints
- as experienced by several other countries of South Asia. This is now being addressed by aligning it
with the 10 year strategy for the UNCCD to combat land degradation in the country. A further
impediment was that while a Land Use Policy was initiated in parallel in 2002, this was in draft form
until it received cabinet approval in 2007. This delay affected efficient use of the land resource in the
country during this time (MOENR, 2007 c). The Land Use Policy Planning Department and the Land
Commissioner General’s Department play a key role in land management planning. Land management
falls within the purview of about 30 institutions, such as the Land Commissioners Department, The
Hadabima Authority, The Mahaweli Authority, and the DOA. This highlights some of the complexities
entailing land use planning and land management that affect effectiveness.

The thematic assessment on land degradation of the NCSA Project (GEF ID 2417) found that the main
capacity constraints underlying land degradation in Sri Lanka were weak coordination and
communication among institutions/agencies, the lack of a proper coordination mechanism/body and
poor private sector involvement. The lack of awareness about the NAP on the part of senior officers in
different government agencies and private institutions was found to impede implementation of the
activities of the NAP in Sri Lanka (MOENR, 2007c).

Overall, it can be seen that Sri Lanka has a strong base for conservation through the legal, policy and
institutional frameworks. However implementation weaknesses through lack of coordination, capacity,
finances, mandates and buy-in are leading to reduced impact. The GEF supported national projects
have largely been in the area of biodiversity and climate change. Piloted or implemented project
activities have tended to focus on protected area management and renewable energy. In these types of

                                                                                                      85
projects and this coverage of focal areas it can be seen that the spread is limited. The project
formulation exercises in GEF-4 (RAP) and GEF-5 (STAR) have not resulted in a wide variety of project
proposals despite the process of setting the priorities involving wide stakeholder engagement through
national strategy development exercises.

6.3 Relevance of GEF support to the achievement of global environmental benefits

Given that Sri Lanka is an island with high endemism and biodiversity, and that there are commitments made
through protected area networks to protect biodiversity, Sri Lanka is contributing to the protection of globally
valuable species and habitats. The GEF projects have also helped to advance this goal, though some gaps
have been highlighted in this report. Although Sri Lanka’s small size lowers its contribution to global
biodiversity in comparison to mega biodiversity countries such as Brazil, the island’s high endemism and
biodiversity per unit area for most vertebrate groups and flowering plants has enabled a significant
contribution to the conservation of globally valuable species and habitats. GEF has distinctly contributed
considerably to put in place measures to protect such globally valuable species and habitats.

In terms of climate change, the priority of the GEF is mitigation, and while this is also an area that is of
interest, the more pressing need for Sri Lanka is adaptation and this is not a priority for the main GEF Trust
Fund. However it is noted that there are other similar funds that provide grants for adaptation that countries
can link to. The enabling activities carried out for reporting to the UNFCCC (UNFCCC enabling activity-GEFID
- 309), have been used as base documents for formulating the adaptation strategies. In this area activities
have also been largely restricted to renewable energy – and mainly for power generation. Hence it has not
tackled other areas of emissions such as transport and agriculture or into other types of benefits such as
carbon stocks.

Sri Lanka is mainly an agricultural country and therefore one of the pressing problems with regard to POPs is
the use of chemical fertilizers that affects land degradation and soil fertility. These issues are not the priorities
under the global environmental benefits and Sri Lanka has also not pursued many projects in these areas –
except in terms of small grants for land degradation and two projects that address agro-biodiversity. Sri
Lanka has only one regional project currently operational (BOBLME Project - GEF ID 1252) under
International Waters and hence shows fewer links on that issue with global environmental benefits. While
the SGP projects have more projects in the area, their scope is extremely small on the global scale.
Nonetheless, it has expanded the focus areas of the portfolio in Sri Lanka

CHAPTER 7. Efficiency of GEF support to Sri Lanka
7.1 Time, effort, and financial resources required for project formulation

The time taken for project approval has been increasing over time, especially for the FSPs. While
initially it averaged one year, during GEF phases 3 and 4 the period for start-up has increased to around
2.3 years. The increase in the project approval process is attributed to the increase in time spent on
project preparation (Table 7.1). Projects in GEF 2 were exceptions as the ADB14 had done much
preparatory work on Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878)
before the project was included in the GEF project cycle. Similarly, the Rural Renewable Energy project
(GEFID 1545) was a follow-up project of Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID 104) following the
same implementation methods and hence required much less approval resources.

The time taken for projects to be included in the RAF has been very long in comparison to the other
phases. This is because a new procedure was adopted during the RAF for project identification, where
stakeholders were expected to submit projects to the GEF OFP. As this did not occur, implementing
agencies got involved in the development of the initiatives. In addition, there were delays in getting
approval through the GEF secretariat due to the financial crisis. The RAF projects proposed for inclusion
in the pipeline by 2006 were only included in 2009. On average it takes around four and half years for
FSPs in Sri Lanka to move from inclusion in the project pipeline to eventual implementation, and in
comparison to GEF projects in Brazil (3 years)15 is longer. The longer gestation period would require
that the project implementation takes in to consideration the changes that could have occurred during
the long drawn out approval process.

have put in a similar amount of money largely into the renewable energy project (Chart 7.1). This is an
indication of the relevance of the projects that have been developed under the GEF portfolio.

Chart 7.1: Distribution of Funding Sources for Projects in the GEF National Portfolio




GEF projects are managed by GEF Agencies and the WB and UNDP are the two main GEF agencies,
together managing close to 85 percent (Table 7.4). However, it needs to be noted that co-financing by
Asian Development Bank (Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project: GEF ID 878) and
International Financial Corporation (Portfolio Approach to Distributed Generation Opportunity
(PADGO) (Phase 1) – GEF ID - 2996) are classified under WB as they were not GEF Agencies when they
supported (largely implemented) the respective projects. The focus of WB and UNDP has been on
biodiversity and climate change. UNEP has been the only organization that has worked on POPs, which
was an enabling activity.

Chart 7.2 shows the distribution of funding across GEF phases and the agencies managing them. The
WB was dominant during the first three phases of GEF whilst, UNDP has assumed increasing
prominence in the subsequent phases. GEF-3 shows two new implementing agencies in terms of IFAD
(East Coast Tsunami Project - GEF ID 2753) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (Portfolio
Approach to Distributed Generation Opportunity (PADGO)-GEF ID 2996). The IFAD project is a MFA
with a focus on coastal ecosystem restoration that is a new type of project for the GEF portfolio. It is
currently at the implementation stage. GEF-4 shows the greatest variation in agencies and, while also
bringing in new project areas and GEF-5, is predominated by UNDP.

7.3 Coordination and synergies

The co-ordination in project implementation was largely carried out through National Coordination
Committees, Steering Committees, and tri-partite meetings. In addition, projects also established
coordination mechanisms at regional (District and Divisional) levels too, largely to increase
coordination with beneficiaries. The assessment of such coordination mechanisms indicates the
outcomes are mixed but there are also instances in which the coordination was carried out on the basis
of need, such as in the Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID – 104), with more successful outcomes.

A number of issues have caused the national mechanisms to function at less than expected level. In the
Conservation of Medicinal Plants project (GEF ID 95), coordination was assigned to the Ministry that
was responsible for health (Ministry of Indigenous Medicine) rather than for biodiversity (MOE) which
made it difficult to build ownership and increased the cost of coordination and inter-agency
collaboration. Coordination was further affected due to capacities and/or lack of contribution by the
relevant government agencies, as the environmental agencies responsible for forests, environment and
wildlife were going through a restructuring process. The coordination was further hampered due to the
Ministry (or Ministers) changing at least five times during the project implementation, affecting


                                                                                                     90
continuity in decision making as personnel at the helm also changed with changes to the Ministry.18 The
regularity of the meetings has also been an issue that had reduced the effectiveness of these high-level
coordination forums (Coastal Biodiversity Project - GEF ID – 802); and Rainforests Project -GEF ID - 818).

The coordination with societies created for conservation of resources has been attempted through
different mechanisms. They include a more participatory mechanism (Medicinal Plants Project - GEF –
ID 95) with stronger government involvement and leadership (Coastal Biodiversity Project - GEF ID –
802). The societies are seen to have worked with the field staff of the relevant government institutions
to reduce resource abuse. The evaluators of the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID – 802) were of the
opinion that the enthusiasm is unlikely to last as the communities did not have a mandate for
preventing resource abuse without the involvement of the relevant governmental officers and hence
the tasks they are performing are no different to that of an ordinary citizen.


7.4 Monitoring and evaluation for project adaptive management

The monitoring and evaluation system used in the GEF projects include several steps: the logical
framework matrix; tracking outcomes and impacts; quarterly progress and financial reports to be used
for Steering Committee meetings and disbursal of funds; Annual Reports/Project Implementation
Reports for tri-partite meetings; mid-term evaluations to assess independently the project and make
changes if necessary; and Terminal Reports/ Implementation Completion Reports to document project
outcomes; and independent evaluations to assess outcomes to impacts.

In completed projects, evaluation reports indicate that the quality of the logical framework matrix has
had an impact on the quality of project monitoring and outcomes. The logical framework matrix of the
Protected Areas Management and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID – 818) had to be revised mid-
project as the initial logical framework matrix was not adequate, but was subsequently not used for
project monitoring. Evaluators of the Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas
Management project (GEF ID – 352) felt that the project objectives mentioned in the logical framework
matrix were task oriented - “development of human-elephant conflict resolution techniques” - instead
of being outcome or impact oriented - “fewer cases of human-elephant conflicts in buffer zones of
protected areas”. The mid-term evaluation report on the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID – 802),
indicates that some of the outcomes had hidden outcomes (i.e. more than one outcome in a specified
outcome) creating complexities and undermining the ability of the project to carry out effective project
implementation.

All the completed projects have used the mid-term evaluation reviews as a means of taking stock and
making changes to the project, where appropriate. For instance, in the Conservation of Medicinal
Plants Programme (GEF ID 95), assumptions related to domesticating medicinal plants being a viable
alternative to traditional harvesting of plant material, such as active participation of environmental
organization can be assured through coordination committees, and that mass awareness campaigns
was sufficient in changing behavior amongst the target population did not hold. As income only based
on medicinal plants was not sufficient to interest most villagers the project introduced village micro-
plans that covered a broader set of income and village development objectives. The project also


18
  The project did make amends towards the end of the project by creating awareness of its various components such as
involvement of the community in conservation to environmental organizations but during project implementation
faced difficulties in coordination.

                                                                                                                 91
introduced provision of seed funds to help establish village revolving funds to support this broader
approach.

The practice in relation to final reports varies between the different GEF Focal areas. The completed
projects in which the WB was involved have Project Completion Reports but do not have independent
evaluation reports. Completed projects managed by UNDP do not have completion reports but have
evaluation reports. The inconsistencies in the final reporting has led to many of the projects such as
Rainforests Project (GEF ID 818), Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878) and
Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (GEF ID 1545) still remaining as active projects in
the GEF system.

A systemic mechanism for the assessment of monitoring stress reduction/improvement and changes to
socio-economic conditions after the project was one of the weaker aspects of many of the GEF
Projects. At a minimum, the completion reports on Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development
(GEF ID 1545) provide information on the level of environmental stress reduction, i.e. the estimation of
the reduction of emissions due to the use of renewable energy. The Conservation of Medicinal Plants
Programme (GEF ID 95) used a participatory approach in monitoring and evaluation and used attitude
and perception surveys based on baselines to understand changes in perceptions and participation
amongst the supported communities. The design of the project on Coastal Biodiversity Project(GEF ID –
802) proposes the initiation of a biophysical and socio-economic monitoring over a period of time to
provide trends and impacts of the project. A study on water quality to assess the processes and
categories of development activities that have or were likely to have adverse impacts on the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity of the Lagoons was carried out over a period of one
year, but had not been used for management decisions related to accumulation of trace metals,
pesticide residuals and agrochemicals. No studies, however, were carried out on socio economic
monitoring to understand changes on dependency on the declining natural resources. Similarly for the
Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878), repeat biodiversity surveys were
planned but the baseline biodiversity survey was done only towards the end of the project. Hence
arrangements and institutions to monitor stress reduction/improvement in the environment and/or
socio-economic conditions at the systemic level after project completion are weak.


7.5 Efficiency in Project Implementation

The delay in project implementation was minimal in relation to the FSPs in the Climate Change projects,
but the Enabling Activity related to the First National Communication under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change took over ten (10) years. Delays are largely seen in the
implementation related to both medium and full scale bio-diversity projects, with the average delay
being around one and half years.

        Protected Areas Management

The reasons for delay in implementation of projects are due to both internal and external factors.The
Conservation of Medicinal Plants Programme (GEF ID 95) during the implementation period was
affiliated with five ministries and ministers, five Secretaries, four Commissioners of Ayurveda and four
project Management Unit Directors. Each change required re-introducing the project, implementation
delays, and uncertainties over goals and objectives. Slow recruitment of consultants, and partners not
receiving funds in a timely manner contributed to the delays in Coastal Biodiversity Project(GEF ID 802).
The understaffing and the opposition to recruitment of external staff resulted in delays in the
implementation of Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID 878).

External factors, such as the tsunami, also affected project implementation, both in terms of reduced
attention to the projects’ activities, due to personnel engaged in relief activities, and overlaps with
tsunami related rehabilitation projects (Coastal Biodiversity Project - GEF ID 802). The implementation
of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Conservation Project (GEF ID - 878) was delayed due to litigation by
an NGO, which did not want expatriate consultants carrying out biodiversity assessments, and cases
being filed against the land allocated for the construction of the head office of the DWLC.


7.6 Roles and responsibilities among different stakeholders in project implementation

The quality of inputs by GEF Agency is assessed satisfactory, except for UNDP’s management of the
Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID – 802) where the evaluation report suggests that UNDP should have
taken more care in relation to the audit recommendations of the Auditor General.




                                                                                                        93
Most projects had a government agency as the lead unit for project implementation. There have,
however, been instances in which private sector and non-governmental organizations have taken the
lead. The Energy Services Delivery Project (GEF ID – 104) and Renewable Energy for Rural Economic
Development (GEF ID 1545) were ably implemented by a banking entity19. The support extended by the
MOF to the Project Unit in relation to the tariffs and agreements for small scale producers helped
increase implementation efficiency. Conservation of Medicinal Plants Programme (GEF ID 95) relied
heavily on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as the Sri Lankan government
environmental agencies were undergoing restructuring and the Department of Ayurveda, which had
been tasked with project implementation, lacked expertise in bio-diversity. This arrangement however
was assessed to have alienated environmental agencies and reduced ownership. Insufficient technical
capacity of the Coastal Biodiversity Project (GEF ID – 802) was a factor in the drafting of the quarterly
and annual reports. The execution of this project was assessed to be very fragmented with IUCN, Turtle
Conservation Project and the Department of Wild Life Conservation handling different components
without adequate coordination.

7.7 The GEF Focal Point mechanism in Sri Lanka

One of the key functions of the GEF OFP is leading the      Box 7.1 Key functions Role of the GEF
proposal planning and approval stages. Even though          Operational Focal Point:
structured processes such as the RAF and STAR have          The role of the OFP encompasses many
been put in place through the GEF process and               different aspects:
consultative design sessions are held and possible           Orientation of projects to meet GEF
project ideas are discussed, they have not                       criteria, GEB criteria and national
materialized in a timely way or with a wide variety of           priorities
projects. The focal point has also not been proactive        Working with project proponents on fine
                                                                 tuning proposal and managing the
in pushing for these projects to be submitted. Hence
                                                                 approval process;
in some cases the IAs have stepped in to develop and
                                                             Monitoring and evaluation of the
push for proposals. More recently some of the hold               implementation;
ups in approval have been due to problems with               Dissemination of information and
deadlines and paperwork but also due to a need link              lessons; building partnerships and
the project to national priorities and show benefits in          synergies among stakeholders and to
order to get approval. Projects on purely an                     national and regional projects;
environmental basis are getting less attention when          Establishing a transparent coordination
government funds have to be set aside for it. Hence              mechanism.
greater lobbying for projects that show synergies and
linked to national development needs have to be                                        Source: RAF 2006
clear. Dissatisfaction has been expressed with the
performance of the OFP in this regard.

Once the projects are approved as mentioned earlier the monitoring process is also seen to be weak.
Regular meetings are not held and linking of projects is not a systematic process. Hence there is a
lack of coordination among the projects and regular updates and improvement of projects is not
taking place. Lack of staff, capacity and finances to carry out this type of coordination, and more
importantly monitoring role is also the reason for the lack of pro-activeness. In some instances they
are also involved in the implementation - if the project is based in the Ministry or involves the same
resource people in their other capacities (i.e. Alien Invasive Species Project - GEF ID 2472). During the
national consultation process many expressed the need for the focal point to organize regular
monitoring meetings for GEF Projects. The purpose was to enhance information sharing amongst GEF
projects and improve on the synergies in the implementation of the GEF projects. The MOE is aware
of these issues and had also tried in the past to set up a stronger monitoring mechanism that did not
materialize. The RAF also identified the need to build capacity and strengthen the monitoring
capacity of the focal point to carry out these activities. This is necessary for increase effectiveness of
projects.

Background and Introduction

1.      Country Portfolio Evaluations (CPEs) are one of the main evaluation streams of work of the
GEF Evaluation Office.20By capturing aggregate portfolio results and performance of GEF support at
the country level they provide useful information for both the GEF Council and the countries. CPEs
relevance and utility has increased in GEF-5 with the increased emphasis on country ownership and
country-driven portfolio development.
2.      Countries are chosen for CPEs among those which are GEF eligible, based on a selection
process and a set of criteria including the size, diversity and maturity of their portfolio of projects. 21
Among several considerations, Sri Lanka was selected based on its diverse portfolio including several
completed/closed projects with significant emphasis on biodiversity and climate change.A distinctive
feature of the Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE is that it is jointly managed by the GEF Evaluation Office and
the Sri Lankan Ministry of Finance and Planning, through a Joint Steering Committee (JSC).
Independent national quality assurance support is provided by the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association,
through a Peer Review Panel (PRP). A team of national consultants is assembled to support the GEF
Evaluation Office in the conduct of the evaluation.
3.      The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka covers an area of 65,610 km 2with a population
of approximately21.5 million people.22Sri Lanka is classified as a lower-middle-income country with a
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of approximately US$2,580.23Sri Lanka continues to
experience strong economic growth following the end of the 26-year conflict with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The ambitious economic program of the government covers policies on
foreign and domestic private investment to support growth, develop small and medium enterprises,
and increase agricultural productivity. The global financial crisis and recession in 2008 and 2009
nearly caused a balance of payments crisis and slowed growth to 3.5% in 2009. In the following two
years, economic activity rebounded strongly with the end of the war and an International Monetary
Fund (IMF) agreement. Sri Lanka’s per capita income of $5,700 on a purchasing power parity basis is
among the highest in the region.24 Sri Lanka is ranked 97thout of 187 countries on the Human
Development Index (HDI), placing Sri Lanka above the regional average in South Asia.25
4.       Sri Lanka harbors the most diverse landscapes, rich in species and ecosystem diversity with
the highest biodiversity per unit area of land among Asian countries in terms of flowering plants and
all vertebrate groups, except birds. Over the last century, however, much of Sri Lanka’s forest cover
has been destroyed, with less than one third of the area still under forest cover.26 Sri Lanka is

considered as one of the 18 biological hot spots in the world (Red List 2007) with endemic,
threatened and rare species, both flora and fauna.27 One important step towards the conservation of
biological diversity was the adoption of the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (BCAP) in 1998.
Further steps have been taken since 1994 to manage the natural resources and the environment,
including enabling a stronger involvement of civil society and the private sector. Sri Lanka possesses
some of the finest legislative enactments in the South Asian region. 26.5% of the total area of the
country is protected. However, law enforcement and the respective enforcement capability of state
agencies still need further improvement.28Further threats to biodiversity are the ever-increasing
demand for land for human habitation and related developmental activities, poor land use planning,
indiscriminate exploitation of biological resources and its vulnerability to climate change, such as sea
level rise.

5.      Since 1991 (Table 1), the GEF has invested $58.1 million (with about $336.45 million in co-
financing) through 21 national projects, namely 9 in biodiversity, 9 in climate change, 1 in Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPs), and 2Multifocal Area projects.29 The projects are evenly spread within the
GEF project cycle with 5 projects being closed and one completed; the majority of them on
biodiversity and climate change. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with 12
projects totaling $12.6 million, has been the main channel for GEF support in Sri Lanka to date,
followed by the World Bank (3 projects totaling $18.47 million) and the United National Environment
Programme (UNEP) (2 projects totaling $1.94 million). In addition, Sri Lanka is also a participant
country in 3 regional and 8 global projects.

Objectives of the Evaluation

6.       CPEs aim to provide the GEF Council with an assessment of results and performance of the
GEF supported activities in a country, and of how the GEF supported activities fit into the national
strategies and priorities as well as within the global environmental mandate of the GEF. Based on this
overall purpose, the Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will have the following specific objectives:
        Evaluate the effectiveness and results of completed and ongoing projects in each relevant
         focal area.30
        Evaluate the relevance and efficiency of GEF support in Sri Lanka from several points of
         view:31 national environmental frameworks and decision-making processes, the GEF mandate
         and the achievement of global environmental benefits, and GEF policies and procedures.
        Provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its decision making
         process to allocate resources and to develop policies and strategies, (2) Sri Lanka on its
         participation in the GEF, and (3) the different agencies and organizations involved in the
         preparation and implementation of GEF support.
7.        The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will also be used to provide information and evidence to other
evaluations being conducted by the Office. The evaluation will address the performance of the GEF
portfolio in Sri Lanka in terms of relevance, efficiency and effectiveness as well as the contributing
factors to this performance. The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will analyze the performance of individual
projects as part of the overall GEF portfolio. CPEs do not aim at evaluating the performance of GEF
Agencies and of national entities (agencies and/or departments, national governments or involved
civil society organizations).


Key Evaluation Questions

8.       The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will be guided by the following key questions:
Effectiveness, results and sustainability
     h) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results (outcomes and impacts) by focal
        area at the project and aggregate level?
     i) What is the likelihood that objectives will be achieved for those projects that are still under
        implementation in Sri Lanka?
     j) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results related to the dissemination of
        lessons learned in GEF projects and with partners?



30
  Effectiveness: the extent to which the GEF activity’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance; Results: in GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short- to medium-term
outcomes, and progress toward longer term impact including global environmental benefits, replication effects, and other
local effects; Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended period of
time after completion; projects need to be environmentally as well as financially and socially sustainable.
31
  Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national environmental priorities and policies and to
global environmental benefits to which the GEF is dedicated; Efficiency: the extent to which results have been delivered
with the least costly resources possible.

                                                                                                                         110
    k) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in producing results which last in time and continue after
       project completion?
    l) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in moving from foundational activities and production of
       information and databases to demonstration and investment activities with concrete tangible
       results?
    m) Is the GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in linking environmental conservation measures with
       compatible sustainable livelihood and development activities?
    n) Is GEF support to Sri Lanka effective in replicating/up-scaling the successful results it has
       demonstrated in its projects?
Relevance
    f) Is the GEF support relevant to Sri Lanka national environmental priorities and sustainable
       development needs and challenges?
    g) Are GEF and its Agencies supporting the environmental and sustainable development
       prioritization, country ownership and decision-making processes of Sri Lanka?
    h) Is the GEF support to Sri Lanka relevant to the objectives linked to the different Global
       Environmental Benefits in biodiversity, greenhouse gases, international waters, land
       degradation, and chemicals focal areas?
    i) Is Sri Lanka supporting the GEF mandate and focal areas programs and strategies with its own
       resources and/or with the support from other donors?
    j) Is the relevance of the GEF support to Sri Lanka's national priorities coinciding or clashing
       with the relevance to the GEF international mandate of achieving Global Environmental
       Benefits?
Efficiency
    f) How much time, effort and financial resources does it take to formulate and implement
       projects, by type of GEF support modality in Sri Lanka?
    g) What role does Monitoring and Evaluation play in increasing project adaptive management
       and overall efficiency in Sri Lanka?
    h) What are the roles, types of engagement and coordination among different stakeholders in
       project implementation in Sri Lanka?
    i) What are the synergies for GEF project programming and implementation among: GEF
       Agencies; national institutions; GEF projects; and other donor-supported projects and
       activities in Sri Lanka?
    j) How do the national budget procedures in Sri Lanka affect GEF project proposals preparation
       and funding?
9.       Each of these questions is complemented by indicators, potential sources of information and
methods in an evaluation matrix, which is presented in Annex 1. The matrix contains a tentative list
of indicators or basic data, potential sources of information, and methodology components.



Scope and Limitations

10.     The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will cover all types of GEF supported activities in Sri Lanka at
different stages of the project cycle (pipeline, on-going and completed) and implemented by all GEF
Agencies in all focal areas, including applicable GEF corporate activities such as the Small Grants


                                                                                                   111
Programme (SGP) and a selection of regional and global programs that are of special importance to
the country. However, the main focus of the evaluation will be the projects implemented in Sri Lanka
(within boundaries), i.e. the national projects, be these full-size, medium-size or enabling activities.32
11.        The stage of the project will determine the expected focus of the analysis (see Table 3).

12.      The GEF does not establish country programs that specify expected achievements through
programmatic objectives, indicators, and targets. However, since 2010 the GEF has started
supporting countries in undertaking national portfolio formulation exercises on a voluntary basis.
These exercises serve as a priority setting tool for countries and as a guide for GEF Agencies as they
assist recipient countries. These country programming efforts are rather recent, which limits their
usefulness in country portfolio evaluations that look back up to the start of GEF operations, i.e.
sometimes 20 years back. This is why generally CPEs entail some degree of retrofitting of frameworks
to be able to judge the relevance of the aggregated results of a diverse portfolio of projects.
Accordingly, the CPE evaluation framework described here will be adapted along with the other
relevant national and GEF Agencies’ strategies, country programs and/or planning frameworks as a
basis for assessing the aggregate results, efficiency and relevance of the GEF portfolio in Sri Lanka.
13.      GEF support is provided through partnerships with many institutions operating at many
levels, from local to national and international level. It is therefore challenging to consider GEF
support separately. The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will not attempt to provide a direct attribution of
development results to the GEF, but address the role and contribution of GEF support to Sri Lanka
overall efforts in achieving global environmental benefits. The evaluation will address how GEF
support has contributed to overall achievements in partnership with others, by questions on roles
and coordination, synergies and complementarities and knowledge sharing.
14.      The assessment of results will be focused, where possible, at the level of outcomes and
impacts rather than outputs. Project-level outputs will be measured against the overall expected
impact and outcomes from each project. Special attention will be paid to the identification of factors
affecting the level of outcome achievements and progress to impact, as well as to the risks that may
prevent further progress to long term impacts. Progress towards impact of a sample of mature
enough projects (i.e. completed at least since 2 years) will be looked at through field Reviews of
Outcome to Impact (ROtI) studies.33 Expected and unexpected impacts at the focal area level will be
assessed in the context of GEF objectives and indicators of global environmental benefits. Outcomes
at the focal area level will be primarily assessed in relation to catalytic and replication effects,
institutional sustainability and capacity building, and awareness. The analysis on the context in which
outcomes and impacts have been unfolding, including the identification of the main external impact
drivers and assumptions, will be an essential part of the analysis, especially, but not exclusively, in
the ROtI studies that will be conducted.

32
   The review of selected regional projects will feed in the aggregate assessment of the national GEF portfolio described
above.
33
   The field ROtI method will be applied to 3 out of the 6 closed/completed national projects.

                                                                                                                    112
15.      The inclusion of regional and global projects increases the complexity of this type of
evaluations since these projects are developed and approved under different context (i.e. regional or
global policies and strategies) than national countries. However, a representative number of regional
and global projects in which Sri Lanka participated/s will be included based on criteria such as the
relevance of the regional project for Sri Lanka, or the location of the project management unit when
it is based in Sri Lanka, among others.
16.      Out of the 21national projects, 5 projects have been closed,1 has been completed, 3are being
implemented, 2 have been approved by the GEF Council, 3 have been endorsed and 3 have been
approved by the GEF Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and 4 have been approved by the GEF Agency.13
Full Size Projects (FSPs) include 3 projects implemented by the World Bank,5by UNDP, 1 by UNEP, 1
by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and 1 by the United National Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO). 1 FSP is jointly implemented by the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and 1 by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
The 2 Medium Size Projects (MSPs) are implemented by UNDP. 6 Enabling Activities (EAs) include 5
projects implemented by UNDP, 1 by UNEP.
17.      The context in which these projects were developed, approved and are being implemented
constitutes another focus of the evaluation. This includes a historic assessment of the sustainable
development and environmental policies, strategies and priorities, legal environment in which these
policies are implemented and enforced, GEF Agencies country strategies and programs and the GEF
policies, principles, programs and strategies.
18.      Weaknesses of M&E at the project and GEF program levels have been mentioned in past
CPEs and other evaluations of the Office. These weaknesses may pose challenges to the Sri Lanka CPE
as well. Not all the information which will be used for the analysis will be of a quantitative nature.


Methodology

19.     The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will be conducted by staff of the Office and a team of national
experts provided by a national institution, The Center for Poverty Analysis (CEPA), i.e. the Evaluation
Team, led by a Task Manager from the GEF Evaluation Office. The team includes technical expertise
on environment and sustainable development in Sri Lanka, evaluation methodologies, and the GEF.
The consultants selected qualify under the Office’s Ethical Guidelines, and have signed a declaration
of interest to indicate no recent (last 3-5 years) relationship with GEF support in Sri Lanka. The
Operational Focal Point (OFP)in Sri Lanka acts as resource person in facilitating the Sri Lanka CPE
process by identifying interviewees and source documents, organizing interviews, meetings and field
visits.
20.     The methodology includes a series of components using a combination of qualitative and
quantitative evaluation methods and tools. The expected sources of information include:
     Project level: project documents, project implementation reports, terminal evaluations,
      terminal evaluation reviews, reports from monitoring visits, and any other technical
      documents produced by projects;
     Country level: national sustainable development agendas, environmental priorities and
      strategies, GEF-wide, focal area strategies and action plans, global and national
      environmental indicators;


                                                                                                   113
     Agency levels: country assistance strategies and frameworks, evaluations and reviews;
     Evaluative evidence at country level from other evaluations implemented either by the
      Office, by the independent evaluation offices of GEF Agencies, or by other national or
      international evaluation departments;
     Interviews with GEF stakeholders, including the GEF OFP and all other relevant Government
      departments, bilateral and multilateral donors, civil society organizations and academia
      (including both local and international NGOs with a presence in the country), GEF Agencies,
      SGP and the national UN conventions’ Focal Points;
     Interviews with GEF beneficiaries and supported institutions, municipal governments and
      associations, and local communities and authorities;
     Field visits to selected project sites;
     Information from national consultation workshops.
21.     The quantitative analysis will use indicators to assess the relevance and efficiency of GEF
support using projects as the unit of analysis (that is, linkages with national priorities, time and cost
of preparing and implementing projects, etc.) and to measure GEF results (that is, progress towards
achieving global environmental impacts) and performance of projects (such as implementation and
completion ratings). Available statistics and scientific sources, especially for national environmental
indicators, will also be used.
22.     The Evaluation Team will use standard tools and protocols for the CPEs and adapt these to
the specific context in Sri Lanka. These tools include a project review protocol to conduct the desk
and field reviews of GEF projects and interview guides.
23.      The Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE will include visits to project sites. The criteria for selecting the
sites will be finalized during the conduct of the evaluation, with emphasis placed on both ongoing
and completed projects. The Evaluation Team will decide on specific sites to visit based on the initial
review of documentation and balancing needs of representation as well as cost-effectiveness.
24.     Quality assurance will be performed at key stages of the process by a Peer Review Panel
composed by three independent experts from the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association (SLEvA). The
expertise provided covers the relevant scientific and technical aspects of the peer review function
related to the GEF focal areas as well as to evaluation.

Process

25.      A number of steps have already been undertaken for the Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE. In February
2012 a pre-evaluation mission took place to explore possibilities for joining forces with institutions in
Sri Lanka in the management and conduct of the CPE. As a result of this mission it was agreed with
the Sri Lankan Ministry of Finance and Planning to jointly manage the evaluation. The JSC has been
established soon after that mission. Parallel to that, an agreement was reached with SLEvA to set up
a national Peer Review Panel to support the evaluation. Furthermore, an agreement was reached
within JSC for selecting a qualified national firms and/or institutions to assist the Office with the
conduct of the evaluation.
26.     In August 2012 a second mission took place with the main objective of scoping the
evaluation, i.e. define precisely what the evaluation should cover, and identify through consultations
with GEF national stakeholders what key questions should be answered by the evaluation. The

                                                                                                     114
mission was also an opportunity to officially launch the evaluation, while at the same time introduce
the selected national consultant firm to GEF national stakeholders. Unfortunately, the selected firm
could not honor its commitment due to internal problems emerged between the proposed team of
experts and the firm itself, which ultimately led the firm to withdraw from the assignment. Further
consultations within the JSC led to the recruitment of CEPA, the 2nd ranked firm, in October 2012,
which was briefed and introduced to national GEF stakeholders, to the JSC and the PRP during a third
mission that took place in early November 2012. These TOR conclude the Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE
preparatory phase, and set the scene for the upcoming evaluation phase, during which the
Evaluation Team will complete the following tasks:
         Complete the ongoing literature review to extract existing reliable evaluative evidence.
         Prepare specific inputs to the evaluation:
         -     GEF Sri Lanka Portfolio Database which describes all GEF support activities within the
               country, basic information (GEF Agency, focal area, implementation status), project cycle
               information, GEF and co-financing financial information, major objectives and expected
               (or actual) results, key partners per project, etc.
         -     Country Environmental Legal Framework which provides an historical perspective of the
               context in which the GEF projects have been developed and implemented in Sri Lanka.
               This document will be based on information on national environmental legislation and
               policies of each government administration (plans, strategies and similar), and the
               international agreements signed by Sri Lanka presented and analyzed through time so to
               be able to connect with specific GEF support.
          -    Global Environmental Benefits Assessment, which provides an assessment of Sri Lanka’s
               contribution to the GEF mandate and its focal areas based on appropriate indicators,
               such as those used in the System for the Transparent Allocation of Resources (STAR)
               (biodiversity, climate change and land degradation) and others used in projects
               documents.
          -    Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) field studies of 3national projects completed since
               at least two years, selected in a way to represent results in as many diverse GEF focal
               areas and GEF Agencies as possible, and strengthen as such the information gathering
               and analysis on results.
         Conduct the evaluation analysis and triangulation of collected information and evidence
          from various sources, tools and methods. This will be done during a fourth mission in Sri
          Lanka by the Task Manager to consolidate with the CEPA team the evidence gathered and fill
          in any eventual information and analysis gaps before getting to key preliminary findings.
          These will be summarized in a concise Aide Mémoire, which will be distributed to
          stakeholders one week prior to the final consultation workshop.34During this mission,
          additional analysis, meetings, document reviews and/or field work might be undertaken as
          needed;
         Conduct a national Stakeholder Consultation Workshop with participation of the
          Government representatives and other national stakeholders, including project staff, donors
          and GEF Agencies, to present and gather stakeholders’ feedback on the main Joint GEF/Sri
          Lanka CPE preliminary findings contained in the Aide Mémoire, and proceed to the

34
   The Aide Mémoire will be circulated by the JSC, who will also send it out to GEF stakeholders with the invitation to the
final consultation workshop.

                                                                                                                         115
          formulation of conclusions and preliminary recommendations to be included in a draft Joint
          GEF/Sri Lanka CPE report. The workshop will also be an opportunity to verify eventual errors
          of facts or analysis in case these are supported by adequate additional evidence brought to
          the attention of the Evaluation Team;
         Prepare and circulate to stakeholders and to the JSC and PRP a Draft Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE
          Report, which incorporates comments received at the national stakeholder consultation
          workshop;
         Consider the eventual incorporation of comments received to the draft report and prepare
          the Final Joint GEF/Sri Lanka CPE Report. The GEF Evaluation Office will bear full
          responsibility for the content of the report.

27.     The dissemination of the final GEF Sri Lanka CPE report will be a shared responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning, who will distribute the report to GEF national stakeholders in the country, and of the GEF
Evaluation office, who will take care of distribution outside the Sri Lankan boundaries.
