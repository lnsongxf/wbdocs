       Quality of care is an abstract and complicated con-                           high quality care, thus quality standards require con-

       Zhejiang, Hangzhou – Twelfth Five          Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province in China, is home to over eight
       Year (TFY)                                 million individuals, and has traditionally struggled with providing equal and
       In text reference:                         sufficient health care to its citizens. In an effort to curb such obstacles, the 12th
       Hangzhou, TFY                              Five Year Plan was implemented in 2011, and key aspects included integrated
                                                  e-consultation services, non-communicable disease joint centers, and
                                                  collaborative services for medical and living support and nursing care.
       Anhui, Feixi – Strengthening the           Feixi County of Anhui Province is located in the eastern part of China with a
       Capacity of Primary Health Care            population of roughly 850,000 citizens. In 2009, Feixi became the pilot site for
       (SCPHC)                                    the initiative, “Strengthening the Primary Health Care Capacity” as set forth
       In text reference:                         by the government, which focused on strengthening four sectors: 1) human

       Henan, Xi – Integrated Care (IC)           The Integrated Care (IC) Reform in Xi, China addressed low quality of care for
       In text reference:                         non-communicable diseases and disjointed health systems by implementing
       Xi, IC                                     contracts between county hospitals, township health centers, and village clinics
                                                  in 2012. The initiative focused on building a strong referral mechanism, providing
                                                  technical assistance to lower-level facilities, and altering the payment system to
                                                  support cost sharing, all of which has had considerable success even in its early
                                                  stages.
       Beijing – Beijing Chaoyang Hospital        The Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Alliance, started in late 2012, aimed to attract
       Alliance (CHA), Four Cases                 patients to utilize community health centers more frequently for minor ailments
       In text reference:                         and strengthen the collaboration between upper- and lower-level facilities. The
       Beijing, CHA                               CHA was composed of a core hospital, a second tertiary hospital, a secondary
                                                  hospital, and a number of community health centers, which coordinated care for
                                                  patients; as a result of this structure, the growth rate of participating facilities rose
                                                  from 2012 to 2013.

Shanghai, RLG                                 This healthcare group created a shared imaging and testing center that increased
                                              access for residents, provided “specialist-GP joint outpatient” visits for patients in
                                              community health centers, and strengthened its previously-existing primary care

       Norway, Fosen – District Medical           Fosen, Norway, a municipality in fjords of Northern Norway, developed a

       Fosen, DMC                                 hospital stays. In 2012, Norway modeled its national health care initiative off of
                                                  Fosen’s successful DMC model.
       Portugal – Local Health Unit (ULS)         In 1999, a small province in the Northwest of Portugal created a Local Health

       Singapore – Regional Health                Singapore reorganized its health care system by developing six Regional Health

       In text reference:                         ecosystems. RHSs each innovated and developed interventions to provide
       Singapore, RHS                             integrated coordinated care. Some examples of these interventions include Aged

       United States, Veterans Health             Across the United States the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model
       Administration – Patient-Aligned           has been used to integrate and improve primary care. The Veterans Health
