This report is the product of a collaborative effort amongst relevant entities of the United
Nations system and other stakeholders, which was led by the World Bank Group and UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).
The UN General Assembly adopted resolution 70/226 on December 22, 2015 in which it
decides to “convene the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementa-
tion of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and
marine resources for sustainable development to support the implementation of Sustainable
Development Goal 14.” To support Fiji and Sweden, Presidents of the Conference with tech-
nical expert advice for preparing the Conference, an Advisory Group consisting of relevant
entities of the United Nations system and other stakeholders was established in April 2016.
This Advisory Group agreed to form seven subsidiary informal preparatory working groups
(IPWG) in line with the targets under SDG14.
Informal Working Group (IPWG) 6 was assigned to cover SDG target 14.7 and worked on the
issue of blue growth and “increasing economic benefits for SIDS and LDCs from sustainable
management of marine resources, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.” The World
Bank Group and UN DESA were appointed as co-conveners of IPWG 6.
The membership of the working group includes: The World Bank Group (WBG), UN Depart-
ment of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Environment, Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization (FAO), International Maritime Organization (IMO), UN Office of Legal Affairs/
Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (OLA/DOALOS), UN Office of the High
Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and
Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS), UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Indus-
trial Development Organization (UNIDO), United Nations World Tourism Organization
(UNWTO), International Seabed Authority (ISA), International Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN), World Trade Organization (WTO), International Council for Science
(ICSU), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Ocean
Council (WOC), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Conservation International, Ocean
Policy Research Institute (OPRI) of Sasakawa Peace Foundation, and National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of U.S. Department of Commerce. These entities con-
tributed to and assisted in the development of this report.
IPWG 6 undertook relevant research and consultations to evaluate the current status of SDG
target 14.7 and related issues, including challenges, gaps and opportunities in its implemen-
tation, and provided recommendations on necessary future actions, partnerships, projects
and commitments to accelerate the implementation of SDG target 14.7 that directly respond
to related needs and opportunities. As part of its work, IPWG 6 submitted an informal input
to the background note of the Secretary-General for the preparatory meeting of the Confer-
ence in November 2016. The informal working group then decided that this input could be
optimized to serve an additional purpose. Thus, the group agreed to develop the input into
this standalone report with the intention to officially launch it around the Conference in
June 2017. The World Bank Group accepted to oversee the production process.
The co-conveners of the working group are Mr. Björn Gillsäter, World Bank Group Spe-
cial Representative to the UN in New York, and Ms. Irena Zubcevic, Chief, Small Island
Developing States, Oceans and Climate Branch, Division for Sustainable Development, UN

     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     This report was drafted by a working group of United Nations entities, the World Bank, and
     other stakeholders to suggest a common understanding of the blue economy; to highlight the
     importance of such an approach, particularly for small island developing states and coastal
     least developed countries; to identify some of the key challenges its adoption poses; and to
     suggest some broad next steps that are called for in order to ensure its implementation.
     Although the term “blue economy” has been used in different ways, it is understood here
     as comprising the range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine
     whether the use of oceanic resources is sustainable. An important challenge of the blue
     economy is thus to understand and better manage the many aspects of oceanic sustainabil-
     ity, ranging from sustainable fisheries to ecosystem health to pollution. A second significant
     issue is the realization that the sustainable management of ocean resources requires collabo-
     ration across nation-states and across the public-private sectors, and on a scale that has not
     been previously achieved. This realization underscores the challenge facing the Small Island
     Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as they turn to better man-
     aging their blue economies.
     The “blue economy” concept seeks to promote economic growth, social inclusion, and the
     preservation or improvement of livelihoods while at the same time ensuring environmen-
     tal sustainability of the oceans and coastal areas. At its core it refers to the decoupling of
     socioeconomic development through oceans-related sectors and activities from environmen-
     tal and ecosystems degradation. It draws from scientific findings that ocean resources are
     limited and that the health of the oceans has drastically declined due to anthropogenic
     activities. These changes are already being profoundly felt, affecting human well-being and
     societies, and the impacts are likely to be amplified in the future, especially in view of pro-
     jected population growth.
     The blue economy has diverse components, including established traditional ocean indus-
     tries such as fisheries, tourism, and maritime transport, but also new and emerging activi-
     ties, such as offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive activities, and marine
     biotechnology and bioprospecting. A number of services provided by ocean ecosystems, and
     for which markets do not exist, also contribute significantly to economic and other human
     activity such as carbon sequestration, coastal protection, waste disposal and the existence of
     biodiversity.
     The mix of oceanic activities varies in each country, depending on their unique national cir-
     cumstances and the national vision adopted to reflect its own conception of a blue economy. In
     order to qualify as components of a blue economy, as it is understood here, activities need to:
         ■■   provide social and economic benefits for current and future generations
         ■■   restore, protect, and maintain the diversity, productivity, resilience, core functions,
              and intrinsic value of marine ecosystems
         ■■   be based on clean technologies, renewable energy, and circular material flows that
              will reduce waste and promote recycling of materials.

x   The Blue Economy
INTRODUCTION

Humanity’s relationship with the oceans, and how people use and exploit their resources,
is evolving in important ways. While the oceans are increasingly becoming a source of food,
energy, and products such as medicines and enzymes, there is also now a better understand-
ing of the non-market goods and services that the oceans provide, which are vital for life on
Earth. People also understand that the oceans are not limitless and that they are suffering
from increasing and often cumulative human impacts. Oceans that are not healthy and resil-
ient are not able to support economic growth.
The fact that oceans and seas matter for sustainable development is undeniable. Oceans
and seas cover over two-thirds of Earth’s surface, contribute to poverty eradication by creat-
ing sustainable livelihoods and decent work, provide food and minerals, generate oxygen,
absorb greenhouse gases and mitigate the impacts of climate change, determine weather
patterns and temperatures, and serve as highways for seaborne international trade. With an
estimated 80 percent of the volume of world trade carried by sea, international shipping and
ports provide crucial linkages in global supply chains and are essential for the ability of all
countries to gain access to global markets (UNCTAD 2016).
The “blue economy” concept seeks to promote economic growth, social inclusion, and pres-
ervation or improvement of livelihoods while at the same time ensuring environmental sus-
tainability. At its core it refers to the decoupling of socioeconomic development through
oceans-related sectors and activities from environmental and ecosystems degradation
(UNCTAD 2014; UN DESA 2014a). Challenges in the sustainable use of marine resources—
­
such as the impacts of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, increased frequency
and severity of extreme weather events, and rising temperatures—are going to have direct
and indirect impacts on oceans-related sectors, such as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism,
and on maritime transport infrastructure, such as ports, with broader implications for inter-
national trade and for the development prospects of the most vulnerable nations, in particu-
lar coastal least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). While
the blue economy, both as a concept and in practice, is relevant to all countries, this paper
focuses on SIDS and coastal LDCs.

    RELATIONSHIP OF SIDS
    AND COASTAL LDCS TO
    OCEANS, SEAS, AND
    MARINE RESOURCES

    SDG Target 14.7 of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals focuses on enhancing the eco-
    nomic benefits to SIDS and LDCs from the sustainable use of marine resources, including
    through the sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism. The world has
    54 lower and lower-middle income coastal and island countries for whom oceans represent
    a significant jurisdictional area and a source of tremendous opportunity. Oceans and their
    marine resources are thus the base upon which the economies of many SIDS and coastal
    LDCs are built, and they are central to their culture and sustainable development, to poverty
    reduction, and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
    Small island developing states face particular challenges to their sustainable development,
    including small populations, limited resources, vulnerability to natural disasters and external
    shocks, and strong dependence on international trade. Their growth and development is
    often hampered by high transportation and communication costs, disproportionately expen-
    sive public administration and infrastructure due to their small size, and little or no opportu-
    nity to create economies of scale (FAO 2014b). The particular vulnerabilities and challenges
    of SIDS were among others recognized in the Barbados Programme of Action, the Mauri-
    tius Strategy of Implementation, the Rio+20 outcome document, and the SIDS Accelerated
    Modalities of Action (Samoa) Pathway. In the Samoa Pathway, SIDS recognized that “sustain-
    able fisheries and aquaculture, coastal tourism, the possible use of seabed resources and
    potential sources of renewable energy are among the main building blocks of a sustainable
    ocean-based economy in SIDS” and expressed their support for sustainable development
    of ocean resources. Indeed, SIDS often argue that they are better described as “large ocean
    states,” to acknowledge the size of their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and the impor-
    tance of oceans for their lives and livelihoods.1
    Least developed countries are the poorest countries. Their low level of socioeconomic devel-
    opment is characterized by weak human and institutional capacities, low and unequally
    distributed income, and a scarcity of domestic financial resources. They often suffer from
    governance difficulties, political instability, and, in some cases, internal and external con-
    flicts. Their largely agrarian economies are affected by a vicious cycle of low productivity and
    low investment. They rely on the export of a few primary commodities as the major source
    of export and fiscal earnings, which makes them highly vulnerable to external terms-of-trade
    shocks. Only a handful has been able to diversify into the manufacturing sector, although

    THE TRANSITION
    TO A BLUE ECONOMY

    Sustainable development implies that economic development is both inclusive and envi-
    ronmentally sound, and to be undertaken in a manner that does not deplete the natural
    resources that societies depend on in the long term. The need to balance the economic,
    social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in relation to oceans is a
    key component of the blue economy. It is also a difficult balance to reach in practice, given
    that ocean resources are limited and the health of the oceans has drastically declined due
    to human activities—ranging from damage caused by carbon dioxide emissions to nutrient,
    chemical, and plastics pollution, unsustainable fishing, habitat degradation and destruction,
    and the spread of invasive species. The scientists and experts who prepared the First Global
    Integrated Marine Assessment (also known as the World Ocean Assessment) warned that the
    world’s oceans face major pressures simultaneously with such great impacts that the limits of
    their carrying capacity are being reached—or in some cases have been reached—and that
    delays in implementing solutions to the problems that have already been identified as threat-
    ening to degrade the world’s oceans will lead, unnecessarily, to greater environmental, social,
    and economic costs (United Nations 2016).2
    The importance of oceans for sustainable development is widely recognized by the interna-
    tional community and was embodied in, among others, Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of
    Implementation, various decisions taken by the Commission on Sustainable Development, the
    Rio+20 outcome document The Future We Want, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop-
    ment. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), together with
    its implementing agreements—the 1994 Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI
    of UNCLOS and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement—sets out the legal framework
    within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out and is of strategic importance
    as the basis for national, regional, and global action and cooperation in the marine sector. This
    includes the conservation and sustainable use of all areas of the oceans and their resources. The
    concept of a blue economy came out of the 2012 Rio+20 Conference and emphasizes conserva-
    tion and sustainable management, based on the premise that healthy ocean ecosystems are more
    productive and form a vital basis for sustainable ocean-based economies (UN DESA 2014a).
    Under “business as usual,” the costs of marine ecosystem degradation from human uses
    should be high, but they are not quantified or accounted for. At the same time, the economic
    contribution of the ocean to humankind has been significantly undervalued (Economist

    While there is no universally accepted definition of the blue economy, many agencies and organizations are
    working on describing how they understand the concept. One example are the principles submitted by WWF.
    Other principles and descriptions are used by different sectors, governments, and organizations.
    A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY is a marine-based economy that . . .

     CHALLENGES TO THE
     BLUE ECONOMY

     The potential to develop the blue economy is limited by a series of challenges. For much of
     human history, aquatic ecosystems have been viewed and treated as limitless resources and
     largely cost-free repositories of waste. These resources, however, are far from limitless, and
     the world is increasingly seeing the impacts of this approach. The narrow coastal interface
     is oversubscribed by myriad sectors and is increasingly affected by climate change. Rising
     demand, ineffective governance institutions, inadequate economic incentives, technologi-
     cal advances, lack of or inadequate capacities, lack of full implementation of UNCLOS and
     other legal instruments, and insufficient application of management tools have often led to
     poorly regulated activities. This in turn has resulted in excessive use and, in some cases, irre-
     versible change of valuable marine resources and coastal areas. In this increasingly competi-
     tive space, the interests of those most dependent and vulnerable (for example, small-scale
     artisanal fishers) are often marginalized, mostly for the benefit of other, more visible sectors
     (such as coastal tourism), where the actual economic benefits—while more clearly apparent
     at first—may actually be ephemeral or directly exported to foreign investors.
     The major human impacts include, among others, the following:
         ■■   Unsustainable extraction from marine resources, such as unsustainable fishing as
              a result of technological improvements coupled with poorly managed access to
              fish stocks and rising demand. FAO estimates that approximately 57 percent of fish
              stocks are fully exploited and another 30 percent are over-exploited, depleted, or
              recovering (FAO 2016). Fish stocks are further exploited by illegal, unreported, and
              unregulated fishing, which is responsible for roughly 11–26 million tons of fish catch
              annually, or US$10–22 billion in unlawful or undocumented revenue.
         ■■   Physical alterations and destruction of marine and coastal habitats and landscapes
              due largely to coastal development, deforestation, and mining. Coastal erosion also
              destroys infrastructure and livelihoods. Unplanned and unregulated development
              in the narrow coastal interface and nearshore areas has led to significant externali-
              ties between sectors, suboptimal siting of infrastructure, overlapping uses of land
              and marine areas, marginalization of poor communities, and loss or degradation of
              critical habitats.
         ■■   Marine pollution, for example in the form of excess nutrients from untreated sewer-
              age, agricultural runoff, and marine debris such as plastics.
         ■■   Impacts of climate change, for example in the form of both slow-onset events like
              sea-level rise and more intense and frequent weather events. The long-term climate

     SECTORS OF THE BLUE
     ECONOMY

     Oceans-related economic activities are developing against a backdrop of soaring global pop-
     ulation, growing consumption, and the ever growing need for new sources of food, energy,
     and minerals. For example, by 2030 two thirds of the fish for food consumption is expected
     to be farmed, much of it at sea (World Bank 2013). Offshore wind capacity is forecast to rise
     to become the leading power generation technology by 2030 (IRENA 2016), and seaborne
     trade is expected to quadruple by 2050 (ITF 2015). On land, the oceans-related economy will
     experience a surge in investment in coastal infrastructure, industry, and tourism as the global
     migration to cities and coasts deepens. At the same time, the risks to coastal populations from
     rising sea levels and storm surges as a result of climate change will drive the need for a wave
     of defensive infrastructure development.
     As defined earlier, the blue economy consists of sectors whose returns are linked to the living
     “renewable” resources of the oceans (such as fisheries) as well as those related to non-living
     and therefore “non-renewable” resources (including extractive industries, such as dredging,
     seabed mining, and offshore oil and gas, when undertaken in a manner that does not cause
     irreversible damage to the ecosystem). It also includes activities relating to commerce and
     trade in and around the oceans, ocean monitoring and surveillance, and coastal and marine
     area management, protection, and restoration. The following table provides a summary of
     the types of activities in the blue economy, related industries and sectors, and drivers of
     growth.
