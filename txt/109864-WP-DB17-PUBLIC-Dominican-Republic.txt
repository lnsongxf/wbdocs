This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        objection ("Certificado de uso de suelo", "certificado de no
        objecion") and receive inspection by the Municipal Council
        (Departamento de Planeamiento Urbano)

        Following the Doing Business case study assumptions and based
        on Resolution 5/2004 one needs to request a certificate to use
        the land and also obtain a certificate of no objection prior to
        obtaining the construction permit. Moreover, in order to obtain
        the certificate to use the land an inspection by the Municipal
        Council is required (the official cost for this inspection is DOP
        500.00.).
        The land-use certificate confers the right to build on the plot, but
        it does not authorize construction. The certificate ensures that
        the project conforms to zoning regulations.
        The certificate of no objection is a certificate which according to
        your project plans, elevations and sections approves and                   1 day              DOP 500

        appoints the urban design parameters.

        The request must be accompanied by several documents related
        to the land, including:
        • A copy (simple, unnotarized) of the real property deed for the
        plot (does not have to be recently obtained)
        • A cadastral plan
        • A map of the project’s location and a first draft of the project

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Payment of taxes at the Dirección General de Impuestos (Tax
      Authority)

      After the inspection is over and the value of the property is calculated, a
      tax of 3% of the property value must be paid before the "Dirección
      General de Impuestos Internos" (Tax Authority) before registering the
      property transfer, by virtue of de “Eficiencia Recaudatoria” Law No. 173-
      07 dated July 17th, 2007.



      If there is a difference between the property value indicated in the                       3% of property

      Department upon valuation, the higher value will be the one considered
      as valid for calculation of this transfer tax.



      However, said law provides an exemption of this tax in cases of transfer
      of real estate properties acquired by means of loans with financial
      institutions and cooperatives, if such real estate property has a value
      under DOP$1,000,000.00 adjustable upon inflation.


      The property tax must be paid within the six (6) months following to the

      surcharges will be applied. Surcharges amount to 10% of the sum not
      paid (the corresponding transfer taxes) for the first month or fraction of
      the month. To any additional delays the Tax authorities will charge a 4%
      (per month or fraction) over the 10% plus a 1.73% indemnity (per month
      or fraction).



      Moreover, on July 10, 2009, Law 182-09 was enacted granting a tax
      exemption on the 2% that must be paid to record a mortgage. This
      exemption only applies when it is proved that a new loan/mortgage has
      been obtained to pay off an existing loan secured with the same land.
      Consequently, the former mortgage would be cancelled to record the
      new one, with no additional cost.

      Buyer files the property transfer request before the Title Registrar´s

      When filing request for property registration before the Title Registrar´s
      Office, stamp duties are paid (Art. 13 of Law 140-2015: DOP 100 for the
      Notarial receipt; 30 DOP according to Law 91; and 20 DOP according to

      Certificate of Title in the name of the buyer, cancel the old Certificate

      take no more than 45 days to qualify the transfer.



      The filed documentation shall include:



      (i) Notarized purchase agreement (obtained in Procedure 4).

      (ii) Real estate property taxes declaration; receipt of payment; and
      Certification issued by the Tax Authority stating the Seller is up to date
      on the payment of taxes on the real estate property (obtained in
      Procedure 5).

      (iii) Payment of stamp duties (completed in this procedure).

      (iv) Copy of identity documents for seller and buyer (such documents
      may vary whether seller and buyer are natural persons or companies).

      (v) Copies of their Mercantile Registration Certificate ("Certificado de
      Registro Mercantil") issued by the corresponding Chamber of
      Commerce, and

      (vi) Certificate of registration at the National Taxpayers Registry ("RNC")
      issued by the Dirección General de Impuestos Internos (the Tax
      Authority)



      It should also be noted that the Buyer is also required to file the original
      copy of the Title Certificate. Furthermore, if either Buyer and/or Seller are
      companies or legal entities, the authorities will require evidence of the
      corporate approval of the transaction (i.e. minutes of the meeting of the
      corporate body that has authorized the purchase/sale). Another relevant
      point is that if the Buyer and/or Seller are foreigners, they must present
      two different copy of their identity documents: their passport and any
      official identification from their country of origin.




      The land registry operates with the Torrens title system and is being
      digitized since 2005. All new transactions are completed digitally, but all
      titles created before 2005 are not digitized yet. The registry has
      consultation room units (“Departamento de sala de consultas”) where
      the registry’s electronic database is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
