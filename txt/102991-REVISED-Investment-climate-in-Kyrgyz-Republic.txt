EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Aspects of investment environment studied as part of this survey
The survey of both current and past investors looked at the following five aspects influencing investment
environment in the Kyrgyz Republic:

        a) Factors influencing an investment decision

This aspect covers factors that help potential investors make a decision about what country to
choose as their investment destination. It is against these core criteria that potential investors assess
and benchmark those countries that will most likely bring the expected returns and be in line with
investors' business growth and expansion strategy.

        b) Market entry - investors' experience in registering a company

This aspect covers the process of registering a company that investors went through in the Kyrgyz
Republic after they had made adecision to invest. This includes access to information, specific procedures
an investor has to follow, their ease or otherwise, and the cost of market entry.

        c) Investor protection and confidence

This aspect covers factors influencing the business operations of investors in the Kyrgyz Republic.
These range from the legal environment that governs running a business and protection of investor
rights to transparency in dealing with investor complaints and grievances to interaction with state
authorities to resolving disputes. These are the areas that either increase investor confidence and
stimulate repeat investment inflows or increase investor's vulnerability and lead to a decrease in or
loss of investments.

        d) Investment Incentives

This aspect covers specific preferential benefits (financial and non-financial) that the Kyrgyz government
offers to investors and how investors perceive them.

        e) Market exit

This aspect covers the process of closing a business. This includes access, clarity and transparency of
the information regarding the business closure, the ease or otherwise of the process, and the cost
of closing a business in the Kyrgyz Republic.

                                                                                                        11

INVESTMENT DECISIONS
For operating investors the top five factors that influence their investment decisions are investing in a domestic market, the ease
of registering a business in a given country, the ease of obtaining all necessary licenses and permits to operate, how business-
friendly the legislation is and access to cheap labor (Figure 11).

The results of the survey revealed that a similar set of conditions is
important for non-operating investors when making an investment
decision. They put a slightly higher emphasis on the ease of
the company registration process and slightly higher emphasis
on the availability of personal relations in the country (friends,
relatives, diaspora) (Figure 12).

The results show that investors are interested first and foremost in how easy it will be to enter the
market and to run a business in a given country.The greatest emphasis is placed on how clear,
transparent and predictable the legislation is,how easy it isto access all requirements overall,
and how business friendly regulations are. Other important elements such as the availability
of business support services or techno parks are not priority conditions for investors.They are
more'nice-to-have'rather than'must-have'for an investment to take place. Investors are also
prepared to work without additional benefits or incentives, provided these are non-tax related
incentives. Both current and past investors would welcome tax- and customs-related incentives,
however. Taxation and customs are the real pain points of the investment environment in the
Kyrgyz Republic.

Calculation of average weighted values
To adjust the sampling structure with the target group structures, the average weighted values were calculated. Upon
completion of field work, weight ratios were calculated. For this purpose, the adjustment of total population was made: the
total population of operating and non-operating companies was adjusted as a proportion of non-operating companies in
the sampling of operating companies and the share of operating companies in the sampling of non-operating companies.
The distribution of the total population and the sampling of the study is presented on Table 30.
