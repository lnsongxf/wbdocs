toward higher value-added activities, such as manufactur­       tion are more likely to succeed when they have strong

Chapter 6: Political Economy of Transport Sector
Integration in the East African Community

1.	 Introduction
The transport infrastructure in East Africa Community
(EAC1) member states has improved dramatically over the
past two decades. Among the more notable achievements
are (1) vast improvements in the quality of the region’s
trunk roads; (2) substantial reductions in road travel times;
(3) growing compliance with vehicle weight restrictions;
and (4) falling transport prices due to the aforementioned
changes, mainly along the Northern Corridor.
    This chapter elucidates the political economy factors that
supported these improvements. The findings are largely
consistent with recent literature on the political economy
of regional integration and transport economics. From the
former, the results resonate with existing studies that argue
regional integration efforts are most likely to be successful
when one country emerges as a leader in favor of integra­
tion and the private sector strongly advocates for it. They
also support the thesis that transport prices are likely to fall
when (1) transport becomes more efficient, (2) road quality
improves, and (3) competition becomes more intense. For
many years, the second and third condition existed in East
Africa, but not the first. Efficiency is now improving along the
Northern Corridor, but less so along the Central one, for
reasons the paper will explicate. The result is that transport
prices are falling along the former, but not the latter.
    The next section examines the transport infrastruc­
ture in the region as well as how economic devel­     opment is
affecting it. The subsequent section explicates the institu­
tions of the EAC that promote integration and impediments            it currently accounts for more than 95% of the EAC’s land

Regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for its further economic development and, more
importantly, its structural transformation away from agriculture towards higher value-added activities,
such as manufacturing and services. Yet there are many paths towards greater integration, some of which
are easier than others. In addition, integration need not follow a linear path or occur mainly through
formal inter-governmental economic coordination. In order to gain insights into how regional integration
is occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, determine impediments to it, and develop recommendations to further
facilitate it, this volume examines the political economy of regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa.

In a comparative context, the findings suggest cautious optimism for regional integration efforts in sub-
Saharan Africa. They also question perceptions that regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa is doomed
to be less successful than in other parts of the world. Economic integration is typically difficult, especially
among less developed economies. In addition, failed integration attempts and slow implementation
of integration policies is a global pattern, not only an African one. Yet integration is occurring in sub-
Saharan Africa, despite these obstacles. This volume demonstrates that regional integration is more likely
to succeed when it has strong support among governments and/or the private sector as well as when
key actors take a pragmatic and flexible path to integration rather than a rigid and all-encompassing
one. Similarly, it shows that economic integration is more likely to succeed when it occurs alongside
regional attempts at improving political stability and/or developing joint infrastructure. Arguably, regional
integration in sub-Saharan Africa is perhaps somewhat more successful than one would predict given the
challenging environment in which it is occurring.
