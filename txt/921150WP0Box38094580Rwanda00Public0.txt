THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       The documents required to obtain an electronic signature are:
       - Proof of identity (Simple copy) of the managing director or of one of
       the shareholders of the company being formed or of an authorized
       representative. Scanned copy of the ID.
       - Contact Details of the managing director or of one of the
       shareholders of the company being formed or of an authorized
       representative
       - Email account of the managing director or of one of the shareholders
       of the company being formed or of an authorized representative

       authorized representative with powers of attorney. To obtain an
       electronic signature, applicants sign up with their email addresses and
       scan their ID cards to be attached to the account application. Once the
       account is setup, a registration number is generated to enable users to
       proceed to online registration. This registration number is, at the same
       time, the tax identification number (TIN) and VAT number of the
       company.

      Online company registration has become mandatory as of February 17,
      2014. It is free of charge. Entrepreneurs submit the company
      documents and obtain an electronic copy of the registration certificate
      online. The dossier is subsequently transferred to the RRA and all
      relevant entities' representatives to assign the new company with
      identification numbers.

      Obtain the Tax Identification Number (TIN) Certificate

      Applicants need to obtain the company's Tax Identification Number
      (TIN) certificate. This certificate is different from the incorporation
      certificate, on which the TIN number is provided. While the TIN number
      is the exact same as the registration number listed on the certificate of         1 day             no charge

      Open a Bank Account

      For VAT registration purposes, applicants must first open a bank
      account. The company's bank account number shows on its VAT

      Register for VAT

      The VAT certificate must be displayed at the company. Registering for
      VAT is not compulsory at the time of registration; it can be done later
      on. It is only needed for small companies (according to the Ministerial

        By law, every company or tax payer must buy an electronic billing
        machine from a certified supplier. This is a new requirement based on
        the Ministerial Order No. 002/13/10TC of 31/07/2013 on Modalities of
        use of a certified Electronic Billing Machine, which was published in the

        Every company needs to pay for a trading license (“patente”). The cost

        the type of business – for companies with a turnover between RWF
        10,000,000 - 40,000,000, the trading license costs RWF 60,000 (based on

        The law requires that the sale agreement be authenticated by a notary.
        Article 35 of the property law specifies that for the transfer of any
        property, any adult of 21 years or older, must give their consent to the
        transfer of property. It is the practice that parties ask the notary to draft
        the sale agreement himself.

        In order to facilitate land transfers, the District Land Registry set up a
        short form of 2 pages, fulfilled by the parties to the contract. In principle,
        the contract shall be made of 3 mandatory copies, 2 of which are given                      Paid in procedure

        The buyer and seller will meet with the notary at the Sector Level to sign
        the sales agreement. There must be two witnesses signing on the sales
        agreement as well.

        The seller takes the authenticated sale agreement, the registration
        receipt and the certificate of good fiscal standing to the Land Registry
        and files a request of the transfer of property.

        The documents to be provided are the following:
        (1) Completed form to request the transfer
        (2) Original property title
        (3) The notarized sale agreement

By Doing Business report year from DB2010 to DB2015

                    Rwanda strengthened its secured transactions system by
                    allowing a wider range of assets to be used as collateral,
                    permitting a general description of debts and obligations in the
DB2010
                    security agreement, allowing out-of-court enforcement of
                    collateral, granting secured creditors absolute priority within
                    bankruptcy and creating a new collateral registry.
                    Rwanda enhanced access to credit by allowing borrowers the
                    right to inspect their own credit report and mandating that
DB2011
                    loans of all sizes be reported to the central bank’s public credit
                    registry.
                    In Rwanda the private credit bureau started to collect and
                    distribute information from utility companies and also started
DB2012
                    to distribute more than 2 years of historical information,
                    improving the credit information system.
                    Rwanda strengthened its secured transactions system by
DB2014              providing more flexibility on the types of debts and obligations
                    that can be secured through a collateral agreement.
                    Rwanda improved access to credit by establishing clear priority
                    rules outside bankruptcy for secured creditors and establishing
DB2015
                    clear grounds for relief from a stay of enforcement actions by
                    secured creditors during reorganization procedures.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
