Appendix A. Context of the OECS Countries
The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) is a subregional grouping in the
Caribbean, established on June 18, 1981 by the Treaty of Basseterre. The ten-member
grouping comprises six sovereign states and four overseas territories. Eight of the 10
members also share a common currency (the East Caribbean dollar), a common central
bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, or ECCB), and consequently constitute the
Eastern Caribbean Economic and Currency Union (ECCU).1 A revised Treaty of
Basseterre to establish the OECS Economic Union came into force on January 21, 2011.
The revised treaty envisages the creation of a single economic and financial space
within which goods, people, and capital move freely; monetary and fiscal policies are
harmonized; and countries continue to adopt a common approach to trade, health,
education, and the environment. Since 1976, the East Caribbean dollar has been pegged
to the U.S. dollar at a rate of EC$2.70 to $1. This commitment to a fixed exchange rate
has provided a strong anchor for macroeconomic stability, allowed for low rates of
inflation, and facilitated the development of the financial system.

The six independent OECS countries are the quintessential small states. With a total
landmass of about 2,364 square kilometers and a combined population of just over
600,000 people, the middle-income group of islands that comprise the OECS are small
not only in geographic area, but also in population.2 They are similar in culture, climate,
topography, history, and language. The economies are also similar in their proximity to
the United States (their largest trading partner) and natural endowments (sand, sea, and
sun), making them prime tourist destinations.3 In addition, the members share a
number of important structural characteristics. First, owing to their small geographic
and population size, they face challenges of diseconomies of small scale, especially in
infrastructure, institutions, and markets. Second, their location makes them vulnerable
to climate change phenomena, such as rising sea levels and temperatures as well as
frequent natural disasters, especially hurricanes.4 Third, while they enjoy the benefits of
very open economies, they are simultaneously vulnerable to external events and shocks
such as the removal of trade preferences and the still unfolding impact of the recent
global financial crisis. Fourth, they have achieved middle-income status, but some
continue to face the challenges of youth unemployment, crime, and public security as
well as weak institutions and economic management that have contributed to their high
public debt and difficult business environment.

Economic growth in the subregion was sluggish even before the 2008–09 global
economic crisis, owing partly to a deterioration in external conditions. During the 1980s,
real gross domestic product (GDP) in the OECS region grew at an annual average rate

CONTEXT OF THE OECS COUNTRIES
of about 6 percent, largely from growth in tourism, expansion in agricultural
production (mainly bananas and sugar), and increased public investment financed
primarily by development assistance.5 However, since 1990, annual economic growth in
the OECS region has slowed drastically, averaging 3 percent in the decade after 1990
and 2 percent in the next decade (figure A.1). The slowdown in growth that began in
the early 1990s was brought on by a combination of factors that included recessions in
advanced economies, structural weaknesses of the OECS economies, and a number of
negative external shocks (Schipke, Cebotari, and Thacker 2013). The negative external
shocks to the OECS included natural disasters, the events of 9/11, the erosion of trade
preferences, the slowdown in the global economy, and sharp oil price increases.

Partly from the loss of traditional agricultural trade preferences, tourism has
increasingly become the dominant economic activity and is now the single largest
invisible export for the OECS subregion. Following the implementation of the European
Union’s (EU’s) single market in 1993, the EU’s preferential regime for bananas
underwent significant changes that resulted in the erosion of the preferences for the
OECS economies and consequently a decline in banana exports (Schipke, Cebotari, and
Thacker 2013). As a result, goods exports declined and the regional economy
underwent a structural transformation from agriculture to services, especially tourism.
Consequently, tourism became the primary driver of growth in the subregion and now
contributes significantly to the accumulation of foreign reserves, job creation, personal
income, and government revenue. On average, the industry represents more than 50
percent of export earnings, at least 30 percent of GDP, and 30 percent of total
employment (table A.1). In terms of markets, the OECS countries have mostly relied on
traditional tourist markets (Canada, the Caribbean, United Kingdom, and United
States). While there has been a very marginal growth in the North American markets,

Note: Direct contributions include spending in relation to travel and tourism by residents, businesses, and government, and
visitor exports on tourism related commodities (accommodation, transportation, entertainment, and attractions) in relation to
GDP. For employment, jobs provided in these industries (accommodation services, food and beverage services, and cultural,
sports and recreational services. Indirect contribution includes capital investments in travel and tourism; government spending to
support tourism; and supply chain effects.

Despite its significance to the region, the OECS share of global tourism, measured by
both tourism receipts and number of visitor arrivals, has declined over the last decade,
indicating a loss in external competitiveness. The OECS global share of tourist arrivals
declined from 0.13 percent in 2000 to 0.09 percent in 2014. Within the Caribbean, the
OECS share of tourist arrivals fell from 4.2 percent to 3.6 percent over the same period.
As with tourist arrivals, the OECS performed below the Caribbean on tourism receipts.
Between 2006 and 2012, the OECS’s share of total Caribbean receipts declined from 5.2
to 4.8 percent (World Bank 2015).

The countries’ relative openness to trade increases their vulnerability to external shocks.
The subregion’s high degree of trade openness and concentration of exports in a few
goods and services has resulted in greater vulnerability to external shocks, notably in
prices and trading partner country demand for exports, including tourism. 6 The
openness of OECS countries is especially evident through the trade openness indicator,
measured as exports and imports of goods and services as a percentage of output
(trade/GDP) (table A.2). The OECS as a whole displayed an average openness indicator
of 96 percent over the 2005–13 period. In comparison, the average trade openness

indicator for the Latin America and the Caribbean Region and emerging market and
developing economies over the same period was 61 percent and 43 percent,
respectively. In addition, taxes from international trade transactions account for more
than half of government revenue in the region.7 Given this degree of openness, any
changes in trade performance have a direct impact on economic output.

A narrow export base coupled with the fact that most investment and consumption
goods are imported has meant that imports consistently exceed exports, resulting in a
structural trade deficit, which averaged about 33 percent of GDP over the 2005–13
period. Surpluses on the services account, particularly tourism receipts, have been
instrumental in containing the current account deficit which averaged 21 percent of
GDP over the same period. Thus far, the OECS subregion has been able to finance the
current account imbalance with substantial inflows of foreign direct investment and
development aid.

Extensive emigration in recent decades has led to the rapid growth of private
remittances, which now constitute an important source of financing. The OECS region
has, over the past two decades, experienced a significant migration of skilled labor out
of the region, and has in return benefited from large private remittances. The latter now
constitute an important element of the safety net for the poor and unemployed.
Remittance flows to the region have been one of the most important sources of
financing, and since the 1990s, they have exceeded official development flows.
Remittance amounts in the region range from about $21 million in Antigua and
Barbuda (1.8 percent of GDP in 2013) to $52 million in St. Kitts and Nevis (6.7 percent of
GDP in 2013) with a regional average of about 4 percent of GDP, in 2013.

The countries in the subregion are also highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks and
have delicate natural environments. The small island states of the OECS lie directly in
the path of Atlantic hurricanes, which have in recent years, increased in frequency and
intensity.8 The region is also at significant risk of other major climatic hazards,
including storm surges, strong winds, heavy rains, drought, and volcanic eruptions.
Existing threats to the region’s ecosystems include overexploitation of their resource
base, loss of natural habitats, changes in water quality and quantity, and climate
change.9 The catastrophic nature of the subregion’s natural disasters has typically
resulted in the diversion of already limited resources away from other development
priorities, to the financing of post-disaster recovery efforts. Between 1993 and 2012,
average OECS annual losses from natural disasters reached 4.3 percent of GDP.
Individual instances of damage have far exceeded this average (World Bank 2014). For
example, the damage caused by Hurricane Ivan to Grenada in 2004 amounted to an
estimated $900 million in losses, more than twice the country’s GDP, while Hurricane
Georges caused damages amounting to 155 percent of St. Kitts and Nevis’s 1998 GDP
(figure A.2). Recent studies suggest that the average hurricane in the Caribbean reduces
output by nearly 1 percent, and that in the ECCU, the debt to GDP ratio grows faster, by
almost 5 percentage points the year a storm strikes, with a cumulative debt increase of 5
percent of GDP a few years later (IMF 2013).

APPENDIX A
CONTEXT OF THE OECS COUNTRIES
Public finances in the subregion have been under strain, especially in the wake of the
global economic crisis, and debt levels are high. The OECS countries have persistently
large levels of debt and in 2014 ranked among the 35 most indebted nations in the
world. The combined public debt of the six OECS economies has been greater than 50
percent of regional GDP since 1990, and averaged about 87 percent during the 2000–14
period (table A.3).10 The rapid buildup of debt is attributable in great measure to a
deterioration in fiscal balances owing mostly to a rise in expenditures rather than a fall
in revenues. The rise in expenditures reflects policy slippages, exogenous shocks, and
other factors such as bailouts (Schipke, Cebotari, and Thacker 2013). As at end-2014,
more than half (53 percent) of the debt in the region was owed to external creditors. The
reliance on external sources was high, particularly in Dominica (69 percent of total debt)
and Grenada (66 percent of total debt). Of the external debt, about 40 percent is
multilateral, with the majority held by the Caribbean Development Bank.

The erosion of competitiveness in OECS economies is a bottleneck to growth. Firms
operating in the region experience cost disadvantages that are both structural and
policy-driven. Labor costs in the subregion are high and have grown faster than
productivity partly from a high degree of unionization. Electricity costs are among the
highest in the world, reflecting sector inefficiencies, lack of investments, and monopoly
powers of generators and distributors. The high cost of credit derives from several
factors including deposit rates floors in selected countries, information asymmetries
from the absence of credit bureaus, and lengthy credit recovery processes as the result
of judicial procedures. There is also some evidence of overvaluation of the Eastern
Caribbean dollar. Recent IMF computations suggest that the real effective exchange rate
is overvalued by about 23 percent for the ECCU economies.

In general, the countries rank well on the Doing Business indicators, compared with
small islands and other Caribbean countries, though they are well behind the

                                                              CONTEXT OF THE OECS COUNTRIES
institutional structures present in advanced countries. In particular, the average
rankings of OECS countries for getting electricity (but not the cost of its use), contract
enforcement, ease of getting construction permits, and protection of investors bode well
for a growth-supportive institutional framework. However, payment of taxes, access to
credit, labor market rigidities, and property registration remain weak. Cooperation at
the subregion level has already helped to reduce the fixed costs of some public and
private services and there is potential in others, including transportation The very
limited fiscal space for public investments means that private sector participation in the
provision of reliable, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure services is essential and
building an environment conducive to private investments in infrastructure is a
priority.

OECS members boast open democracies characterized by political stability with high
participation in elections, but with costly civil services. The countries of the subregion
are all stable, parliamentary democracies and are founded on constitutions which
guarantee a wide set of fundamental rights and freedoms to the people that are
enforceable through the high court. The electoral system in the states is a single member
plurality system which has created a representative political order with politics in most
islands being dominated by two parties. Public administrations are characterized by
well-established organizational structures and institutional rules and regulations,
respect for the rule of law, and a high degree of judicial independence. In general, the
World Governance Indicators (2013) paint a favorable picture, placing the OECS
countries within the 55–95th percentile worldwide.11 As in other countries, the
dominance of two parties has led to significant political polarization, especially in the
run-up to elections, and contributed to political business cycles. Furthermore, the
existing government systems are outdated and have resulted in civil services that are
large, bureaucratic, and burdensome to their small economies. On average, the wage
bill accounted for 44 percent of government expenditures in 2012, compared with 26
percent for Latin American countries and 26 percent for middle-income countries.12 This
ratio varies among the countries in the region with Dominica having the lowest ratio at
40 percent, while Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines had the highest at 50
percent.

The OECS countries have made good progress on social indicators although some
challenges remain in key areas. Overall, human development indicators for the
subregion are favorable and the countries rank between 61 and 97 among the 187 states
in the United Nations Development Programme’s 2013 Human Development Index.
Good progress has been achieved in most of the Millennium Development Goals
including the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger, universal primary education,
gender equality, and improved maternal health. Gross enrollment in primary education
ranges between 85 and 118 percent and in secondary education between 88 and 105

                                                                                          7

percent. Infant mortality is low, ranging from 6 to 20 per 1,000 live births and average
life expectancy is comparable to that of OECD countries.13 Maternal mortality rates—
which range from 23 to 45 per 100,000 live births in 2013—are also low in the OECS.14
Progress in reducing hunger by half has been mixed. While hunger is very low in
Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, hunger in Antigua and Barbuda and
Grenada remains moderately high and has worsened over time; St. Kitts and Nevis and
St. Lucia have made some progress in reducing hunger but remain relatively far from
attaining their goals (World Bank 2014).

Despite their high per capita income status and a dearth of reliable time-series data,
poverty rates in the OECS appear to be higher than the averages in both Latin America
and the Caribbean Region and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs). Poverty rates
in the region, which vary from 18 to 38 percent using each country’s national poverty
line (figure A.3), are higher than the averages for both the Region and UMICs (5.4 and
5.6 percent respectively in 2012). Conversely, inequality as measured by the Gini
coefficient is low (ranging from 36.6 in 2008 in Grenada to 48 in 2006 in Antigua and
Barbuda) compared to the Region average of 52.9 in 2009 (World Bank 2014). The poor
in the OECS region are concentrated in rural areas, where a large part of the population
lives, and poverty is particularly prevalent among female-headed households. Despite a
lack of regular labor market surveys, unemployment—especially among the youth—is a
major concern in the region. Available data from member states indicate that
unemployment rates (as a percentage of the labor force) range from 6.3 percent in
Antigua and Barbuda to 25 percent in Grenada (IMF 2013). Among the youth,
unemployment rates range from 34 percent in St. Lucia to 42 percent in Grenada. The
high numbers of out of work youth are of particular concern because of related
increases in the prevalence of gang involvement, drug abuse, and crime. There is also
evidence suggesting that youth unemployment is more prevalent among the female
population of the OECS states.

Improvements in key social indicators notwithstanding, the social gains achieved risk
being eroded by a number of factors. Firstly, the high and growing incidence of
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) if not addressed could reverse the gains in the
health indicators. NCDs now account for about 70 percent of deaths in the OECS, a rate
much higher than either the global average (50 percent) or the average for low- and
middle-income countries in the Americas (60 percent). Furthermore, NCDs constitute a
growing portion of health spending and impose a large economic burden at the societal,
community, and household level.15 Secondly, weaknesses in the educational system are
having a stifling effect on competitiveness and growth, and contributing to rising
unemployment among youth. Education system challenges are sourced in a number of
factors, including inadequate attention to early childhood development, poor quality of
education, limited access to tertiary education, and a lack of qualified teachers.16 The
average pass rates for standardized tests in core subjects such as English and
mathematics are less than 50 percent, and many students lack basic skills in information
and communication technology and other disciplines deemed critical for success in the
work place. Evidence also points to a mismatch between the skills acquired in school
and the critical skills demanded by the labor market. Relatedly, the lack of adequate
skills is frequently cited as a top constraint to hiring by firms in the region.

Gender dynamics in the OECS states are more complex than those in many other
regions or countries. Gender identities rooted in shared social norms and cultural
values expose men and women to specific gendered concerns. Women in the region
experience higher rates of unemployment, fewer job options, and lower wages than
men. In some OECS states, poverty rates are higher among women, especially among
female-headed households and women in rural areas.17 In the OECS countries, women
are also particularly vulnerable to domestic violence and increased health risks.
According to a recent United Nations report (UN 2011), young women aged 15–24,
constitute the most at-risk population and are three to six times more likely to contract
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS). Lastly, women’s involvement in political activities also lags behind that of men.
In contrast, some gender inequalities appear to have tilted toward male
marginalization, especially in terms of underachievement and school dropout rates. The
ratio of female to male enrollment is near parity at the primary level in almost all
countries but girls are slightly more likely than boys to be enrolled in secondary school.
Available data also suggest that girls are much more likely to enroll at the tertiary level.
In addition, men’s involvement in violent activities and substance abuse continues to
increase and exceeds that of women.

APPENDIX A
CONTEXT OF THE OECS COUNTRIES

Developments during the Evaluation Period
Given the strong linkages of the region with the United States and Europe, the OECS
states were severely impacted by the global financial crisis and experienced sharp
declines in growth. Pre-existing weaknesses in the financial sector, debt management,
public finances, and social protection programs exacerbated the fall-out from the crisis
and severely constrained the countries’ ability to respond. The primary channels of
transmission for the crisis were through significant reductions in the levels of tourism,
remittances, foreign direct investment, and exports. As a result, regional growth
contracted from about 4.2 percent during 2006–08 to -2.7 percent over the following
three years (table A.4). Per capita income declined on average by 4.5 percent from
around $9,200 in 2008 to $8,800 in 2012. The largest fall in per capita income was felt in
Antigua and Barbuda (17 percent compared to the pre-crisis level), which experienced a
cumulative output contraction of 22 percent of GDP during 2009–11. Dominica, St.
Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines were less affected by the crisis compared
with neighboring countries (World Bank 2014).

Positive growth, together with fiscal imbalances and already high-debt levels, prevailed
pre-crisis. Confronted by a series of external economic shocks in the early 2000s, the
OECS governments tried to offset the slowdown and sustain employment through
expansionary fiscal policy, mainly through increased public spending financed by
expensive commercial borrowing. As a result, the region’s economic growth rebounded
from an average of 1.3 percent during 2000–02, to about 5 percent over the 2003–07
period. However, the increased spending led to growing fiscal imbalances and an
unsustainably large debt burden.18 The OECS fiscal deficit, which stood at 6.6 percent of
regional GDP in 2000, had grown to 10.5 percent in 2002. On average, the OECS fiscal
deficit was about 6.5 percent of regional GDP over the 2000–07 period compared to
about 3.7 percent during 2008–14. Consequently, the OECS public debt grew from about
70 percent of regional GDP in 2000, peaked at 95 percent in 2004, and was about 87

percent of GDP in 2014. As a result of both revenue-enhancing and expenditure-
reducing measures, fiscal balances in the region have improved since the crisis. In
Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis for example, fiscal positions have improved because
of the introduction of a Value-Added Tax (VAT) and strong receipts from the
Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program, while in the other countries large
expenditures have continued to put pressure on fiscal balances.

Current account deficits in member states have also been declining as a result of the
global crisis. The OECS’s average current account deficit has declined by more than 10
percentage points (from 28.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 13.5 percent in 2014) because of
lower imports and strong service receipts, mainly driven by the CBI program.19
Financing of the current account deficit has relied heavily on government borrowing
and on a number of nontraditional sources of financing, including the CBI programs, oil
financing arrangements under Venezuela’s Petrocaribe program, and nontraditional
development partners. Uncertainty regarding the long-term sustainability of these
arrangements and programs also increases the vulnerability of the OECS states. A
disruption or modification of the terms of oil financing, for example, could affect the
external accounts of OECS countries and generate fiscal pressures. In addition, while
the CBI programs have been a significant source of funding for several OECS countries
in recent years (providing revenues equal to 13 percent of GDP in St. Kitts and Nevis in
2013 and of nearly 4 percent in Dominica), their sustainability is uncertain, especially as
such programs proliferate in the region (e.g., Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada
restarted their programs in 2013 and 2014, respectively).

The global crisis also triggered distress in the financial sector and exposed critical gaps
in the regulatory and supervisory structure of nonbank financial institutions. Financial
soundness indicators deteriorated as nonperforming loans increased, putting pressure
on profitability and capital levels. Further, the weakness of the real estate market made
it difficult for banks to realize real estate collateral. In July 2011, the largest domestic
bank in Antigua and Barbuda, which accounted for 3.2 percent of the total assets of the
ECCU banking system was taken over by the Central Bank. The January 2009 failure of
British American Insurance Company Limited (BAICO) and Colonial Life Insurance
Company (CLICO)—two subsidiaries of CL Financial Group which offered high
interest rates on fixed-term deposits backed by risky investments in the U.S. real estate
sector—caused a major financial shock throughout the Caribbean. The failure led to
costly government interventions with the highest gross exposure at 15 percent of 2009
GDP in the OECS region (Schipke, Cebotari, and Thacker 2013). The weak underwriting
criteria and risk management policies in banks prior to the crisis in combination with
the prevailing low growth environment have resulted in a deterioration of asset quality,
a decline in profitability, and a contraction in credit to the private sector.20

CONTEXT OF THE OECS COUNTRIES
Finally, in part as a result of the crisis, major advances have been made in the continued
process of integration and cooperation among the OECS countries. The Eight-point
stabilization and growth program, signed by the ECCU governments in 2009, served as
the basis for a coordinated regional response to the global financial crisis. The primary
pillars of the stabilization program were in the areas of financial programming, fiscal
reforms, debt management, public sector investment programs, social and financial
safety nets, and reforms of the banking and insurance sectors. To deepen the level of
economic integration, a revised Treaty of Basseterre establishing the OECS Economic
Union entered into force on January 21, 2011. The revised treaty paves the way for the
creation of a single financial and economic space with a common external tariff and
within which goods, people, and capital would move freely. Member states are
expected to harmonize monetary and fiscal policies and to take a common approach to
trade, health, education, and the environment as well as to the development of such
critical sectors as agriculture, tourism, and energy.

the small number of white-sand beaches, high rainfall, and poor air connections. Instead, eco-
tourism is being promoted.

9The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the buildings in the region were
not built to appropriate seismic-resistant standards, so a large earthquake event could also have
catastrophic consequences.
10In 2014, the average debt to GDP ratio for the sub-region stood at 87 percent of regional GDP
and all the states have since 2010, exceeded the ECCU’s target debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent.
11 TheWorld Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators are annual composite constructs made
up of individual indices (mostly based on perceptions or “expert opinions”) from various
sources, including the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Survey, Political Risk
Services International Country Risk Guide, and more specialized sources such as Transparency
International. Aggregation helps reduce potential idiosyncratic errors associated with the
individual indices, and the composite indices measure various dimensions of governance
within known error margins. The composite indices track six dimensions of governance: “Voice
and Accountability,” “Political Stability and Absence of Violence,” “Government Effectiveness,”
“Regulatory Quality,” “Rule of Law,” and “Control of Corruption.”

a ratio of the OECS countries’ GDP.
13Though lower than the average for small states (20 deaths per 1,000 live births), the infant

Vincent and the Grenadines.
15The costs of NCDs include direct costs of individual health spending as well as indirect loss of
earnings, in addition to the economic burden to families, communities, and private and public
healthcare systems. In St. Lucia for example, NCD patients spend 36 percent of their total
household expenditure annually for care.
16 According to a recent World Bank report on Education in the OECS countries, on average, 21
percent of Mathematics and English teachers are unqualified in the subject matter, and this rate
is over 80 percent among Science teachers in OECS countries (Matthews 2013).
17 The gender distribution of poverty in the sub-region varies across countries. Men and women
are nearly equally represented among the poor in Dominica. In Grenada and St. Lucia,
however, more males than females are poor (52.2 percent and 57.5 percent, respectively). The
situation is reversed in Antigua and Barbuda and in St. Kitts and Nevis, where females make up
52.8 percent and 52.5 percent, respectively, of the poor.
18 Centralgovernment primary deficits (excluding grants) in particular, were the main source of
rising debt ratios in OECS countries, accounting for more than half of the total increase during
the pre-crisis period.
19 TheCBI is a program established by some OECS governments to attract investors to make a
substantial contribution to the development of the country in return for the opportunity to
apply for citizenship and passport within the strict guidelines of the law. CBI programs are
active in Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Dominica, and St. Kitts and Nevis.
20NPLs increased significantly following the 2008–09 crisis from 6 percent in 2007 to more than
11 percent of total loans at end-2010.

                                WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONAL PROGRAM FY06–14
The FY06–09 Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) foresaw World Bank Group-wide
activity, including base-case International Development Association (IDA) financing of
almost $13 million a year, reduced slightly in the RPS Progress Report (RPSPR). The
RPS was based on indicative base case World Bank financing totaling $51.3 million on
IDA terms to the four blend countries. This total included both the projected IDA
country allocations and a $15.2 million IDA regional allocation. Base case lending was
to be conditioned on criteria covering macroeconomic and portfolio performance as
well as regional integration and collaboration for regional projects. Failing these,
lending was to be scaled back to a low-case scenario. There was a provision in base case
lending for budget support, and investment lending was to focus on skills
enhancement, public sector management, and infrastructure. High-case lending—to be
triggered by the fulfillment of more stringent macroeconomic performance criteria—
would amount to roughly double the base case amount. The difference—possibly
including additional budget support—was to be provided on International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) terms, with Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts
and Nevis in addition to the four blend countries as potential beneficiaries.

The Bank also planned to commit grant financing under trust funds for capacity-
building activities. Planned analytic and advisory activities (AAA), many OECS- or
Caribbean-wide, covered a variety of areas, and there was emphasis on dissemination
of key AAA to build ownership for relevant reforms. As is standard, the RPS did not
detail planned IFC activity, although both investment and advisory service operations
were envisioned. IFC was to seek investment opportunities in areas that fostered
growth diversification and regional integration, including the financial sector,
infrastructure (favoring public-private partnerships, or PPPs), and services (notably
information technology and tourism). However, the RPS recognized that given small-
state-specific constraints (e.g., the need to attain critical mass), International Finance
Corporation (IFC) investment funding mechanisms would likely need to be
underpinned by partnerships with grant donors. Other activities would include
technical assistance and advisory services related to small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) planned to conduct a
benchmarking exercise of the OECS countries’ competitiveness with foreign direct
investment using Commonwealth Secretariat funding. It also foresaw the possibility of
the Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS) replicating its 2004 review
of Grenada’s investment climate in other OECS countries. The RPSPR maintained the
RPS pillars and planned areas of Bank Group intervention, but introduced some new
project and AAA activities, and substantially modified the RPS results framework. The
RPSPR also recognized the base case scenario as having been, and most likely
remaining, the relevant one for Bank financing. Based on somewhat lower-than-

planned IDA availability, it reduced its projection of total Bank financing on IDA terms
to the four blend countries.

The FY10–14 RPS planned for Bank and IFC activity, including IDA financing averaging
almost $15 million per year. Rather than detail financing scenarios, the FY10–14 RPS
projected Bank financing of up to $73 million on IDA terms to the four blend countries
and up to $120 million (up to $20 million for each of the six countries) on IBRD terms.
Under the influence of the global crisis, IDA/IBRD financing was envisioned to include
both budget support (including possible programmatic development policy lending)
and investment lending, with the latter covering multiple areas, including disaster
vulnerability reduction, regional energy regulation, and social protection. In addition,
the RPS envisioned some grant financing commitments under the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and under other trust funds (such as the Institutional Development Fund)
for capacity-building initiatives. The RPS also set out an AAA program, including
analytic work and various nonlending technical assistance (NLTA) initiatives. As in the
FY06–09 RPS, IFC planned to focus on financial markets (including trade finance, SME
financing, microfinance, and credit information); infrastructure; investment climate; and
growth sectors, including sustainable tourism. Particular focus—for advisory services
as well as for potential investments—was to be put on PPPs.1 MIGA was not mentioned.
While maintaining the RPS pillars and broad areas of intervention, the RPSPR
introduced some changes in the work program—dropping a financial sector technical
assistance project and an education sectorwide approach (SWAP)2—as well as in
outcome indicators and targets in the RPS results matrix. It also dropped “how to” IFC
advisory work on PPPs and planned investment climate assessment work in certain
countries. No radical change in IDA/IBRD financing was made, although the constraint
on the availability of IDA resources turned out to be less binding than anticipated in the
RPS.

Detailed Portfolio Analysis
Delivery of World Bank financing over the evaluation period did not differ radically
from plans, although IDA funding was larger than expected. During the FY06–09 RPS
period, deliveries of Bank (i.e., IDA/IBRD) financing commitments amounted to some
$41.5 million under 10 projects. The new financing commitments benefited the four
blend countries, mainly Grenada and St. Lucia, and were entirely on IDA terms. The
$10 million shortfall compared with the original (base-case) plans had already been
largely anticipated in the FY06–09 RPSPR, and was attributable mainly to lower-than-
expected availability of IDA resources following a reallocation to other Caribbean
countries for natural disaster response. During the FY10–14 RPS period, new Bank
financing commitments amounted to $198.9 million on IDA terms (to the four blend
countries) and $18.5 million on IBRD terms (of which $10 million was to Antigua and

Barbuda) under 14 operations. Compared with plans (even as modified by the FY10–14
RPSPR), IDA commitments turned out significantly higher, as IDA allocations for the
countries turned out to be larger than projected initially3 and significant IDA regional
resources (which the RPSPR had not attempted to project) were mobilized in favor of
the OECS countries.4 In contrast, the modest financing commitments on IBRD terms
during FY10–14 remained well within the envelope specified in the RPS. Altogether,
new Bank lending commitments over the evaluation period amounted to almost $259
million under 24 operations, all but $18.5 million of it on IDA terms. Beyond the
individual country IDA allocations, IDA resources of $42.6 million were provided from
the regional allocation.5 In addition to IDA/IBRD financing, again mostly in line with
plans, $67 million in GEF and trust fund grant financing was committed to the OECS
countries (table B.1) under 25 projects.6

The instruments under which Bank financing was committed were mainly investment
projects concentrated in disaster risk management. Commitments of IDA/IBRD
financing were made predominantly under investment operations. Grenada and St.
Lucia—the largest overall recipients of Bank financing—were the only recipients of
development policy operations, which accounted for only 14 percent of the value and 13
percent of the number of IDA/IBRD commitments. In general, the operations delivered
largely reflected plans (as qualified in the RPSPRs). For instance, during FY10–14,
although the RPSPR introduced some modifications relative to RPS plans (notably to
accommodate post-Hurricane Tomas recovery operations in St. Lucia and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines and to drop financial and education sector lending), the outturn of
projects approved differed little from the modified plans.7 The sector composition of
operations was concentrated in disaster risk reduction and management (including
catastrophic insurance and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction), with
commitments classified under the urban development sector board accounting for

almost half of total lending (figure B.1). Overall, five key areas that were broadly
aligned with the CAS pillars—urban development (under which virtually all disaster
risk management operations are classified), financial and private sector development,
economic policy, global information-communications technology, and social
protection—accounted for almost 90 percent of total Bank financing commitments
during FY06–14.

Although IDA/IBRD financing commitments were larger in the latter part of the
evaluation period, the portfolio of Bank-financed operations underwent substantial
consolidation. The Bank lending commitments during the evaluation period came on
top of a significant inherited portfolio of 20 projects with an associated net commitment
of about $128 million.8 New IDA/IBRD financing commitments—especially
commitment volumes—were tilted heavily toward the latter part of the evaluation
period (figure B.2). In particular, commitment volumes increased sharply in FY14
owing to the approval of three new disaster vulnerability reduction operations for
Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which together amounted to
$93.6 million in new financing commitments. Despite the increase in commitment
volumes, however, the number of active IDA/IBRD-financed projects in the portfolio
fell steadily after peaking in 2008 (figure B.2). Close to end-FY15, the active portfolio
comprised only 9 operations for a total net commitment of about $184 million—
compared with more than twice that number at the start of the evaluation period.

Consolidation notwithstanding, portfolio riskiness increased after FY12, while
disbursements showed no clear trend. During the period FY06–10, on average 14
percent of the number of projects and 10 percent of commitment volumes in the OECS
were deemed to be at risk. Portfolio riskiness contrasted favorably with an average of 20
percent of the number of projects and 17 percent of commitment volumes at risk in the
Bank’s Latin America and the Caribbean Region, and a world average of 18 percent of

the number of projects and 15 percent of commitment volumes at risk over the same
period. Exceptionally, in FY11, no Bank operations or commitments in the OECS were
considered to be at risk (table B.3). However, since FY12, the riskiness of the OECS
portfolio has increased to 30 percent of projects and 20 percent of commitments
compared to 22 percent and 19 percent for the Region and 20 percent of both projects
and commitments for the World Bank portfolio as a whole. The trend in disbursements
over the evaluation period was somewhat unclear, although disbursements did show
some signs of weakening, especially as a ratio of net commitment volumes (and
especially following the record new commitment volumes in FY14). Disbursements
declined from an average of $25.4 million during FY06–08 to an average of $18.8 million
over FY09–11, remaining virtually flat at an average of $18.2 million thereafter (figure
B.2).

The performance of projects exiting the OECS portfolio was somewhat better than the
World Bank average, albeit with significant risks to development outcomes. Thirty-
three operations exiting the portfolio during the evaluation period were subject to IEG
assessments (table B.4).9 On average, outcome ratings, at about 79 percent moderately
satisfactory or better, are on a par with those of the Region and are somewhat better
than the average for the Bank as a whole (73 percent). Seven projects exiting the OECS
portfolio were rated as moderately unsatisfactory or worse. Most of these operations
encountered implementation delays, primarily as a result of project designs that made
insufficient provision for weak client institutional capacity. In particular, issues
hindering project implementation included complex institutional arrangements, overly
sophisticated M&E plans, inadequate political economy analysis, weak ownership, and
coordination problems linked to multiplicity of stakeholders. IEG reviews of closed
projects also found a high risk to development outcome in two (8 percent), and
significant risk to development outcome in seven (28 percent), of the 25 instances where
risk was assessed. Commitments under these projects amounted to $48.5 million, or 26
percent of total commitments under all projects assessed for risk to development
outcome. The elevated risks to development outcomes were attributable to factors such
as lack of government consensus and public support for certain reforms, uncertainty
regarding the sustainability of financing for infrastructure maintenance in contexts
characterized by fiscal constraints and vulnerability to natural disasters, and
unsustainability of institutional arrangements established during project
implementation.

In terms of Bank AAA deliveries, NLTA dominated. The Bank delivered a total of 55
AAA products over the evaluation period, largely reflecting (RPSPR-adjusted) plans.
Economic and sector work (ESW) accounted for 38 percent of the number of AAA tasks,
which were dominated by NLTA (62 percent of AAA tasks). Out of a total of about $12
million in Bank (administrative) budget and trust fund resources allocated to AAA
products over the evaluation period, 69 percent was allocated to NLTA tasks. The
composition of AAA switched sharply toward NLTA during the latter part of the
period (figure B.3). ESW deliveries included several reports, the majority of which had
multi-OECS-country coverage involving a broad array of themes, including fiduciary
management, tourism sector backward linkages, skills enhancement, private sector
financing, and an accounting and audit ROSC.10 A gender review was completed
toward the end of the period and was attached to the FY15–19 RPS. Several ESW
products with Caribbean-wide reach—again covering diverse themes, including
pension reform, nurse migration, noncommunicable diseases, crime and violence, air
transportation, and a regional energy strategy—and Bank Group institutional products
such as Doing Business updates also had direct applicability to the OECS countries. In
addition, shortly before the start of the evaluation period, in-depth core diagnostic ESW
on the OECS countries—which was not emphasized during the evaluation period—had
been completed on the growth agenda and fiscal (including public expenditure) issues.
Bank NLTA deliveries benefiting the OECS had similarly broad thematic coverage.
They were both inter-OECS—coverage included debt management, financial sector,
education, safety nets, and statistics; and Caribbean-wide—coverage included public
financial management, natural hazard risk management, human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and youth at risk.11

IFC delivered few investments, concentrating its efforts in advisory services, while
MIGA had virtually no activity. IFC made only two direct investments in OECS-based
institutions over the evaluation period: a $20 million loan to the Bank of St. Lucia in
FY08 and a $30 million loan to the American University of Antigua in FY10.12 In
addition, under an IFC trade line, $8.6 million in trade finance guarantees were

generated. Nevertheless, IFC invested at least $120 million in companies domiciled
outside the OECS but with operations and investments in OECS countries.13 IFC also
delivered 14 advisory service (AS) operations during the evaluation period,
concentrated in the areas of access to finance (including microfinance and credit
information), PPP transactions advisory, and the business climate. AS operations in the
area of access to finance included provision of technical assistance to the Bank of St.
Lucia in designing and implementing a strategy for SME financing, while PPP-related
AS operations typically involved providing support for structuring transactions. These
transactions included divestment of the state insurance company of Antigua,
development and operation of replacement hospital in Grenada, and a concession to
introduce private sector participation in the operation of St. Lucia’s Hewanorra
International Airport. Finally, MIGA activity during the evaluation period was confined
to the planned competitiveness benchmarking exercise.

2 TheRPSPR explains that the Bank was able to mobilize grant resources, including DFID
support, to fund financial sector technical assistance, while the countries had made insufficient
progress in mapping out a credible education strategy to warrant Bank preparation of a
sectorwide approach in the sector.
     also reflected a doubling of the minimum base IDA country allocation to SDR 3 million
3 This

under IDA-16 (FY12–14), which benefited small states disproportionately.
4 Almost   $38 million in regional IDA resources were committed during the FY10–14 period.
5This figure breaks down into $4.8 million over FY06–09 and $37.8 million over FY10–14. To be
eligible to draw on the regional IDA allocation, a project must fulfill certain criteria, including
planning to involve three or more countries, all of which need to participate for project
objectives to be achievable (see World Bank 2005, para. 132). In addition, regional IDA funding
must leverage national allocations. Caribbean-wide operations that involved at least one OECS
country are included in the figures cited.
6 Inaddition to financing commitments of IDA/IBRD resources, financing commitments to
clients made by the Bank also count projects financed by the GEF and other trust funds that are
client-executed (the $67 million figure cited). In contrast, trust fund-financed initiatives that are
Bank-executed—some of which can in practice closely resemble client-executed projects—are
classified under Bank AAA (typically as nonlending technical assistance) rather than as
financing commitments to clients.
7Differences relate mainly to the timing and amounts of certain operations. For instance, the
FY10–14 RPSPR foresaw programmatic development policy lending beginning in FY13,
whereas the first Grenada Resilience-Building DPL was approved in FY14. The Antigua Public
and Social Sector Transformation Project was anticipated as an FY12 delivery of $20 million, but
ultimately materialized as an FY13 delivery of $10 million.
   addition, 5 projects (including three GEF projects) with associated trust fund grant financing
8 In

commitments of $10.8 million were active at the start of the evaluation period.
9 Two  were Caribbean-wide GEF operations, and one (the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility) was trust fund-financed and recipient-executed. The remainder, which
included projects with a multi-Caribbean-country or multi-OECS-country reach and country-
specific operations, were IDA/IBRD-financed. All IEG assessments took the form of ICR
reviews, and in two cases a more detailed assessment (PPAR) was also done subsequently.
                ESW, which included a cocoa and nutmeg logistics chain analysis for Grenada
10 Single-country

and debt management assessments for Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and St. Kitts and Nevis
was more limited.
11 Single-country   NLTA tasks (e.g., on geothermal development in Dominica) were limited.
12The dearth of IFC investment opportunities in the OECS region is often attributed to the small
size of the countries (high transactions cost relative to the size of potential investments) and the
absence of stronger regional integration.
13These included a $100 million equity investment in Sagicor Financial Corporation, the number
one provider of individual and group life and health insurance in Barbados, Jamaica, and the
Eastern Caribbean region, and a $20 million equity investment in a private equity firm with
investments in the Caribbean.

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS

The Bank used analytic and advisory activities (AAA) in its endeavor to help strengthen
the countries’ debt management capacity; lending had only a sparing role. Beginning in
2010, under Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) coordination and often in
collaboration with the IMF, the Bank helped provide training to country and ECCB
officials in debt management, including use of a Debt Management Performance
Assessment (DeMPA) tool,2 debt sustainability analysis, and medium-term debt strategy
(MTDS) preparation. It also provided follow-on analytic and advisory support,
including preparation of three DeMPA reports—for Antigua and Barbuda (FY10),
Grenada (FY10), and St. Kitts and Nevis (FY10)—and direct assistance in preparing
MTDSs (table C.2). Support from Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and
Development (DFATD) helped fund the Bank’s work. Separately, the Bank developed
the Comprehensive Debt Framework, a general framework for approaching debt
management in small states that clarifies the multiple policy levers affecting public debt
and their interconnectedness.3 Except for a prior action under the FY10 Grenada
Economic and Social Development Policy Loan ($8 million) that consolidated debt
management functions into a single unit,4 Bank lending has contributed little to debt
management.

Bank lending and trust fund grants sought to help strengthen agency performance and
Human Resources (HR) management capacity in Grenada and Dominica. In Grenada,
support for a New Public Management model of public service delivery in Grenada was
initially provided by the FY06 Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Credit

                                                                                                                    29

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
(PSMTAC; $3 million), which—in its initial configuration—focused on strengthening
service delivery in agencies newly designated as Executive Agencies. However, pursuit
of the Executive Agency model ran into constitutional obstacles and was later dropped.5
The PSMTAC also sought to introduce modern HR management principles into the
public sector, but the focus on this dissipated as implementation was delayed and the
project restructured. Sometime later, using an FY10 Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) grant,6 the Bank sought to help build government capacity to undertake functional
reviews in five pilot ministries and develop associated action plans.7 Despite
implementation delays, the launch of the reviews featured as a prior action under the
FY10 Economic and Social DPL (ESDPL), and four were eventually completed.8 After a
three-year hiatus, the FY14 First Programmatic Resilience-Building (DPC, $15 million)
resumed Bank support for improved public sector management,9 featuring the prior
action of endorsement of a public sector modernization policy (which inter alia
established procedures for strategic realignment of public employment, strengthening
the management of selected agencies, and developing a results focus in planning and
budgeting). In Dominica, the FY07 Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance
Credit (GSPTAC; $1.4 million) helped fund a human resources audit of ministries,
departments, and agencies and a toolkit for preparing succession plans, as well as
institutional strengthening of the government registry.

The Bank subsequently extended support for government HR management to St. Lucia,
as well as to Antigua and Barbuda and to St. Kitts and Nevis. In St. Lucia, a similar
sequencing of IDF grant-supported technical assistance and development policy
lending sought to help strengthen public sector human resource management, although
the grant’s role in providing hands-on support for DPL-supported prior actions was
less clear than in Grenada. The FY09 IDF grant helped prepare a new pay and
classification plan, review the legal framework for human resource management, and
map out a performance appraisal system. A year later, the single-tranche FY10
Economic and Social DPL ($12 million, of which $8 million IDA) supported inter alia
three prior actions relating to public sector HR management: contain the wage bill by
avoiding increases in funded government positions and stopping funding for vacant
positions; consolidate the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and
National Development under a single permanent secretary; and undertake functional
reviews in three ministries. In Antigua and Barbuda, an FY10 IDF grant supported a
payroll audit, functional reviews in two ministries, and prerequisites for carrying out a
pay and classification reform.10 A follow-on project, the ongoing FY13 Public and Social
Sector Transformation Project (PSST; $10 million), was designed to support—among
several measures to strengthen public service management—the integration of a dual
public service employment regime.11 However, owing in part to a government change
since the project’s approval, implementation of the component has been seriously

                                      WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
delayed, and is unlikely to proceed in its current form. In St. Kitts and Nevis, an FY12
IDF grant was designed to support—among other initiatives—a payroll audit and
functional reviews of government ministries, but implementation has seriously
lagged.12

In both Grenada and St. Lucia, Bank lending supported the introduction of the value
added tax (VAT) and associated strengthening of revenue administration. In Grenada,
the one-off FY10 (ESDPL) featured the prior action of VAT enactment, which simplified
indirect tax policy to four rates. In parallel, the Bank was helping to modernize
Grenada’s tax administration through the FY08 Technical Assistance Credit (TAC; $1.81
million with $0.65 million EU co-financing).13 The project supported an organizational
and management structure review of the Inland Revenue department to help
strengthen tax administration and collection. Similarly, in St. Lucia, the FY10 ESDPL
supported the submission of the VAT bill to Parliament as well as of set-up and
operationalization of a VAT unit as prior actions. Despite repeated delays in processing
the required legislation, St. Lucia eventually introduced the VAT in October 2012.

Bank lending also supported improvements in customs administration in several of the
countries, notably upgrading of UNCTAD’s ASYCUDA system.14 The FY07 Dominica
GSPTAC helped upgrade the ASYCUDA system to ASYCUDA World, leading to
significant improvements in the processing of customs procedures. In Grenada, the
FY08 TAC similarly helped replace an outdated ASYCUDA system with a web-based
version of ASYCUDA World. Despite costing more than budgeted ($1.15 million
compared to $0.85 million), the difference was covered through a restructuring that cut
other project activities. In addition, the project helped introduce better risk management
that reduced the need for inspections, and deliver training in classification and
valuation to customs officers and auditors. In St. Lucia, the FY10 ESDPL featured
commencing implementation of ASYCUDA World as a prior action, although full
operationalization encountered significant delays owing to technical glitches. In all
three countries, deployment of the new systems enabled more efficient (and eventually
paperless) customs processing as well as data exchange between the customs
administration and the trading community.

In addition, the Bank used regional instruments to support tax and customs policy and
administration as well as public expenditure management. During FY05–09, the Bank
channeled grant funding of $1 million through the Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center,15 supporting consultancies and training in (among other areas) tax
and customs policy and administration as well as public expenditure management that
benefited the OECS and among other Caribbean countries. Since 2011, the Bank has
administered a major partnership initiative to strengthen public financial management
funded by the Canada, known as Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean

                                                                                           31
APPENDIX C
WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
or SEMCAR,16 providing support to the OECS countries in the areas of inland revenue
and customs administration, as well as in several aspects of public expenditure
management, with a focus on IT systems and an underlying goal of cross-country
harmonization of systems and realizing economies of scale. Earlier, in FY07, the Bank
had used a regional IDF grant17 to deliver regionally harmonized strengthening of
institutional capacity for procurement and (external) audit. In some countries, lending
also provided fragments of support for public expenditure management, notably the
procurement and audit functions. In Dominica, the FY07 GSPTAC supported software
installation for external audit and treasury management as well as the preparation of
new procurement legislation (eventually approved in 2012). In Grenada, an early
attempt at pooling procurement with St. Vincent and the Grenadines under the FY06
PSMTAC) was unsuccessful; much later, under the FY14 Development Policy Credit
(DPC), a new procurement bill was submitted to Parliament, and approved in August
2014.18

In 2008, the Bank began supporting the development of e-government services in four
OECS countries using a regional adaptable program lending (APL) framework. The E-
Government Regional Integration Project (E-GRIP), implemented by the OECS
Secretariat and funded by FY08 IDA credits to Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia (a total
of $7.2 million) and a FY10 credit to St. Vincent and the Grenadines ($3.2 million).19
Despite implementation delays, two restructurings, some shortcomings (notably in
M&E under the project), and procurement-related issues (including limited responses
and significantly costlier-than-estimated bids), the project helped deliver support for
certain “quick-win” outputs (such as the government online portal in St. Lucia) and,
perhaps most significantly, helped the countries make inroads in setting up new
applications for electronic tax filing, a multi-purpose identification system, and a
regional electronic procurement system for pharmaceuticals.20 The project helped lay the
foundations for the countries’ development of e-government services in a regionally
harmonized way, including the establishment of e-government-related legal
infrastructure and an inter-operability framework.

Finally, the Bank used grant resources, and in some cases lending, to provide support
aimed at strengthening strategic planning and M&E capacity, both regionally and in
certain countries. At the regional level, a FY10 OECS-wide IDF grant21 sought to help
make performance information from priority public programs and projects available to
decision-makers and to create capacity for its generation and use in member countries.
However, grant implementation suffered significant staff turnover-related delays,
ultimately resulting in cancelation of almost half the balance. In 2011, the Bank initiated
nonlending technical assistance (NLTA) to the OECS Secretariat with funding from a
Rapid Social Response MDTF grant to support preparation of a growth and
development strategy for the OECS countries (including some of underlying sector

strategies). 22 In an endeavor to help increase the use of M&E in policy-making, it also
supported the design and implementation of building blocks of an M&E system at the
regional level. Despite some implementation delays, most outputs foreseen under the
grant were eventually produced. At the country level, the Bank provided support to
both Grenada and Antigua and Barbuda to strengthen cabinet-level policy-making
capacity. In Grenada, the FY10 IDF grant helped establish an M&E unit at the Cabinet
Office.23 In Antigua and Barbuda, a component of the FY13 PSST project seeks to help
develop cabinet office capacity for strategic planning and coordination as well as policy-
making capacity within line ministries. However, start-up and implementation have
been significantly delayed.24

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS

Continuing its long-standing engagement in disaster risk management (DRM) with the
OECS countries, Bank support during the evaluation period—which led to DRM
accounting for the bulk of the portfolio—was concentrated in three countries. The Bank
has been a leading player in DRM in the OECS, its engagement going back decades.
Historically, the focus has been on reconstruction, but over time the Bank has shifted
increasingly toward policy engagement on DRM: the focus shifted progressively
toward more pre-emptive risk reduction, strengthening institutional capacity, and more
comprehensive risk management strategies. During the evaluation period, the Bank
engaged heavily in DRM in Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but
had little activity in the other countries.25 Using primarily investment lending through
the Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) instrument, ERLs were prepared quickly in the
wake of disasters, in effect using the window of opportunity created by these disasters
as an entry point to help carry out risk reduction activities. Subsequently, the Bank built
on its record of success in emergency response to fund a large-scale multi-country
investment program project focused on vulnerability reduction using a horizontal APL,
the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program (DVRP), which allowed for careful
planning and design of risk reduction under regular (rather than emergency)
circumstances (table C.4). In addition, the Bank provided investment lending and
technical assistance support for the CCRIF, and engaged in substantial policy dialog,

including through a recent DPL in Grenada. The Bank has used its comparative
advantage as a convening party to bring in technical partners, and to aggregate
resources (including from climate finance) to offer larger projects. Successive Bank
DRM projects have repeatedly been the largest donor project ever implemented in those
countries.26 In many of these interventions, the Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery has provided key support for technical assistance and analytic work; the IDA
crisis response window has also been important in crowding in additional IDA
resources beyond the country envelopes.

Bank ERLs delivered support for recovery and reconstruction in the wake of major
hurricanes, but also supported measures to reduce exposure. The ERLs—delivered
notably in response to Hurricane Ivan in 2005 (Grenada) and Hurricane Tomas in 2010
(St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines)—funded a wide range of activities.27
Many projects included retroactive financing of emergency operational costs or critical
purchases, such as fuel. They financed reconstruction of damaged assets, particularly
priority infrastructure such as roads and bridges. They also supported the
reconstruction or retrofitting of public buildings, primarily hospitals/clinics, schools,
and community facilities. They financed construction of physical risk reduction
measures, mostly seawalls and river defenses. These works were designed to be of a
higher structural standard than previous structures, and so more likely to resist future
disasters. In addition, the ERLs sought to support improvements in managing spatial
development and land use planning. They aimed to improve knowledge and
understanding of vulnerability, and financed the production of inventories of public
assets, disaster vulnerability maps, hydraulic and other spatial studies, capacity
building for hydro-meteorological agencies, training in geographic information systems
(GIS) and data management, and other activities. ERLs aside, the Bank also undertook
post-disaster needs assessments (PDNAs) in the wake of disaster events, adding to the
combination of the country’s own simplified rapid assessment plus the more detailed
UN assessment that typically follows.

The Bank also provided financing for DRM investments in the four blend countries
through the DVRP,28 and supported a landslide risk reduction pilot in St. Lucia. The
DVRP aims to extend and expand the previous avenues of engagement, with financing
of works for schools, hospitals, bridges, water supply, emergency shelters, flood
control, slope stabilization, and others. But it also aims at building knowledge to serve a
regional platform for hazard and risk evaluation and improved decision-making by
gathering information on public infrastructure (airports, hospitals, transport and water
grids, government buildings), watershed management, urban flood management,
coastal protection, and landslide risk reduction. The project draws on resources from
regular IDA allocations, the IDA Crisis Response Window (following severe flooding in
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2013), the Strategic Climate Fund, and

the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. The idea of the horizontal APL is to achieve
some benefits from regionalism, such as lower unit cost from economies of scale and
joint processing and information-sharing, while keeping infrastructure investments
within country-level projects. Some experts criticize the program design as being too
focused on infrastructure as compared to institutional capacity-building. In St. Lucia,
the Bank supported a community-based pilot aiming to sensitize communities to
disaster risk and support small scale drainage and other works.

Successive Bank projects provided substantial support for disaster preparedness and
emergency management capacity. Permanent national emergency management offices
were established, whereas previously disasters had mostly been handled by temporary
committees established in the wake of the disaster. The Bank financed construction of
headquarters buildings for the offices, along with provision of training and equipment
purchase. Subsequent projects further expanded capacity, supporting for example
stockpiling of emergency equipment, training programs for staff, establishment of local
community liaison officers, upgrades to telecommunications systems, and simulation
exercises.

The Bank played a central role in the establishment of the CCRIF. The CCRIF is a
facility—the result of a model partnership that the Bank helped convene—offering
several Caribbean countries (beyond just the OECS) insurance against specified,
objectively measurable, disaster events (box 3.1). The Bank’s central role in setting up
the mechanism—realized through a combination of AAA, lending, and convening
work—included financing design work, key technical contributions such as supporting
the analytic work needed to establish country risk profiles, financing initial premium
payments for the four blend OECS countries, and acting as a financial intermediary
between the facility and reinsurance markets through the Bank’s Treasury. By pooling
risks, the facility can offer insurance at a lower rate than would be available if each
country tried to purchase insurance on its own, or if each country had to maintain its
own reserves separately. It also enables insurance coverage to exist for some very small
countries that may have otherwise been uninsurable. Cost savings come from
economies of scope and scale; it was cheaper to undertake risk modeling for Caribbean
countries in a coordinated fashion, it was more efficient to undertake a single client
education program, and the transaction costs of operating the facility are lower than
would exist for a set of separate insurance contracts (due in part to the small size of
member countries). While Bank support for the CCRIF in relation to the OECS countries
is now complete, there is ongoing work to expand CCRIF to Central America and the
Dominican Republic.

 Box C.1. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility: A successful Multi-Country
 Partnership
 The CCRIF is an innovative instrument that solves a long-standing problem: private insurers
 have been unable to provide cost-effective insurance products for small states because the
 transaction costs of developing large-scale insurance products for small states are
 individually high, and developing a sophisticated actuarial risk appraisal requires substantial
 upfront investment. The CCRIF’s risk pooling feature, and the Bank’s upfront work to
 support risk modeling for the various countries as well as design of the financial setup,
 allowed these obstacles to be overcome. The CCRIF now has 16 member countries, and offers
 members—who pay risk-based insurance premiums to purchase desired levels of insurance
 coverage—three distinct insurance products: against a hurricane of specified wind speed,
 against an earthquake of a specified magnitude, and (most recently) against rainfall of
 specified severity. Each product is designed not to insure against losses from a disaster, but to
 provide rapid payouts in the wake of the event to help provide the liquidity needed to
 finance disaster response and early recovery phases—including fuel purchases, equipment
 hire, and overtime wages.
 The CCRIF is the result of a partnership involving a number of donors. The facility was
 capitalized with a grant from Japan along with capital contributions from a multi-donor trust
 fund (which had contributions from Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean Development Bank,
 European Union, France, Ireland, and United Kingdom in addition to the World Bank) as
 well as membership fees from the 16 member countries. Aside from the formation of the joint
 risk pool, development partner funds and expertise supported the necessary data collection
 and technical product development work. Bank contributions included a lending operation
 that was specific to the OECS countries (OECS Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project; P094539;
 $14.2 million) that financed the insurance premiums of the four blend countries for 2.5 years,
 as well as a Caribbean-wide lending operation (Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
 Project; P108058; $45 million) that established the CCRIF and supported its initial operations.
 After the initial donor support, all members except Haiti now fund their own premium
 payments, and the facility is a self-sustaining entity with strong support from member
 countries.

The Bank addressed climate change adaptation through its disaster risk reduction
management portfolio, as well as directly through Caribbean-wide projects. Since the
most significant impacts of climate change for the OECS countries are from more
serious storm events, it is generally not meaningful to distinguish between climate
change adaptation and disaster risk management. The adaptation deficit to current
climate variability is large, and so Bank-supported DRM interventions have effectively
been no-regrets adaptation measures that make sense regardless of future climate
change. Nevertheless, the Bank could do more to consider resilience-building activities
beyond those that focus on the current risk of natural disasters, especially in regard to
land use planning in coastal areas that will be affected by sea level rise. The Bank also

supported a series of explicit climate change adaptation objectives through Global
Environment Facility (GEF) projects in the wider Caribbean.29 These projects included
some activities in OECS countries, though they were not tightly tied to the regional
strategy for the OECS or its specific objectives. The projects were the first series of
projects explicitly focused on climate change adaptation by the Bank. Their design was
experimental, before climate change was typically seen as a significant development
priority, and when there was little prior experience to draw on. Key outputs produced
under the projects included a series of sea level rise monitoring stations, which could
generate useful data to feed into weather forecasting systems. The projects were
assessed in detail in a separate Project Performance Assessment Report (IEG 2012).

Bank support for environmental management and biodiversity protection took the form
entirely of GEF financing, with two principal projects. Despite the prominent
positioning of the environment in country strategies and its links to the critical tourism
sector, the OECS countries have elected not to use scarce IDA resources for
environmental protection. Aside from a few small interventions,30 two GEF projects
accounted for the bulk of Bank support during the evaluation period. The first,
approved in FY04 but implemented largely during the period, sought to strengthen
national and regional management of protected areas.31 The project was implemented
through the OECS Secretariat, but tried to retain some local ownership by establishing
protected area managers at the local level. The results of this project made clear that the
main challenge to implementation of ecosystem protection was the lack of a sustained
funding source. The second, approved in FY12,32 aims to develop a self-sustaining
regional trust fund that could then fund capital investments and projects, in turn
leading to better monitoring and management of marine ecosystems. The GEF and co-
financing contributions would capitalize the regional fund, which would transfer funds
to newly-established national trust funds, which in turn would solicit and approve
funding applications from biodiversity organizations—parks agencies, national trusts,
and others—for activities including new studies, enforcement, equipment, mapping,
invasive species combatting, training, and capital costs for equipment or facilities, but
not staffing or regular operational costs. National trust funds would have their own
board including civil society and private sector representatives, who collectively would
form a majority. Government representation would be in a minority—an inclusive
approach for which they deserve credit—and governments would be required to make
matching contributions from new dedicated funding sources (to avoid depleting
existing government biodiversity funding).

BANK SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS

Bank AAA supported assessments of social protection programs in all the countries,
albeit relatively late in the evaluation period. With Bank support, Dominica had
prepared an assessment in 2003 that identified key issues for reform. The Bank’s 2005
Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Paper drew attention to the need to increase the
efficiency of the OECS countries’ social protection programs and their responsiveness to
shocks. These early foundations notwithstanding, it was not until the second RPS
period that Bank NLTA helped complete social safety net assessments in the remaining
five countries.33 Findings included poor targeting, inefficient administration, and
pronounced fragmentation. Relevant Management Information Systems (MIS) and
formal appeals systems were missing, and programs were not formally audited. These
weaknesses made safety nets ineffective, with high administrative costs and low

                                      WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
coverage of the poor. The assessments recommended consolidating safety net programs
and establishing beneficiary registries, clear targeting, and appeals mechanisms.

In Dominica, St. Lucia, and Grenada, Bank lending helped initiate social protection
reforms. During 2007–10, the GSPTAC supported Dominica in developing a beneficiary
identification system (BIS) and a proxy means test (PMT) for targeting cash transfers to
low-income groups, based on 2007 poverty data. However, absent a socio-political and
fiscal impact analysis of the reforms, use of the BIS and PMT was discontinued beyond
a pilot phase once the project closed when the government realized that elderly people
above the poverty line would be excluded from benefits—an exclusion deemed
politically infeasible. In addition, the PMT criteria would have qualified a greater
number of beneficiaries for cash benefits whereas financing was not assured, given that
government spending on social welfare programs already amounted to about 6 percent
of GDP in 2014.34 In both St. Lucia and Grenada, the Bank-supported assessments laid
the foundations for reform, with initial steps supported by Bank development policy
lending.35 St. Lucia developed a social protection policy and plans to revise the law on
public assistance programs as a next step; in addition, a targeting instrument has been
tested and is now being finalized.36 In Grenada, the Bank’s FY12 Safety Net
Advancement Project (SNAP) is helping to develop and test a beneficiary MIS for the
government’s Support for Education Empowerment and Development (SEED)
program, and a PMT to identify and target beneficiaries—in addition to funding SEED
benefit payouts. Implementation of the SNAP, which is currently undergoing
restructuring, has been slow.

The Bank also provided regional AAA on pensions, and limited labor-market-related
support. FY08 Bank analytic work (World Bank 2010) raised concerns about the
financial sustainability of public pension systems, pointing to the need for: (i)
portability of social insurance to enhance inter-island labor mobility; (ii) adjusting
contributions and benefits to ensure financial sustainability; and (iii) improving
governance. Several OECS country officials indicated that the Bank’s pension report has
been useful in their work. On labor markets, the Bank has provided fairly limited
support, the growing burden of unemployment notwithstanding. During 2009–12,
technical assistance funded under the TFSCB sought to help build statistical and survey
capacity, notably on labor surveys.37 Thus far, only St. Lucia is producing a regular labor
force survey and occupational wage survey. In 2013/4, a first labor force survey was
conducted with ILO support in Dominica, Grenada, and in St. Kitts and Nevis, and will
be implemented in other islands.38 In Antigua and Barbuda, since 2013 the Bank’s PSST
project is helping to set up a temporary employment program.39

Building on regional AAA, Bank project support in St. Lucia and Grenada helped
expand vocational training. A 2007 Caribbean-wide Bank report found that despite

                                                                                         43

having received up to 11 years of formal education, school leavers had no diploma and
lacked the skills needed on the job market (Blom and Hobbs 2008). The Bank
recommended scaling up youth training programs and increasing workforce job
training, relying inter alia on regional training programs, transparent funding
mechanisms, and increased labor union participation in training programs. Bank-
supported projects in St. Lucia (implemented during 2007–13) and Grenada
(implemented during 2009–13) followed, helping to establish vocational training
systems in the two countries.40 The projects helped set up a vocational education unit at
the Ministry of Education in St. Lucia and a National Training Agency (NTA) in
Grenada, both of which are fully functional and have been accredited by CARICOM’s
Caribbean Vocational Qualification.41 In both countries, training agents assist graduates
in job search, mentor them, and monitor performance; social workers and psychologists
assist youth with social and life skills. Contacts with St. Lucia and Grenada
notwithstanding, skills training systems have not yet been replicated in the other OECS
countries for lack of the necessary resources.

Regarding secondary education, beginning in FY02 Bank project financing—structured
as a horizontal APL—helped construct, rehabilitate, and equip secondary schools, as
well as support teacher training, education policy, and curriculum reform. During
2003–11, in Grenada’s low-income areas, the Bank helped rehabilitate the Grenada Boys
and Westerhall secondary schools and funded school materials.42 In line with a
nationwide trend, the transition rate from primary to secondary schools in Grenada
increased in schools in low-income areas from 51 percent in 2002 to 72 percent in 2010.
In St. Kitts and Nevis, the Bank funded the construction and equipment of the 250-place
Saddlers Secondary School in a low-income neighborhood.43 The school enrolled 70
students in 2009. Over 2002–08, the Bank funded the construction and equipment of two
secondary schools in St. Lucia (Gros Islet and Anse La Raye) with 2,345 places for
students.44 In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, over 2004–11, the Bank funded the
construction of West St. George secondary school for 750 students as well as the
rehabilitation of 4 schools (North Union, Adelphi, Petit Bordel, Campden Park).45 The
Bank projects also provided intensified support for teacher training, education policy,
and curriculum reforms. In Grenada, teachers were trained in literacy, numeracy, and
technical education. Teachers were also trained in St. Kitts and Nevis, and other schools
equipped, broadband connections established, and principals trained in data collection.
The Bank funded curriculum development, learning centers, and teacher training in St.
Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines from 2004–08.

Bank AAA and grant funding helped generate knowledge and supported education
policy and strategy development. A 2007 Caribbean-wide report prepared by the Bank
drew attention to the need to improve governance and accountability of secondary
schools, as well as education quality through teacher training.46 Bank policy dialogue

with the OECS countries did not, however, cover changes to education financing in
order to enhance incentives and performance in the education system.47 Through an IDF
grant, the Bank supported the development of the OECS Education Strategy 2012–21,
which was approved by the OECS governments in 2011 and aims to align national
strategies and plans and harmonize the education systems across states.48 In 2011, the
Bank financed reports on curriculum development and on skills strategy options, in
addition to updates of Teacher Training Manuals and costing of sector plans. In 2012,
the Bank also funded capacity-building workshops for teachers on HIV prevention and
health practices under a School Health NLTA program.49 The Bank has also conducted
country Education Management Information System (EMIS) assessments in the OECS
using the SABER methodology and has helped train staff on analysis of education data
for policy development.50

In support of HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment, the Bank implemented projects
in several of the OECS countries under its Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Program (MAP), a horizontal APL first approved in 2001. The Bank worked in
parallel with other development partners (including the US government, GFATM,
PAHO, and UNAIDS), implementing projects approved under the MAP prior to the
start of the evaluation period. A regional project,51 implemented over 2004–10,
supported stakeholder workshops, training for health care professionals, PMTCT
assessments in Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, studies and workshops on
HIV and AIDS, development of strategic documents and regional collaboration,
regional laboratory upgrading and development of national laboratory capacity, and
establishment of a Health Economics Unit (HEU) at UWI.52 While the support was
generally effective and many of its outputs have since been sustained,53 there was
insufficient focus on developing and institutionalizing data collection and M&E.
Beyond the regional dimension, country-specific HIV and AIDS operations were
implemented in Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.54 In St. Lucia, the project helped increase the frequency of condom use and
the number of newly infected HIV patients declined over 2004–10. In St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, the project helped reduce HIV and AIDS incidence and the number of
new AIDS patients during 2004–11. In Grenada, waning government commitment
meant that project implementation met with numerous problems and 57 percent of loan
proceeds were canceled, although the project was able to help improve access to care for
HIV-positive pregnant women as well as access to anti-retroviral therapy. Although
many of the outputs under these projects have been sustained, the partnerships with
civil society organizations initiated under several projects have not generally been
continued. Beyond its project support, the Bank has since provided selective support for
HIV- and AIDS-related initiatives, mainly in the form of regional NLTA tasks.

Subsequently, Bank AAA helped improve knowledge of other health-related issues,
notably NCDs; IFC advisory work on a hospital public-private partnership (PPP) has
not borne fruit. In response to concerns in the region about nurse staffing shortages and
outmigration, FY08 Bank regional analytic work confirmed a nursing shortage (in some
countries, 30 percent of nursing positions were vacant) and outmigration (about three
times more Caribbean nurses working abroad than at home) in as well as low (50
percent) completion rates among nursing students (World Bank 2009). FY11 analytic
work on NCDs in the OECS drew attention to NCDs’ high contribution to life years lost
(70 percent, above the 60 percent reported by MICs in Latin America), with behavioral
risk factors such as high obesity rates contributing to the high NCD rates (World Bank
2012). Caribbean-wide NLTA later supported awareness-raising and prevention
activities, including distribution of toolkits to national health ministries.55 In Grenada, a
PPP for a hospital under an IFC advisory service operation stalled due to government
financial constraints; nevertheless, PPP legislation passed in 2015 has paved the way for
future private-public investment in hospitals.56

 Under the planned three-operation programmatic DPC series, the first $15 million operation of
which was approved in FY14 (June 2014), a trigger for the planned second operation concerns
cabinet approval of the MTDS. More generally, it can be argued that Bank budget support to St.
Lucia (the FY10 Economic and Social DPL) and Grenada (the FY10 Economic and Social DPL
and the FY14 Resilience-Building DPC) have assisted with debt management at the margin—in
the sense that the counterfactual would likely have involved borrowing from higher-interest
and/or lower-maturity sources.

 The focus of the project, which was restructured, was subsequently altered to support the

including Canada (which currently provides the largest share of the funding), U.K. Department
for International Development, Australia, CDB, the EU, Inter‑American Development Bank,
Ireland, United Nations Development Programme, U.S. Agency for International Development,
and the World Bank. Barbados, which hosts the center, and 19 other beneficiary countries have
contributed to the center’s expenses.

  Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR) and delivery of support is
planned in two phases. Phase 1 (2011–14, now extended to 2016) focuses on identifying key
                                                                                                                 47

changes in policy and institutional arrangements that need to take place quickly in tax, customs,
and PFM to ensure effective implementation of ICT systems. Its goal is to bring about increased
ability of institutions and staff in the countries to manage processes and ICT systems in tax,
customs, and public financial management (PFM), with increased access to regional training
and ICT support for the relevant administrations. Phase 2 will focus on deepening the reform
agendas and in-depth upgrading of processes and ICT systems, including an integrated solution
for tax, customs, and PFM and establishing a fully operational ICT support center serving all
beneficiary countries. In terms of the Bank program, SEMCAR takes the form of NLTA
(P123665) funded by a Bank-administered trust fund (with a part administered by the IMF)
benefiting 12 Caribbean countries, including the OECS. A related FY12 IDF grant (P131197; $0.2
million) supported negotiations toward multiple licenses for the SmartStream software for some
of the beneficiary countries.
 OECS Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Project Implementation (P104531; about $0.4

  The new law fills a gap wherein an earlier procurement law, approved in 2007, had proved
infeasible to implement owing to the outlays needed to set up and operate the institutional
framework for which it provided. An indicative trigger for the second operation in the
programmatic series features cabinet approval of regulations and the putting in place of an
institutional setup to implement the new procurement law.
 The credits were provided in part from the envelope for regional projects from the Latin
19

America and the Caribbean Region.

  The project also helped to set up other systems in the countries, such as a human resources
reporting facility for the SmartStream (public financial management) application.

  Start-up delays can be at least partly attributed to the fact that the project was prepared,
negotiated and approved with a predecessor (United Progressive Party) government that was
defeated at the polls in 2014.

  The concentration of Bank support for DRM in these three countries owed in part to their
recent experiences with severe storm events, in particular Grenada from Hurricane Ivan. The
other three OECS countries had had less recent experience of disasters, and so have focused on
other development priorities. Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, classified as high-
income countries with IBRD only access, had been (and largely remain) reluctant to borrow
from IBRD for large-scale infrastructure given their high debt levels and borrowing costs.
Dominica has recently devoted a substantial portion of its IDA envelope to DRM.
26
  As indicated in Appendix B, of active OECS World Bank projects in 2015, the portfolio of
roughly $83 million in lending is nearly two-thirds for DRM. Of course, this increase in support

  The DVRP is a horizontal APL, with a first wave of projects (APL1) for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and Grenada in FY11 (P117871; $20.9 million). In FY14, a second wave was
approved, for St. Lucia (APL2; P127226; $41 million) and Dominica (APL3; P129992; $17 million)
as well as additional financing for St. Vincent and the Grenadines (P146768; $35.6 million).

  A 2010 report on tertiary education touched on financing—notably recommending increasing
private funding, providing student loans, reforming governance, and improving quality
assurance—but did not address financing of the main (primary and secondary) education
system.
48
  The education strategy presents seven imperatives to achieve this goal: (i) improve the quality
and accountability of leadership and management in schools and Ministries of Education; (ii)
improve teacher quality, management, and motivation; (iii) improve the quality of teaching and
learning at all levels, using learner-centered experiences; (iv) improve curriculum and strategies
for assessment to meet the needs of all learners at all levels of education; (v) increase access to
quality early childhood development; (vi) provide opportunities for all learners to progress to
further education and training and to engage in productive employment; and (vii) increase
access to and relevance of tertiary and continuing education and increase research and
innovation.

  The OECS and other Caribbean governments maintained a regional approach, developing the
Caribbean Regional Strategic Framework (CRSF) on HIV/AIDS for 2008–12 to coordinate local
and international support to HIV/AIDS. With the support of several international donors, the
HIV/AIDS epidemic was controlled and by 2009 the focus was expanded to strengthen the
broader public health context. In 2009 public health was restructured in the region into the
Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) managed under CARICOM.
 These were the Grenada HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project (P076715; FY03; $6

  Although it is thought to be challenging to attract private investment in health care in the
OECS owing to the limited scale involved as well as constraints in financial and human
capacity, experience suggests that it is not infeasible to implement hospital PPPs in small
islands. This was done in the Turks and Caicos Islands without World Bank Group support. To
ensure the financial sustainability of the hospital PPPs and provide access for the entire
population, the Turks and Caicos Islands government established a social health insurance
scheme funded by employee salary contributions and subsidized contributions from the
government for the nonemployed population.

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS

Bank AAA, and to some extent financing, helped advance the resolution of the
CLICO/BAICO debacle and safeguard OECS financial sector stability. Given the need
to act regionally in order to mitigate risks of contagion and defend financial sector
stability, the Bank provided technical advice to the ECCU Core Committee on Insurance
regarding various aspects of the work for an orderly resolution of the BAICO/CLICO
crisis.1 It also produced analysis of the systemic risk of BAICO and CLICO in the
Eastern Caribbean region and a special report on ECCU insurance sector
rationalization. Both studies helped frame the new legislative and institutional
arrangements for the insurance sector going forward. In parallel, at the individual
country level, the two FY10 single-tranche Economic and Social DPLs to Grenada and
St. Lucia supported measures aimed at resolving the BAICO/CLICO crisis as well as
the enactment of new insurance legislation. In St. Lucia, for instance, a judicial manager
was appointed to review BAICO within the national territory and recommend an
orderly resolution to the company’s insolvency; a new insurance bill requiring basic
solvency margins was submitted to Parliament. In Grenada, the FY14 programmatic
Resilience-Building DPC series supports further measures to strengthen financial sector
stability.

Bank AAA and financing also addressed financial sector regulation and supervision;
IFC supplemented investments with advisory service operations in an effort to expand
SME financing. Through lending and AAA, as partly outlined in the preceding
paragraph, the Bank sought to help strengthen and harmonize regulation and
supervision of the insurance sector.2 Subsequently, in collaboration with the IMF, CDB,
and the United Kingdom (and with the Task Force on the ECCU Financial System as the
main counterpart), Bank technical support included banking sector diagnostics. It
helped undertake a preliminary assessment of 11 indigenous banks and implement
proposed solutions to weaknesses identified, and most recently initiated a

comprehensive independent diagnostic of banking sector asset quality.3 Regarding
access to finance, following analytic work on private sector financing by the Bank,4
beginning in FY08 IFC engaged with a large commercial bank in St. Lucia in support of
creating an SME lending practice through an investment and two advisory projects.5 It
also supported this bank with its global trade finance program (GTFP).6 Additional IFC
AS operations looked into the feasibility of a microfinance program and setting up a

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
With variable efficacy, Bank Group analytic and advisory work helped identify reform
opportunities and/or track implementation. Regarding sector linkages and value
chains, a Bank report in FY08 examined ways to enhance tourism sector backward
linkages. (World Bank 2008).8 IFC also sought to help improve linkages between
tourism and other sectors in the OECS countries, and later undertook an AS operation
in support of generating tourism investment in St. Lucia.9 In FY13, Bank analytic work
specific to Grenada examined ways of improving logistics for cocoa and nutmeg, two of
the country’s most important exports (Fries, Weiss, and White 2013).10 As discussed
earlier, the Bank also prepared a diagnostic report in FY15 discussing key constraints to
growth under the Caribbean Growth Forum initiative, and proffered the
Comprehensive Debt Framework as an analytic tool tracing the linkages between
growth and public finances in the OECS and other small states.

Concerning business environment reforms, a Bank Group report appeared to lay the
groundwork for subsequent IFC advisory work aimed at improving individual
indicators (World Bank 2007).11 Through its Doing Business Reform advisory services,
IFC pursued a number of advisory projects in the region (with a reach extending
beyond the OECS in some cases), in part with support from Canada.12 Beginning in


                                                                                                       55

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT FOR ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
early 2009, it provided advice on business entry reforms in Dominica, Grenada, St.
Lucia, and St. Kitts and Nevis intended to “simplify, streamline and automate
regulations and procedures” for business start-up. It also supported trade-logistics
streamlining in Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis, assessing aspects
that could be simplified and helping to develop solutions. IFC’s Doing Business Reform
Advisory also submitted reform memos to all of the OECS countries proposing “policy
recommendations aimed at improving the environment for doing business in the short
and medium term.” In all of these efforts, IFC reported trying to encourage public-
private dialogue on reforms (IFC 2010).

Selectively rather than systematically, Bank financing supported steps aimed at
improving the business environment, including certain public services. In Grenada, the
FY06 PSMP TAC’s competiveness component helped refurbish small business training
facilities and strengthen capacity to promote an improved business environment for
micro and small businesses at the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation
(GIDC). Similarly, the FY08 Grenada TAC supported a strengthening of investment
promotion services and associated restructuring of GIDC. Under the FY14 Resilience-
Building DPC, prior actions included the enactment of the Grenada Tourism Authority
(GTA) Act, as well as steps to prepare for the commercialization of public estates in an
effort to stimulate agribusiness sector development. In addition, as recounted in chapter
3 (sub-pillar 1.1), several Bank lending operations (including the 2010 Economic and
Social DPLs in Grenada and St. Lucia) supported the deployment of upgraded
ASYCUDA systems in customs in some of the OECS countries, and the E-GRIP sought
to lay the groundwork for, and to operationalize, e-government services for the
payment of taxes. Bank lending also supported other initiatives (e.g., to facilitate
business registration). In St. Lucia, for instance, the FY10 Economic and Social DPL
featured the launch of an online company registration portal among its prior actions.

IFC advisory services sought to help realize PPPs in specific areas, including water and
sanitation (St. Lucia) and hospital management (Grenada). IFC carried out several AS
projects aimed at bringing specific PPP projects to fruition during the latter part of the
evaluation period. In St. Lucia, IFC—working in tandem with Bank lending support—
conducted a transaction advisory for a PPP project in the water sector, seeking to help
put in place a management contract with a private operator for WASCO, the public
water and sanitation utility.13 In fact, IFC’s advice to put in place a management
contract represented a scale-back compared with Bank advice in the early 2000s that St.
Lucia should aim for a concession contract. The tendering process was carried out, and
two bids were received from prospective operators. In FY14, IFC engaged in a second
transaction advisory in St. Lucia for private sector participation in managing the
country’s Hewanorra International Airport, which handles long-haul flights (and thus
most of its tourist traffic).14 In Grenada, IFC advised on a PPP for health infrastructure

involving the design, financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of a
replacement facility for St. George’s General Hospital, with the goal of improving local
health care as well as of fulfilling medical training and regional tertiary care needs and
attracting medical tourism.15 In Antigua and Barbuda, IFC served as transaction adviser
for a planned partial privatization of the state-owned Antigua State Insurance
Corporation (SIC).16 The Bank has also provided support on PPPs, including developing
a regional infrastructure roadmap and assisting with PPP frameworks in both Grenada
and St. Lucia.

WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS

In telecommunications/ICT, project financing sustained long-standing Bank support for
regulatory framework development and sought to increase utilization of services. Prior
to the evaluation period, Bank project engagement beginning in 1998 had supported the
design of a new telecommunications regulatory system, which led to the creation of the
Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and of National
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) in five countries.17 The positive
impact of these reforms on access to, as well as quality and affordability of,
telecommunications services in the region was enormous. Follow-up support through
the FY05 OECS Telecommunications and ICT Development (TICT) Project—
implemented largely during the evaluation period—sought to consolidate the reforms
and expand access and use of telecommunications and ICT services, notably through
the creation of Universal Service Funds (USFs) to promote private ICT investment in
under-served communities and public institutions.18 TICT project efforts to expand the
use of ICT services by government and the private sector19 were pursued subsequently
under the Caribbean Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP), which was
structured as horizontal adaptable program lending.20 The project, which remains under
implementation, aims to fill broadband infrastructure gaps as well as to help develop
the IT and IT-enabled service industries in three countries.21 Significantly, CARCIP is
piloting a new regional procurement model—for the connectivity infrastructure

investment, which accounts for over half the project budget—pooled across the three
countries, managed by St. Lucia’s PCU. With support from the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID), the Bank has begun working on an open data
initiative with St. Lucia. IFC involvement in telecommunications during the evaluation
period was limited to advisory services for a submarine cable project,22 although an
investment predated the period.23

In water and sanitation, Bank project financing supported water supply investments in
St. Lucia and sought—together with IFC advisory work—to help improve WASCO’s
performance. During the evaluation period, the Bank implemented two projects, both
approved prior to the start of the period.24 The first, a technical assistance operation,
followed years of fruitless efforts by the Government of St. Lucia and several
development partners to improve WASCO’s performance, and was designed to
transform the water sector by focusing on strengthening the regulatory framework and,
in parallel, introducing private sector management to improve WASCO’s
performance.25 As indicated in the discussion of sub-pillar 2.2, IFC served as transaction
adviser in the initiative to place WASCO under a management contract with a private
operator in 2008. Implementation of the Bank’s technical assistance project saw repeated
delays, and its closing date was extended by three years; despite this, the Bank
consistently elected to portray the project as making good progress.26 Responding to an
urgent need to help alleviate water shortages in the north of the island (the general area
of Castries, the capital, and several tourist resorts) ahead of the Cricket World Cup in
March 2007, the Bank approved a second project in FY05 to finance targeted water
supply infrastructure. This second project purposely excluded any institutional
objectives.

Regarding energy, a Bank project supported electricity regulation in Dominica, but the
bulk of its project financing sought to help establish a regional (OECS-wide) energy
regulator. In Dominica, continuing earlier Bank support for the electricity sector,27 the
FY07 GSPTAC supported the establishment of a national electricity regulator, the
Independent Regulatory Commission (IRC), also providing initial support for the IRC’s
operation. In parallel, the Bank pursued a regional energy regulation model, which
culminated in the FY11 approval of the First Phase (encompassing Grenada and St.
Lucia) of the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) Program.28 Since
its approval, however, the ECERA project has encountered many problems. By the start
of implementation, which was delayed for more than two years,29 the two participating
countries and other stakeholders had begun raising concerns on the pace of progress—
notably in mobilizing commitments by the other OECS countries to ECERA—and the
viability of a regional energy regulator serving only two countries. Impatient with the
delays in creating ECERA, both countries took steps to create national authorities to
regulate their energy sectors,30 raising the additional complication of how these bodies’

roles are defined in relation to ECERA’s. In response to the countries’ concerns, the
project gave top priority to the preparation of new Electricity Supply Acts for Grenada
and St. Lucia and intensified efforts to encourage other countries to join ECERA.31
Meanwhile, as planned, several studies went ahead under the project.32 Nevertheless,
scarcely a year after the project’s formal launch, a decision was taken to restructure the
project, with Grenada and St. Lucia favoring an “ECERA light” model of a virtual
service agency with minimal staff to support the national regulators—a significant step
back from the original model that would leave the regional body with no regulatory
power and limited technical capacity.

and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST). It helped lay additional groundwork for reforming the
insurance regulatory framework in the OECS, notably by funding a stakeholder workshop as
well as the preparation of a White Paper setting out key elements of a new regulatory
framework, including a regional authority and a uniform law.
3
 Tasks involved include the Restoring Financial Stability in the OECS NLTA (P126179),
approved in FY13 and completed in FY14, the Continued Resilience of the ECCU Financial
System NLTA (P145745), approved in FY13 and still ongoing, and the Strengthening the
Financial Sector in the Eastern Caribbean NLTA (P150897), approval of which is beyond the
evaluation period).

 The IFC AS operations were the FY08 Republic Bank Microfinance Feasibility Study (541603)
and the Caribbean Regional Credit Bureau (568827; $ 2million).

 Interviews with public officials and private sector actors in Grenada and St. Lucia in the
tourism sector showed little familiarity with the report.
9
 The AS operations in question were the FY08 Improving tourism linkages in the OECS
Countries operation (545644), and the FY12 Tourism Investment Generation St. Lucia (581548)
operation.
 The study complemented a JSDF-funded FY13 Grenada Small Farmer Vulnerability Reduction
10

project.
11
  Among other findings, the report indicated that while the OECS countries had harmonized
several areas of business regulations—such as business start-up, legal rights of borrowers and
lenders, bankruptcy procedures and contract enforcement—differences arose in how
harmonized legislation was implemented in each jurisdiction. For example, despite the similar
companies act, starting a business in St. Vincent and the Grenadines took 12 days, compared to
57 days in Grenada.
12
  The IFC AS operations included Elimination of Administrative Barriers in the OECS (543384;
FY08), Investment Climate in the Caribbean (567627; FY11), Trade Logistics in the Caribbean
(591347; FY13), and OECS Business Taxation Reform Project (600212; FY14).
13
     The FY08 task was the St. Lucia Water PPP Transaction Advisory (23377; $0.7 million).

18
  The FY05 OECS Telecommunications and ICT Development (TICT) Technical Assistance
Project (P088448; $2.7 million) financed a review of the Telecommunications Act as well as the
drafting of a new Electronic Communications Bill with expanded mandate for ECTEL and the
NTRCs. With much of the fixed line communications network dominated by the incumbent
Cables and Wireless, the project supported the development of a model for determining
interconnection tariffs (leading to lower rates), the promulgation of revised Interconnection
Regulations, and the application of alternative technologies for spectrum monitoring. The
biggest component of the project, however, was to promote private ICT investment in under-
served communities and public institutions through the creation of Universal Service Funds
(USFs) to support Universal Service projects through a one-time subsidy.
19
  TICT project outputs in this regard included two digital classroom live portals, two
community technology centers, and a robotics invention system as a tool for ICT education in
five schools.

  In 2003, IFC had made an investment ($4.8 million in equity and a $6.7 million loan) toward a
€90.8 million project by Digicel for the roll out and expansion of its operation in the Eastern
Caribbean. IFC’s equity position was bought out when Digicel refinanced its project in 2005–06.
24
  The Water Sector Reform TA Project (P070244; $2.6 million) was approved in FY01 and the
Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project (P094416; $7.7 million) in FY05; the latter
received additional financing (P105027; $1.8 million) in FY07. Both projects closed in FY09.
25
  The CDB—which, unlike the Bank, continues to be involved in St. Lucia’s water sector—
provided parallel financing ($5.27 million) to strengthen WASCO’s internal systems (e.g., staff
skills) and fund urgently needed water and sanitation investments.
26
  Although the Bank fielded regular, well-staffed supervision missions and contributed strong
technical support, despite the continuing lack of progress under the project, all but one
Implementation Status Report during the original implementation period rated the achievement
of both Project Development Outcome and Implementation Progress as satisfactory, and
continued to rate both as such during half of the extension (MS for the other half), until the final
unsatisfactory rating in the ICR.
27
  The FY04 Dominica Economic Recovery Support Operation supported a review and
amendment of the legal and regulatory framework for electricity supply. In parallel, in 2003–04,
the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) provided two grants of $75,000 each
to Dominica for technical assistance in designing and implementing a new regulatory
framework for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution and in amending the
Electricity Act to enable private licensees to generate and distribute electricity.
28
  The FY06–09 RPS had proposed an OECS Infrastructure and Utilities Reform Investment/TA
program to provide regional benchmarking and regulatory assistance for the countries’
electricity (and water) sectors. However, this operation never materialized; instead, the Bank
began preparing a regional energy regulation project in FY07, targeting Board approval by
FY09. The OECS ECERA project (P101414; $5.6 million) was eventually presented to the Board
and approved in FY11. In parallel to the IDA funding, a grant of $1.5 million from the SIDS
Dock facility, a sustainable energy initiative for Small Island Developing States, was mobilized
to support the effective implementation of the project.
29
  In particular, the IDA credits had to be terminated and then reinstated for noncompliance of
effectiveness conditions.
 Grenada passed the Public Utility Commission Bill in February 2015; St. Lucia passed the
30

National Utilities Regulatory Commission Bill in November 2015.
 The Programmatic Resilience Building Development Policy Credit series for Grenada, of
31

which the first loan was approved at end-FY14, specifies “cabinet approval of the policy for the
amendment to the Electricity Supply Act” as a trigger for the second operation in the series.
32
  These studies address various issues, including the self-financing mechanism and power
pricing strategy for ECERA, strategy and business models for energy efficiency investments in
the OECS countries, grid-codes and policies to promote renewable energy, and model Power
Purchasing Agreement and renewable energy experience stock-taking.

Appendix F. Guide to Country Program
Evaluation Methodology
This methodological note describes the key elements of country program evaluation
(CPE) methodology of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG).

CPEs rate the outcomes of World Bank Group assistance programs, not the country’s
overall development progress.

A World Bank Group assistance program needs to be assessed on how well it met its
particular objectives, which are typically a subset of the country’s development
objectives. If a Bank Group assistance program is large in relation to the country’s total
development effort, the program outcome should be similar to the country’s overall
development progress. However, most Bank Group assistance programs provide only a
fraction of the total resources devoted to a country’s development by development
partners, stakeholders, and the government itself. In CPEs, the IEG rates only the
outcome of the Bank Group’s program, not the country’s overall development outcome,
although the latter is clearly relevant for judging the program’s outcome.

The experience gained in CPEs confirms that Bank Group program outcomes
sometimes diverge significantly from the country’s overall development progress. CPEs
have identified Bank Group assistance programs which had:

      Satisfactory outcomes matched by good country development;
      Unsatisfactory outcomes in countries which achieved good overall development
       results, notwithstanding the weak Bank Group program; and
      Satisfactory outcomes in countries which did not achieve satisfactory overall
       results during the period of program implementation.

Assessments of assistance program outcome and Bank Group performance are not the
same.

By the same token, an unsatisfactory Bank Group assistance program outcome does not
always mean that Bank Group performance was also unsatisfactory, and vice versa.
This becomes clearer in considering that the Bank Group’s contribution to the outcome
of its assistance program is only part of the story. The assistance program’s outcome is
determined by the joint impact of four agents: (i) the country; (ii) the Bank Group; (iii)
partners and other stakeholders; and (iv) exogenous forces (e.g., events of nature,
international economic shocks). Under the right circumstances, a negative contribution



                                                                                        77

GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM METHODOLOGY
from any one agent might overwhelm the positive contributions from the other three
and lead to an unsatisfactory outcome.

IEG measures Bank Group performance primarily on the basis of contributory actions
the Bank Group directly controlled. Judgments regarding Bank Group performance
typically consider the relevance and implementation of the strategy, the design and
supervision of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support interventions, the scope,
quality and follow-up of diagnostic work and other analytic and advisory activities
(AAA), the consistency of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support with its
nonlending work and with its safeguard policies, and the Bank Group’s partnership
activities.

Rating Assistance Program Outcome
In rating the outcome (expected development impact) of an assistance program, IEG
gauges the extent to which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved,
without any shortcomings. In other words, did the Bank Group do the right thing, and
did it do it right. Programs typically express their goals in terms of higher-order
objectives, such as poverty reduction. The country assistance strategy (CAS) may also
establish intermediate goals, such as improved targeting of social services or promotion
of integrated rural development, and specify how they are expected to contribute
toward achieving the higher-order objective. IEG’s task is then to validate whether the
intermediate objectives were the right ones and whether they produced satisfactory net
benefits, as well as whether the results chain specified in the CAS was valid. Where
causal linkages were not fully specified in the CAS, it is the evaluator’s task to
reconstruct this causal chain from the available evidence and assess relevance, efficacy,
and outcome with reference to the intermediate and higher-order objectives.

For each of the main objectives, the CPE evaluates the relevance of the objective; the
relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the objective, including the
balance between lending and nonlending instruments; the efficacy with which the
strategy was implemented; and the results achieved. This is done in two steps. The first
is a top-down review of whether the Bank Group’s program achieved a particular Bank
Group objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact on the country’s
development. The second step is a bottom-up review of the Bank Group’s products and
services (lending, AAA, and aid coordination) used to achieve the objective. Together
these two steps test the consistency of findings from the products and services and the
development impact dimensions. Subsequently, an assessment is made of the relative
contribution to the results achieved by the Bank Group, other development partners,
the government and exogenous factors.

                                                     GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM METHODOLOGY
Evaluators also assess the degree of country ownership of international development
priorities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, and Bank Group corporate
advocacy priorities, such as safeguards. Ideally, any differences on dealing with these
issues would be identified and resolved by the CAS, enabling the evaluator to focus on
whether the trade-offs adopted were appropriate. However, in other instances, the
strategy may be found to have glossed over certain conflicts, or avoided addressing key
country development constraints. In either case, the consequences could include a
diminution of program relevance, a loss of country ownership, or unwelcome side-
effects, such as safeguard violations, all of which must be taken into account in judging
program outcome.

Ratings Scale
IEG utilizes six rating categories for outcome, ranging from highly satisfactory to highly
unsatisfactory:

Highly satisfactory:                 The assistance program achieved at least

                                     objectives, and had best practice
                                     development impact on one or more of them.
                                     No major shortcomings were identified.
Satisfactory:                        The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward all major relevant objectives.
                                     No best practice achievements or major
                                     shortcomings were identified.
Moderately satisfactory:             The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward most of its major relevant
                                     objectives. No major shortcomings were
                                     identified.
Moderately unsatisfactory:           The assistance program did not make
                                     acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                     relevant objectives, or made acceptable
                                     progress on all of them, but either (i) did not
                                     take into adequate account a key
                                     development constraint or (ii) produced a
                                     major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                     violation.
Unsatisfactory:                      The assistance program did not make
                                     acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                     relevant objectives, and either (i) did not take

                                        constraint or (ii) produced a major
                                        shortcoming, such as a safeguard violation.
Highly unsatisfactory:                  The assistance program did not make
                                        acceptable progress toward any of its major
                                        relevant objectives and did not take into
                                        adequate account a key development
                                        constraint, while also producing at least one
                                        major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                        violation.
The institutional development impact can be rated at the project level as high,
substantial, modest, or negligible. This measures the extent to which the program
bolstered the country’s ability to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of
its human, financial, and natural resources. Examples of areas included in judging the
institutional development impact of the program are:

        The soundness of economic management;
        The structure of the public sector, and in particular, the civil service;
        The institutional soundness of the financial sector;
        The soundness of legal, regulatory, and judicial systems;
        The extent of monitoring and evaluation systems
        The effectiveness of aid coordination;
        The degree of financial accountability;
        The extent of building capacity in nongovernmental organizations;
        The level of social and environmental capital.

IEG is, however, increasingly factoring institutional development impact ratings into
program outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Sustainability can be rated at the project level as highly likely, likely, unlikely, highly
unlikely, or, if available information is insufficient, nonevaluable. Sustainability
measures the resilience to risk of the development benefits of the country program over
time, taking into account eight factors:

        Technical resilience;
        Financial resilience (including policies on cost recovery);
        Economic resilience;
        Social support (including conditions subject to safeguard policies);
        Environmental resilience;
        Ownership by governments and other key stakeholders;
        Institutional support (including a supportive legal/regulatory framework, and
         organizational and management effectiveness);

      Resilience to exogenous effects, such as international economic shocks or changes
       in the political and security environments.

At the program level, IEG is increasingly factoring sustainability into program outcome
ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Risk to development outcome. According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines,
sustainability has been replaced with a “risk to development outcome,” defined as the
risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) of a
project or program will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to development
outcome can be rated at the project level as high, significant, moderate, negligible to
low, and nonevaluable.
