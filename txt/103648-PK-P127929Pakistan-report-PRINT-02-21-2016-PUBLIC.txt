Executive Summary

T
       he objective of the report is to raise awareness of the financial impacts that disasters have on
       the budget of the Government of Pakistan (GoP) and to form the basis for a continued dialogue
       between the GoP and the World Bank on the potential development of a strategy for financing
disaster losses. The study presents a series of complementary options for development of a national
disaster-risk financing strategy, based on a preliminary fiscal risk analysis and a preliminary review
of the current budget management related to disasters in Pakistan. The recommendations provided
in this document are therefore a starting point for a collaborative discussion with the GoP on the
potential development of a broad Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) program that would
equip the Ministry of Finance with additional instruments to manage the contingent liability posed
by disasters. This report follows a request from the government for advisory services from the World
Bank in the areas of disaster risk identification and the resulting fiscal impacts on the state.

This study benefits from the international experience of the World Bank, which has assisted several
countries in the design and implementation of sovereign disaster risk financing strategies (for
example, in the Caribbean island states, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and
Vietnam) and property catastrophe risk insurance programs (such as in Eastern Europe, Romania,
and Turkey). This experience is necessarily tailored to the institutional, social, and economic
characteristics of Pakistan as well as the availability of relevant data.

On average, approximately 3 million people are affected by natural catastrophes each year in
Pakistan, which equates to approximately 1.6 percent of the total population. According to an
analysis of historical disaster data since 1973, collected for this report from UNdata,1 approximately
77 percent of the population affected by disaster has been impacted by floods.

Pakistan faces a major financing challenge from natural catastrophes, with flooding causing an
estimated annual economic impact of 3–4 percent of the federal budget.2 Preliminary analysis
in this report estimates the annual economic impact of flooding in Pakistan at US$1.2 billion to
US$1.8 billion, equivalent to 0.5–0.8 percent of national gross domestic product (GDP).3 However,
the simulations we present in chapter 3 show that a major flood event (occurring, on average,
once every 100 years) could cause losses in excess of US$15.5 billion,4 which equates to around 7
percent of national GDP5 or almost 40 percent of the federal budget. In terms of annual probability,
there is a 1 percent chance in any year that a major event of this size will occur. Although the
government tries to meet the recovery and reconstruction needs to rebuild damaged infrastructure

       in the aftermath of disasters, insufficient financing to rebuild has led to the deterioration of the
       infrastructure’s protective capacity against future adverse natural events, resulting in additional
       losses in succeeding disaster events.

       Progress has been made on the establishment of financing mechanisms for dealing with disaster
       losses, but significant work still remains to operationalize structures and to ensure that financing
       mechanisms are appropriately provisioned. A structure for dedicated federal and provincial funds for
       disaster risk management has been established under the National Disaster Management Act 2010.
       However, challenges still remain with respect to operationalization of the funds and standardization
       of procedures across provinces. It remains difficult for the GoP to analyze the financing needs and
       gaps for meeting relief, recovery, and rehabilitation support to the affected portion of the population.
       The heavily decentralized approach to disaster risk financing in the provinces is a key contributor
       to these challenges. The mechanisms through which disasters are financed vary from province to
       province, depending on the administrative systems in place and the ready availability of funds.
       There is a need for a sustainable plan to ensure that the National Disaster Management Fund (NDMF)
       and provincial funds are adequately provisioned in the context of likely needs.

       Although the federal and provincial governments recognize the need to allocate resources in their
       budgets for disaster response prior to a disaster, they lack the technical basis to determine such
       allocations. At present, post-disaster expenditures are financed from contingent and supplementary
       budgets during the relief and recovery phases and from the annual Public Sector Development
       Program during the reconstruction phase. The inaccessibility of data on the underlying hazards
       and their past and possible future financial implications is one barrier to the informed ex ante
       provisioning of funds. A development of technical capacity and necessary tools to quantify likely
       needs for disaster-related expenditure would help the government to both (a) determine appropriate
       allocations through the budget, and (b) explore and make informed proposals for possible sources of
       financing outside of the budget.

       This study presents the GoP with a series of options for consideration that could help the government
       increase its immediate financial response capacity against disasters and better protect its fiscal
       balance. Specifically, there are seven options for consideration spread across the short, medium
       and long term (table ES.1). These options follow the operational framework of (a) assessing risk, (b)
       arranging financial solutions, and (c) delivering funds to beneficiaries.

       The implementation of a national disaster risk financing strategy would require significant institutional
       capacity building and further work to quantify likely needs for disaster-related expenditure. Disaster
       risk financing is just one component of a comprehensive fiscal risk management strategy, which
       requires specific financial and actuarial expertise. Major capacity building related to disaster risk
       assessment and incorporating international best practice in financial management of disasters
       would be required for the development and use of financial tools to guide the GoP in its national
       disaster risk financing strategy.

wide range of disasters over the past 40 years, including floods, earthquakes, droughts,
cyclones, and tsunamis. These hazards are further exacerbated by growing urbanization,
increased vulnerability, and shifting climatic patterns, which have led to increasingly
severe disasters. Over the past decade, the damages and losses from disasters in Pakistan
have exceeded US$18 billion. As Pakistan’s population and asset base increase, so does its
economic exposure to disasters.

                    T
                         he World Bank is supporting the Government of Pakistan (GoP) in building capacity regarding
                         disaster risk management (DRM) to build resilience to both humanitarian and fiscal shocks
                         associated with disasters. The financial losses alone since 2005 have totaled more than
                    US$18 billion (table 1.1). The recurring floods of 2010 and 2011 highlighted the need and importance
                    of developing financial mechanisms to help the government mobilize resources in the immediate
                    aftermath of a disaster while buffering the long-term fiscal impact of such events. There is a need to
                    develop an overarching policy document in the form of a national disaster risk financing strategy,
                    which could enable the government to make an informed choice on accessing various sources of
                    funding to respond to disasters, including ex ante and ex post financing instruments.

                    Historically, a reactive emergency-response approach has been the predominant way of dealing
                    with disasters in Pakistan. To that end, the West Pakistan National Calamities (Prevention and
                    Relief) Act of 1958,6 which governed disaster risk management activities, was mainly concerned
                    with organizing the emergency response. Following the 2005 earthquake that affected Azad Jammu
                    and Kashmir (AJK) and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (then called the North-West Frontier
                    Province), it became clear that appropriate policy and institutional arrangements needed to be
                    put in place to mitigate potential losses of life and property from future disasters while protecting
                    federal and provincial budgets.
                    The National Disaster Management Ordinance of 2006 established the National Disaster Management
                    Authority (NDMA) as an executive arm of the National Disaster Management Commission. The NDMA
                    has been made operational to coordinate and monitor implementation of national DRM policies and
                    strategies. Among other things, this new system is designed to devolve and decentralize the DRM
                    mechanisms: Provincial Disaster Management Commissions (PDMCs) and Authorities (PDMAs) have
                    been established while similar arrangements have been made in AJK and the Federally Administered
                    Tribal Areas (FATA)—eventually establishing the Sindh Disaster Management Authority, the Gilgit-
                    Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, and the FATA Disaster Management Authority. In addition,
                    District Disaster Management Authorities have been set up across the country and are viewed as the
                    linchpins of the whole system, serving as the first line of defense in the event of a disaster.
                    A National Disaster Risk Management Framework has been formulated to guide the work of the
                    entire DRM system. It identifies national DRM strategies and policies, highlighting nine priority
                    areas to establish and strengthen policies, institutions, and capacities:7

Although the GoP has taken the necessary legal, institutional, and policy measures for DRM, several
entities in addition to NDMA are working on DRM with overlapping mandates at the federal level.
These include the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, the Emergency Relief
Cell, and the Federal Flood Commission, among others. This multiplicity of institutions at the
provincial level includes the PDMAs, the Provincial Irrigation Departments, and the Civil Defence
and Rescue Services. Similarly, in addition to the National Disaster Management Ordinance of

The World Bank is providing technical assistance to the GoP for the development of a national
disaster risk financing strategy. This nonlending technical assistance aims to (a) assess the GoP’s
fiscal exposure to disasters; (b) propose options for the development of a national strategy to
improve financial response capacity for disasters; and (c) promote property catastrophe risk
insurance for both public and private dwellings. The World Bank has been promoting a proactive,
strategic DRM framework based on five pillars: risk identification, risk reduction, preparedness,
financial protection, and resilient recovery.
Despite prevention and mitigation efforts, no country can fully protect itself from the impacts of
major natural catastrophes. Disaster risk financing and insurance allows governments to increase
their financial response capacity in the aftermath of a disaster and to improve access for affected
populations to financial tools to aid recovery. These financial mechanisms can also reduce the
impact of disasters on social and economic development by smoothing financial shocks and
preventing governments and populations from resorting to adverse coping mechanisms that disrupt
development initiatives and productivity. Table 1.2 describes the types of mechanisms that this
practice area encompasses, along with mechanism beneficiaries.

This report contains the main findings and recommendations of this initial technical assistance.
There are five chapters including this introduction. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the budget
processes for the financing of disaster losses during each of the three post-disaster phases: immediate
emergency response, recovery, and reconstruction. Chapter 3 provides a preliminary financial
disaster risk assessment for Pakistan, focusing particularly on the fiscal impact of disasters. Chapter
4 presents an overview of the private catastrophe insurance market. Chapter 5 reviews the options
for future financing of disaster recovery and reconstruction expenditures; this final chapter includes
options for sovereign risk financing and for the promotion of commercial catastrophe insurance for
the private property sector. Complementing the report are seven technical appendixes that provide
information on further analyses and results.
This report also includes input from major donors that assist Pakistan in disaster risk management.
From the inception of the report, the authors have engaged in proactive consultation with donors
who have shown interest in the report’s findings and recommendations. Initial findings of the report
have also been shared with the donors bilaterally as well as through the Partnership for Disaster
Resilience in Pakistan, which serves as the DRM donor coordination platform.

A structure for dedicated federal and provincial funding of disaster risk management (DRM)
has been established under the National Disaster Management (NDM) Act, 2010. However,
challenges still remain regarding operationalization of the funds and standardization of
procedures across provinces. It remains difficult for the Government of Pakistan (GoP)
to analyze the financing needs and gaps for meeting relief, recovery, and rehabilitation
support to the affected portion of the population. The heavily decentralized approach to
disaster risk financing in the provinces is a key contributor to these challenges.

                          he GoP established the current regulatory framework for post-disaster management under the
                          NDM Act, 2010. The Parliament of Pakistan approved “An Act to provide for (the) establishment
                          of a National Disaster Management System for Pakistan” on December 8, 2010, which came
                    into force retroactively on August, 17, 2007.8 It defines a disaster as “a catastrophe or a calamity
                    in an affected area arising from natural or a man-made cause or by accident, which results in a
                    substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to and destruction of property.”9
                    Before the implementation of the NDM Act of 2010, the GoP dealt with disasters guided by the
                    National Calamities Act of 1958, which focused mainly on emergency response. Following the 2005
                    earthquake, the GoP recognized the importance of disaster risk reduction for sustaining long-term
                    social, economic, and environment development. As such, it embarked on a program to establish
                    appropriate policy, legal, and institutional arrangements and implemented strategies and programs
                    to minimize national risks and vulnerabilities. Most notably, the National Disaster Management
                    Authority (NDMA) Ordinance of 2006 was passed, specifically to be implemented by the National
                    Disaster Management Commission. The ordinance was later superseded by the NDM Act of 2010.
                    The Act (2010) established a National Disaster Management Fund (NDMF) administered by the
                    federal government and separate provincial DRM funds administered by each of the provincial
                    governments.10 Specifically, the Act (2010) stipulates that the NDMA shall administer the NDMF
                    toward meeting emergency, preparedness, response, mitigation, relief, and reconstruction expenses.
                    The Act (2010) also specifies rules on emergency procurement and accounting to facilitate the post-
                    disaster use of the funds—for example, empowering district authorities to authorize respective
                    departments to undertake procurements for rescue and relief as deemed necessary.11 The NDMF
                    shall be kept in one or more accounts maintained by the NDMA in either local or foreign currency in
                    any scheduled bank in Pakistan and shall be operated in accordance with NDMA directions.12
                    The NDM Act of 2010 also provides guidance on the types of expenditures incurred by the federal
                    government following disasters.13 These expenditures include shelter, food, drinking water, medical
                    cover and sanitation, special provisions for vulnerable groups, discretionary assistance on account
                    of loss of life, and assistance for damage to housing and restoration of livelihoods. In addition, other
                    relief activities and expenditures may be incurred as deemed necessary.
                    The NDM Act of 2010 explicitly references various sources of NDMF financing, but there is a need
                    for a sustainable plan to ensure that the NDMF and provincial funds are adequately provisioned in
                    the context of likely needs. The Act (2010) describes the following source of NDMF financing: (a)
                    grants made by the federal government; (b) loans, aid, and donations from national or international
                    agencies; (c) donations received from any other source; (d) the Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief
                    Fund; and (e) any other fund related to natural calamities established at the federal level as the
                    federal government may determine appropriate.14 The Act (2010) also describes the following
                    sources of financing for the Provincial Disaster Management Funds (PDMFs): (a) grants made by the
                    federal government or provincial governments; and (b) loans, aid, and donations from national or
                    international agencies provided in the prescribed procedures.15

                         of Pakistan as a law in 2010. It came into force from the date of the promulgation of the ordinance.

At the time of writing, the federal government has made grants to the NDMF, but the limited
allocations as well as legacy issues regarding the preexisting system have prevented the NDMF from
being fully operationalized. The NDMF is not currently being used for disaster response. Instead, the
Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund remains the main vehicle to channel government funds to those
affected by disasters. A sustainable plan is required to ensure that sufficient funds are available in
the NDMF and PDMFs to address disaster losses, examining financing possibilities across a range
of sources. Currently, if allocations to the NDMF were to become exhausted, the Ministry of Finance
would likely be approached for extra funds. This demand would likely be met from reallocation of
the existing allocations, such as slow-moving development projects or unused or surplus funds.
However, in other cases, supplementary grants could be required to meet exceptional additional
demand.
The NDM Act of 2010 outlines the NDMA’s authorities and functions.16 In turn, the NDMA defines
three levels of emergencies (table 2.1).

Small (level 1) events are limited to a single district, and thus the district administration, headed by
the deputy commissioner (DC) or district coordination officer (DCO), is responsible for relief efforts
and leads coordination of all departments. The DC’s or DCO’s staff undertakes the initial situation
and needs assessment, which is conveyed to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
In parallel, the provincial finance department is also informed of the financial requirements that
could arise from the disaster.
For medium-size (level 2) events that are limited to an individual province, upon receiving information
of a disaster covering more than one district, the PDMA coordinates with the DCs or DCOs of the
affected districts. In addition, the PDMA coordinates with the relevant line departments of the
province to assess the situation and to oversee the provision of relief to the affected population.
The PDMA also notifies the chief executive of the province to allocate the resources required. The
NDMA is also alerted on the nature of the disaster, and regular situation reports are shared.
For large (level 3) events that extend across provincial boundaries, the NDMA coordinates the efforts
of the various PDMAs and provincial ministries and departments. Although the respective PDMAs
lead relief assistance, the NDMA stands by to meet any gaps or raise resources through the office

                    of the prime minister and the federal Ministry of Finance. The NDMA also coordinates the donor
                    community by sharing situation reports and needs assessments while supporting preparation of
                    relief and response plans to raise donor resources.
                    DRM procedures lack standardization across provinces despite specifications in the NDM Act of
                    2010. In general, the DRM system defined in the NDM Act of 2010 and national disaster response
                    plans are not fully followed at the provincial level, and DRM approaches vary across the provinces. In
                    Punjab, for example, disasters are typically managed following instructions given in war books such
                    as the financial war book, and other provinces still follow instructions in the Natural Calamities Act
                    of 1958. No institutional mechanisms currently exist to calculate the financial impacts of disasters
                    within the federal or provincial treasuries. After a disaster, with the support of the World Bank and
                    Asian Development Bank, the GoP undertakes a damage and needs assessment, which estimates the
                    direct losses as well as the reconstruction costs by sector and province across both the public and
                    private sectors.17
                    The post-disaster financial responsibilities of provincial governments are not well defined, but they
                    generally include the types of expenditures listed in table 2.2. In addition to these expenditures,
                    other relief mechanisms may be provided. In Punjab, for instance, short-term waivers on water and
                    land taxes are common following a disaster. In certain cases, waivers of interest on agriculture loans
                    are allowed as well as delays in the repayment of these loans.

                    Since 2005, estimates of the total costs through the three post-disaster phases have twice
                    exceeded US$5 billion. Post-disaster cost estimates related to the 2005 earthquake and the 2010
                    floods totaled approximately $US5.2 billion and US$8.7 billion, respectively. Estimates made
                    during the respective preliminary damage and needs assessments for four selected events since

Donor assistance can represent a significant, although uncertain, part of financing disasters. Indeed,
since 2005, donor assistance has accounted for approximately 60–80 percent of total post-disaster
expenditures during the relief and recovery phases (figure 2.2). After the 2005 earthquake, for
example, international donors contributed approximately US$520 million (62 percent) of a total
estimated expenditure of US$845 million for relief and recovery. In response to Cyclone Yemyin
in 2007, international donor assistance accounted for approximately US$21 million (59 percent)
of the total $US36.2 million expenditure for relief and recovery. In 2010 and 2011, following the
devastating flood events, donors contributed 81 percent (US$1.37 billion) and 65 percent (US$157
million), respectively, of the relief and recovery spending. However, it should be noted that the total
costs of the events summarized in figure 2.1 are four to seven times greater than the expenditures
contributed to relief, recovery, and reconstruction. Thus, while donor financing plays an important
role in financing the relief and recovery phases, it accounts for only 5–16 percent of all financing
needs.

Emergency Response and Relief Phase
Funds for emergency response activities are immediately available from a variety of sources,
depending on the size of the disaster. For small (level 1) events, district governments use their
own financial resources for emergency response through their contingency budget lines. If these
funds are not sufficient (for example, in the case of a medium-size [level 2] event), the provincial
governments may provide funds from their contingency budget lines (where available). This process
continues for level 3 events crossing provincial boundaries, where, should the respective district and
provincial budgets be exhausted, additional funding come from the federal budget. Any additional
expenditures are adjusted in the following year’s budget through the demand for supplementary
grant.18
Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Sindh have allocated provincial contingency budget
lines to meet disaster relief and response requirements as they occur to ensure prompt availability
of funds. However in the case of the federal government and Punjab province, supplementary grants
are typically used to provision post-disaster funds, and the required contingent funds are initially
met by reappropriation from the surplus heads such as unused salary budgets. Once these funds are
exhausted and additional grants are required, they are approved by the respective assembly within
the following fiscal year’s budget. This procedure is also followed in Baluchistan, KPK, and Sindh if
the existing funds are not enough to cover post-disaster expenditures.




 	 “Supplementary” demands for grants and appropriations represent expenditures that could not be met from within the budget
18

   allocations under various normal annual demands and appropriation.
14 / CHAPTER 2: Fiscal Management of Disasters




                    Recovery Phase
                    The recovery phase (also called the rehabilitation phase) starts after the emergency response
                    phase and typically lasts three to six months. During this specific post-disaster phase, lifeline
                    infrastructure (water, electricity, sanitation, and so on) and key public buildings and infrastructure
                    (such as hospitals and bridges) are repaired. Housing rehabilitation assistance is also provided to
                    the affected households.
                    The NDM Act of 2010 provides some insights into the types of expenditures incurred by the federal
                    and provincial governments, which include compensation for loss of life and also assistance on
                    account of damage to houses and to restore means of livelihood.19 The Act (2010) gives the NDMA
                    the national authority to direct that, for severe disasters, relief may be granted in the repayment of
                    loans or that fresh loans may be granted to the affected population with appropriate concessions.20
                    The Act (2010) does not stipulate the method of making post-disaster payments to the affected
                    population. However, in practice, the affected region is first identified as a “calamity-hit area,” and
                    then the data of expected beneficiaries is sent to the National Database and Registration Authority
                    (NADRA) for verification. Once the beneficiary details are verified, the affected people are issued
                    ATM cards through which they may obtain the cash compensation in one or more tranches.21
                    The funding mechanisms during the recovery phase are currently exactly the same as during
                    the emergency response phase. Funds for financing the post-disaster recovery phase come from
                    contingency budgets and supplementary budgets at the district, provincial, and federal levels.
                    Initially funds come from the district budgets, and as these become exhausted, additional funding
                    from provincial budgets becomes available. In the case of significant (level 3) natural catastrophes,
                    district and provincial budgets are supplemented by funding from the federal budget.

Reconstruction Phase
The reconstruction of public assets (at the federal and provincial levels) is mainly financed through
the annual Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). The PSDP of the federal and provincial
governments consists of a series of projects and programs that are developed according to Pakistan’s
long-term development needs. The PSDP expenditures are funded from revenue and capital accounts
of the federal and provincial governments.
Line ministries are responsible for the reconstruction of their assets. Each affected ministry at either
the federal or provincial level obtains estimates of the extent of disaster damages and prepares
an appropriate program for the reconstruction of the affected public assets and infrastructure.
Typically the relevant line ministries prepare these programs in consultation with the finance
ministries of either the federal or provincial governments. The proposed programs are put before
the national or provincial assemblies, as part of the PSDP of the federal or provincial government,
for their approval. As soon as the programs are approved, they are implemented by the respective
line ministries, as described in the GoP’s Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual for federal and
provincial governments.22
No central mechanism currently tracks the expenditures on relief, recovery, and reconstruction.
Instead, funds are disbursed across different tiers of governance as well as across the various
federal and provincial ministries and departments. The difficulty in tracking expenditures on relief,
recovery, and reconstruction following disasters makes it challenging for the GoP to assess the
needs and shortfalls for funds for disaster-related expenditure. A system to better track disaster-
related expenditures across all the various implementing agencies would improve future needs
assessments as well as the transparency and accountability of funds spent postdisaster.

     The assessment of the economic and fiscal risk related to disasters, including contingent
     liabilities, is the first stage in developing disaster risk financing strategies. Such an




                                                                                                                                      CHAPTER 3
     assessment typically requires historical damage, loss, and expenditure data along with
     loss estimates calculated from natural catastrophe risk models. The World Bank and the
     Asian Development Bank (ADB) have supported the Government of Pakistan (GoP) in
     assessing the impacts of natural hazards through detailed post-disaster damage and needs
     Assessments. These assessments were prepared following the 2005 earthquake, Cyclone
     Yemyin in 2008, and the 2010 and 2011 floods.23 Although data are limited, this chapter
     presents preliminary fiscal risk profiles developed for the GoP.

                     Contingent Liability and Post-disaster Spending Needs


                    O
                           ur preliminary assessment of the government’s contingent liability from disasters indicates
                           that the government faces a major financing challenge arising from natural catastrophes.
                           Flooding is a major driver of risk, causing an estimated annual economic impact of 3–4
                     percent of the federal budget (between US$1.2 billion and US$1.8 billion).24 This range is equivalent
                     to 0.5–0.8 percent of national gross domestic product (GDP).25 However, our simulations show that
                     a major flood event (occurring, on average, once every 100 years) could cause losses in excess of
                     US$15.5 billion,26 which equates to around 7 percent of national GDP27 or almost 40 percent of the
                     federal budget.
                     The GoP’s contingent liability due to disasters can create significant fiscal risk, but that liability
                     is not clearly defined in law, making a fiscal risk assessment difficult to perform. Beyond its
                     explicit contingent liability and associated spending needs (such as the reconstruction of public
                     assets and infrastructure), the government may have a moral and social responsibility (implicit
                     contingent liability) to assist the population in the aftermath of an extreme disaster. For example,
                     the government not only provides not only emergency assistance (for example, food, shelters, and
                     medical supplies) but also can finance recovery and reconstruction activities such as assistance to
                     rebuild low-income housing. Contingent liabilities arising through the establishment of disaster-
                     linked social protection schemes also need to be considered in such an analysis.
                     The GoP’s post-disaster contingent liability can be categorized into short-term, medium-term, and
                     long-term spending needs. All financial resources do not need to be mobilized immediately after
                     a disaster, but adequate resources must be mobilized quickly to fund post-disaster emergency
                     and recovery activities. Once the recovery phase is complete, the GoP must mobilize longer-term
                     resources to meet its reconstruction needs. In general, governments assume contingent liabilities
                     for three broad categories of post-disaster spending needs:
                     n	   Repair of nationally owned public assets such as national roads, major water infrastructure, and
                          national government buildings (typically in the medium-term)

                     n	   Repair of subnationally owned public assets such as provincial and district roads, health facilities,
                          schools, or local markets (typically in the short- to medium term)

                     n	   Compensation for deaths and injuries, increased safety net payments, and stimulus grants for
                          livelihood recovery and housing reconstruction (typically in the short term)

                     A major challenge for the government in the aftermath of a disaster is to access immediate liquidity
                     to finance its short-term spending needs. Although various financial instruments can be mobilized
                     for the post-disaster reconstruction phase (including additional credit and tax increases), financial
                     instruments that provide immediate liquidity after a disaster are more challenging to access. See
                     appendix F, which describes the potential financial instruments available.
                     Assessing the short-term post-disaster spending needs is essential. To devise a cost-effective disaster
                     risk financing strategy, especially for the funding of short-term post-disaster public spending needs,
                     it is critical to assess those possible public spending needs that create additional fiscal risk for the
                     government.

Analysis of Historical Disasters in Pakistan
This report has estimated the number of people affected by historical disaster events across Pakistan
between 1973 and 2012, which can serve as a proxy for the severity of each event.28 During this 40-
year period, 102 individual disaster events have been catalogued and analyzed for their impacts on
the affected populations (as listed in appendix A).
On average, approximately 3 million people are affected by natural catastrophes in Pakistan each
year, which equates to about 1.6 percent of the total population. Figure 3.1 shows the number of
people estimated to have been affected by disasters since 1973, by peril type.

From 1973 through 2012, floods affected approximately 77 percent of the all the people affected by
disasters in Pakistan (figure 3.2). Drought was the next most damaging peril, followed by earthquake,
windstorms, and others (such as avalanches and landslides).

                     Of all the people affected by natural catastrophes in Pakistan from 1973 through 2012, 87 percent were
                     residents of either Punjab or Sindh provinces, which included 66.6 percent and 20.1 percent of people
                     affected, respectively. The high number of affected people in these areas is due to a number of factors
                     including high population density, poor infrastructure, the geomorphology of the regions, and the
                     location of high numbers of residential properties on floodplains. A further 12 percent were residents
                     of Baluchistan or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, with the remaining (less than 2 percent) living
                     in Azad Jammu and Kashmir State, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and the Gilgit-Balistan
                     administrative territory. Figure 3.3 summarizes the geographical distribution of affected people.

Since 1973, 11 natural catastrophes have hit Pakistan that, were they to occur in the present day,
could affect over 4 million people. Of the 11 disasters estimated to have impacted over 4 million
people, eight have been floods. Furthermore, the top three most impactful events (the floods of
2010, 1976, and 1973) affected well over 10 million people each (figure 3.4).

Statistical Fiscal Disaster Risk Analysis

disasters is built on actuarial analyses of historical disaster impact data collected for this report.
Because of data availability, preliminary fiscal disaster risk profiles are developed for the whole
country and one province (Punjab) regarding the peril of flood only.29 In particular, risk metrics such
as the annual expected loss (AEL) and probable maximum losses (PMLs) have been estimated. The
AEL is an estimate of the long-term annual average loss, while the PMLs estimate possible large
losses. The PML is defined as an estimate of the aggregate annual maximum loss that is likely to
arise on the occurrence of an event or series of events with a certain probability. For example, a PML
with a 100-year return period is the estimated loss caused by an event occurring once every 100
years on average (that is, with a 1 percent probability of occurrence per year on average).

Preliminary fiscal flood risk profiles of Pakistan and Punjab
The fiscal disaster risk profiles of Pakistan and Punjab are related to the public spending needs for
post-disaster operations. Post-disaster expenditures financed by the government in the first few
months after a catastrophe are estimated using an indirect approach based upon the number of
people identified as being affected by an event (appendix A).
After the analysis of the historical impact data, it was concluded that a meaningful, robust disaster
risk profile could be generated only for flood risk—the most significant peril in Pakistan’s recent


 	 The data lacked sufficient historical records for drought and earthquake events to perform actuarial analyses of those perils in a

   suitably robust manner.

                     history. As such, 40 years of flood events (from 1973 through 2012) have been examined to generate
                     risk profiles for both the entire country and the province of Punjab. From an analysis of statistically
                     significant distributions through the actual impact data from 40 years of flood events, we can
                     extrapolate calculations of the possible severity of events with a low probability of occurrence (for
                     example, with a 1-in-100-year or 1-in-250-year probability).
                     The government post-disaster budget expenditure per person affected by a flood disaster is
                     estimated at between US$400 and US$600, on average. A portion of this cost is the direct financial
                     compensation to the affected households for reconstruction of damaged housing and livelihoods
                     support, and the remainder is for the reconstruction of critical public assets. Combining these
                     estimates of fiscal cost per affected person, preliminary fiscal flood risk profiles have been calculated
                     for the country of Pakistan (figure 3.5) and the province of Punjab (figure 3.6). In the figures, two
                     options represent the lower and upper ends of the average estimated fiscal cost per person affected
                     by a flooding event. These figures are based on different analytical techniques to arrive at the results.
                     This preliminary analysis indicates that the annual national fiscal disaster losses from flood are
                     in the range of US$1.2 billion to US$1.8 billion, equivalent to 3–4 percent of the federal budget or
                     0.5–0.8 percent of GDP.30 Once every 100 years these losses are expected to exceed either US$10.3
                     billion or US$15.5 billion (depending on the option assumed), which amounts to 25–37 percent of
                     the federal budget or around 4–7 percent of GDP. In terms of annual probability, there is a 1 percent
                     probability in any year that an event exceeding either US$10.3 billion or US$15.5 billion will occur.
                     Figure 3.5 shows the indicative fiscal loss exceedance curve, and table 3.1 shows the indicative AEL
                     and selected PML values. In an average year, the fiscal losses are estimated in the range of US$1.2
                     billion to US$1.8 billion. Every 10 years, they could exceed US$3.4 billion to US$5.2 billion, and
                     every 100 years they could exceed, depending on the fiscal cost option, US$10.3 billion or US$15.5
                     billion.

                     Preliminary Earthquake Risk Profile of Pakistan
                     The historical disaster impact data set collated for this study did not contain enough drought, tropical
                     cyclone, or earthquake events to support a reliable actuarial analysis of the possible fiscal impacts
                     of these types of natural catastrophes. However, a prototype probabilistic earthquake model was
                     used to demonstrate the value of such a modeling approach if appropriate input data sets were to
                     become available. The results from this model are presented to illustrate the approach, but further
                     development and refinement are necessary.
                     Probabilistic catastrophe risk models offer the government innovative tools to assess the country’s
                     financial exposure to disasters. Governments in both developed and developing countries are
                     increasingly using such modeling techniques to guide their disaster risk management and financing
                     decisions. Such tools allow for the probabilistic assessment of low-frequency, high-severity disasters
                     (such as major earthquakes) and their potential losses, as further discussed in box 3.1.
                     This preliminary probabilistic earthquake risk modeling approach complements the actuarial
                     historical impact analysis. It presents a preliminary analysis of the damages caused by earthquake
                     (shake only) to residential properties only. This earthquake risk assessment produced a seismic
                     probabilistic loss exceedance profile for housing damage at the national level.
                     A significant amount of research and expertise went into the earthquake loss estimation. The
                     probabilistic earthquake risk modeling was conducted using key input data sets from local experts
                     in Pakistan that detail the most up-to-date seismic hazard analysis and housing inventory analyses
                     (at a spatial resolution of 1 square kilometer) for the whole country. The modeling also evaluated
                     the impact as if the 2005 earthquake were to occur at the present time.
                     The probabilistic seismic hazard analysis was derived from results of over 30,000 simulated
                     earthquakes affecting Pakistan. Information about the number of dwellings, construction type
                     (katcha, brick, concrete, and the like) and height were obtained from detailed studies and census
                     information.31 The damage and loss functions were based on nine vulnerability functions developed

                      	 Katcha refers to cheap, natural construction materials such as mud, grass, bamboo, thatch, or sticks.

                     for Pakistan using a mix of building heights and construction types. The replacement values (or
                     monetary value of the properties, updated to current values) were obtained after consultations with
                     local engineers and collection of Pakistan-specific information on unit costs of construction from
                     the World Housing Encyclopedia.32 The total modeled replacement value of Pakistan’s building stock
                     was estimated at US$561 billion in current prices.
                     This preliminary analysis indicates that the annual expected earthquake loss to residential properties,
                     or the housing sector, is approximately US$1 billion and that these losses are expected to exceed
                     US$18.7 billion once every 100 years. The loss exceedance curve shows the potential earthquake
                     losses for key return periods (figure 3.7). The results show that earthquake risk in Pakistan is very
                     significant and should be considered to have a significant fiscal impact. It also shows that, over the
                     long term, an annual average of 0.2 percent of the total value of the building stock in Pakistan is
                     affected by earthquake loss (table 3.3).
                     One output of the probabilistic earthquake approach is a deterministic (“as-if” scenario) analysis
                     of the 2005 earthquake. If this event were to occur in the present day, the total economic loss to
                     residential properties is estimated at approximately US$2.8 billion (about twice the 2005 losses),
                     which corresponds to a return period of around 26 years. Given the increase in number of buildings
                     in Pakistan since 2005, this analysis indicates that the number of properties damaged would be
                     greater, but the actual number of properties destroyed would be lower (having been built better
                     after the 2005 earthquake).

the GoP an order-of-magnitude estimate of its possible public spending needs for post-disaster
operations. Because of the lack of historical earthquake and tropical cyclone event data, it was
not possible to perform an actuarial analysis of the possible fiscal costs of these types of natural
catastrophes. This actuarial analysis should be complemented by more-rigorous catastrophe
modeling techniques, particularly for the assessment of possible losses from future major disasters.
To illustrate the value of probabilistic and deterministic catastrophe models, a prototype earthquake
model has been developed that estimates the possible losses to private residential properties from
this peril, although this model would require additional developments and refinements before the
outputs could be used in developing a disaster financing strategy. In lieu of more-robust modeling
estimates, the results of the flood risk profiles for Pakistan and Punjab are used as an input to




                                                                                                                                              CHAPTER 3
a series of options that the GoP may wish to consider toward the development of a preliminary
national disaster risk financing strategy (as chapter 5 discusses in detail).
This report also highlights two different approaches to disaster risk analysis to estimate fiscal
impacts: (a) the actuarial approach, and (b) the scientific and engineering-based approach.
However, it also important to recognize that the financial impacts estimated are for direct losses
from independent hazard events. For example, the losses do not consider the impact of landslides
after an earthquake in northern Pakistan. This impact could be further exacerbated if an earthquake
occurred during the rainy season, further increasing the likelihood of landslides. Therefore, the
preliminary loss estimates generated using these methods may not necessarily represent the
maximum losses possible.

            The Private Catastrophe
             Risk Insurance Market
Global experience has demonstrated that risk transfer chains, such as insurance and
reinsurance, can be key instruments in absorbing a significant portion of the economic
impacts associated with disasters. This chapter outlines the current insurance market




                                                                                                                   CHAPTER 4
operating in Pakistan, focusing particularly on Pakistan’s non-life insurance market and
products, followed by implications for natural catastrophe insurance.

The insurance market in Pakistan remains underdeveloped because of a lack of awareness
and understanding of the different products and a lack of new products within the insurance
market. From a geographical perspective, too, the provinces of Baluchistan, the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been adversely affected by civil
unrest and associated political security issues. In these provinces, the outreach of insurers
is limited to the larger cities such as Peshawar and Quetta, leaving the rural areas unserved.
30 / CHAPTER 4: The Private Catastrophe Risk Insurance Market




                    Overview of the Market



                   F
                           orty-nine insurers, one national reinsurer, and some international reinsurers currently
                           operate in Pakistan. All of these participants are regulated by the Securities and Exchange
                           Commission of Pakistan (SECP), which also licenses and regulates insurance brokers, loss
                           surveyors, and adjusters. However, under the current regulatory framework, insurance
                    agents are not required to be licensed by the regulator, though all their activities are monitored
                    and controlled through the insurance companies, which are required to maintain a register of their
                    agents and are held responsible for all acts and omissions of the agents. The government-owned
                    non-life insurer, the National Insurance Company Limited (NICL), though fully regulated by SECP, is
                    under the administrative control of the Ministry of Commerce.
                    The insurance industry in Pakistan is small compared with its geographic peers. The country’s
                    overall insurance penetration (life and non-life premiums as percentage of gross domestic product
                    [GDP]) has remained less than 1 percent over the past few years, one of the lowest in the SAARC
                    region.33 In 2011 the total insurance penetration (life and non-life) was approximately 0.7 percent in
                    Pakistan, lower than in Bangladesh (0.9 percent), India (4.1 percent), and Sri Lanka (1.2 percent), as
                    shown in figure 4.1. Traditionally, the agent selling network is the dominant channel for the delivery
                    of insurance products in Pakistan. A small number of insurance brokers also operate in the market.

Total annual gross premium revenue of Pakistan’s non-life insurance sector was approximately
US$0.57 billion at the end of 2013, up from approximately US$0.33 billion in 2006. Over the same
time period, gross premium revenue in Pakistan’s life insurance sector grew from approximately
US$0.23 billion to approximately US$0.88 billion.34
In terms of annual growth rates, non-life insurance sector contracted by 11 percent from 2007 to
2009.35 Since 2009, however, the sector’s annual growth rates have increased by 6 percent. In
contrast, the life insurance sector sustained an average annual growth rate of approximately 25
percent from 2007 to 2012. Fluctuating growth rates in the non-life sector are primarily due to the
economic downturn that commenced in 2007, coupled with a decline in consumer and industrial
financing by banks. (Such financing is the main driving force for non-life insurance growth, as
non-life insurance is mostly centered on commercial lines.) However, the insurers have made no
visible efforts to expand the outreach to personal lines of business; therefore growth has remained
relatively stagnant.
In addition, the number of non-life insurers in Pakistan is not increasing; in fact, nearly 24 non-life
insurers have exited the market since 2009. Typically those companies that have left the market have
done so either voluntarily or in reaction to regulatory actions owing to compliance irregularities.36
According to the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, given the small size of the market, the existence of
40 non-life insurers as of 2012 indicates increased competition and decreased market power.37 This
could have an impact on technically sound catastrophe insurance premium rates. Based on gross
written premiums, four insurance companies—EFU General Insurance, Adamjee Insurance, Jubilee
Insurance, and NICL—enjoyed approximately 63 percent of the total non-life market in 2012. Of the




                                                                                                                                             CHAPTER 4
remaining 37 percent of the non-life market, 22 percent was shared by 10 mid-size insurers, with the
final 15 percent being split across 25 small insurance companies. As a consequence, the lower end
of the non-life insurance sector is considered to be overcompetitive, characterized by aggressive
pricing techniques and pressures on profitability due to the intense commercial competition.

Insurance of public assets
The state-owned NICL has a 12 percent non-life market share, with the remaining 88 percent being
covered by private insurers. The NICL non-life market share has been relatively stable over the past
five years, because its core business is to insure public assets of government and semigovernmental
organizations.38 Among the private companies covering the 88 percent of public assets, three large
insurers had a combined market share of 50 percent in 2012 (that is, 44 percent of the total market
share).

  	 The Herfindahl index (also known as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, or HHI) is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the
     industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert
     O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust law, and also technology management.
     It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares of the 50 largest firms (or if fewer than 50, summed over all the
     firms) within the industry, where the market shares are expressed as fractions. The result is proportional to the average market
     share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single
     monopolistic producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market
     power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite.

32 / CHAPTER 4: The Private Catastrophe Risk Insurance Market




                     Regulation
                     The Insurance Ordinance of 2000 entrusted the supervision of insurance businesses to the SECP.
                     In addition, the SECP’s mandate has grown to include supervision and regulation of the insurance
                     sector, nonbanking finance companies, and private pensions. The SECP also provides oversight
                     of various external service providers to the corporate and financial sectors, including chartered
                     accountants, credit rating agencies, corporate secretaries, brokers, and insurance surveyors.

                     Reinsurance
                     The majority (51 percent) state-owned Pakistan Reinsurance Company Limited (PRCL) accounts
                     for approximately 20 percent of all non-life reinsurance premiums written in 2012.39 The only
                     reinsurer in Pakistan, PRCL is listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange. However, the domestic insurers
                     also reinsure with international reinsurers directly or through reinsurance brokers. During 2012,
                     premiums of more than US$0.28 billion, both in treaty and facultative contracts, were remitted
                     abroad to foreign reinsurers, constituting approximately 49.5 percent of the total gross written
                     premiums of non-life insurers, up from 37 percent in 2008.40 For example, from 2008 to 2012,
                     Swiss Re alone retained approximately 20 percent of the overall non-life business, and no risk was
                     retroceded. The reinsurance treaties of Swiss Re in Pakistan normally cover business interruption
                     from fire and allied perils as well as from natural catastrophe perils. To address undercapitalization
                     of the market, the SECP and its stakeholders are currently deliberating a risk-based capital (RBC)
                     model whereby the minimum capital requirement would need to be increased. By 2017, such
                     requirements for non-life insurers would likely increase from the current PRe 300 million to PRe 500
                     million. The solvency ratio of an insurer is the size of its written premiums relative to the capital.

In Pakistan, the solvency regime for the insurance industry prescribed under the SEC (Insurance
Rules), 2002, was revised in 2012. It is a dynamic solvency regime whereby the assets admissible
for calculating the solvency of an insurance company and the assets’ respective percentages have
also been prescribed. The SECP also licenses and regulates the loss adjustors.
Large international reinsurance brokers encourage clients operating in Pakistan to have appropriate
catastrophe insurance covers. This is based on actuarial catastrophe models, especially for small
clients; the large and medium-size clients usually buy extended earthquake and flood coverage
along with their fire policies. A small number of direct insurance brokers exist in the market, but few
have expanded from the commercial and corporate market to serve the retail consumers.

Alternative insurance distribution channels
Pakistan’s microfinance industry has matured and diversified over the past 10 years. Although, there
has been virtually no development of specific stand-alone microinsurance products in the past few
years in Pakistan, major financing banks (MFBs), microfinance institutions (MFIs), multidimensional
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and more recently, the commercial banks and telecom
companies through the branchless banking platform have matured. The MFI product range has also
broadened to include products beyond the typical enterprise loan such as insurance and alternative
credit products (emergency loans, housing microfinance, and remittance services). Bancassurance
and mobile banking, too, are rapidly becoming the modes of choice to deliver financial products.
Although bancassurance is a growing and significant distribution channel, some constraint on its
use exists because of high commission costs charged by the banks to provide this service.41




                                                                                                                                       CHAPTER 4
Pakistan’s microfinance sector is vulnerable to fiscal shocks due to disasters. Discussions with the
MFBs, MFIs, and Pakistan Microfinance Network revealed that the microfinance sector suffered
heavily from the floods of 2010 and the catastrophic rains of 2011. Consequently, many of the
MFIs become reluctant to lend or work in disaster-prone areas despite the need to create access to
finance in these regions.


Private Property Catastrophe Insurance
An analysis of insured losses from natural catastrophes indicates severe underinsurance in Pakistan.
According to a survey of participants in the Pakistan insurance market conducted as part of this
report, the largest insured loss events were the 2010 floods, followed by the 2011 floods (table 4.1).
Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that private property owners were significantly underinsured
for losses from many of the recent natural catastrophes. Most properties and assets damaged by
recent disasters were either uninsured or not covered for these particular perils.




 	 Bancassurance, also known as the bank insurance model, refers to an arrangement in which a bank and an insurance company
41

   form a partnership so that the insurance company can sell its products to the bank’s client base.

                    is the total value of claims before insurance limitations such as deductibles and limits were applied; and “net claims” is the net
                    value of claims after insurance limitations such as deductibles and limits were applied. The “retention ratio” is the net premium as
                    a percentage of the gross premium. The “loss ratio” represents net claims as a percentage of net premiums.




                    In Pakistan, catastrophe insurance coverage is, by default, not included in a fire policy but available
                    as an extension to a fire policy. However, it is subject to additional premium rates that cover the risks
                    of earthquake (fire and shock) and atmospheric disturbances including floods and other extraneous
                    or additional perils. Catastrophe insurance coverage usually includes buildings, machinery, business
                    interruption, household contents, stocks, stock-in-process, and other contents covered under the
                    fire insurance policy.
                    The earthquake and atmospheric disturbance are the most prominent catastrophic products
                    available in the market, as a bundled product, and the annual premium rates range from between
                    0.60 per mille to 1.20 per mille for both perils with various terms, conditions, and deductibles
                    being applied. These rates are usually applied on the sum insured of the risk; however, in some
                    cases, it is written on the first-loss basis as well. Because commercially available catastrophe risk
                    models for Pakistan are limited,42 the pricing of leading domestic insurance companies tends to
                    be conservative. Moreover, because the premium for natural perils is charged as part of the total
                    premium for fire and allied peril policies, it is not possible to assess the premium for the catastrophe
                    cover itself.
                    NICL, the government-owned insurer, has the exclusive mandate under law to provide insurance
                    for public assets. Hence, all insurance business relating to any public property, or to any risk or
                    liability pertaining to any public property, shall be placed with NICL only and not with any other
                    insurer.43 The classes being underwritten by NICL include fire, marine, engineering, aviation, motor,
                    travel, and crop. Despite being given this mandate, NICL has not initiated any specific catastrophe
                    insurance program for public assets (buildings, their contents, and national infrastructure). Because
                    NICL has been entrusted with this specific mandate to insure the public sector property and risks,
                    it is imperative to review its retention capacity versus reinsurance figures. NICL’s average retention
                    during past three years has remained around 50 percent, which shows a reasonable risk appetite
                    coupled with strong backing by reinsurers.
                    Discussions with the leading insurers as well as the SECP revealed limited understanding of
                    the catastrophe exposure in the domestic insurance market, mainly owing to the inadequate
                    availability of risk mapping data, and therefore the rates charged might be below the level required

considering the earthquake, flood, and tsunami exposures. The lack of discipline and competition
in the market further restricts the required increases in premium rates. Further, in Pakistan, no
specific or standardized underwriting guidelines are available to the industry for the underwriting
of catastrophe risks.
Because of the non-availability of precise data, local insurers have shown strong reservations about
the implications of the Insurance Ordinance’s 72 hours’ disaster definition clause, which, as a
practical matter, is difficult to enforce.44 Applications of event limits also remain a major concern for
the insurers. Some insurers report that they conduct portfolio analyses to determine the expected
distribution of losses from possible events such as atmospheric disturbances or earthquakes
based on “Catastrophe Risk Evaluation and Standardizing Target Accumulations” (CRESTA) zone
statistics.45 However, CRESTA doesn’t have a consistent risk zoning approach to classify risks.
Moreover, the development of catastrophe insurance and reinsurance in Pakistan is currently limited.
There is no technical awareness and visible appetite for new products because inadequate data and
conservative thinking regarding catastrophe insurance products is limiting the development of this
important line of business.
With the exception of a few larger insurers, insurance companies in Pakistan generally do not
fully understand natural catastrophe insurance products, which in turn translates into lower
awareness among the consumers or potential policyholders. One consequence of this situation
is underinsurance, which is often unintentional because the policyholders are not aware of the
possible coverage (or lack thereof) and need for catastrophe insurance. One of the most critical, but
prevalent, issues is the lower insurance density (premium per capita) and penetration (premium

   	 In the insurance and reinsurance industry, an “hours clause” refers to a time period (usually measured in consecutive hours)
     during which claims resulting from a given occurrence (such as a natural catastrophe) may be included in the loss under cover.
     It aggregates all losses occurred in the specified time frame (usually 72 hours) as a single event. This has implications for
     deductibles, limits, and per occurrence liability of policies.

     of natural hazard coverage (CRESTA Secretariat website, Munich, https://www.cresta.org). CRESTA risk zone information—
     widely used by insurers internationally for assessing the insurance rates they will charge—is based on observed and expected
     seismic activity as well as on other natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and storms.

A comprehensive national disaster risk financing strategy should be designed to improve
the capacity of the Government of Pakistan (GoP) to access immediate financial resources
in the event of a national disaster and to ensure that required funds are efficiently delivered
to beneficiaries while also maintaining fiscal balance. This chapter presents seven options
for a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy.
38 / CHAPTER 5: Options for a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy




                     Seven Strategic Options Following the Operational Framework


                     O
                            ptions for a national disaster risk financing strategy in Pakistan follow the operational
                            framework of (a) assessing risk, (b) arranging financial solutions, and (c) delivering funds
                            to beneficiaries.

                     Option 1:	 Develop a Central Database of Disaster Losses and Expenditures
                     A centralized database of historical budget expenditures and losses relating to disasters would
                     support a better understanding of the country’s fiscal exposure to disasters. Pakistan’s decentralized,
                     reactive approach to financing disasters—which differs province to province—makes it extremely
                     difficult to perform a national analysis of the fiscal impact of natural catastrophes.
                     This report has compiled a database of disasters in Pakistan since 1973, including a measure of
                     their impacts in terms of the number of people affected (see appendix A). However, scant data
                     are available on (a) the actual economic costs of these events; (b) the public expenditures spent
                     financing these losses; and (c) the mechanisms through which these funds were allocated and
                     directed toward post-disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction activities.
                     A central database that compiles historical disaster budget expenditures and losses would allow
                     the GoP to analyze its past fiscal exposure to natural catastrophes, and this information would be
                     invaluable in helping to understand and predict the future financial costs of disasters to the state. A
                     development of technical capacity and necessary tools to quantify likely needs for disaster-related
                     expenditure would help the government not only to determine appropriate allocations through the
                     budget but also to explore and make informed proposals for possible sources of financing outside of
                     the budget. This information can also help the government identify areas where policy clarification
                     is needed on the types and extent of post-disaster spending.
                     The key agencies for the establishment and maintenance of such a database would be the National
                     Disaster Management Authority, the Provincial Disaster Management Agencies, and the Ministry of
                     Finance. The development of any such database would look to draw from existing budgetary and
                     disaster risk management structures and systems rather than to create a new isolated structure.

                                             1. Develop a central database of disaster losses and expenditures to better predict
                      Short term
                                             future financial costs of disasters

                                             3. Clarify contingent liability associated with post-disaster cash transfer programs and
                      Short term             enhance the programs’ financing sources to ensure efficient access to funds after a

                                             4. Develop financial disaster risk assessment tools, including financial catastrophe risk
                      Short to medium term
                                             models for the Ministry of Finance

                      Medium to long term    7. Promote property catastrophe risk insurance for private dwellings

Option 2:	 Operationalize the National and Provincial Disaster Management Funds
The National Disaster Management (NDM) Act of 2010 established a National Disaster Management
Fund (NDMF) at the federal level and Provincial Disaster Management Funds (PDMFs) in each
province, but none of these funds is yet officially operationalized. Currently the main sources of
post-disaster funding are contingency and supplementary budget lines (for relief and recovery) and
the annual public sector development program (for reconstruction).
The NDMF and PDMFs could be used to consolidate some of the currently disparate sources of
financing for disaster-related expenditures. Using dedicated funding structures could assist with
tracking and reporting of post-disaster spending and could also help clarify the division of post-
disaster responsibilities in advance of events through a rules-based approach to access. Dedicated
structures with emergency protocols and clear rules for release of funds can also help to speed up
access to post-disaster financing for implementing agencies.
The legislative basis and administrative structure for the NDMF and PDMFs already exist. The next
steps to operationalize these funds would involve developing a sustainable plan for financing the
funds and working with the relevant authorizing and implementing agencies to integrate the funds
into post-disaster processes. These actions also could determine any additional procedural or policy
specifications required to make the funds as efficient as possible.
Regarding a plan for financing, these funds could finance some portion of the low-risk layer of a
national disaster risk financing strategy (such as localized floods and landslides; see option 5).
Guided by the preliminary flood risk profiles developed for this report, we estimate that financing




                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER 5
for disaster losses of US$1.2 to US$1.8 billion is required annually. In the case of Punjab specifically,
the preliminary flood risk analysis has identified annual financing needs of US$0.8 to US$1.2 billion.
Additional analyses would be required for other perils and other provinces, but these figures give a
ballpark estimate of the size of disaster risk management funds required in Pakistan.
One model for disaster risk financing may be found in Mexico which set up its Natural Disaster Fund
(FONDEN) in 1996 to provide quick funds following natural catastrophes (as further discussed in
box 5.1 and appendix C). Some of the main benefits from the establishment of the fund include
clarification of the division between federal and state post-disaster responsibilities; encouragement
of insurance purchases by public asset managers; commitment of entities to an audited, rules-based
approach in the use of post-disaster disbursements; and development of a linked financing structure
that leverages both public and private capital.

Option 3:	 Clarify Contingent Liability Associated with Post-disaster Cash Transfer
           Programs and Enhance the Programs’ Financing Sources
The GoP manages cash transfer programs that provide rapid financial relief to vulnerable populations
in the aftermath of disasters. Cash transfer programs were designed in response to the 2005
earthquake, and the 2010 floods (at a national level) and to the large floods in 2011 and 2012 (at
a provincial level). In 2012, the GoP developed a National Disaster Response Plan for future cash
transfer-based responses.46 The plan, approved by the prime minister, gives responsibility for early
recovery cash transfer support to the Cabinet Division, building on the 2010 flood response, which
was a partnership between the federal and provincial governments and served as the blueprint for
the 2011 and 2012 provincial programs.
The plan provides clear mechanisms for administering future early-recovery cash transfer programs,

                     their eligibility through the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). However, to
                     date this plan, although approved, is not being implemented as planned at the federal level. At the
                     provincial level, some efforts have been made, such as in Punjab, where the government is trying to
                     put systems in place for efficient cash transfer responses, building on its experience from previous
                     provincial-level cash transfer responses to flooding disaster. These experiences could help with the
                     setup for a systematic post-disaster safety net.

For the poverty-based targeting of these cash transfers, the plan recommends using the National
Poverty Registry (NPR), which covers almost the entire population of the country (more than 27
million households) and facilitates different score cutoffs to represent percentiles of the poorest
population. Although the country also has a nationwide social safety net—the Benazir Income Support
Programme (BISP, further discussed in box 5.2), which uses the NPR to identify its beneficiaries—
the cutoff for disaster recovery benefits can be set, depending on fiscal space and need, either above
or below the cutoff used to identify BISP beneficiaries.
Given the frequency of disasters (particularly floods) affecting Pakistan and the aggregate value of
the transfer payments, such cash-transfer recovery programs represent a material and uncertain
fiscal liability for the GoP. Although the mechanics of the payment system function well, the
government lacks a clear understanding of the annual expected payments required from the program
or of the probable maximum payments. Furthermore, no financial strategy is in place to ensure that
the requisite funds are available on a timely basis without requiring a reallocation of resources from
ongoing, planned government expenditures.

42 / CHAPTER 5: Options for a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy




                     At present, the extent of liability varies with both the severity of the disaster and the available fiscal
                     space. Discussions could be held with the GoP to determine whether the extent and size of cash
                     transfers could be explicitly defined, clarifying government responsibility in the case of a disaster.
                     Once the contingent liability is defined, a risk financing strategy (including options such as reserves,
                     contingent credit instruments, and insurance) could be developed to manage its volatility and thus
                     address the issue of fiscal space.
                     To adequately plan for likely future demands from this program, the contingent liability must be
                     clearly quantified. A process to perform such quantification would require inputs from (a) risk
                     assessment tools (concerning the likely frequency and intensity of natural hazards in Pakistan);
                     (b) retrospective disaster impact analyses (concerning the relationships between geography and
                     disaster intensity and thus the resulting cash payments); and (c) explicit GoP policy concerning cash
                     responses, responsibility for fiscal liability, and payment amounts (in tranches and so on).
                     Therefore, it could be valuable to explore whether the cash transfer mechanism could become more
                     efficient through the following approaches:
                     ■■Quantification of the range of the annual liability that arises from the cash transfer program

                     ■■Explicit definition of the liability, as described above

                     ■■Development of a risk financing strategy to manage the financial cost of the liability


                     Option 4:	Develop Financial Disaster Risk Assessment Tools
                     The design of a comprehensive national disaster risk financing strategy begins with a detailed disaster
                     risk assessment. Neither the federal government nor the provincial governments currently perform
                     assessments of the likely budgetary impacts of natural catastrophes. Catastrophe risk modeling
                     techniques can complement the actuarial analysis of historical loss data to assess the financial
                     and fiscal exposure to disasters. Such models combine information on the underlying natural perils
                     (hazard), the assets at risk (exposure), and their potential damageability (vulnerability) to calculate
                     estimates of economic and fiscal risk. (For a further discussion of catastrophe risk modeling, see
                     chapter 3, box 3.1.)
                     Hazard modules for the major perils should be developed in Pakistan. Chapter 3 of this report
                     presented an actuarial analysis of historical fiscal impacts to generate preliminary fiscal disaster
                     risk profiles for the GoP and the province of Punjab for the peril of flood. These analyses alone were
                     possible because of the data available for flood events across the country and in Punjab. The lack
                     of historical data for other major perils (in particular, earthquakes and tropical cyclones) means
                     that hazard models should be developed or acquired that will provide preliminary estimates of the
                     frequency and severity of these additional perils at the federal and provincial levels. The technical
                     expertise within national geoscience and academic entities can be leveraged to help develop specific
                     hazard modules, with World Bank guidance if required. At the time of writing, efforts are under way to
                     address this requirement for greater technical understanding of the natural hazards facing Pakistan.
                     In 2012, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) established a National Working Group
                     on Vulnerability and Risk Assessment along with four subject-specific technical subgroups to lead
                     and coordinate the efforts for earthquake hazard, flood hazard, exposure, and vulnerability and risk
                     communication.47
                     In addition, a national georeferenced exposure database could be built. This data set would include

the locations and attributes of public and private buildings as well as infrastructure exposed to natural
perils. The public assets catalogued would include schools, hospitals, water and sanitation facilities,
public buildings, and roads and bridges. Private dwellings could also be included, especially those
identified as being an implicit contingent liability to the GoP (for example, the housing stock the
lowest socioeconomic groups). Agricultural assets such as crops, and georeferenced socioeconomic
data on households could also be included to assess population needs and impacts on farmers. This
database could support immediate post-disaster needs assessments and would also be used as an
input to one or more catastrophe risk models, allowing the economic and fiscal impacts of disasters
to be better quantified. In addition, this information could help the insurance industry to offer more
sustainable and affordable property catastrophe insurance products.
Finally, a catastrophe risk model combining analyses of flood, earthquake, and tropical cyclone
hazards could be the basis of financial decision-making tools for the Ministry of Finance. It would
include a financial model that would build on the modeled losses of the catastrophe risk model and
the historical losses. This tool could help the ministry to design the national disaster risk financing
strategy, including the size of the annual budget allocations to the National and Provincial Disaster
Management Funds, the structuring of contingent social safety net programs, and any disaster
risk transfer strategy (such as insurance). Mexico’s finance ministry currently uses such a financial
model, as described in box 5.3.

44 / CHAPTER 5: Options for a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy




                     One of the key findings of chapter 4 of this report is the low level of technical understanding in
                     Pakistan’s insurance and reinsurance sector. Detailed hazard and exposure models developed by the
                     GoP could improve the knowledge base in the private sector, which in turn could help to improve
                     (a) the quality of the insurance products offered by the market; (b) portfolio optimization of the
                     primary insurance market; (c) negotiations on reinsurance pricing and rating agency submissions
                     of insurance companies; and (d) the overall level of market penetration of non-life insurance across
                     Pakistan. All of these improvements would help to reduce the GoP’s contingent liability in the event
                     of a disaster.

                     Option 5:	Develop Models for Improving Financial Response Capacity
                     The GoP could develop a national disaster risk financing strategy, with the technical support of
                     the World Bank, that articulates how disaster losses will be financed at the national, provincial,
                     business, and household levels. The strategy would articulate policy on post-disaster interventions
                     for different beneficiary groups and would also present a plan for financing expected costs.
                     A mix of financing mechanisms would be determined based on expected losses, applied in a risk-
                     layering approach, illustrated in figure 5.1. This approach offers an optimal mix of risk retention
                     (through reserves or contingency budget and contingent credit lines) and risk transfer instruments
                     (such as insurance). See appendix F for further details and a comparative analysis of risk financing
                     and risk transfer products. Appendix G describes an operational framework for implementing
                     disaster risk financing and insurance solutions.

                     The preliminary flood risk profiles conducted as part of this report indicate that the government
                     faces average costs of US$1.2 to US$1.8 billion every year.48 Furthermore, a major flood event
                     (occurring, on average, once every 100 years) could cost upward of US$10 billion. Different financial
                     instruments will be suitable for financing the smaller, recurrent losses and the large, infrequent
                     losses to which Pakistan is exposed. The contingent liability arising from establishment of any
                     disaster-linked social protection schemes should also be considered within the financing strategy.
                     For example, the National and Provincial Disaster Management Funds could be operationalized

and funded appropriately to deal with some part of the more-frequent, smaller losses using grants
from the annual budget combined with external financing sources. For larger events that are not
cost-efficient to prefund, contingent instruments such as insurance and contingent credit become
effective tools. A number of countries in Central and South America have used the World Bank’s
contingent credit product—the Development Policy Loan with Catastrophe Drawdown Option—to
access rapid liquidity in the event of a disaster (box 5.4). The Government of the Philippines also
used one of these facilities to draw down US$500 million to respond to Tropical Storm Sendong,
which struck at the end of 2011.

Governments are also increasingly using risk transfer instruments such as insurance, catastrophe
bonds, and catastrophe derivatives to deal with infrequent large events. In these cases, the higher
“per-dollar payout” cost of risk transfer relative to retaining risk through reserves or credit is
merited by the substantial financial capacity they offer. For example, the Government of Mexico has
transferred catastrophic hurricane and earthquake risk to the international markets via catastrophe
bonds and excess of loss insurance since 2006. The latest transaction in 2012 placed US$315 million
of risk via a catastrophe bond.
In summary, the GoP should consider a “bottom-up” disaster risk financing approach. It should
secure financing for recurrent events through risk retention (operationalization of national and
provincial reserves or contingent credit) and then deal with the higher-risk layers by increasing its
level of financial resilience through the consideration of disaster risk transfer instruments.

Option 6:	Establish a Robust Catastrophe Risk Insurance Program for Public
          Assets
Disasters can severely affect public assets (such as schools and hospitals) and public infrastructure
(such as roads and bridges). Countries’ strategies for financing the reconstruction of public assets
will vary depending on many factors including access to capital markets and the size of the event
with respect to the fiscal budget. For example, developed economies with easy access to the capital
markets may choose to self-insure because they can access additional financial capacity to bear
the full cost of recovery and reconstruction after a disaster strikes. Other countries may require by
law that public assets carry catastrophe insurance against disasters. Even where catastrophe risk
insurance is compulsory, in practice, most public assets remain either uninsured or underinsured—
46 / CHAPTER 5: Options for a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy




                     in part because public managers are reluctant to spend part of their limited budgets to pay insurance
                     premiums, and in part because they lack adequate information to select cost-effective insurance
                     coverage.
                     By law, public assets in Pakistan are required to be insured, and the state-owned National Insurance
                     Company Limited (NICL) has the mandate to provide that insurance. However, it is not clear how
                     comprehensive this coverage is and what the uptake rate of insurance is by managers of public assets.
                     Our analysis suggests that public assets and infrastructure are not comprehensively insured against
                     catastrophic risks in Pakistan, although some provinces and municipalities have recently insured
                     specific, select public assets. Lack of consistent insurance of public assets highlights the need for a
                     comprehensive database of public infrastructure. NICL could also use such a database to determine
                     the insurability of these assets. Initiatives by the NDMA, the World Bank, and other agencies to
                     collate, share, and synthesize geospatial information—including property and infrastructure that
                     could potentially be affected by natural catastrophes—could be valuable for a public asset insurance
                     program.
                     A catastrophe risk insurance program for public assets in Pakistan could be established in
                     collaboration with the private insurance industry. Typically, through such a program, private insurers
                     offer technical assistance to public entities in the design of their catastrophe insurance coverage
                     of public assets. Standardized terms and conditions for the property insurance policies also would
                     be developed in collaboration with the private insurance industry to help public managers identify
                     their risk exposure and their insurance needs. The program could also structure a national insurance
                     portfolio of public assets for placement in the private insurance and reinsurance market. A national
                     approach to insuring public assets would allow for economies of scale and diversification benefits,
                     and thus for lower reinsurance premiums as well.
                     In preparation of such a catastrophe risk program, a centralized database of public buildings, their
                     contents, and nationwide infrastructure could be developed (as part of the activity to develop a
                     national, georeferenced database of national assets) as well as a database of current insurance
                     policies in force.49 Analysis of both will help identify current blind spots and inefficiencies in the
                     overall process of insuring public assets. In addition to better understanding the inclusions and
                     exclusions of NICL natural catastrophe risk policies, a detailed dynamic financial analysis (DFA) of
                     the portfolio of risks insured by NICL would provide key information and insight regarding portfolio
                     optimization and evaluation of reinsurance structures.

                     Option 7:	 Promote Property Catastrophe Insurance for Private Dwellings
                     In Pakistan, less than 1 percent of the residential property stock is currently insured against
                     disasters. This low penetration is a direct result of the relatively poor development of the country’s
                     private non-life insurance market. However, other factors such as insurance affordability for families
                     and general aversion to the concept of insurance also are key factors in Pakistan’s low insurance
                     penetration.
                     The GoP may therefore want to promote catastrophe insurance for private residential properties.
                     A developed domestic property catastrophe insurance market would reduce the GoP’s implicit
                     contingent exposure to major disasters. To help stimulate market development, the GoP could
                     finance and distribute exposure and loss models to private insurers. The government could also
                     support information and awareness campaigns.
                     Turkey provides an international case study of the development of a national homeowners’

catastrophe insurance program. The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP) was established
in 2000 to help address issues of market failure in the country, specifically a lack of local-market
earthquake insurance capacity and lack of demand for policies. The World Bank provided technical
and financial assistance during the design stage of the TCIP to help model and rate the earthquake
exposure. The Bank also made a contingent loan available during the start-up implementation stage
to cover claims as part of the risk financing program. A key feature of the coverage is that it is a
simple, earthquake-only property policy that is provided at affordable rates. Given the low voluntary
demand for insurance by Turkish homeowners, earthquake insurance was made compulsory for
registered houses in urban centers. Box 5.5 provides further description of the TCIP program.

Should the GoP decide to establish a private residential catastrophe insurance program, it would
have to make a number of key decisions, including the following:
■■Whether to form a public sector catastrophe insurance fund (as in Turkey) or to promote some
  form of coinsurance pool through the involvement of the existing non-life commercial insurers.

■■Whether to make homeowners’ property insurance compulsory or to market the coverage on a
  voluntary basis. In Turkey, homeowner demand for property insurance was low because of the
  lack of an insurance culture; hence, it was deemed necessary to make coverage compulsory.

■■Whether to bundle property catastrophe insurance with mortgages (at least as an initial step for
  homeowners) or to keep it as stand-alone coverage. Mortgage-linked catastrophe insurance could
  be made compulsory; alternatively, coverage could be bundled with property taxes. Because
  mortgage coverage usually extends over a longer time period, any shortfall later on could be
  covered by the sufficient capitalization of an insurance scheme.

■■Whether to target the product only at urban property owners or to target all households. In Turkey,
  earthquake insurance is only compulsory in urban areas. In Pakistan, much of the rural building
  stock is unlikely to meet the minimum building standards required by local insurers and their
  respective reinsurance markets.
48 / CHAPTER 5: Options for a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy




                     ■■Whether to involve the government in the program through a public-private partnership. This
                       could include the provision of start-up funding (such as research and development costs) or early-
                       phase risk-bearing capital.

                     Finally, improved coverage of insurance supervision would be required to effectively promote
                     catastrophe risk coverage among private insurers. The quality of insurance supervision in Pakistan
                     could be further improved through the use of a risk-based assessment of insurers’ retention capacity
                     and reinsurance strategies based on catastrophe risk modeling and actuarial tools. To that end, the
                     World Bank, the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), and the Securities
                     and Exchange Commission of Pakistan have begun a project to harmonize the overall insurance
                     legal and regulatory framework and to incorporate risk-based supervision.50 The risk-based capital
                     (RBC) method offers guidance to insurance companies to better manage risks. For example, RBC
                     requires an insurance company with a higher risk to hold a larger amount of capital. There are
                     also options for the market to adopt DFA tools that complement actuarial models to further refine
                     the commercial earthquake premium rates and to assess the impact of disasters on the insurers’
                     portfolio. A scoring tool to assess the quality and adequacy of the insurers’ reinsurance strategies
                     could also be developed.

Appendix A: Historical Disaster Database
for Pakistan
A historical disaster database was compiled, specifically for this report, of the disasters that have
affected Pakistan since 1973. The historical disaster data were gathered following a review of the
available data at the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster
Management Authorities (PDMAs) across all the provinces and regions in Pakistan.
Although these data were readily available for the major recent disasters, the data for older events
were extracted from the archives of the provincial relief commissioners housed in the provincial
revenue departments.
The data collector met with the NDMA at the federal level and, at the provincial level, with the PDMAs,
provincial finance departments, and provincial revenue departments. In some cases, records of the
districts affected by various disasters were also analyzed to validate the numbers available at the
provincial and national levels.

                    Appendix B: World Bank Development
                    Policy Loan with Catastrophe Drawdown
                    Option
                    The Development Policy Loan with Catastrophe Drawdown Option (Cat–DDO) is a contingent credit
                    line that provides immediate liquidity to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
                    (IBRD) member countries in the aftermath of a disaster. It is part of a broad spectrum of World
                    Bank Group disaster risk financing instruments available to assist borrowers in planning efficient
                    responses to catastrophic events.
                    The Cat-DDO helps develop a country’s capacity to manage the risk of disasters and should be
                    part of a broader preventive disaster risk management (DRM) strategy. The Cat-DDO complements
                    existing market-based disaster risk financing instruments such as insurance, catastrophe bonds,
                    reserve funds, and others.
                    To gain access to financing, the borrower must implement a DRM program, which the Bank will
                    monitor on a periodic basis.

                    Key Features
                    The Cat-DDO offers a source of immediate liquidity that can serve as bridge financing while other
                    sources (such as concessional funding, bilateral aid, or reconstruction loans) are being mobilized
                    after a disaster. The Cat-DDO ensures that the government will have immediate access to bridge
                    financing following a disaster, which is when a government’s post-disaster liquidity constraints are
                    highest.
                    Borrowers have access to financing in amounts up to US$500 million or 0.25 percent of gross domestic
                    product (GDP), whichever is less. The Cat-DDO has a “soft” trigger as opposed to “parametric”
                    trigger, which means that funds become available for disbursement upon the occurrence of a
                    disaster resulting in the declaration of a state of emergency.
                    The Cat-DDO has a revolving feature; amounts repaid during the drawdown period are available for
                    subsequent withdrawal. The three-year drawdown period may be renewed up to four times, for a
                    total maximum period of 15 years.

                    Pricing Considerations
                    The Cat-DDO carries a London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based interest rate that is charged on
                    disbursed and outstanding amounts. The interest rate will be the prevailing rate for IBRD loans at
                    the time of drawdown. A front-end fee of 0.5 percent on the approved loan amount and a renewal
                    fee of 0.25 percent also apply.
                    The Cat-DDO provides an affordable source of contingent credit for governments to finance recurrent
                    losses caused by disasters. The expected net present value of the cost of the Cat-DDO is estimated
                    to be at least 30 percent lower than the cost of insurance for medium-risk layers (that is, a disaster
                    occurring once every three years). This cost saving can be even higher when the country’s opportunity
                    cost of capital is greater.

                    Appendix C. Mexico’s Natural Disaster
                    Fund (FONDEN)
                    Mexico has a long history of, and broad exposure to, disasters. Located on the world’s “fire belt”—
                    where 80 percent of the world’s seismic and volcanic activity takes place—Mexico is a seismically
                    active country. The country is also highly exposed to tropical storms and is located in one of the few
                    regions of the world that can be affected simultaneously by two independent cyclone regions: the
                    North Atlantic and the North Pacific.
                    To address its vulnerability to adverse natural events, Mexico has developed a comprehensive
                    institutional approach to disasters. The catalyst to comprehensive disaster risk management was
                    the Mexico City earthquake of 1985, which killed 6,000 people, injured 30,000 others, and left a
                    total of 150,000 victims. Total direct losses exceeded US$4 billion.
                    Mexico established the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) in 1986 as the main mechanism
                    for interagency coordination of disaster efforts. SINAPROC is responsible for mitigating societal loss
                    and essential functions caused by disasters. Responsibility for SINAPROC lies with the Secretariat
                    of the Interior, within which the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) was also
                    established. CENAPRED is an institution that bridges the gap between academic researchers
                    and government by channeling research applications developed by university researchers to the
                    Secretariat of the Interior.

                    The Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN)
                    Despite developing an institutional approach to disasters, all levels of government in Mexico were
                    still regularly required to reallocate planned capital expenditures toward financing post-disaster
                    reconstruction efforts. Budget reallocations created delays and scaling back of investment programs,
                    while also slowing deployment of funds for recovery efforts. In response, legislation was passed in
                    1994 to require federal, state, and municipal assets to be privately insured. In 1996, the government
                    created the Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN) in the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit.
                    FONDEN is an instrument for the coordination of intergovernmental and interinstitutional entities
                    to quickly provide funds in response to disasters. Its main purpose is to provide immediate financial
                    support to federal agencies and local governments recovering from a disaster, particularly for
                    (a) provision of relief supplies, and (b) financing for reconstruction of public infrastructure and
                    low-income homes. FONDEN is also responsible for carrying out studies on risk management and
                    contributing to the design of risk transfer instruments

                    Main Features
                    FONDEN was originally established as a budgetary tool to allocate funds annually to pay for expected
                    expenditures for disaster losses. In 1999, FONDEN was modified through the establishment the
                    FONDEN Trust Fund, a catastrophe reserve fund that accumulates the unspent disaster budget of
                    each year.
                    Financial support is directed toward public infrastructure as well as low-income households that,
                    because of their poverty status, need government assistance. The adverse natural events covered
                    by the FONDEN consist of geological perils (including earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, and
                    landslide) and hydrological perils (including drought, hurricane, excess rainfall, hail storm, flood,
                    tornado, and wildfire).
                                                                              Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment Options for Consideration / 55




FONDEN is based on three complementary instruments: the Revolving Fund, the FONDEN Program,
and the FONDEN Trust Fund. The first provides monies for disaster relief efforts, the second supports
reconstruction of infrastructure, and the third manages Mexico’s catastrophe risk financing strategy.
They are further described as follows:
■■Revolving Fund: This fund finances emergency supplies to be provided in the aftermath of a
  disaster, such as shelters, food, primary health care, and so on. In the case of high probability of
  a disaster, or imminent danger, the local governments can declare a situation of emergency and
  obtain resources from FONDEN immediately. Doing so allows local governments to take measures
  to prepare for immediate relief needs.

■■FONDEN Program: This program finances rehabilitation and reconstruction projects for public
  infrastructure (owned by municipal, state, and federal governments) as well as the restoration of
  natural areas and private dwellings of low-income households following a disaster.

■■FONDEN Trust Fund: This Trust Fund manages the assets of FONDEN, including its risk transfer
  strategy (reinsurance or alternative risk transfer instruments). The Federal FONDEN Trust
  manages the financial resources provided by the federal government, including the annual
  budget allocation. The State FONDEN Trusts, set up for each of the 32 states, manage the financial
  resources received from the federal FONDEN Trust after a disaster.


FONDEN Institutional Structure
Located within the civil protection unit of the Secretariat of the Interior (figure C.1), FONDEN is a
trust managed by one of Mexico’s main development banks (Banobras). The structure of FONDEN
includes a counterparty in each of the 32 Mexican states, including Mexico City, to facilitate the
assignment and management of federal transfers. The main advantage of this structure is the ability
to provide resources to state governments immediately—on average. five days after the disaster.
The FONDEN Trust receives an annual allocation from the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit




                                                                                                                                          APPENDIX C
to develop and manage its risk financing strategy. The risk is layered, with some tranches retained
and others transferred through various instruments. To transfer risk to the reinsurance markets, or
the capital markets for catastrophe bonds, the FONDEN Trust places excess risk first with the public
insurer Agroasamex. This entity passes on the risk to the markets.

                    FONDEN Program
                    The purpose of this program is to provide financing to state and local governments that are
                    overwhelmed by the occurrence of a disaster. The assessment of losses to be cofinanced by FONDEN
                    is based on a specific procedure involving the local and federal authorities. This procedure includes
                    six main steps and should not exceed 23 days after occurrence of the disaster:
                    1.	 In the aftermath of a disaster, a specialized federal or state agency (for example, the
                        meteorological department or geosciences department) certifies the occurrence of a disaster
                        and informs the state government.

                    2.	 Within 4 days after the occurrence of a disaster, the state government sets up a technical
                        committee to identify and assess the damage caused by the disaster.

                    3.	 Within 10 days, the technical committee provides the state government with a technical and
                        financial evaluation of the disaster.

                    4.	 Within 15 days, the state government informs the federal government. The Secretariat of the
                        Interior issues a declaration of state of disaster. Meanwhile, the Secretariat of Finance and
                        Public Credit authorizes FONDEN to release early partial contribution to the state.

                    5.	 Within the following 2 days, the Secretariat of the Interior should (a) ensure that the requested
                        assistance is related to the disaster; (b) verify that the damaged infrastructure has not benefited
                        from FONDEN in the past (if this is the case, the proof of insurance of the damage infrastructure
                        is requested); and (c) formally approve the cofinancing of the reconstruction of the damaged
                        assets.

                    6.	 The claims are authorized to be financed by FONDEN. In the case of federal assets, the federal
                        FONDEN Trust pays directly the contractor. In the case of state of municipal assets, the federal
                        FONDEN Trust transfers the funds to the state FONDEN Trust once the state government has
                        transferred its contribution.


                    FONDEN Trust
                    The federal government aims to promote the private insurance of specific public assets owned by
                    federal agencies and state governments, thus reducing its financing dependence on FONDEN in
                    case of a disaster. The federal government has empowered FONDEN to develop a catastrophe risk
                    financing strategy, relying on private risk transfer instruments such as reinsurance and catastrophe
                    bonds. This helps FONDEN to increase its financial independence and overcome some political
                    economy issues.
                    The financial structure of FONDEN is depicted in figure C.2. The public bank Banogras acts as the
                    account manager of the FONDEN Trust. The public reinsurer Agroasemex intermediates any financial
                    transactions with the international reinsurance and capital markets.

FONDEN 2011 Disaster Risk Financing Strategy
FONDEN’s disaster risk financing strategy relies on a combination of risk retention and risk transfer.
To execute this strategy, FONDEN receives an annual budget allocation from the federal budget,
which is sometimes complemented by an exceptional budget allocation in the case of a major
disaster. To purchase insurance coverage, the federal law was modified to allow FONDEN to transfer
risk to the reinsurance and capital markets, with the insurance premium being defined as a service
in the government budget law. The transferring of risk to the reinsurance and capital markets are

58 / Appendix C: Mexico’s Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN)




                    To implement the risk financing strategy, the federal budget includes a budget line of 0.4 percent of
                    the government expenditures for the financing of public assets and FONDEN, which corresponded
                    to Mex$10 billion in 2011. If the annual budget allocation is insufficient, FONDEN can receive an
                    exceptional budget allocation from the federal government reserve funds (such as the oil fund).
                    For the first time, in 2011, FONDEN placed an indemnity-based excess-of-loss (XL) reinsurance treaty
                    on the international reinsurance market. Reinsurance payouts are based on the losses reported by
                    FONDEN that are borne by the federal government (that is, 100 percent of the damage to federal
                    assets and 50 percent of the damage to state or municipal assets and low-income housing). The
                    losses reported to FONDEN include replacement costs (on average, 75 percent of the total losses)
                    and improvement costs (on average, 25 percent of the total losses). Only replacement losses are
                    covered under the reinsurance treaty. As of March 2011, the federal government was expecting to
                    place a XL reinsurance treaty of Mex$6 billion on excess of Mex$12.5 billion.
                    FONDEN also secured the protection of a catastrophe bond. In 2006, it issued a US$160 million
                    catastrophe bond (CatMex) to transfer Mexico’s earthquake risk to the international capital markets.
                    It was the first parametric cat bond issued by a sovereign entity. After the CatMex matured in 2009,
                    Mexico decided to further diversify its coverage by pooling multiple risks in multiple regions. In
                    October 2009, with assistance from the World Bank, it issued a multiperil cat bond using the World
                    Bank’s newly established MultiCat Program. The federal government issued a four-tranche cat bond
                    (totaling US$290 million) with a three-year maturity, called MultiCat Mexico. It provided (binary)
                    parametric insurance to FONDEN against earthquake risk in three regions around Mexico City and
                    hurricanes on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The cat bond repaid the principal to investors unless
                    an earthquake or hurricane triggers a transfer of the funds to the Mexican government. During the
                    lifetime of the bond, no event triggered a payment.

Appendix D: Turkish Catastrophe
Insurance Pool
Bridging the contents of Europe and Asia, Turkey is highly exposed to severe earthquakes. Despite the
common occurrence of earthquakes, Turkey’s private insurance market was long unable to provide
adequate capacity for catastrophe property insurance against earthquake risk. Without adequate
commercial protection of residential buildings, the government faced a significant contingent
financial exposure in post-disaster reconstruction of private property.
After the Marmara earthquake in 2000, in cooperation with the World Bank, the government worked
to limit its financial exposure to the residential housing market through the establishment of the
Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP). The pool enables the Government of Turkey to ensure that
owners who pay property taxes on domestic dwellings can purchase affordable and cost-effective
coverage. As a result, the government’s contingent fiscal exposure to earthquakes is decreased by
the transferring of risk to the international reinsurance markets, which reduces pressure to provide
post-disaster housing subsidies.
The TCIP is a public sector insurance company that is managed on sound technical and commercial
insurance principles. It operates as a genuine public-private partnership with most, if not all,
operational functions outsourced to the private sector. The TCIP purchases commercial reinsurance,
and the Government of Turkey acts as a catastrophe reinsurer of last resort for claims arising out
of an earthquake with a return period of greater than 300 years. The full capital risk requirements
for the TCIP are funded by commercial reinsurance (currently in excess of US$1 billion) and its own
surplus capital (about US$0.5 billion).
The TCIP policy is a stand-alone property earthquake policy with a maximum sum insured per policy
of US$65,000; an average premium rate of US$46; and a 2 percent of sum-insured deductible.
Premium rates are based on the construction type (two types) and property location (differentiating

                     this level of penetration, the government invested heavily in insurance awareness campaigns and
                     made earthquake insurance compulsory for homeowners on registered land in urban centers. The
                     legal framework for the program envisages compulsory enforcement mechanisms in urban settings,
                     while coverage is voluntary for homeowners in rural areas.

Appendix E: Post-disaster Operational
Phases
The role of disaster risk financing and insurance for the post-disaster operational phases is further
detailed in “Financial Protection against Disasters: An Operational Framework for Disaster Risk
Financing and Insurance” (Working Paper 94988, World Bank, Washington, DC, 2014). A summary
is provided below of the three operational phases: emergency response and relief, recovery, and
reconstruction.
Emergency response and relief operations. This phase includes emergency assistance to the
affected population to ensure basic needs such as shelter, food, and medical attention. This
assistance, provided during or immediately after a disaster, can save lives, reduce health impacts,
ensure public safety, and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected. This phase aims
to stabilize the society and prevent or mitigate further loss. Such costs can be difficult to estimate
ex ante, because they depend on the specific characteristics of the catastrophic event (location,
intensity, time of the year [winter or summer], time of day [day or night], and so on). But they are
relatively small compared with the subsequent recovery and reconstruction operations. Although
relief costs are limited, they need to be financed within hours after a disaster. The capacity of
governments to mobilize resources for relief operation on short notice should be a key component
of their risk financing strategy.
Recovery operations. Following the initial relief efforts, recovery operations are crucial to limit
secondary losses and ensure that reconstruction can start as soon as possible. They aim at the
restoration and improvement, where appropriate, of facilities, livelihoods, and living conditions
of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors. In other words,
recovery operations restore the society’s functions, such as reopening of schools, businesses, and so
on, even if only in temporary shelters. They include, among other things, the emergency restoration

of lifeline infrastructure (for example, water, electricity, and key transportation lines); the removal
of debris; the financing of basic safety nets; and the provision of basis inputs (such as seeds and
fertilizers) to restart agricultural activities. It is also during this phase that engineering firms can
be mobilized to start the design of infrastructure work that will proceed during the reconstruction
phase. The government may also have to subsidize the basic restoration of private dwellings,
particularly for low-income families, before the reconstruction phase starts.
Reconstruction operations. This phase generally centers on the rehabilitation or replacement of
assets damaged by a disaster. They include repair and rebuilding of housing, industry, infrastructure,
and other physical and social structures that constitute that community or society. These include
public buildings and infrastructure that are the direct responsibility of the state. National or local
authorities generally have to face obligations that go beyond their own assets. In most cases, the
government will have to subsidize the reconstruction of private assets, particularly housing for low-
income families who could not otherwise afford to rebuild their homes.

Appendix F: Operational Framework
for Implementing Disaster Risk Financing
and Insurance Solutions
The Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Operational Framework developed by the World
Bank DRFI Program seeks to provide governments implementing financial protection strategies
with a framework for the development and implementation of cost-effective, sustainable DRFI
solutions. This framework is laid out in “Financial Protection against Disasters: From Products to
Comprehensive Strategies—An Operational Framework for Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance”
(Working Paper 94988, World Bank, Washington, DC, 2014). This text below summarizes this
document.
The structure of the DRFI operational framework has emerged through a long, sustained dialogue
and many years of working with governments and the private sector. It builds on more than 15 years
of intensive partnerships with more than 60 countries worldwide in developing DRFI strategies and
addressing challenges at both the policy and technical levels.
This framework aims to answer basic questions and challenges usually faced by governments when
they initiate or further improve their DRFI strategies. Experience has shown that a DRFI engagement
is usually triggered by two main entry points. First, governments often are looking to implement a
specific product or financial instrument; here, the challenge is to help policy makers situate this
instrument in the larger context of financial protection and disaster risk management. Second,
governments may start from a particular development goal—such as protecting small farmers against
drought or ensuring access to immediate post-disaster liquidity for central and local governments—
in which case it is necessary to identify the appropriate solutions. In both cases, the Operational
DRFI Framework provides governments with an initial orientation to start the relevant discussions




                                                                                                                         APPENDIX F
with all stakeholders and gain an understanding of how the work might evolve over time. As a
second step, it helps governments to identify and prioritize policy options and the needed actions
to implement these choices.
Although the overall goal of DRFI—to increase the financial resilience of society to disasters—is
common across all countries, a government has many options to achieve this goal, depending on
its circumstances and time frame. The Operational DRFI Framework helps governments and policy
makers identify and prioritize solutions appropriate for their countries. Introducing a common
language also enables and strengthens the international cooperation often required between
governments and their partners as well as among governments to exchange experiences and good
practice. A structured, consistent way of approaching disaster risk financing helps governments
better identify and implement their priorities and enables international development partners and
the private sector to better support them in doing so.
The Operational Framework is not, however, a blueprint for action, meant to provide detailed
guidance on how to carry out each step. Such implementation requires the sustained engagement
and commitment of the countries and their partners. Countries are diverse, and so are their DRFI
needs and solutions. Low-income countries constrained by a lack of capacity may not use financial
instruments in the same way that middle-income countries yield and fine-tune them. Small island
developing states subject to financial shocks that can reach multiples of gross domestic product
(GDP) face different challenges than large middle-income countries that are trying to safeguard low-
income populations against disasters.
64 / Appendix F: Operational Framework for Implementing Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Solutions




                     The Operational DRFI Framework is presented in three components that should be seen as one
                     package and applied in an iterative way: (a) a decision tree for governments engaging in DRFI (figure
                     F.1); (b) an overview of government actions to increase financial resilience of defined beneficiaries
                     (table F.1); and (c) illustrative examples from international experience (table F.2).
                     The decision tree guides policy makers through a set of fundamental questions to guide the process
                     of identifying the appropriate policy and developing the required actions to implement it (figure F.1).
                     A government’s DRFI engagement can be seen in three main phases: diagnostic, preparation, and
                     implementation. As a first step, governments need to identify and prioritize the problems they want
                     to address. Second, policy makers—in line with their priorities—need to define a set of solutions and
                     develop a DRFI strategy. Finally, to implement the strategy, the government needs to design and
                     execute an action plan.

                     At each step of the decision process, policy makers can consult the second component of the
                     Operational DRFI Framework, the matrix of policy objectives and actions (table F.1), to help answer
                     the questions and develop and implement the DRFI Strategy. The steps in the decision process are
                     as follows:

                     1.	 Identify and prioritize overarching goals and beneficiaries of planned DRFI engagement
                     2.	 Assess risks to identify the impacts that are of concern and the problems driving those impacts
                     3.	 Arrange financial solutions, starting by identifying and prioritizing sources of funds to mitigate
                         financial impacts
                     4.	 Deliver funds to beneficiaries after identifying effective delivery channels of those funds
                     5.	 Identify policy goals and actions needed, consolidate them into a Strategy and Action Plan, and
                         begin implementation
                     6.	 Monitor and evaluate implementation to refine policies and actions

                     Finally, the third component of the Operational DRFI Framework presents illustrative examples of how
                     governments are implementing DRFI solutions (table F.2). While this decision process is presented
                     sequentially, governments usually begin engagement in DRFI to address an acute challenge. It is
                     important to develop a comprehensive strategy, but governments need not put off implementation
                     for many years. Many actions can—and should—start immediately while a full diagnostic is carried
                     out and a strategy is developed.

                     Sources of Post-disaster Financing
                     Governments have access to various sources of financing following a disaster. These sources can be
                     categorized as ex post and ex ante financing instruments. Ex post instruments are sources that do
                     not require advance planning. They include budget reallocation, domestic credit, external credit,
                     tax increase, and donor assistance. Ex ante risk financing instruments require proactive advance
                     planning and include reserves or calamity funds, budget contingencies, contingent debt facility, and
                     risk transfer mechanisms. Risk transfer instruments are instruments through which risk is ceded to
                     a third party, such as traditional insurance and reinsurance, parametric insurance (where insurance
                     payouts are triggered by predefined parameters such as wind speed of a hurricane), and alternative
                     risk transfer (ART) instruments such as catastrophe (CAT) bonds.
                     The analysis of the fiscal management of disasters in Indonesia has identified possible post-disaster
                     resource gaps.51 This time-sensitive analysis supports the design of a cost-effective disaster risk
                     financing strategy, because different financial instruments are available at different periods after a
                     disaster (figure F.2).

                     Among the ex post (postdisaster) financing tools, contingency budget is the first to be immediately
                     available after a disaster. Other ex post financing tools usually take more time to mobilize and are
                     mainly available for the reconstruction phase. These include emergency recovery loans and post-
                     disaster reconstruction loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank.
                     Ex ante financing instruments can provide immediate liquidity after a disaster. These instruments,
                     which are designed and implemented before a disaster occurs, include national disaster reserve
                     funds, contingent credit, and insurance. Small but recurrent losses can be retained through reserves

and/or contingent credit. More severe but less-frequent events—occurring, for example, once every
seven years or more—can be transferred to the insurance or capital markets. Finally, international
post-disaster donor assistance plays a role after the occurrence of an extreme disaster.
Catastrophe risk layering can be used to design a risk financing strategy (igure F.3). Budget
contingencies together with reserves are the cheapest source of ex ante risk financing and will
generally be used to cover the recurrent losses. Other sources of financing such as contingent
credit, emergency loans, and possibly insurance should enter into play only once reserves and
budget contingencies are exhausted or cannot be accessed fast enough. A “bottom-up” approach is
recommended: the government first secures funds for recurrent disaster events and then increases
its post-disaster financial capacity to finance less-frequent but more-severe events. The level of
fiscal resilience to disasters, which drives the optimal financial strategies against disasters, is a
decision to be taken by the government based on economic and social considerations. Table F.3
presents a comparative analysis of the ex ante risk financing and risk transfer instruments.

a. Parametric insurance is a relatively new concept, demonstrated, for example, by the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) established in 2007. These covers are more bespoke, and
counterparties may be open to multiyear contracts such as that seen between Swiss Re and the Dominican Republic. The CCRIF paid out within two weeks of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010.
b. The total return swap structure, and permitted asset rules for collateral investment, in widespread use before the global financial crisis (2008–09) exposed a number of bonds to credit issues during the
crisis (largely because of the collapse of Lehman brothers). Since then, rules on permitted investments have tightened considerably, and the current trend is to invest all proceeds in U.S. Treasury money
market funds.

c. Industry loss warranties trade for U.S. perils, European windstorms, and to a lesser extent, Japanese earthquakes. Third-party industry loss providers recognized and accepted by the market include U.S.
Property Claim Services (PCS) and European companies (PERILS AG, Swiss Re Sigma, Munich NatCat services).

Build Financial Resilience to Disasters
This appendix summarizes several examples of World Bank initiatives to help countries build
financial resilience to disasters. They are adapted from “Financial Protection against Disasters: An
Operational Framework for Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance” (Working Paper 94988, World
Bank, Washington, DC, 2014).

Sovereign Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI)
for Middle-Income Countries
SECO Initiative supporting Azerbaijan, Colombia, Indonesia, Morocco, Peru, South Africa,
and Vietnam
Supported by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs of Switzerland (SECO), a sovereign DRFI
initiative through the Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Program of the World Bank and
the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is supporting selected middle-
income countries to strengthen financial resilience and protect fiscal balance. With the help of the
program, Colombia, for example, implemented international best practices insuring its investments
worth US$38 billion in road infrastructure concessions.

Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) in 2007 to help mitigate
disaster and climate change risk. Under this initiative the countries worked together to implement
the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot, the first parametric catastrophe risk transfer transaction
in the Pacific region. In early 2014 Tonga was the first country to benefit from a payout (US$1.2
million) following cyclone Ian.

Developing Large-Scale Public-Private Partnerships in Agriculture
Insurance for Smallholders
Kenya
The Government of Kenya has confirmed its intention to develop and launch a large-scale public-
private partnership in agricultural insurance, building on appraisal work finalized in 2014 with the
support of the World Bank-GFDRR DRFI Program. The Kenya program will have two components:
(a) an area-yield index insurance program linked to crop credit for small, semicommercial and
commercial maize and wheat growers; and (b) a livestock drought index insurance program for
vulnerable pastoralists in four counties of northern Kenya. Expected to start by October 2015,
the program is expected to reach on average 140,000 producers over the first five years. The
Government of Kenya committed fiscal and human resources to the program. The DRFI Program
is also supporting the government to consider the integration of these agricultural liabilities in an
overall sovereign DRFI strategy.

                      public-private partnership in agriculture insurance. The initial scheme suffered from slow claims
                      settlement, high basis risk due to challenges with data collection, and unintended disincentives
                      distorting agricultural production decisions. The World Bank-GFDRR DRFI Program has worked with
                      the relevant ministries and the public crop insurance company to provide technical and policy advice
                      in support of transitioning toward a public-private partnership. This has significantly reduced the
                      basis risk and claims settlement time, while also improving actuarial risk pricing, leading to more
                      equitable distribution of subsidies to farmers.

                      Improving Insurance of Public Assets and Insurance Supervision
                      in Middle-Income Countries
                      Philippines
                      In the Philippines the World Bank-GFDRR DRFI Program is helping build capacity in local insurance
                      markets by improving the insurance of local government assets. Working with the Government
                      Service Insurance System (GSIS), the state-owned monopoly insurer for public assets, the program
                      will also help to introduce insurance policies based on international best practice, support access
                      to reinsurance at better terms, and improve risk information and risk-based pricing. The project
                      will also investigate the possibility of setting up a risk pool for homeowners and small business, an
                      initiative strongly backed by domestic insurance companies.

                      Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, to be expanded
                      to the whole South East Europe and Caucusus region
                      The South East Europe and Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF) is a catastrophe-
                      and weather-risk reinsurance program with the objective of increasing the number of homeowners,
                      farmers, enterprises, and government organizations that are insured against weather-related risks and
                      climate change. To implement the SEEC CRIF program, Europa Reinsurance Facility Ltd. (Europa RE),
                      a nonprofit, government-owned organization, has been established as a specialized regional reinsurer.
                      SEEC CRIF targets the entire SEEC region, but with an initial focus on the Balkans and the Caucasus. The
                      program will continue to support the technical work for countries to join the facility and will work with
                      the World Bank and other donor partners to finance country membership contributions.


                      Disaster-Linked Social Protection
                      Kenya
                      The Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP), implemented by the Government of Kenya with support from
                      the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), provides unconditional cash transfers
                      to chronically food-insecure households in the four poorest and most vulnerable counties in Kenya
                      (Marsabit, Mandera, Turkana, and Wajir). Under Phase 1 of the program, approximately 100,000
                      households throughout these counties receive regular bimonthly payments to enable them to meet
                      their daily consumption needs. In 2013 the program began looking into adding a disaster-linked

component to the HSNP to enable rapid scale-up of transfers to a possible 400,000+ households
during acute drought crises. Alongside social protection colleagues, the World Bank-GFDRR DRFI
Program has been advising key counterparts in the Government of Kenya on the key benefits
(including more rapid response and increased transparency) and on the investments required,
including insurable quality data, to use insurance principals to execute the scale-up of the cash
transfers.
